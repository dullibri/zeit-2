HEADLINE: Bulb Lighted by Radio Waves May Last for Up to 14 Years

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
In what appears to be a significant advance in the technology of efficient lighting, a bulb will be introduced today that uses a high-frequency radio signal instead of a filament to produce light.
The new bulb is more cost effective than existing types and will last 14 years if lighted 4 hours a day, which is typical household use, electrical engineers say. 
 Compared with a 100-watt incandescent bulb, which would cost about 30 cents a week to buy and operate for 4 hours daily, a 25-watt version of the new bulb would provide as much light but cost only 9 cents a week.
The bulb is expected to have a life of at least 20,000 hours, in contrast to most incandescent bulbs, which burn out after 750 to 1,000 hours. The compact fluorescent bulbs introduced a few years ago last about 7,000 to 10,000 hours, but are bulkier than the new bulbs, limiting the places they fit.
 
Expected Early Next Year
 The developers of the bulb, which is to be available early next year, say they expect it to be used first in spotlights and in other commercial applications where the cost of bulb replacement is a major expense. A version for standard household use will follow soon after.
An independent expert, Howard S. Geller, the executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said he had not seen the bulb itself but had seen the makers' description of it. If it works as described, he said, "then it would be a real breakthrough."
The new bulb, which the makers have called the E-Lamp, for electronic lamp, will sell for about the same price as existing compact fluorescent bulbs, or $12 to $15 each, said Richard E. Disbrow, the chairman and chief executive of the American Electric Power Company, of Columbus, Ohio, the nation's second-largest electric utility company after the Atlanta-based Southern Company.
Compact fluorescent bulbs, which are priced at about 15 times the cost of an incandescent bulb, have had limited appeal to consumers. But the new bulbs will last much longer and the price is expected to drop as they are produced in larger quantities, said Pierre G. Villere, the president of Intersource Technologies, a small Silicon Valley company that developed the bulb with backing from American Electric Power and will make and market it.
Mr. Villere said that as a bulb that would last for years, the E-Lamp was "not a disposable good, but a durable good, like an appliance."
Mr. Disbrow said American Electric would probably offer the bulb at a discount to its 2.1 million electricity customers in parts of seven states.
 
After Years, Gradually Dims
 The E-Lamp works by generating a high-frequency radio signal. The rapidly oscillating radio waves excite a gas mixture in a sealed globe, and the gas in turn gives off light outside the visible spectrum. When this light hits a phosphor coating on the inside surface of the bulb's glass shell, the phosphor glows with visible light.
Existing fluorescent bulbs use an electrode to generate a current in the gas. The E-Lamp lasts longer because there is no electrode to burn out, but after years of use the bulb gradually dims because the phosphor wears out.
American Electric Power and Intersource Technologies, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., said the new bulb had other advantages as well: it can be used with a dimmer switch like an incandescent bulb and will be smaller and more energy efficient than most compact fluorescent bulbs now on the market.
"The bulb will fit in any fixture, and it will operate upside down, sideways and even outdoors," Mr. Disbrow said in a telephone interview. His company's engineers are "wildly enthusiastic," he said.
According to the two companies, the bulb will switch on or off in less than a second, with no flicker. It will also work in the cold, unlike existing compact fluorescents, which require mild or warm temperatures to light.
At the Electric Power Research Institute, a utility consortium in Palo Alto, Calif., Karl F. Johnson, the manager for commercial building systems, said engineers had been experimenting for years with bulbs that ran on radio waves but had always had trouble preventing the waves from leaking out and interfering with other electric devices. If the new bulb has solved that problem, he said, "it would be a very neat product; it would be wonderful."
E-Lamp's makers say they have indeed found a way to prevent the radio signals from leaking.
 
Managing Electricity Demand
 The companies plan to introduce the bulb today in Columbus, Ohio, where the Edison Electric Institute, the trade association of investor-owned utilities, is beginning its annual meeting.
Mr. Villere of Intersource said the bulb would come on the market in the first quarter of 1993 but probably would not be widely available for a few months until the company had expanded its manufacturing capacity to produce the bulb by the millions.
American Electric is not generally known in the utility industry as a leader in conservation efforts. Mr. Disbrow said, however, that his company saw the bulb as a valuable tool in "demand-side management," an approach in which utilities stress greater efficiency in electric use, rather than construction of new generating stations.
American Electric owns 9.9 percent of Intersource. The company has not taken a larger stake, Mr. Disbrow said, because American Electric is regulated under a 1935 Federal law that places strict controls on diversification by multistate utility companies.

HEADLINE: TOKYO BID TO SEND ITS TROOPS ABROAD SUFFERS A SETBACK

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 31

 BODY:
In what appeared to be a major setback to its plans to send Japanese forces abroad for United Nations peacekeeping operations, the Government yielded to a compromise this weekend that would in effect create a symbolic military force but prevent it from leaving Japanese shores for years.
The compromise came in a last-ditch effort to overcome widespread objections to the plans in Parliament, which is expected to act on establishing a peacekeeping organization in the next few weeks. The national debate over sending Japanese forces abroad for the first time since World War II grew out of international criticism during the Persian Gulf war that Japan was willing to write a check to maintain world peace, but not to put its own citizens at risk. 
 Ever since, the governing Liberal Democratic Party has been trying to lift the postwar ban on sending Japanese troops abroad, drafting legislation and reinterpreting the Constitution to allow military personnel to serve under United Nations command for the first time.
 
A 'Freeze' on Deployments
 Government officials, trying to put the best face possible on the agreement, said that under revisions to the bill, which Parliament is expected to act on this week, the Japanese military would be permitted to play some limited non-combat roles, like providing medical aid or logistical help or observing elections. But to win support of some key opposition parties, the Government had to agree to "freeze" any deployment of peacekeeping for an unspecified period, and to allow Parliament to vote separately on each dispatch of troops. If the gulf war was any guide, that process could take months, opening Japan to more criticism that it is slow to respond.
More than any other initiative taken by Tokyo in the postwar era, the peacekeeping bill has become the symbol of how far Japan is willing to go in fulfilling its pledges to take a greater political role in world affairs, one that would be more commensurate with its economic might.
But as the debate unfolded, it became clear that many of Japan's leaders envision a far more active, risky role than do many of its citizens, who see little advantage in dispensing with the postwar prohibition on sending forces abroad. Under most current interpretations of the Constitution, which was written by the American occupying force here after Japan's surrender, the country's Self-Defense Forces are strictly prohibited from venturing beyond Japan's shores or engaging in acts of "collective security."
Since the gulf war, when Japan contributed $12 billion but no personnel to the multinational force that liberated Kuwait, debate has raged here over whether the post-cold-war era requires a fundamental change in Japanese policy.
Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa declared passage of the bill one of his top priorities, and many political analysts here believe that his tenure may depend on how skillfully he secures its passage without harming his party's chances in a critical election this summer. Many political leaders here also consider passage a prerequisite if Japan hopes to realize its ambitions to become a member of the United Nations Security Council in coming years.
 
Public Is Opposed
 Nonetheless, polls show that the Japanese public is clearly opposed to any plan to send its troops into combat areas, with many questioning whether they can yet trust their Government to keep a rein on the military. As a result, the governing party -- fearful that its efforts to pass some kind of peacekeeping bill could be defeated for a third time -- has been struggling for ways to pass the core elements of the bill, while at the same time at least seeming to be responsive to the public's apprehensions. And it is possible the fragile coalition being built around the bill could still collapse, perhaps leading to the dissolution of both houses of Parliament and the calling of a general election.
"The cold war is over, and we need to begin to think about playing a different role in the future," Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, who heads one of the larger factions in the governing party, said in an interview recently. "But we have to do it in a way that allows Japanese public opinion to mature." That task, he said, will take several years.
For the time being, however, the Liberal Democrats have been involved in weeks of political horse-trading with two small but crucial opposition parties, the Komeito and the Democratic Socialists. Without their support, the bill would die in the upper house of Parliament, where the Liberal Democrats lost their majority in a major setback three years ago.
Until this weekend, the two parties have wavered on the bill. But over the weekend they reached an agreement to support it, under conditions that seemed to underscore the depth of Japan's ambivalence and uneasiness about changing what has become a a tenet of the country's postwar national identity.
 
Freeze on Deployments
 The agreement calls for a "freeze" on deploying any armed missions that would play a role in separating warring factions. Ending the prohibition would require an act of Parliament, something that could take months or years if Japan's reaction to the gulf war is any guide.
The Government also agreed that that once it is lifted, Parliament would have to vote separate approval any time the military is to be sent to join a United Nations peacekeeping force.
The message of such broad concessions, which the Government had fought for months, was clear: When gunfire breaks out, Japanese troops will be nowhere around. But the legislation would permit non-military activity, from providing medical care to supervising elections.
No one seemed very happy with the compromise. Mainichi Shimbun, one of Japan's largest dailies, today called it "a compromise hodgepodge reached to secure an adopted at all costs" and termed it an effort to lull the public into acceptance of the sending Japanese troops aborad.
"It is the utmost irresponsibility to enact this defect-ridden bill into law," it said.
A senior official of the Foreign Ministry who was involved in the negotiations defended the decision to freeze any deployment, saying: "It is not for any cowardly reasons. The public just needs a bit of time to swallow this."
The largest opposition party, the Socialist Party, has vowed to continue its longstanding battle against any effort to send Japanese troops abroad. The Communist Party and some minor parties also oppose the legislation.
Some Socialist leaders are blaming the United States for pressing the bill's passage.
"The trouble with America is that you are always trying to encourage us to increase our military capability," Masao Kunihiro, one of the leading opponents of the bill in the upper house, said recently. "I know that the day will come when you will regret it."
American officials here and in Washington have been careful to express no opinion on the bill itself, saying Japan has to decide for itself what role it is comfortable playing in United Nations peacekeeping activities. But it is clear that American pressure, or at least the perception of it, has played a critical roll in keeping the issue at the top of Japan's agenda. Last fall, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d criticized Japan in a speech here for failing to go beyond "checkbook diplomacy."
 
Advice From U.S. Envoy
 During the gulf war and after, the United States Ambassador here, Michael Armacost, said repeatedly that Japan must begin to put its citizens "at risk" to keep world peace -- presumably with global medical teams, logistics workers or troops -- but he has declined to be more specific.
In contrast, several of Japan's neighbors, especially those who vividly recall Japan's invasion of Asian neighbors in the 1930's and 40's, have offered grave reservations about the bill. China's leaders have urged caution, and Singapore's former Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew, once compared lifting the the prohibitions on sending Japanese troops abroad to giving liquor candies to an alcoholic.
Yet it is in Asia where Tokyo assumes it would first send Japanese peacekeepers. Japan was peripherally involved in last year's agreement to disarm the warring factions in Cambodia, and the leader of the United Nations presence there is a Japanese, Yashushi Akashi. Mr. Akashi has repeatedly called for Japan to take an active role in the peacekeeping effort there, and has even asked it to set up a "staging area" for supplies on Japanese soil.
But under the bill, it seems unlikely that significant numbers of Japanese would be deployed to Cambodia anytime soon. And when they were sent there, they could not be placed between the factions or anywhere else where hostilities seemed imminent.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Senate Race
Primaries for Cranston's Seat Expose Rifts in California Parties' Ideologies;
Republicans View Contest for Heart of Their Party

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 31

 BODY:
An election year challenge sure to stump even the most astute Republicans in this state: Name one issue on which the party's two main contenders for a six-year Senate term agree.
Give up? So do the candidates themselves. 
 Bruce Herschensohn, a conservative television commentator from Los Angeles, and Representative Tom Campbell, a moderate from the Silicon Valley, hardly sound like they belong to the same party.
"I'm running against him the way I would run against a liberal Democrat in the general election," said the outspoken but jovial Mr. Herschensohn. "We have different philosophies that stretch across almost every major issue."
 
Possible Turning Point
 The more cerebral Mr. Campbell, who was a Stanford University economist before he went to Congress, said his opponent believes that "if you're not 100 percent with the far right on everything, then you're not credible." Mr. Campbell added, "He represents the past of the Republican Party and his positions are very extreme."
While there are several bitter Republican rivalries this year for the California Legislature that pit the religious right against more moderate candidates, it is the Campbell-Herschensohn competition that could be a turning point in the decades-old struggle for the heart of the state's Republican Party.
"There are hundreds of contested primaries in which there are significant ideological differences," said Dan Schnur, a spokesman for Gov. Pete Wilson, who has made no endorsement but is believed to favor the more like-minded Mr. Campbell. "The difference is that you've got two equally matched competitors, and they're fighting on a statewide stage. That heightens the interest and the intensity."
Tom Bethell, a media fellow at the Hoover Institution, said the contest could be "one of the more important G.O.P. races in the state's history -- its outcome is likely to influence the state G.O.P. in the years ahead."
 
Conservatives Waning
 The conservative wing of the Republican Party, which catapulted Ronald Reagan to the Governorship, has been waning since the 1980's, particularly with the election of Governor Wilson in 1990. So a victory by Mr. Herschensohn could reinvigorate those who preach his pure, hard-line Republicanism. But a victory by Mr. Campbell could signal the rise of a more moderate state party whose positions align with Democrats on issues like abortion rights, homosexual rights and the environment.
The stakes are particularly high because the state's Republicans may be on the verge of becoming the ruling party in California. This could be the year that the Republicans outnumber Democrats in the state's Congressional delegation, and many analysts predict that Republicans will take control of the State Legislature by 1994 or 1996.
There is also a race for California's other Senate seat, to fill the two years remaining in the term Mr. Wilson gave up when he became Governor.
That Republican contest, between John Seymour, the moderate who is now holding the seat on an interim basis, and Representative William E. Dannemeyer, a staunch conservative, has drawn less attention and is not viewed as a critical ideological test. Mr. Seymour is widely viewed as the favorite.
The full six-year seat, open because of the retirement of Senator Alan Cranston, is critical, said Bruce E. Cain, a political science professor at the University of California at Berkeley. "It's the only shot the conservatives have," he said.
"If Campbell defeats Herschensohn, what you're talking about are two moderate Republicans potentially winning seats in the U.S. Senate," he added. "That's pretty demoralizing to the conservative wing of the party."
There is a third candidate for the full Senate term, Sonny Bono, the former Mayor of Palm Springs who is best known as an entertainer. He has lagged in third place in pre-election polls.
 
Race Gets Dirtier
 Mr. Herschensohn, (pronounced HERSH-en-son) who is 59 years old, said there was no overriding issue in the race, which he said would hinge on whether Republicans want "a conservative versus liberal" candidate.
"I would enter legislation for a balanced budget, for a flat-rate tax, to repeal all bilingual laws," he said in an interview. "I would enter an amendment to the Constitution for voluntary prayer in school. And I would do everything in my power to maintain our defense budget."
Scoffing at his opponents' attempts to tag him as a liberal, the 39-year-old Mr. Campbell emphasizes his fiscal conservatism. But he said his support for the right to choose abortion was "the deciding issue" in the campaign. "If the Republicans of California chose me as their candidate," he said in an interview, "the party had better have a pro-choice point of view."
The race has turned nasty in recent weeks. In his latest commercial, Mr. Herschensohn accused Mr. Campbell of distorting his position in a way that is "symbolic of what's wrong with the arrogant, spoiled, liberal Congress." Mr. Campbell says flatly, in his advertising and in person, that Mr. Herschensohn is a liar.
 
Different Geography
 Despite their ideological differences, the race could also turn on how well Mr. Campbell and Mr. Herschensohn tap their vastly different geographic bases. After more than a decade as a television and radio commentator in Los Angeles, Mr. Herschensohn, who admits he prefers television appearances to the grind of endless campaign appearances, is well known in Southern California but sought to raise his popularity in the San Francisco area by campaigning with Oliver L. North, well known from the Iran-contra affair.
Though he has never held elective office, Mr. Herschensohn finished second in 1986 Senate primary to Representative Ed Zschau, who vacated the House seat now held by Mr. Campbell but lost the election to Mr. Cranston.
Mr. Campbell, who has represented Palo Alto for two terms, has sought to build his name recognition in Southern California. While recent polls show a tight race between Mr. Campbell and Mr. Herschensohn, they give Mr. Campbell a thin lead.
If the turnout is low, Mr. Herschensohn would probably benefit because he is backed by many of the conservative loyalists who are usually most inclined to vote.
No matter what the outcome, some Republicans are not bracing for the end of intraparty warfare after Tuesday's primary. "I don't think," Mr. Schnur said, "there will be any apocolyptical fallout on either side."

HEADLINE: In Sarajevo, Anger and Grief Amid Ruins

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, May 31

 BODY:
When the Serbian Orthodox priests lifted the top off Predrag Marjanovic's coffin for his family's last farewells today, his grandmother leaned over, moved the black scarf from his face and kissed him.
"Your brothers who survive you will avenge you!" she said, her anguished voice rising above the wailing of the dead man's mother and sister. 
Around them, in the caramel-colored church in the hills above this besieged city, Serbian men in camouflage fatigues with pistols, knives and grenades strapped to their belts wept for their comrade, a 27-year-old Serbian policeman. He died on Friday when a sniper in Sarajevo shot him in the back as he pulled his pajamas from a clothesline.
After their farewells, the mourners stepped out into the drizzle and vowed to keep fighting until Sarajevo was "liberated" from the Croats and Muslim Slavs who control much of the city.
"If this land is not going to be Serbian, it will be nobody's," said a 30-year-old Serbian policeman, also named Predrag, who gave only his first name.
A day after the United Nations Security Council imposed sweeping sanctions on Serbia and identified it as the principal aggressor in Bosnia and Herzegovina's civil war, the mood among the ethnic Serbian forces encircling Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, was defiant, and at times apocalyptic.
In their vows to keep fighting, to avenge lost comrades and to capture Sarajevo -- or at least to carve out Serbian enclaves that can be governed as part of an autonomous Serbian republic -- the fighters offer little hope that they will yield at any time soon to international pressure.
On the Serbian front lines, along the slopes of the 6,500-foot mountains that cradle Sarajevo, the mood was one of a people who consider themselves maligned, above all by the United States, which led the drive for sanctions.
Sometimes in anger, sometimes in what seemed like despair, officers and men alike assailed American reporters entering Sarajevo for what they said were misleading Western news accounts that had helped push the United Nations into the embargo on trade, oil, civil aviation and sports.
At the funeral, at paramilitary checkpoints along the rutted mountain roads that are the Serbs' supply lines, and at military barracks on Sarajevo's outskirts where Serbian commanders direct their operations, the Serbs insisted that atrocities attributed to their forces -- including a mortar attack on a bread line in the center of Sarajevo in which at least 20 people died -- were "provocations" by Muslim Slav units seeking to push the world into punitive actions against Serbia.
 
Fear of Extinction
 The Serbs also represented themselves as men fighting to save their historic foothold in Sarajevo against the Muslim-dominated Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which they said was committed to a program of Islamic fundamentalism, and ultimately to the extinction of the Serbian Orthodox Church and other aspects of Serbian culture that have been rooted here since Sarajevo in its present form was founded 535 years ago.
Finally, the Serbs said, they were fighting to save their families and fellow military men who have been trapped in Sarajevo by the fighting.
As mortar and machine-gun fire broke the stillness outside his office, Col. Tomislav Sipcic of the newly formed army of the so-called Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, was preoccupied with the plight of Serbs trapped in Sarajevo. At intervals during the evening, the granite faced officer at the Lukavica barracks in Sarajevo's outskirts picked up a telephone on his candle-lit desk to speak with a Croatian commander of the opposing Muslim-Slav and Croatian forces in Sarajevo.
Until 12 years ago, Colonel Sipcic, who is 50 years old, was an officer in the Yugoslav Army It has transferred at least 55,000 troops to the new army after the Serbian Government, under pressure to respect Bosnia and Herzegovina's independent status, ordered Yugoslav forces to withdraw. Now, in addition to maintaining a blockade on Sarajevo, the Colonel's tasks include bargaining with the Croatian commander, Col. Stjepan Siber, over 734 Serbs who are trapped in the Marshal Tito barracks in the heart of Sarajevo.
For more than two months, the Serbs, who include 486 women and children and 248 officers and teen-age military cadets, have been besieged in the barracks by Croatian and Muslim Slav forces. Inside the huge military encampment, covering the equivalent of 10 city blocks, the Serbs are trapped without electrical power or fresh food, and their fate has become intertwined with that of Sarajevo itself. In effect, they have become hostages to the heavy bombardment of the city by Serbian artillery, mortar and rocket batteries in the surrounding hills.
Tonight, in one of the curious human twists to the Sarajevo battle, Colonel Sipcic agreed to allow a Muslim Slav chess team safe passage on their way to the World Chess Olympiad in the Philippines if Colonel Siber, a former army colleague, held to an agreement to allow the evacuation of the Marshal Tito barracks on Monday.
Similar agreements have been made and broken at the last moment, raising fears of a massacre if the walls of the barracks should be breached.
But if ties forged in the old Yugoslavia still count for something among military officers, much else about Sarajevo attests to the rupturing of human bonds and the resurgence of the ethnic and religious hatreds of the past. Many of the Serbian fighters described their Muslim foes as lazy, and as under the spell of Alija Izetbegovic, the President of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a man they described as a Muslim extremist.
"What they didn't succeed in achieving 500 years ago they want now," said Grujo Sudzum, a 36-year-old Serbian mechanic serving as a military volunteer, referring to the Turkish drive into Europe in the 15th century.
As dusk settled over the low hills separating the Lucavica barracks, Mr. Sudzum was surrounded by a group of Serbian volunteers. Asked if they would agree to United Nations demands that they stop fighting if it meant the end of their bid for a Serbian republic within Bosnia, they replied in a chorus: "Never!"
One man exclaimed: "I lost my house!" Another man said he had lost contact with his wife and three children in Pofalici, a district where, the fighters said, Muslim Slav militiamen had killed at least 70 civilians 15 days ago, burning some alive in their homes.
In the village of Pale, 10 miles from Sarajevo, the funeral of Mr. Marjanovic left no doubt about the bitterness stirred by the fighting. After Serbian priests in black and golden vestments had performed a liturgy over the coffin, and mourners with lighted candles had filed under the oil-painted icons to kiss the dead policeman, Nedeljko Rasevic, a 41-year-old hotel manager now serving as a military volunteer, blamed President Bush for what he said was the United Nations' victimization of the Serbs.
"If Mr. Bush was here he wouldn't do such things to our people," Mr. Rasevic said. "He should come here to see the truth. He should come here and learn about the eight people that the Muslims took to a school basement in Sarajevo and burned alive. We are burying our people all the time."

HEADLINE: TENS OF THOUSANDS CALL FOR REMOVAL OF SERBIA'S LEADER

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, May 31

 BODY:
Tens of thousands of demonstrators crowded downtown streets today calling for the resignation of Serbia's President as the first effects of United Nations sanctions were being felt.
The President, Slobodan Milosevic, criticized the sanctions imposed on Saturday, saying Serbia was not responsible for the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which continued today. 
 "This is the price we have to pay for supporting Serbs outside Serbia," Mr. Milosevic said early this morning after he cast his vote in elections for the Yugoslav Parliament. "As far as the accusations that we have committed aggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina are concerned, surely every citizen of Serbia knows that they are ridiculous. We have not committed any aggression against Bosnia."
 
Election Boycotted
 Mr. Milosevic appeared tired as he voted today. All major opposition parties were boycotting the elections in Serbia and Montenegro, the only remaining Yugoslav republics, and the Serbian Orthodox Church denounced the vote.
Polls opened just hours after the United Nations Security Council imposed the economic sanctions.
[Bush Administration officials Sunday expressed deep reluctance to use military force to enforce the sanctions, saying Washington's immediate goal was to force the Serbian-backed military to lift its two-month blockade of Sarajevo. Administration officials said they wanted to assess the effects of the embargo before taking any further steps to punish Yugoslavia. Page A8]
The first outward signs of the embargo were lines forming at gasoline stations in the Belgrade area and the disruption of air links.
 
Flights Are Canceled
 This morning, hundreds of stranded travelers milled around Belgrade Airport watching the word "Canceled" click up next to one departing flight after another on the large black timetable. Within hours, only flights for Paris, Copenhagen, Moscow and London were left and it was unclear whether they would actually depart.
Yugoslavia also has been disqualified from the European soccer championship in Sweden as a result of the United Nations embargo.
The peaceful demonstrators, many dressed in black, took over downtown Belgrade streets for about three hours this afternoon, unfurling a mile-long black banner along the city's main shopping thoroughfare before protesting outside the television station, the hub of the Serbian Government's propaganda network.
Demonstrators jeered and shouted "Slobo Must Go!" outside the republic's Presidency Building, referring to President Milosevic.
The demonstration was the largest anti-Government gathering in Serbia since violent protests in March 1991 brought Yugoslav Army tanks to Belgrade streets.
 
Bombing of Belgrade
 "I am against the war and the regime that has sucked our sons into war," said a Yugoslav Airline flight attendant, laid off last week after 30 years on the job because of the cancellation of the airlines' landing rights by the United States and Canada.
"I want to show the world that all Serbs are not the same," she said. "We all expect to be bombed, and we remember when the Americans bombed Belgrade in 1944."
Slobodanka Karic, a 50-year-old health worker, said, "It's only a matter of time before the armed conflict comes to Belgrade. The international community should stop all the armed attacks by all sides, and then the Communists must be removed."
The demonstrators scoffed at today's elections, calling them a "farce."
 
Reports on Turnout
 Election officials reported only a 38 percent turnout at Serbian polling stations at 2 P.M., and by evening were asserting that 60 percent of the electorate had voted. In Montenegro, turnout reports ranged from 6 to 60 percent. About 7.3 million people are eligible to vote. Final results are not expected until Wednesday.
Western diplomats said a weak turnout would not necessarily be interpreted as a vote of no confidence in Mr. Milosevic, who rose to power through the Communist Party's apparatus and has deflected criticism and held power by appealing to Serbian nationalism and controlling the republic's large enterprises and most influential media.
Serbia's main opposition parties, the Serbian Renewal Movement, Democratic Party and Serbian Liberal Party called for the boycott because they said the Government pushed through the country's new Constitution without adequate discussion, allowed only a short period for campaigning and refused to end its virtual monopoly on the country's main television channel.
 
'Duty to Liberate Serbia'
 The leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement, Vuk Draskovic, said: "The Serbs' enemies are not in London, New York, Paris or Moscow. They are right here in Belgrade. It's our duty to liberate Serbia."
"The Serbian people are not guilty," Mr. Draskovic said. "Sanctions are needed against the regime, not the people."
The Serbian Orthodox Church denounced the Serbian and Yugoslav Governments last week, disassociated itself from the new Constitution and the elections and called for the formation of a government of national salvation.
Only the renamed Communist Party of Serbia and Montenegro, two ultra-nationalist parties, and several dozen tiny political groups ran candidates.
 
Successor to Old Yugoslavia
 The elections were scheduled after the new Yugoslavia was formed on April 27 in an attempt to claim the status of the successor to the Yugoslav Federation as well as its assets.
Government leaders say the elections are important because they will allow the Yugoslav Government to begin functioning normally again after huge gaps were torn in the Legislature and administration by the secession of Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia.
Officials of the United Nations peacekeeping forces in Sarajevo today won agreements from Serbian leaders in Bosnia and Herzegovina's government for a new cease-fire scheduled to begin on Monday at 6 P.M. local time, an official in Sarajevo said. The cease-fire agreement provides for the evacuation of a besieged Yugoslav Army barracks in the city center.
Bosnian Serb forces this morning continued their bombardments of Sarajevo, while Yugoslav Army and Bosnian Serb forces also shelled the historic port city of Dubrovnik, lobbing about 17 shells into the walled Old Town.
More than 2,300 people have been killed and 7,700 wounded since the Serbs began their military campaign to seize most of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The fighting has driven well over 700,000 people from their homes.

HEADLINE: Attention Italian Shoppers: Find Your Bargains Here;
For These New York Visitors, 'Buy American' Ranks With Major Tourist Attractions

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER

 BODY:
It was Alberto Frambrosi's first visit to the United States, and the tourist from Milan knew exactly where to find the real America. It had nothing to do with the Empire State Building or the Statue of Liberty or anything else New Yorkers might expect.
Mr. Frambrosi landed at Kennedy International Airport, dumped his luggage at his hotel in midtown Manhattan, and hurried to Curacao Export Ltd., a small and bustling store, four flights above West 57th Street off Fifth Avenue, that is a mecca for Europeans, especially Italians. Here, in abundance, were the American products Mr. Frambrosi and his friends covet -- Timberland shoes, Swatch watches, Levi's jeans, Sony Walkmans -- and pay dearly for at home. 
 Ray-Ban sunglasses, the Olympian model, were his first purchase. $60! In Milan, he had paid twice as much for his other five or six pairs, he said.
 
'Still the Fabled Land'
 "I love them," said Mr. Frambrosi, who heads a software company. "I love them a lot. I don't know why." With his new Ray-Bans, he said, he was ready to hit the other places on his list of New York musts -- Central Park, Fifth Avenue, Benihana's.
The approach of summer means the annual migration of foreign tourists to New York, and despite the reports of economic recession and murder in the subways, the visitors are arriving by the tens of thousands, as always.
"New York is still the fabled land," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the regional commissioner for the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. And New York, he added, counts on tourism as one of its major industries.
In 1990, the last year for which figures are available, tourists spent $9.66 billion in the city, with more than a third coming from international visitors, according to the city's Convention and Visitors Bureau. The money amounted to an increase of 4.5 percent over the year before, and came at a time when the city was sinking into a deep recession.
This year the Europeans, benefiting from a favorable exchange rate, are spending freely. "New York is the bargain capital of the world," Mr. Ehrenhalt said. " 'I can get it for you wholesale' was invented in New York." And while the Italians may be outnumbered by visitors from England, West Germany and France, they are the most exuberant of the European spenders, store owners and tour company directors say.
Americans in Italy want Ferragamo shoes and Gucci bags. But not the Italians. Buy American -- or in America -- is their motto.
"It's got to be American, even if it's made in Taiwan," said Daniela Marino, marketing director for USA Travel, which books Italian tours to New York.
Besides Curacao, one of the hot spots here is McCreedy & Schreiber Boots and Shoes, at 37 West 46th Street, where Italians in New York go for Timberland, the casual shoe with the little tree logo on its side, which is wildly popular among fashion-conscious Italians. Why Timberland? Mr. Schreiber said that in early 1980's Giovanni Agnelli, chairman of the Italian automaker Fiat, was photographed in Timberland shoes. The rest, Mr. Schreiber said, is history.
 
220,000 Italian Visitors
 Recently, Mr. Agnelli was quoted about his fondness for Brooks Brothers clothes, Mr. Schreiber said. "Now the big thing is Brooks Brothers," Mr. Schreiber said.
Each year, 220,000 Italians visit New York, according to the Convention and Visitors Bureau. Some get a piece of New York without leaving home. Antonella Ierubino, the operations manager of the New York City office of the tour company Gastaldi USA, received a fax several weeks ago from a young woman who works in Gastaldi's Palermo office. His translation:
"What point have you reached with my Swatch watches, Timberland shoes and Michael Jordan sneakers from Nike? Please let me know. I can't take it anymore."
Mr. Ierubino went shopping. Another fax: "I received the two Swatch watches. Wonderful!!! I am overwhelmed with joy. For the Nikes, I'll wait for your news. Perhaps in August, I'll come to NYC!!!"
Mr. Ierubino says Italians love the Mediterranean colors of Swatch. The Ray-Ban craze, he says, may have started with the actor Tom Cruise, who wore them in "Risky Business" and, later, in "Top Gun."
 
Beyond Shopping
 To the Italians, Timberland shoes for $100, Swatch watches for $70, and Levi's for $40 are a bargain. Like Ray-Bans, those brands cost two, three and even four times as much at home.
Monica Detullio, who is 22, was at Curacao last Saturday, buying five pairs of Ray-Bans ($46 apiece), a pair of Levi's 501 jeans ($38), a Walkman ($51), and a cordless phone ($57). In her hand was an Italian guidebook to New York City, with the Curacao entry marked in black pen. It was only 1 P.M. on the first day of Miss Detullio's first trip in America. Six days to go.
"I am not happy," Miss Detullio's father, Nicola Detullio, said dryly. Mr. Detullio, an engineer, was bankrolling the spending spree.
But shopping isn't everything. Italians also want to eat teriyaki at Benihana's and American steak at Beefsteak Charlies. They want to drink espresso at Cafe Lucca in Greenwich Village. They want to see Fifth Avenue, Wall Street, Little Italy and Harlem.
Gabriele Malacrido, a 27-year-old traffic engineer from Como, and his 21-year-old bride, Mara, arrived last Tuesday night on their honeymoon. They had three days in New York. At 9:20 A.M. Wednesday they boarded a minibus outside the Sbarro's restaurant, at Broadway and 46th Street, for a four-hour tour of Manhattan.
Mr. Malacrido's first question for the tour guide: "Is it possible to go to the Bronx?"
It wasn't. "I'd like to see all the town," Mr. Malacrido explained. "I've heard about the Bronx. They say it's very dangerous, and there are a lot of poor people."
The bus went from Rockefeller Center to the Cathedral of St. John the Divine to the Apollo Theater to Little Italy to Winter Garden and back to midtown.
"Very beautiful city," Mr. Malacrido said.
"Horrible coffee," said Golob Branka, a banker.
Mr. Malacrido, who left town Friday, said he decided his excursion to the Bronx was not meant to be, thus depriving himself of the chance to see first hand that there is more to the borough than poor people and danger.
"It did not disappoint me, New York," he said. "But three days is not enough. You must stay here, I think, a week, maybe, or 10 days."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Black Cable Channel's Wild Ride

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
When BET Holdings Inc., the cable-television company whose core business is Black Entertainment Television, went public last fall, the stock took off like a rocket.
And little wonder. BET had lots of cachet as the first publicly traded black-owned company on the New York Stock Exchange, and as the purest-play stock in the fast-growing cable programming business. The service's programming was distinctive, with black-oriented music videos, talk shows, comedy and news. 
 Best of all, BET had a stunning earnings record, unlike many cable companies whose high cash flows are eaten up by high depreciation costs.
But since that October offering, the company and its new investors have found themselves riding more of a roller coaster than a rocket. The stock price has lurched between the mid-teens and mid-20's as expectations soared, only to fall rapidly more than once on disappointing earnings and confusing financial reports.
Through it all, Robert Johnson, the company's founder, chairman and its largest shareholder, has maintained goals different from what he sees as the self-limiting ones of other black entrepreneurs.
"I want to build the first black media company," said Mr. Johnson, 45 years old, in an interview in his office in the Georgetown section of Washington. "Most black companies are family businesses. They are concerned about giving family members security. They don't grow. If we are able to buy those businesses, we can build a major company."
To build such a company, Mr. Johnson is now investing in BET's programming and expanding the company's two monthly magazines, YSB (Young Sisters and Brothers), aimed at black teen-agers, and Emerge, aimed at young black professionals. YSB has about 65,000 paid subscribers. Emerge has 100,000.
Mr. Johnson, who controls 46 percent of BET's stock, said the shares' volatile performance stemmed from Wall Street's frenzied infatuation with his company, tough times for cable and the company's lack of familiarity with the stock market.
He said the confusion was now behind BET. Indeed, a number of cable analysts are turning bullish on the company again. What was happening to BET partly reflected the situation most cable programmers were in. But there were the additional challenges of a small, minority-owned company making its debut on Wall Street, attracting both an enormous response and high expectations.
When it was initially offered at $17 a share, BET's stock was vastly oversubscribed and the shares traded as high as $26.375 on Oct. 30, the first day it traded, before closing at $23.50.
 
Disappointing Earnings
 But then came disappointing earnings for the company's first fiscal quarter, ended Oct. 31. And then confusion over some important financial data and the number of cable subscribers combined to undermine investor confidence and pushed the stock down to $15.875 in December.
The stock recovered to $23.375, only to plunge as low as $12 in early March after a disappointing second quarter, which ended on Jan. 31. Both times the stock dropped so sharply that BET asked for trading to be halted. The stock closed at $15.75 on Friday.
When Mr. Johnson started the company in Washington in 1979, cable television was a fast-growing business and he was convinced that there was room for a black-oriented television service.
Partly financed by Tele-Communications Inc., the service grew so rapidly that by the end of 1991, it had 29 million subscribers. And since much of BET's programming day consisted of low-cost music videos, the company posted its first profit in 1985. That was unusually fast for the cable industry. Most publicly traded cable companies own cable systems, whose high construction costs generally hold down earnings. As the overall market for stock in new companies surged, Mr. Johnson saw the chance to tap the investing public for capital.
 
Enormous Enthusiasm
 When it was courting analysts and potential investors, the company indicated that it hoped to add three million new cable subscribers a year, said Dennis Leibowitz, an analyst who follows BET for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. BET also indicated that advertising growth, which had slowed during the recession, would begin to pick up.
The enthusiasm for the deal was enormous. Initial orders for stock exceeded 70 million shares. BET ultimately sold four million shares as planned, though it raised the offering price twice as demand swelled.
The First Boston Corporation, the lead underwriter, was also extremely bullish. Internal data prepared by First Boston's analyst, Mary Kukowski, before BET went public projected earnings of $15 million, or 74 cents a share, for the 1992 fiscal year. Actual earnings for the 1991 fiscal year, which ended in July, totaled $9.3 million.
By contrast, Mr. Leibowitz of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette is now forecasting 1992 fiscal year earnings of $12 million, or 58 cents a share.
 
Subscribers in Doubt
 BET did report solid profits when it released its first-quarter earnings in December, but the numbers were still disappointing to investors. They were hoping for 30 percent growth, not the 15 percent rise, to $2.3 million, the company reported.
Perhaps even more important, there was some confusion about the number of cable subscribers that BET actually had. Its earnings release alluded to 31.6 million subscribers, but it actually had about 29 million and many of them were not paying full price.
The 31.6 million figure referred to numbers from the A. C. Nielsen Company that included viewers who were getting the service illegally. It took several days to explain the difference to Wall Street. Even so, the growth rate in new subscribers proved slower than anticipated. Instead of the annual growth of three million, it had only acquired 400,000 in the quarter.
Mr. Johnson said cable system owners, fearful of reregulation, were hesitant to pay for new services like BET. That has slowed subscriber growth, he said.
Still, after BET's second-quarter earning came in below Wall Street's expectations, "people even began to think there might be no earnings-per-share growth," said Mr. Leibowitz of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. Revenues did grow by 18 percent, but costs grew faster, he said, jumping 36 percent primarily because of programming expenses and costs associated with the two new magazines.
 
Optimistic About Growth
 Mr. Johnson said he was optimistic about BET's growth potential. "We are only in about 50 percent of all cable homes," he said, adding that BET's ratings were good.
John Kornreich, who follows the company for Sandler & Company, a New York investment firm, said that expectations for BET's performance were unrealistically high. He contends that the company's profit margins were not sustainable because, as he puts it: "In such a competitive environment, they will have to spend more on programming and promotion. That will hurt their margins short term, but long term it will insure their growth."
Despite pressures to spend more, Mr. Johnson is taking his time. As he points out, advertisers pay a premium for other so-called target programming cable stations, from Cable News Network to the Weather Channel. He believes that the same is true of BET. Like other cable programmers, he is trying to negotiate new 10-year contracts with cable systems, twice what had been the normal term.
Until he sees what he will get, he is likely to move cautiously. As the cable audience fragments and programmers seek new niches, Mr. Johnson is determined to maintain and expand his core black audience.

HEADLINE: At Poverty Conference, Gloom and Dashed Hope

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MADISON, Wis., May 28

 BODY:
Robert Lampman, the intellectual architect of the war on poverty, stepped to the lectern and reported the good news: poverty has all but vanished, the economy is booming and wages are soaring for those at the bottom.
Then the 71-year-old economist delivered the punch line.
"Not!" he said. 
 Humor was a help this weekend as some of the nation's most eminent poverty researchers gathered at the University of Wisconsin to survey decades of disappointments and a future of seemingly pinched prospects.
 
Thwarted Hopes
 When Mr. Lampman helped start the university's Institute for Research on Poverty in 1966, he predicted a short life for the institute, anticipating that the days of poverty itself were numbered. That was 965 discussion papers, 44 books and 52 special reports ago.
Then the economy hit a wall, growing more slowly and giving less to those at the bottom. Government programs disappointed. Family breakdown accelerated. The percentage of Americans who fall below the poverty line, which had dropped to about 11 percent in 1973, reversed direction, staying at 13 percent or more throughout the 1980's.
"It's all pretty disappointing, I'm afraid," said Mr. Lampman. "I'm pretty pessimistic, particularly on the race question."
Mr. Lampman's former colleague on President John F. Kennedy's Council of Economic Advisers, James Tobin, was also on hand. He too envisioned poverty's early demise, writing in 1967 that it could be eradicated in nine years.
But speaking at the institute's conference last weekend, he traced the story of how macro-economic growth was doing less and less for the poor, and other forces -- drugs, guns and AIDS -- were doing more to them.
He did not speak for all of social science, but it was nonetheless telling when the Nobel Prize winner concluded of these blights, "Understanding them or prescribing remedies are outside my competence."
 
Knowing and Doing
 The conference, planned before the Los Angeles rioting but tinged with its tragic coloration, raised two questions: "What do we know?" and "What should we do?"
The answer to the first, in some respects, is quite a lot. Now there is an abundant literature about what might be called the anatomy of poverty: how much education the poor have, how much they work, how many leave welfare quickly.
There is also a body of literature on program effectiveness that shows, for instance, that training programs help increase the earnings of women on welfare, albeit quite modestly.
Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, offered an explanation for why anti-poverty programs are not more successful in ending poverty: most do not even try.
Big programs, like Medicaid, housing assistance or food stamps, he said, ameliorate poverty rather than eradicating it. By contrast, programs to make the poor self-sufficient through education or training are much smaller and have suffered the biggest cuts.
"Most programs for the poor achieve their objectives to a limited degree," Mr. Burtless said, arguing, for instance, that while Medicaid does not reduce poverty, it probably improves the health of the poor.
 
Tougher Question
 "What should we do?" was a tougher question.
There was something of a consensus here that the working poor -- a large portion of the 13.5 percent of Americans below the poverty line -- could be substantially helped with health insurance and more generous tax credits.
But what to do about what some call "the underclass," a group of persistently poor people mired in apathy and crime, was more problematic; indeed, the scholars do not even agree whether an underclass exists.
Is this a cause for pessimism? "I would put a different spin on it," said Sheldon Danziger, a former director of the institute. "We know how to cut the poverty rate in half tomorrow with a modest amount of new spending -- $20 billion."
But Robert Haveman, also a former institute director, caused a modest stir with a dimmer assessment, describing the usual call for an expanded Head Start program, more tax credits and more job training as "ho hum."
Mr. Burtless said such policies may be familiar, but similar ones work in Western Europe where poverty rates are much lower.
"If that is boring, too bad," he said.
 
Room for Hope
 There were two possible bright spots. One is that some things may get bad enough to get good: as health insurance problems start affecting the middle class, for instance, there is more pressure on government to control costs and expand coverage.
Another bright spot may simply be the scholars' poor history in making predictions about poverty.
Hugh Heclo of George Mason University quoted from a poem by Artur Miedzyrzecki called "What the Political Scientist Knows." But perhaps the insight applies to anyone immersed in an expert's data:
 
It doesn't occur to him
That no one knows when
Irrevocable changes may appear
Like an ice floe's sudden cracks.

Ghost Town for Sale: Elves Included

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WIDE AWAKE, Colo., May 31

 BODY:
No one has lived in this town for many years, except, of course, for the Tommyknockers, the mischievous elves that miners swore they heard, and sometimes even glimpsed, especially after a drink or two.
But the Tommyknockers might soon have company. Wide Awake is up for sale. 
 All that remains of the old mountain town, which is still named on some maps, are remnants of a post office that collapsed in a jumbled heap, the concrete foundation of the stamping mill and a tiny wood and tin shack that was home to Wide Awake's last resident, Wallace Stevens, a retired shepherd, who died in 1964. Seven miles from the nearest town, a four-wheel-drive vehicle is needed to get here across an unpaved and unmarked road.
Like so many ghost towns in the West, the darkness of night, and perhaps an avid imagination, bring some eerie sounds to Wide Awake. "It's really kind of creepy up there," said Verla Clemens, who owns the town with her husband, Richard. "The ground creaks and heaves. You hear sounds like shrieks and screams."
Miners with picks, shovels and dreams struck gold here in the 1860's, and by the turn of the century, more than 500 people lived in Wide Awake, about 50 miles west of Denver. According to legend, the miners had been struggling to come up with a name for the town. As they tossed out possible names late into the night, one sleepy miner supposedly said to another, "Let's just wait until morning, when we're more wide awake."
One of the miners responded: "That's it! We'll name it Wide Awake."
The mine, the linchpin of the town's economy, closed in the late 1920's, although the Clemenses say gold deposits remain in these hills.
The town, which includes 46 acres of private property and 175 acres of deeded Federal land, runs up against the Arapahoe National Forest. Deer and black bear prance across the land, which is covered with juniper, aspen and lodgepole pine. The asking price is $250,000.
The rugged terrain of Gilpin County was forbidding territory to all but the heartiest. And its settlers, who often ended up chasing off to Alaska for the next gold rush, left a legacy of colorful stories. For generations, tourists have come to Black Hawk and Central City for the Old West honky-tonk flavor. The writer Jack Kerouac stopped here to take notes and quench his thirst in the 1950's.
But unlike its neighbors, Wide Awake, an isolated patch in the Rockies, faded into history. Except for an occasional wilderness hiker, tourists would scarcely know that a town had existed here. But the property value has risen in the last year as legalized gambling triggered a boom in Central City and Black Hawk. At the same time, taxes have jumped. And Mr. and Mrs. Clemens, who are retired in Paonia in Western Colorado, say they cannot afford to keep it.
"With all the history, I hate to let the town go," Mrs. Clemens said. "But the taxes are $100 a month now. And with retirement, you know, it's hard to keep up with it. We're hoping somebody with money will rebuild the town, the way it used to be."
Mrs. Clemens's father-in-law, Jesse Clemens, bought the town in the 1930's. When he died in 1987, he left the town to his son, Richard.
The Clemenses' real estate agent, Steve Higgins, said that he had fielded a few serious calls, but that most of the inquiries have come from curiosity seekers.
Wide Awake's last resident, Mr. Stevens, who died at age 97, was said to enjoy the solitude. He stored his food in a tree perch that he enclosed with screens to keep animals away.
"Could he ever tell stories," Mrs. Clemens said. "I went rabbit hunting with him once. I couldn't keep up. He chased off and left me in the snow drifts. I was about 17. He was about 87."
Mr. Stevens's daughter was not pleased that he was living alone in the mountains and persuaded him to spend winters with her in town. When he approached 90, the daughter put him in a nursing home, where he complained vehemently about being cooped up.
He appealed for help to his old friend, Jesse Clemens. "So Jesse went and got him out of the nursing home," Mrs. Clemens said, "and took him back to the mountains."

HEADLINE: METRO MATTERS;
Money and Other Excuses Hinder Inner-City Growth

BYLINE: By Sam Roberts

 BODY:
"THEY haven't been off the boat a year before they open up their own place," Coconut, a sidewalk savant in Spike Lee's film "Do the Right Thing," says as he surveys a grocery owned by Korean immigrants. "They already have got a place in our neighborhood -- a good business occupying a building that had been boarded up for longer than I care to remember."
"It's got to be because we are black," M. L., another character in the film, says. "There ain't no other explanation." 
 To which a third street-corner philosopher replies: "Tired of hearing that old excuse."
Mr. Lee, more prescient than most politicians, captured that raw resentment in 1989, months before a black group began a prolonged boycott of a Brooklyn grocery owned by Korean immigrants, also before blacks and others from the South Central section of Los Angeles vented their rage against Korean-owned stores.
Only three banks in the nation have been chartered specifically to invest in reviving depressed neighborhoods, like South Central. One is in Chicago, another in Arkadelphia, Ark. The third, Community Capital, opened last year in Brooklyn. It is beginning to make a dent in seemingly unbreachable racial or economic barriers that have denied many nontraditional borrowers money.
Last month, Mayor David N. Dinkins announced a program that will tap money from, among other sources, a consortium of banks to spur business in New York's poorer neighborhoods. But Lyndon Comstock, Community Capital's chairman, says that competition is little concern. "I'm not aware of any loans that we lost to other banks," he said.
Already, "Ross Perot" and "Murphy Brown" have replaced "Los Angeles" as the two-word political capsules that the public seems able to digest at any one time. "Urban crisis" is no longer on most politicians' lips either. Nor have most of them been willing to join the debate between M. L. and his friend, much less offer more than another phrase, "enterprise zones."
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan obliquely addressed the M. L. syndrome last month while rebutting Attorney General William P. Barr's argument that family breakdown, crime and the Los Angeles riots were a "grim harvest" of Great Society programs enacted a quarter-century ago. The Senator dismissed Mr. Barr's argument, but not entirely.
"For a brief time, the Great Society gave great influence in social policy to viewpoints that rejected the proposition that family structure might be a social issue," Mr. Moynihan said. "Accordingly, even if social policy might have produced some effective responses, no such policies were attempted."
Since it began 18 months ago, Community Capital Bank has nearly tripled its assets, to $18 million (deposits are Federally insured). Because its market-rate loans range from $50,000 to $450,000, many are packaged with money from other institutions.
The bank has granted $3 million in loans or letters of credit from its own resources and has committed another $1.5 million -- help for more than two dozen borrowers who might have been rejected by conventional banks. Nonetheless, Community Capital was listed among the nation's highest-rated banks last year by Sheshunoff Information Services, a service that rates banks' financial health.
Community Capital approved loans to about 1 in 10 of the business people who applied. One is opening Harlem's first Ben & Jerry's ice cream franchise this summer with a nonprofit group that intends to hire homeless people. Other borrowers include the Settlement Housing Fund, which is rehabilitating 40 apartments in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn; a group building a nursing home in the South Bronx for AIDS patients and their families, and a hardware store owner in East Flatbush, Brooklyn.
Mr. Comstock says he is surprised that many more imaginative entrepreneurs have not applied. Community Capital grants loans in low- to moderate-income communities all over New York City instead of pumping money into a single neighborhood.
"The only thing that represents a long-term concern is that the number of community development projects going on at any one time is nowhere near what the city needs it to be," he said. "It's not even remotely at an acceptable level."
Which suggests that money is only one solution. Another is to address the sidewalk debate between M. L. and his friend, who has tired of old excuses.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: New Jersey;
In All Corners, Volunteers for Perot Set Up Camp

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FRANKLIN PARK, N.J., May 28

 BODY:
Cole Kleitsch rummaged through his files. He was at his desk in the back room of his light-flooded Hallmark card shop in a strip shopping mall here. He had a file for his bank papers, a file for his taxes and, the one he was hunting for, a file for Ross Perot.
The chatty, 30-year-old Mr. Kleitsch said he had never been a political agitator. "I never before saw a political candidate whom I would lift a finger for," he said. But two months ago, he volunteered to work as one of the foot soldiers in the New Jersey campaign to elect Mr. Perot President. Now there is no slipping out of the Hallmark shop with a birthday or get-well card without also getting an earful about Ross Perot. 
 Along the humming highway that runs beside Mr. Kleitsch's shop, he has pasted a poster championing Mr. Perot. A Perot sticker and two clipboards greet patrons at the checkout counter. One clipboard holds petitions to get Mr. Perot on the November ballot in New Jersey. The other is for people wishing to do campaign work for Mr. Perot.
"There are people, myself included, who feel their needs are not being met by the political parties," Mr. Kleitsch said. "We're being offered Coke and Pepsi again. What we want is Seven-Up."
He said that it might seem improbable for Mr. Perot to be elected, but added, "Even a tidal wave looks small when you see it on the horizon before it hits the beach."
The Perot volunteers will have no direct roll in the New Jersey primary on Tuesday, since their candidate is not on the ballot and their efforts are directed toward November. New Jersey counts write-ins in primary elections, but the Perot organizers are discouraging a write-in campaign because Mr. Perot has said he wants to avoid disrupting the primary process.
A drive down the highways and backroads of New Jersey shows Mr. Perot's supporters nearly everywhere. They live in Teaneck and Hopewell, in Summit and Newark, in Fort Lee and Clifton. They are a broad cross-section, none entirely sure what their man stands for, but all united in fervently wanting him to lead the country.
About 9,000 Perot volunteers are scattered around the state. Newcomers sign on daily. The majority seem to be novices at the tortuous regimen of political campaigning, but disillusionment with the major-party candidates and the quirky magnetism of Mr. Perot have conspired to kindle an enthusiasm.
"Most of the people have never worked as part of any party, except maybe a rescue party," Mr. Kleitsch said.
Volunteers have defected from the camps of the Republicans and the Democrats. Many are resolute independents. Even some of the apolitical have been roused. One woman in her mid-30's said she had recently registered to vote for the first time so she could cast her ballot for Mr. Perot.
Tom O'Neil, a 54-year-old business consultant from Lawrence Township, is the state's Perot coordinator. After watching Mr. Perot on television, he said he called Dallas, asked what he could do and was told to organize New Jersey. For the time being, his living room is the state Perot headquarters.
He asked his friend, Pat O'Neil, an unemployed 43-year-old businessman from Princeton who is unrelated, to be deputy coordinator. Pat O'Neil said he had agreed after spending a few days reassuring himself that Tom O'Neil had not lost his mind.
 
Trying in Every District
 At organizational meetings, the volunteers were split into three regions: Northeast, Central and South. Each of the state's 21 counties has been assigned a coordinator, as have about three-fourths of the 547 municipalities. The objective now is to appoint a Perot coordinator and team of 3 to 10 members in each of the state's more than 6,000 election districts.
Only 800 signatures are needed to put Mr. Perot on the state's November ballot, and supporters filed petitions on May 13 that they said included nearly 3,000 names. But they are continuing to solicit more signatures to demonstrate the support that exists. They think 100,000 is a nice number.
The fact that Perot volunteers do not yet know precisely what their candidate stands for does not seem to bother them overly.
"At this point, I don't care what they bring out about him; I'm voting for him," said Peg Meyers, a 65-year-old volunteer in Kendall Park. "When I first heard him, he didn't say what he was for. But what he said was enough for me."
Her husband, Day, also 65, chimed in, "My feeling is the American people don't know what's going on down in Washington. I'm not a smart man. In fact, I didn't go further than the sixth grade, because I had to go work in the mines. But I know things are a mess. I think Perot's going to win big."
 
'A Lot of Havoc'
 Rita Kusler, a 39-year-old unemployed accountant who lives in Plainsboro, likes him beause she thinks he will "create a lot of havoc." She describes herself as a liberal Democrat who always voted for the Democratic nominee, except in 1976, when she wrote in Morris Udall.
When Marie Tuskey heard the name early this year, she at first thought people were talking about Hercule Poirot, the Agatha Christie sleuth. Now she is ready to do anything to get Ross Perot elected. "The way he was brought up is the way I was brought up," said Mrs. Tuskey, who is 66 and lives in Kendall Park. "Close family ties. Always a father and mother. I have six children and we're all close. He said his children got the same medical care his workers got, and I liked that."
She said her children have been enlisted to back Perot, too. But her 9-year-old grandson, Jonathan, whom she was babysitting, said he was in the Bush camp. Mrs. Tuskey did not feel she had to sway him. "Ah," she said, "he can't vote anyway."

HEADLINE: Fiscal Hurdle for City Hall: Pay Talks

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
Despite an agreement on Saturday between Mayor David N. Dinkins and the City Council on the shape of a $29.5 billion budget, City Hall still faces a final fiscal hurdle: reaching an agreement with the municipal labor unions on pay raises.
City officials and labor leaders will sit down this week to begin a new round of contract negotiations, and union officials say they will demand a share of the city's budget surplus for their members, who are working without contracts and have not had raises for more than a year. 
 But Mayor Dinkins has maintained that the city is still in poor fiscal health and cannot afford to share the surplus -- estimated at $515 million last week -- because most of it will be used to allow the city to avoid borrowing to meet its expenses over the next 12 months. He has vowed not to grant any raises to union workers for the next two years beyond what can be financed through productivity gains.
 
A Hard-Line Approach
 In an interview yesterday in London, where he is on an economic-development trip, Mr. Dinkins suggested that union leaders were pandering to their members by indicating that the surplus could be spent on payrolls. "I think they know what the situation is," the Mayor said. "Where are we going to get all this money?"
Sticking to a hard-line approach could be a costly political move for the Mayor and even raises the possibility of a work slowdown or other job action by angry unions. The unions, which can offer large amounts of political contributions, volunteers and votes, are also crucial to Mr. Dinkins's re-election next year. But recently union leaders have said publicly that despite their strong support for him in 1989, they are reassessing whether to endorse him next year.
"The Mayor simply cannot say there is no money around for raises," said Barry Feinstein, president of Teamsters Local 237, representing 12,000 city workers. "We don't want to hear that and we will not accept that. I would prefer for this not to be a knockdown, drag-out fight, but if the administration continues to lie to us, then so be it." Union leaders say the administration is exaggerating fiscal problems to gain concessions.
After losing thousands of jobs and agreeing to work furloughs and other concessions to help the administration close huge budget deficits in the last two years, labor leaders are under increasing pressure from members to get raises. The unions represent more than 200,000 city workers.
Mr. Feinstein said he believed the administration could come up with the money for a wage increase for the unions, given the magnitude of the city's budget. "It's a huge general fund and they know they can move money around, here and there, when they absolutely need it, and we fully expect them to do it," he said.
 
Keeping Pace With Inflation
 Labor leaders will not say how large a raise they plan to seek, but to keep pace with inflation, the unions will need one of at least 3 to 4 percent. City budget officials estimate that a 1 percent wage increase costs the city about $150 million a year.
First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel denied there was money tucked away in the budget for raises. "It's impossible for us to cook the books in such a way as to hide those kinds of dollars in the budget," he said. "Our position is and will continue to be that we have no other money for raises except through productivity gains."
Relations between the administration and labor have been rocky since at least the fall of 1990, when City Hall warned of the need for widespread layoffs to help offset budget deficits. The city has since eliminated more than 20,000 jobs with layoffs and attrition, and labor leaders say their members should be compensated for heavier workloads that have resulted.
The city is close to completing a delayed round of settlements with the unions that began in the fall of 1990 with the United Federation of Teachers and went on to include District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the city and transit police unions, teamsters and sanitation workers. Those contracts provided a 4.5 percent raise over 15 months.
But those contracts have already expired, and the city begins a new round of contract talks on Wednesday with a coalition of labor unions, including the teamsters and District Council 37, which represents more than 140,000 members. Unions representing firefighters, correction officers and superior law-enforcement officers have not yet settled in the earlier round and are still working under old contract provisions.
James F. Hanley, the city's chief labor negotiator, said the administration would take a hard negotiating line but declined to be more specific.
Perhaps the most important issue in the contract talks will be exactly how the city defines an increase in productivity and whether such efficiencies can be achieved in all city jobs to qualify for wage increases.
For example, productivity gains can clearly be achieved in such areas as sanitation and highways, where there are teams of workers who could agree to work in smaller numbers in exchange for a wage differential. But in other areas, like teaching, welfare or elderly care, it is more difficult to gauge productivity gains for union workers without assessing the delivery and quality of services. Thus, some union workers might qualify for raises through such productivity gains while others might not.
"You can't expect teachers to self-fund our raises," said Sandra Feldman, president of the United Federation of Teachers. "Class sizes are already too large and we are already underpaid, so how do you increase productivity?"
Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a private group, said he expected the Dinkins administration to be firm in its union negotiations after being accused of giving away the store in the last round of negotiations when the city initially gave the teachers a 5.5 percent raise. But he predicted that the city would ultimately find some money to help finance union raises.

HEADLINE: Port-au-Prince Journal;
A Settlement in Haiti? 'Mr. America' Is in the Way

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, May 30

 BODY:
When Haiti's military-backed Government published a new law calling for the formation of a "national consensus" Government on Friday, one name seemed to be on everyone's lips as the man most likely to be named to the powerful job of Prime Minister.
Squeezed badly by an international embargo, increasingly racked by violence, and scorned by an outside world that has not forgiven the overthrow of the country's first democratically elected Government last September, Haiti's army is now widely believed to be leaning heavily in favor of installing Marc L. Bazin as head of the Government. 
 Mr. Bazin's supporters say he is just the man to solve Haiti's crisis. In a country that has been called one of the world's leading kleptocracies, he was an incorruptible Finance Minister. A stint at the World Bank consolidated his image as the kind of modern technocrat that this anything-goes country has sorely lacked.
Most important, however, is Mr. Bazin's reputation for entree in Washington, a city that has never seemed far from the tangled intrigues of Haitian politics. For this the 60-year-old politician has been widely called Mr. America here, a name that earns him envy from some and loathing from others.
 
Signs of U.S. Anger
 But the issue of Mr. Bazin's influence in Washington is clearly not as simple as his reputation here would indicate. After the violent overthrow of the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide last September, American diplomats here and in Washington discussed what they called Mr. Bazin's "unhelpful role" in the crisis gingerly. But recently there have been signs of raw anger at Mr. Bazin, once an American favorite -- signs strongly suggesting that he will be powerless to ease Haiti's isolation.
At a recent meeting at the American Embassy here, when a participant inquired about a letter-writing campaign by influential Haitians aimed at persuading the United States to ease its embargo of Haiti, Ambassador Alvin P. Adams Jr. listened quietly, apparently doodling on a piece of paper.
When the speaker finished, several people present said, Mr. Adams held up the paper on which he had written "BAZIN," crumpled it and threw it in a trash can, thus dismissing the anti-embargo effort and the man who has become Washington's nemesis at the same time.
Similarly blunt messages have been sent by American diplomats to the Haitian Army. There can be no solution without recognition of Father Aristide, soldiers have been told. Furthermore, Washington has insisted that the deposed President be allowed to choose his own Prime Minister.
Under the army-backed plan for a "consensus" Government, a new Prime Minister will be proposed before the National Assembly sometime in the next few days. If he is approved, he will form a new Government. The presidency will deliberately be left open, but nowhere is there any mention of Father Aristide.
Few animosities are stronger than those separating Father Aristide and Mr. Bazin. Their enmity dates back well before Father Aristide, a last-minute candidate, drubbed Mr. Bazin and his well-oiled machine in national elections 17 months ago.
Father Aristide speaks unrelentingly about "the people," by which he sometimes too obviously meant only the dispossessed for the comfort of some here. Mr. Bazin, the son of senator and the husband of a woman born into a presidential family, is a more traditional Haitian politician.
There is little talk of involving ordinary people in his discourse. Rather, by his political thinking, called pragmatic or cynical depending on one's point of view, a true leader must slowly gain the confidence of the dominant forces here: the army, business and the conservative church. Only then, he says, will change come to Haiti.
In February, rather than accept an agreement negotiated in Washington that called for Father Aristide's eventual return, and the naming of a rival politician as Prime Minister, Mr. Bazin fought strenuously to make the deal fall through, diplomats say. "Every time we think we have put something together, there is Bazin, pulling it apart," said a disgusted diplomat from the Organization of American States.
 
'What's in It for Me?'
 Asked in a recent interview why he could not support Mr. Aristide simply for the sake of national peace, Mr. Bazin replied in his accentless English, "What's in it for me?"
The price tag on this stubbornness has not been small, diplomats say. Dozens of lives have since been lost in the continuing strife here. Thousands of boat people who have set out for the United States might have conceivably stayed home had there been a settlement. And there has been much embarrassment for both the O.A.S. and the State Department.
"I don't give a damn about what Washington thinks about me," Mr. Bazin said, seemingly lightened by the removal of his Uncle Sam label. "Nobody has worked harder to bring democracy to this country than me. What do they expect me to say: O.K., I'll go home now, my job is done. I don't expect any further role? I don't know how it is in your country, but that is certainly not how politics are played in Haiti."
For Haitians on his left, the conservative Mr. Bazin has long been hated for his exuberant Americanisms, and his ready-made, classic economic answers. To these, they have recently added new reasons for their antipathy.
Although he strongly denies it, after the anti-Aristide coup Mr. Bazin was widely quoted here as calling into question the importance of elections in a country where illiteracy predominates.
 
No Apologies for His Stand
 Now, even as he sheds the American stripes for which he was loathed in some quarters, many have latched onto statements like these and what they say is an unseemly eagerness to curry favor with the army and the remnants of the Duvalier dictatorship's brutal Tontons Macoute.
Mr. Bazin offers no apologies. "Either you are in politics or morality," he said, condemning the international community's unwillingness to recognize or even deal with the military-installed Government that replaced Father Aristide. "There are a number of sectors in this country which are powerful in the decision-making process, and they have to be involved."
Told that his fate in power may well be the same enduring scorn, Mr. Bazin professed serenity. A man who once boasted that through his contacts in Washington he could quickly obtain a half-billion dollars in aid and investment, badly needed by the hemisphere's poorest country, he now says that investment is not crucial.
"The lack of foreign investment is no excuse not to do the things you have to do," Mr. Bazin said, speaking in the cool shade of his front porch in one of the capital's most prestigious hillside neighborhoods. "For years, the foreign advisers have been saying you have to get your own house in order, and this will be a good occasion for that."

HEADLINE: Riots' Victims Begin Getting $638 Million in Aid

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 31

 BODY:
A month after rioting swept the nation's second-largest city, financial aid promised by the Government is beginning to reach those who lost jobs, homes and businesses.
Recipients say they are surprised and delighted to get the money this quickly. But some community leaders and local officials say thousands of people are still going hungry or homeless because of the riots, and they have called on Federal agencies to do more to make people aware of the programs and help them apply. 
 When they picked up their $7,000 low-interest loan from the Small Business Administration on Thursday to rebuild a wheelchair-repair business devastated by looters, Sheila and Ernie Tousant said that before the riots they had consistently been turned down for bank loans. But the Government, Mrs. Tousant said, "removed all the red tape and actually gave us a chance."
"I'm shocked," she said, "because I was here in the Watts riots, and I saw the money go to everyone except the people who needed it."
 
'Long Way to Go'
 Visiting Los Angeles on Friday, President Bush said of the rebuilding, "We have a long way to go," but he praised the Federal relief effort as "massive" and "quick."
The Government is financing some efforts to address deep-rooted urban problems. The Justice Department, for example, is providing $19 million for anti-crime and anti-poverty programs. But the emphasis is on patching up the damage from the riots, and some residents said they were angry that money was being spent to aid business owners while little was being provided to help those who had been homeless and hungry long before the riots.
A pastor at the First African Methodist Episcopal Church at the edge of South-Central Los Angeles said that as late as last week up to 1,500 people a day had still been arriving to pick up donated food.
"There's a problem that's not being addressed," said the pastor, the Rev. Leonard B. Jackson. "It seems to me that if people can find the church to get food, then the Government agencies that are coming in can find us and do more to help these people."
Evelyn White, a volunteer at an encampment for homeless people set up in South-Central Los Angeles by the Brotherhood Crusade, a black community organization, said: "Every person you see here needs aid, but they needed it before all of this started. That's why all this happened."
Through Wednesday, nearly 15,000 people had visited one of the nine disaster application centers run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is overseeing the process of taking requests for help from victims of the riots and routing them to the appropriate Government agencies.
 
Relatively Few Applications
 The centers offer "one-stop shopping" for people needing almost any kind of assistance, from money for food and clothing to low-interest loans for businesses. But the number of people who have actually completed applications for aid under the programs remains relatively small.
The Small Business Administration, for example, said that although it had passed out 11,000 applications, as of Thursday it had received 528 completed requests for assistance.
As of May 23, 4,876 people had filed claims with the state for unemployment insurance after losing jobs because of the riots. By some estimates, tens of thousands of people lost jobs, at least temporarily, because of the damage to businesses.
"I appreciate how fast the Federal Government has moved, but we need to work harder," said Deputy Mayor Linda Griego. "And they need to work harder to do the outreach and the follow-up to make sure people are getting what they need.
 
More Applications Expected
 Federal officials said they expected the numbers of applications to some programs, especially those for small businesses, to increase sharply in coming weeks. They said that Federal agencies had been working hard to inform the community about the programs by meeting with local groups, answering questions and providing assistance with filling out forms at the application centers.
The city, too, has stepped up its efforts to encourage people to seek help, Ms. Griego said. Concerned that undocumented workers are not applying for aid out of fear that they might be reported to the immigration authorities or the Internal Revenue Service, the city has set up programs with churches and other groups to reassure people that none of the information from relief applications will be used against them.
Federal officials said they were trying to shore up weaknesses in their response. Eleven days ago, after complaints that the Government was not providing food fast enough, the Agriculture Department authorized the purchase of $2 million worth of food to be distributed through food banks to riot victims. The first shipments will reach the food banks this week.
The Agriculture Department also loosened restrictions on providing food stamps, dropping, for example, a rule disqualifying people who own cars.
 
More Money Pledged
 President Bush pledged in the week following the riot that the Federal Government would make available almost $638 million in financial assistance through a variety of existing programs, and perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars more, depending on spending decisions made by Congress. On Friday, he said he had authorized an additional $12 million for job training and public-service jobs.
The amount of Federal money actually disbursed since the riots is relatively small, totaling about $3.2 million as of Thursday. The largest chunk of that, $2.8 million, came from the Small Business Administration for 42 low-interest loans totaling $2.8 million, mostly to owners of small businesses that were looted or burned.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which had received 4,694 applications for emergency housing assistance so far, had processed 299 grants totaling $372,000. Under another program to replace personal possessions, like clothing, appliances and cars, the agency had paid out $43,000 to eight applicants as of Wednesday.
 
'A Great Relief Effort'
 At the Disaster Application Center at the old Ambassador Hotel on the edge of Koreatown, James Baker, his wife, Carolyn, and their 2-month-old son, James Jr., were among the more than 200 people a day who had continued to stream in during the previous week seeking aid.
Mr. Baker said he had not found work since he lost his job as a stock person at a Newberry's discount store when it was burned in the rioting. After spending 45 minutes filling out forms and talking to officials from several government agencies and the Red Cross, he said the process of applying for help had gone very smoothly and that he had been assured he would qualify for food stamps, unemployment insurance and grants to help pay the family's rent temporarily.
"This is a great relief effort," he said. "They have all the agencies you need here to take care of each aspect of your life."

HEADLINE: Jobs Outlook Turns Brighter

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE, May 31

 BODY:
A quarter of the nation's companies plan to hire new workers this summer, painting a rosy employment picture similar to that of 1983, when a solid recovery rescued the country from recession, according to a quarterly hiring survey released today by Manpower Inc.
The prospective gains in employment were the strongest since the aborted recovery of the second half of 1991, and this time pointed to a sustainable economic upturn, said Mitchell Fromstein, the president of the temporary hiring concern based in Milwaukee. 
"It appears that the hiring recovery is sustainable through the balance of the year and should begin to reduce the unemployment rate as we move toward the fall period," he added.
Of the 15,000 companies surveyed, 25 percent said they planned to add staff between July and September. Only 8 percent reported plans to reduce staff.
The figures compared with a survey a year earlier that showed 22 percent of businesses planned to hire staff and 10 percent said they would lay off workers.

HEADLINE: Dinkins's Trip Off to Profitable Start

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, May 31

 BODY:
Taking a break before the serious work of drumming up business in Europe for New York, Mayor David N. Dinkins was making his way today through the bustling Petticoat Lane Market when business came up to him.
As the Mayor bought nine souvenir T-shirts for his two grandchildren, Ian Gordon, the manager of the market, approached him and said he was interested in opening a similar street fair in lower Manhattan. Without missing a beat, Mr. Dinkins waved to his recently appointed Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, Barry F. Sullivan, and shouted: "Barry, we got a customer!" 
 Mr. Dinkins's weeklong European trade mission seemed off to a good start. And, with a deal on the city budget securely in his pocket, Mayor Dinkins arrived emotionally upbeat and politically robust, an optimism that seemed to rub off on the dozen or so of New York's business elite in tow.
The visit to the market is one of about 10 courtesy calls and tour-like appearances Mr. Dinkins will make this week. The flea market was purposely pushed on to the Mayor's crowded schedule by his press aides as part of a strategy to have him seen out among common people rather than flanked by the European business elite, his aides said.
 
Mayors Compare Notes
 The marketplace was a far cry from a quaint English farmers market. The air was filled with the sounds of reggae and American rock-and-roll. Vendors, many of them from Indian or Caribbean families, sold trendy clothing, music, Rastafarian hats and foreign food rather than traditional British goods. So multi-cultural was the scene that it could easily have been in New York.
Besides buying the T-shirts, Mr. Dinkins hugged two babies, talked to dozens of curious Londoners and even ran into a few vacationing New Yorkers who asked him to have their pictures taken with him.
In the afternoon, Mr. Dinkins held a traditional English tea for the Lord Mayor of Westminster, Dr. Cyril Nemeth, at the Churchill Hotel on Portman Square, where the delegation is staying. The two Mayors compared notes on dealing with stubborn trade unions and privatizing certain city agencies.
For the next three days, the Mayor and the business delegation will hold more than 21 meetings with various business leaders in London, Paris, Frankfurt and Hamburg. He will also meet with French and British Government officials and lay a wreath at a Holocaust memorial in Frankfurt.
 
Ill Feelings Evaporating
 Following the advice of Mr. Sullivan, Mr. Dinkins said he would try to attract middle-sized European companies to New York and to cement relations with the 2,500 foreign concerns already rooted in the city.
By heading the delegation, the Mayor also aims to patch up his relations with big business in New York City. Some of the business leaders on the trip have been critical of him, saying that he did not sell the city enough to foreigners and that his fiscal leadership last year was anemic.
Many of those ill feelings appeared to have evaporated today. Several business leaders on the trip said Mr. Dinkins's stock was rising in their eyes because he hammered out a tight budget with the Council and would end this fiscal year with a $560 million surplus, enabling the city to avoid requesting new taxes from the State Legislature.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Forget Peoria. It's Now: 'Will It Play in Tulsa?'

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TULSA, Okla., May 29

 BODY:
Blame it on the musical "Oklahoma!," John Steinbeck's "Grapes of Wrath" and the oil business. The nation's image of Tulsa, complains Rusty Linker of the Metropolitan Tulsa Chamber of Commerce, remains one of amiable cowpokes, oil rigs and parched plains.
It scarcely seems fair. Tulsa, with a population of 367,000, is a tree-lined city with twice the average rainfall of San Francisco. The local economy is more dependent on high-technology services like the computer center that handles reservations for American Airlines than on oil. The only cowboys in town are the dress-up urban variety. 
 And according to an analysis of 1990 census data, Tulsa is the most typical town in America.
 
Ideal for Surveys
 That may not appear to be much of a distinction. Yet Corporate America thinks otherwise. Business looks to the country's most middle-of-the-road cities as ideal test markets for new consumer products.
It can be argued that typical has been devalued, because the growing ethnic and racial diversity of American society means no single city is truly a microcosm of the national market anymore. With America now more a mosaic than a melting pot, the mass market is dead, some say. And, to a degree, that is undoubtedly true.
Still, for all manner of mainstream consumer items -- soft drinks, beer, snack foods, detergents, over-the-counter drugs and others -- the product proving grounds of representative communities remain a vital tool of modern marketing. These days, sophisticated computer models have been developed to predict how shoppers will react to new products.
"But whenever possible, I want to test a product on the shelf," said Dwight Riskey, vice president of new products for Frito-Lay Inc., which tested a new Cheetos cheese-flavored snack in Tulsa before distributing it nationally a year ago.
The big consumer-product companies carry out their test marketing with a grim seriousness, big promotional budgets, the utmost secrecy and even shady tricks like buying a competitor's new product by the cartful just to spoil the test-market results.
"It's high-stakes poker par excellence," said Tom Pirko, president of Bevmark Inc., a Los Angeles-based consultant to the food and beverage industries.
Tulsa came closest of all cities with more than 50,000 people to matching the national averages for age distribution, racial mix and housing prices in a recent study by Donnelley Marketing Information Services for American Demographics magazine. Seventy-nine percent of Tulsa's population is white, 14 percent black, nearly equal to the national figures of 80 percent white and 12 percent black.
"It's very significant that Tulsa keeps popping to the top of the list -- it's moving with the nation," said Judith Waldrop, the research editor of American Demographics, who noted that Tulsa was also most representative in an analysis of 1980 census data. "And struggling to keep up economically, as Tulsa has done, is representative of America."
The city's American Indian population is higher than the national percentages and the Hispanic share somewhat lower. Its median home value, at $60,500, is less than the national median of $79,100. Yet Tulsa's blend of children, young adults, baby boomers, middle-aged adults and elderly, and its age distribution, which is a crucial variable in consumer buying patterns, is almost identical to the nation's.
 
Other Typical Cities
 After Tulsa, the most typical American cities are Charleston, W. Va.; Midland, Tex., and Springfield, Ill. Wichita, Kan., Indianapolis and Oklahoma City also ranked in the top 10 by Donnelley's calculations. But some of Corporate America's traditional test markets -- Peoria, Ill.; Fort Wayne, Ind.; Green Bay, Wis., and Syracuse -- are no longer as representative as they once were.
Throughout the postwar years, companies have scouted for typical towns as proving grounds. The traditional technique was to get the national census data each decade and select places that seemed typical -- often medium-sized cities in the Midwest. Then, if local polling data pretty much matched the most recent national averages, the city was decreed representative and companies began assaulting local residents with new products.
That technique was humorously portrayed in the 1947 movie "Magic Town," in which Jimmy Stewart plays a polltaker who declares a Midwest town the "mathematical miracle" of the United States. The resulting national attention ruins the place, at least before Mr. Stewart's character sees the error of his ways, repents and, in the best Hollywood tradition, gets the girl (Jane Wyman).
That single-handed approach has been overtaken by a cottage industry of demographic analysts, who, armed with computer firepower and new techniques, are culling, prodding and massaging the 1990 census data. Eventually, they will be able to provide marketers with demographic profiles and household characteristics, from commuting times to plumbing fixtures, on a block-by-block basis. And that will enable companies to aim at prospective customers with laser-like precision by mail or telephone.
 
Comprehensive Ranking
 For clues on promising test markets, the American Demographics/ Donnelley study is apparently the most comprehensive ranking of places ever done. For comparison, American Demographics also published a list of typical cities in 1985, using less exacting criteria and working from 1980 census data. Most of the top 20 from that ranking have dropped off the list, reflecting population migrations or economic swings, or have stayed the same while the nation became more diverse.
That Tulsa ranked No. 1 in both surveys is a surprise, given the wrenching economic adjustment it went through in the 1980's. Tulsa lost half its employment in the oil industry during the decade, but adapted by investing in education and economic development. It eventually more than made up for the lost oil jobs by attracting companies in the fields of transportation, communications and services.
And in the last decade, Tulsa has become more diverse racially and ethnically, but not at the rapid pace seen in major coastal cities like Miami, Los Angeles or New York.
Yet as a test market, Tulsa still suffers from its cow-town image.
"Tulsa has not been a real hot spot for test marketing," said Barry Sinrod, president of the Sinrod International Marketing Group, a consultant in Boca Raton, Fla. "How many people want to go to Tulsa?"
When Wendy Liebmann, president of WSL Marketing, a consultant in New York, selected Tulsa for a 1990 study of trends in mass-market retail distribution, some marketing experts "told us we were crazy for going to an oil town that was very Southwest ethnic and parochial," she said.
Rick Bahlinger, president of Golden Eagle Distributing, which markets the beers of the Anheuser-Busch Companies in the Tulsa area, noted that the brewer had just finished a two-year test of Busch Cold-Filtered Draft here. But he acknowledged that Tulsa was not one of the company's favorite test markets.
"Tulsa is middle America to the max," he said. "But people haven't really discovered it yet."
But that is starting to change, said Roberta Cunningham, president of Cunningham Field Service Ltd., a Tulsa company that does the legwork for consumer goods companies, surveying how buyers react to test-marketed products. The family company has six offices nationally, but its Tulsa office has doubled its business in the last year, doubling its staff to 36 employees.
Once marketers get beyond the cow-town-and-tumbleweeds image of Tulsa, Mrs. Cunningham said, they find a representative market where shoppers are willing guinea pigs. The refusal rate, people declining to cooperate with telephone or face-to-face surveys, in Tulsa is far below the national averages, and scheduled 15-minute surveys tend to go on longer as Tulsans digress to talk about their children, gardens, cars or whatever.
 
Generic Styles
 Walking through Tulsa's malls, shopping strips and downtown, the faces, the styles and the goods for sale may vary. Most people under 50 seem to be dressed in the moderately priced, generically stylish garb pioneered by the Gap and mimicked by mass-market department stores like J. C. Penney and Sears. Every discount store seems to be trying to copy the Wal-Mart formula of clean, well-stocked outlets with a scattering of service people trying to act friendly.
Doug White, general manager of the big J. C. Penney store in the Woodland Hills Mall, says he is stocking fewer $350 men's suits and $300 women's suits, the high-priced range at Penney, than he did a few years ago.
"We've moved with the market to sell more of the lower price-points now," Mr. White said. "That's what Middle America wants now."
Mark Hunter, general manager of the Woodland Hills Mall, the largest in Oklahoma, where 15 million customers spend more than $200 million a year, agrees: "Customers aren't as driven by names and brands as they were a couple of years ago. They are still spending, but they are doing it more conservatively."
But there are quirky surprises in the spending habits of this typically American city. In the Woodland Hills Mall, for example, the runaway success of the last few years is Glamour Shots, a store where women spend $150 or so for a cosmetic makeover and a cover-girl-style photo session. There is always a line of women waiting to get in.
The appeal of Glamour Shots, apparently, is that it is a few hours of fantasy, a breakaway from the ordinary. "Every woman wants to be a cover girl," said Julie McCarthy, the manager.

HEADLINE: BASKETBALL;
Stage Has Been Set For Drexler's Rise

BYLINE: By MICHAEL MARTINEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore.

 BODY:
This could be Clyde Drexler's finest moment, a time in his life when everything evolves in slow motion, where he is the central character in a play that unfolds in seven parts, right there on national television, in prime time, in front of Michael Jordan.
It could be. But it probably won't. 
 Drexler wants none of it. None of the national news media attention, none of the public praise, none of the inevitable comparisons with Jordan. What he wants is a championship.
Drexler will accompany the Portland Trail Blazers into this week's National Basketball Association finals against Jordan and the Chicago Bulls with a riveting six-game victory over the Utah Jazz behind them. He was, simply, serenity in motion.
The Blazers are this far into the season because of their remarkable talent, but also because of Drexler's inspiring contributions. Even so, he is more likely to deflect the spotlight than to embrace it. And although a league title is the one thing that separates him from his contemporaries -- from Jordan and Magic Johnson and Larry Bird and Isiah Thomas -- it is something he wants for his teammates as much as for himself.
"You need to have a great team to win," he says, repeating his own theme. "There have been some very great players in the N.B.A. who haven't won. In basketball, unlike golf and tennis, you have to rely on other people. You can't say that guys like Charles Barkley or Hakeem Olajuwon or David Robinson aren't super players.
"Before Michael won, did anyone doubt that he was a super player?"
There remain few doubters regarding Drexler, but the defining moment of a player's career has always been a championship. And Drexler has always fallen short. At the University of Houston, he reached the Final Four twice but never won. Two years ago, the Blazers got to the finals before losing to Thomas and the Detroit Pistons.
And while Drexler's professional career has been full of personal achievement, singular recognition has typically escaped him.
He played 28 spectacular minutes in last February's All-Star Game, but it was Johnson who was named the day's best player, fittingly so. He enjoyed a season of great individual triumph, but it was Jordan who won the league's most valuable player award, and by a sizable margin. He is widely regarded as the game's second-best performer, yet it wasn't until recently, eight months after the first 10 players were selected, that he was added to the United States Olympic team.
Drexler, who will turn 30 years old on June 22, is still reaching for the thing that will elevate him. He does not acknowledge it -- in fact, he denies it emphatically -- but others understand its importance.
"As far as being compared to those great players," said Terry Porter, a teammate, "they've all won at least one championship. I think Clyde needs it to be considered with them. I don't think it would affect him so much, but it would help him get the recognition he deserves."
Even so, it is not necessarily a recognition that Drexler courts. When praise is passed around, he accepts only small portions. Privately, he has said that he dreads the unavoidable parallels that will be drawn between him and Jordan during the coming series, preferring to merely blend in as part of the team.
But they will be there, like it or not.
"That's great and dandy," he said. "I think it's an honor to be compared to Michael, but the real satisfaction comes in seeing how well your team does. For me, that's the ultimate."
Is a comparison fair? Perhaps not. Jordan walks on air; Drexler soars to the basket as if he were riding on a hang glider. Jordan dunks with a sudden and dramatic resolve; Drexler lays the ball into the basket gently, the ball rolling off his fingertips. Every step is an economy of movement.
Same results, but not necessarily with the same elan.
"If there is anyone in this game who comes close to Michael in terms of talent, it's Clyde Drexler," said Bulls Coach Phil Jackson. "Basketball aficionados think his game is absoltely terrific."
Statistically, Drexler is a near copy of Jordan. He averaged 25 points a game during the regular season -- the sixth consecutive season he was over 20 -- plus 6.6 rebounds and 6.7 assists. He finished fourth in the league in scoring, made the All-Star team for the sixth season in a row and was the only player in the league to lead his team in scoring and assists.
But while Jordan was anointed the league's newest superstar upon his arrival, Drexler's climb was slow and deliberate.
"Like all great players, Clyde's gotten better every year," said Geoff Petrie, a former Blazer player and now the team's senior vice president of operations. "A great example of that is that we asked more of him this year, putting him in the low post, which was not something we had in our offense a year ago. Now, he has become a very effective, creative low-post player.
"It was also the maturation and experience that you get just being in the league. Even the great players have their best years between 28 and 32, because that's when the intellectual side -- the understanding of how the game is played -- combines with physical talent. That's the closest thing to a whole package that you're going to get. Clyde was always a great player. He's greater now."
But the universal respect that Drexler receives now wasn't always apparent. Early in his career, he bickered with former coaches Jack Ramsay and Mike Schuler, and when Schuler was fired three seasons ago, Drexler took the heat.
 
'Somebody Had to Be Blamed'
 "Somebody had to be blamed," said Petrie. "There was a lot of disappointment because, at that point, we thought we had arrived as a team. But that reputation hasn't stood the test of time. A lot of people who said negative things about him have now recanted them."
Buck Williams, a teammate who joined the Blazers in 1989, said of Drexler: "I used to think he was selfish. I thought he was responsible for getting Coach Schuler fired. But once I got here, I found out that it wasn't true. He's been misread tremendously."
There was also Drexler's supposed penchant for wanting the ball, then for refusing to share it. Not so.
"I thought he was a ball hog," Williams said. "I realized he's a fine passer, very unselfish. If you watch him from a distance, you see that. He's a very nice person."
Drexler was nice, but displeased, when he was overlooked for the United States Olympic team that will compete in Barcelona, Spain, this summer. When he was finally named, he caused a brief stir by suggesting that a gold medal might be worth more to him than a league title. In these parts, it was blasphemy.
He has his priorities straight now.
"It was never a controversy with me," he said. "Right now, winning the N.B.A. championship is much more important. The Olympics is down the line, and that's going to be a nice event. I'm looking forward to it, but this is the most important thing right now."
And so it is. But when the finals begin Wednesday in Chicago, Drexler will likely find himself facing two opponents: the Bulls and the specter of a larger-than-life Jordan.
"When I hear people compare me to Michael Jordan," he said not long ago, "it's the highest compliment. I'm always honored. But I don't compete against Michael. I do what I can do for Portland. That's what matters."
He knows, though, that each move will be compared with Jordan. That winning, as Jordan did last season, may remove all doubt about his gifts and his leadership. That if the Blazers do win, fans will speak of Michael and Magic and Larry and Clyde in the same breath.
"Larry and Magic, to me, are the best I ever played with and against," said Danny Ainge, the former Boston Celtic and current Blazer. "I think Clyde is getting close to that level. But sometimes it's unfair to evaluate them because those guys had better supporting casts. Larry has played with some great players, like Kevin McHale, and Magic had Kareem all those years.
"Clyde does more than Bird -- he shoots the 3-pointer, he rebounds, he runs the fast break, he blocks shots and makes steals -- but that doesn't mean he's better."
Would a championship make him better? Perhaps, in the eyes of some.
"I don't think Clyde has to prove anything to anyone who's ever seen him play," said Ainge. "If he had Kareem and James Worthy on his team, he'd have a championship ring by now."

HEADLINE: Fiscal Insanity Amendment

 BODY:
Gargantuan deficits threaten economic growth. So Congress wants to approve a constitutional amendment mandating a balanced budget. Problem solved? No, problem worsened. By basing rules on ill-conceived accounting concepts, the amendment would tilt the Federal budget in precisely the wrong direction: away from long-term investment and economic growth.
There are other reasons to reject this reckless amendment. It would invite cynical evasion and, by forcing spending cuts and tax hikes when revenues fall off, accelerate recessions. But the fatal flaw lies at its core: Not all deficits are bad; cutting them can sometimes do unspeakable harm. 
 When the Government runs a deficit, it pays bills by borrowing money that entrepreneurs might have used to create new plant and equipment. The danger is that the economy would be left with less productive capital, a key to economic growth.
But when the Government borrows to create public capital -- fiber-optic cables, mass-transit systems, research facilities -- it does the economy enormous good.
The amendment would require cutting the deficit by a daunting $550 billion or $600 billion over five years. More than $100 billion would probably come from non-defense discretionary programs, including investments in education, training and scientific research. Those cuts would amount to death knells for the economy.
By lumping public consumption with public investment, and requiring everything to be paid out of current revenue, the amendment would steer Congress toward consumption and away from investment. Spending tens of millions on farm subsidies would become irresistible when stacked up against spending tens of billions on fiber-optic cables. Which do you suppose helps America more: 21st-century investments or paying farmers not to work?
Prof. Robert Eisner, past president of the American Economic Association, points out other ways the amendment overlooks basic accounting. Inflation erodes the value -- in 1991, by $80 billion -- of the Government's outstanding debt. That means the Treasury could borrow $80 billion without raising total debt one iota. And debt poses little threat unless its growth outstrips growth of the economy; by that token, the U.S. could run $200 billion deficits with impunity.
But even after taking proper account of public investment, inflation and growth, the proponents of the amendment are right in one important respect. By the end of the decade, deficits are expected to soar above $400 billion, high enough to threaten private capital formation.
The problem is overwhelmingly due to explosive growth of entitlements, specifically Medicaid and Medicare. The straightforward solution is health-care reform that clamps medical costs. There will be need to prune consumption-oriented discretionary programs and, yes, to raise taxes. But there won't be need for a mindless constitutional straitjacket.

HEADLINE: Graduates Feel Anxious, Not Just About Jobs;
Women's Pay Gain

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Is it that news has become by definition bad news, or is your reporting simply a vestige of the male-dominated era? Your front-page story on May 14, "Pay of College Graduates Is Outpaced by Inflation," makes no reference to what leaps out in the accompanying chart: that only male college graduates lost income.
Women college graduates gained as did women at nearly every other education level. Thus, the claim that "most Americans" lost income between 1989 and 1991 really means "most men." 
 All in all, the chart (but not the story) shows that women's earnings increased dramatically compared with men's. On average, men's earnings fell by 7.2 percent between 1979 and 1991, while women's rose by 7.8 percent. Surely a 15-point reduction in the "gender gap" deserves some comment.

HEADLINE: Post Sanctions, Invest Wisely in Pretoria

 BODY:
To the Editor:
While New York's Mayor David N. Dinkins is considering "what sanctions to lift" from South Africa (news article, May 14), the rest of us who supported the sanctions movement of the 80's should be asking American corporations to be similarly selective in which types of business they should be willing to resume in that country.
In conversations with leaders of the African National Congress in Cape Town in March, it was plain to me that in due time they too want sanctions lifted, but lifted under a policy that encourages foreign investment in the priority needs of the new South Africa: housing, health, education, land reform. 
 Already the United States Government is practicing modest selective aid in relation to such needs. "But we won't stand by idly and permit capitalists to move back into South Africa as predators," said one A.N.C. leader. "We intend to keep our fingers on their pulse, and we won't give very high priority to diamond mining."
Corporations like a free hand in making their investments. Those of us who supported the sanctions movement in the 80's should be consistent enough to continue to say to American government and business: "Profit, yes, but humane priorities too." Come to think of it, not a bad rule for their investments in our own country.

HEADLINE: Europe Sees Oil Tax as a Way to Dampen Demand

BYLINE: By MARLISE SIMONS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, May 31

 BODY:
As Europe's environmental debate moves swiftly from science to economics, the richest governments are turning to the market place as they grapple with the difficult question: what price the environment?
Their most ambitious attempt at an answer so far came this month when the European Community proposed a plan to fight pollution and global warming by imposing an energy tax on oil, coal, natural gas and other non-renewable forms of energy harmful to the environment. The extra cost is expected to discourage use of such fuels; the revenues would be used to help protect the environment. 
 By proposing the tax on the eve of the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro this week, the Europeans have signaled their view that more drastic measures are needed to limit demand for carbon-based fuels.
Although they have not yet made a final decision on the energy tax, the 12 community governments want to use their proposal to seize the moral high ground at the summit, taking advantage of the low profile of Washington.
 
Opposition to Energy Tax
 But already the plan has drawn opposition from the United States and major Mideast oil producers -- the United States because Washington resents pressure to adopt similar measures and the oil producers because they fear a drop in demand for oil.
The Bush Administration's fear that environmental measures will stifle economic growth was evident when it managed to delete firm commitments and timetables to curb emissions of gases that could cause global warming from a pact that is to be signed in Rio.
But European governments are expected to argue that energy taxes must be part of any strategy to fight global warming and that the price of all goods and services must reflect their cost to the environment.
Public concern over environmental issues continues to rise in Europe's crowded quarters. If the European plan is approved at home, as many people here expect it will be, the plan's supporters hope that higher energy prices will change the consumption patterns of the region's industry and its 340 million inhabitants and make them save energy. Another goal is to tilt the market toward energy sources like wind, sun and waves and stimulate the development of more efficient technology.
The heart of the plan is to use market mechanisms to fight pollution, not administrative measures like standards and regulations. The idea is to start the levy next year at $3 a barrel of oil or oil equivalent, reaching $10 by 2000. (A barrel holds 55 gallons.)
"Our plan will give a decisive boost to the new thinking that international environmental solutions must be found via the market," said Carlo Ripa di Meana, the community's Commissioner for the Environment, a strong advocate of the plan. "In that sense the scope of this plan is revolutionary."
The European Community Executive Commission has adopted the plan, making it in effect a draft law that will be presented for approval by the 12 members and by the European Parliament. The plan conditions European application of the taxes to application by other nations, including the United States and Japan, but leaves the door open to proceed even if this does not happen. Washington objects to this attempt to link United States policy to European policy.
 
Anger at Europe
 In the days before the plan was announced, Mr. Ripa de Meana said in a recent interview, United States diplomats complained that the condition would make the European Community look good at the Earth Summit while "embarrassing" Washington.
"We have let the Community know that whatever it does, we have no intention of imposing an energy tax for a period of time," said an United States diplomat in Brussels.
Major Middle East oil producers have been outspoken in denouncing the plan as an unfriendly act and have threatened trade sanctions. Their complaints dominated a recent meeting in Kuwait of Persian Gulf states and European Community ministers.
Oman and other oil exporters have since suggested raising crude oil prices by $3 a barrel, in effect to reap the tax benefits for themselves.
The sharpest criticism has come from the Saudi oil minister, Hisham Nazir, who told Community foreign ministers that the energy tax was "yet another form of excise tax to raise government receipts." The 12 community governments earned $210 billion from oil taxes last year, more than three times the value of their oil imports, he said.
 
Europeans Divided
 The executive commission in Brussels is recommending that the income from energy taxes be used for incentives to protect the environment. It also notes that the levy will weigh most on the dirtiest fuels, the coal and lignite that are still widely used in Europe.
In Northern Europe, governments are already starting to impose energy taxes, and economists there are also deeply involved in the complicated process of recalculating the prices of many goods and services to reflect environmental costs.
The 12 governments who must approve the tax are divided.
The Germans, who lead the drive in favor of the tax, are strongly supported by the Danes and the Dutch. Most opposed are Spain, Greece and Portugal, which have shown little interest in environment issues and worry about their growth. Spain, the most militant opponent, fears adverse effects on its ailing coal industry.
Reactions by industrial and trade lobbies have been mixed.
Many argue that environmental taxes will put them at a competitive disadvantage. Last year, when the Netherlands said it would impose energy taxes regardless of Community action, seven large corporations threatened to take their business elsewhere.
In Germany, the Federation of German Industries has said it is against taxes in just one or a few countries, but will go along if applied throughout the European Community.
In their analyses and forecasts, European industries increasingly uphold the example of Japan, which has among the highest energy prices but is also the world's most energy-efficient nation. And Japan, they note, is already rushing to turn environmental technology into a boom industry.
But in the short run, the question of competitiveness haunts European industries. To soften the blow, Brussels proposes selective exemptions for the biggest energy consumers, like glass, aluminum and paper industries, provided they implement their own plans to curb energy use and emissions.
 
The Practical Effects
 The plan could widen the gap between American and European energy prices and possibly pollution levels. The community, with 340 million inhabitants, accounts for 13 percent of global carbon dioxide; the United States, with 240 million people accounts for close to 23 percent. Gasoline prices in Europe are already three to four times higher than in the United States.
Brussels experts reckon that the plan would most affect utilities and industries because it would push up the price of natural gas by one-third and of coal by almost 60 percent. It would add 6 percent to gasoline prices at the pump and 11 percent to prices of diesel oil. Home electricity bills would rise by almost 13 percent.
Other measures in the plan include energy-saving standards for cars, appliances, factories, homes and offices. The executive commission in Brussels has also announced new backing for research on other energy sources and said it hoped to raise such sources from 4 percent to 8 percent in the 12 years.

HEADLINE: Board Room Back-Scratching?

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
At first glance, the latest proxy statement from the B. F. Goodrich Company sounds all the right notes in the executive pay debate. It details for the first time how the company links pay and performance and boasts that executive pay is reviewed by a board committee that "consists entirely of outside directors."
What the proxy does not spotlight is that until a year ago one of the outside directors who helped set the pay for Goodrich's chief executive, John D. Ong, was Joseph A. Pichler, the chief executive of the Kroger Company - whose compensation committee included Mr. Ong as an outside director. Thus, Mr. Pichler's $890,370 pay for 1991 was partly determined by a man whose own $905,113 pay Mr. Pichler helped set.
Such interlocking arrangements, which are difficult to detect from public documents, do not in themselves constitute impropriety. Indeed, Mr. Ong's 1991 pay dropped by about a million dollars from 1990. 
Yet in a year when politicians, investors and even the Japanese are pointing to executive pay as a symbol of corporate America's ills, the potential for conflicts is being singled out by some shareholder activists and others as evidence that some board rooms are closed societies where friends often decide sensitive issues among themselves.
"That's the worst sort of potential conflict of interest, when you're serving on each other's jury to determine compensation," said Thomas J. Neff. President of Spencer Stuart, an executive search firm that conducts about 50 director searches a year in the United States. "There's the temptation and the risk of not being objective."
A recent computer search of the proxy statements of the 788 largest public companies by Directorship, a Westport, Conn., consulting firm, disclosed 39 instances, or nearly 5 percent, where heads of companies sit on each other's boards. Five of those couplings have unusual influence over each other's pay since they also sit on each other's compensation committees.
Besides Goodrich and Kroger, they are Conagra Inc. and Valmont Industries; the Kellogg Company and the Upjohn Company; the Sonoco Products Company and the Nationsbank Corporation, and Allergan Inc. and Beckman Instruments Inc.
It is only in the last few years that computers have been enlisted to help analyze the minutiae contained in corporate documents that disclose executive pay. But sociologists, business historians and others who have studied the issue believe that the incidence of interlocking directorships has remained fairly constant since the early part of the century, when the fear was collusion.
Catapulting the issue back into the spotlight today is the public's concern over the spectacle of an already well-paid corporate elite more preoccupied with their pay packages than corporate performance. Now, there is growing apprehension that those charged with policing pay are not always independent.
The mere presence of interlocking directors does not automatically raise improprieties. Indeed senior executives at 3 of the 10 companies in question including Goodrich saw their total compensation tumble in 1991, while the others for the most part took home pay packages that were roughly clustered around the $2 million or so that the average chief executive earned in those years. But the abundance of interlocking directorships may be symptomatic of some of the deeper problems in the board room.
Not surprisingly, 5 of the 10 companies with interlocking compensation committee members include other members whose independence could be questioned. For instance, 4 of the 10 companies have executives on their compensation committees whose business dealings with the company are extensive enough that they have to be disclosed in the proxy statements. Relatives on Committee
Sonoco Products, a packaging concern based in Hartsville, S.C., describes the members of its compensation committees as nonemployees of the company. Nonetheless, it has one executive on its compensation committee who once worked for the company and another whose objectivity could very well be tested: He is F .L. H. Coker, brother of the chief executive, C. W. Coker.
The company does show some restraint. Also on its board, though not on its compensation committee, is a third Coker, J. L., the chief executive's cousin, and a fourth director, J. C. Fort, whom a company spokesman described as a distant relative of Mr. Coker, though that fact is omitted from the proxy. A Coker family ancestor founded the company, although none of the four descendants on the board individually own more than 2 percent of the company's stock.
And indeed, the precise makeup of the committee may be moot. According to the proxy, the committee annually "reviews the salaries of executive officers and recommends increases as deemed appropriate." The possibility of salary decreases is never broached.
"Last year was just about the second time in over 20 years when our earnings from continuing operations didn't better the previous year," said Richard Puffer, Sonoco's spokesman. "So, we normally do have increases."
Asked about the propriety of these symbiotic relationships, the 10 companies insisted that such people should be counted as outside directors so long as they were not currently on the payroll.
Even Goodrich and Kroger, which took Mr. Ong and Mr. Pichler off each other's compensation committees last year, defended the arrangement while it lasted and explained the moves as nothing more than the normal rotation of committee assignments. "The important thing to focus on is whether the company's compensation program is performance-based, and ours is," said Gary Habegger, Goodrich's vice president for human resources. "If it is, you have much less chance for that type of situation to be a real issue."
Two companies, Nationsbank and Valmont, do not contend that their compensation committees consist exclusively of outsiders. After all, Nationsbank's chief executive, Hugh L. McColl Jr., serves on his company's compensation committee and Valmont's chairman and biggest shareholder, Robert B. Daugherty, sits on his company's committee.
Spokesmen for both companies point out that neither man is chairman of his respective committee and that they abstain whenever their own pay is discussed. "If they were the sole members of the compensation committee, you'd have a point," said Brian Stanley, the treasurer of Valmont, a metal fabricator outside Omaha. "But when we have six people, it's just not an issue."
Most companies are free to put anyone they please on their compensation committee -- since there is no Federal requirement to even form a committee. "If you do your compensation by throwing darts against the wall, as long as you disclose it, you've fulfilled your duties," said John D. Heine, a spokesman for the Securities and Exchange Commission.
That regulatory attitude may be one reason why 75, or 9.5 percent, of the 788 companies in the Directorship study report that their chairmen serve on the panels that decide their pay. Even people who are very much part of the business establishment say that such committee configurations create unfortunate appearance problems. Indeed, the Business Roundtable, a group of the leaders of several major companies, recommended as much as two years ago that compensation committees should "limit membership to nonmanagement directors only."
Not doing that "opens you up for a lot of difficult scrutiny," said Thomas F. Madison, the president of markets for U S West Communications and a director who serves on several compensation committees, including Valmont's. Though he said he ordinarily would not tolerate having the chief executive on the compensation committee, he said Valmont was a special case since Mr. Daugherty dropped the chief executive's title in 1988 and drew relatively little compensation from the company.
Since chief executives have exactly the sort of experience that other bosses value, many shareholders say they would tolerate having a few chief executives in the mix.
But how tough might a watchdog be when the object of surveillance can always retaliate? "It would just be very difficult for the type of independence that is required of a board member to exist in that kind of environment," said Ralph V. Whitworth, president of the United Shareholders Association.
Further skewing how much chief executives take home on average is the tendency of many companies to deliberately set pay above their industry average to prevent defections. "That process of peer adustment is a problem to me as an economist because I see what it does to the average," said M. Kathryn Eickhoff, an economist who serves on the boards of five large public companies, including Upjohn.
The other culprit, in her view, is not interlocking directorships like the one that exists between Upjohn and Kellogg but simply the sheer number of chief executives who serve on compensation committees.
"I wonder whether it is too easy for them to rationalize the salaries being suggested," she said. "It seems to me it's easier to find such salaries acceptable if you've previously received one." Regional Patterns Seen
Another common pattern is that interlocking directors tend to be part of tight regional clusters, such as Conagra and Valmont, both Nebraska companies. "We're a fairly small town and we don't have many public companies that would be called industrials, so there's not a great variety of locals to draw from," said Charles M. Harper, chief executive of Conagra and a member of the compensation committee of Valmont.
Personally, he does not see anything wrong with looking close to home for directorial talent. "If I trusted somebody, I don't care if they were a second cousin to the c.e.o.," said Mr. Harper, who predicts that his own fiscal year 1992 compensation will be down significantly, as he believes it should, given this year's performance. "The way to test that from a shareholder's point of view is what are the results, and how does compensation track with results?"

HEADLINE: PENTAGON ANALYST QUESTIONS TIMING FOR MISSILE SHIELD

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
The Pentagon's top program analyst says a $35 billion plan to protect the nation from nuclear attack with land-based interceptors calls for a hasty deployment that could create costly and crippling problems.
The criticism of the "Star Wars" plan, the sharpest to date by a senior Defense Department official, might fray or break a coalition on Capitol Hill that last year endorsed the building of limited missile defenses after the antimissile battles of the Persian Gulf war. 
 The official, Dr. David S. C. Chu, Assistant Secretary of Defense for program analysis and evaluation, says in an internal Pentagon document that the plan risks failure by rushing the development of rocket-powered interceptors and skipping important performance tests. That, he wrote, could hide defects that would cripple the system or lead to costly repairs.
 
Six-Year Delay Possible
 In his analysis Dr. Chu said the plan should be overhauled to delay the system's debut by as much as six years, from 1997 to the year 2003, so that prototype arms and other antimissile apparatus could be thoroughly tested, and modified if necessary, before being put into mass production.
Rejecting such criticism, the plan's architects say they remain confident that an initial system can be fielded by 1997. But they concede that the goal of speedy deployment with abbreviated testing carries many risks.
"The issue is whether you can manage that risk in a responsible way," Dr. Henry F. Cooper, director of the antimissile effort, said in an interview on Friday. "I think that's achievable," with the result that a missile defense system could be put in place without significant cost overruns, schedule slips or technical flaws.
But John E. Pike, director of space policy at the Federation of American Scientists, a private group in Washington, said Dr. Chu's analysis suggested that no credible defense against nuclear attack could be built in less than a decade.
"It's saying that any system deployed in this century isn't going to work, that the current plan is a procurement disaster in the making," Mr. Pike said. Leaders of the antimissile effort, he added, "basically want to decide what to build before they test it, and hope they guessed right."
Dr. Chu's analysis was made available to a reporter by an analyst who views the antimissile plan as flawed and who wanted to call attention to high-level Pentagon doubts about it.
The disputed plan is the main legacy of the "Star Wars" program, begun nearly a decade ago by President Ronald Reagan to build a space- and land-based defense against a missile attack. With the end of the cold war, the general goal of the "Star Wars" program has shifted, from one that would have created an impenetrable shield against thousands of Soviet warheads to forging a defense against accidental launchings and attacks by rogue commanders and renegade nations.
 
$4.15 Billion This Year
 The program's cost this year is $4.15 billion, a record high. Annual costs are expected to double as research gives way to production of batteries of interceptors. The plan for land-based interceptors is the only part of the initiative to be endorsed by Congress, which is bitterly divided over the merits of arms based in space.
The current deployment plan was proposed last year by Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who heads the Senate Armed Services Committee. Inspired by the Patriot interceptor in the Persian Gulf war, he successfully pushed Congress to approve the building of similar but larger land-based interceptors to defend the nation, if possible by 1996.
The Missile Defense Act was signed into law by President Bush in December. Dr. Cooper of the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization, which runs the antimissile research program, recently testified before Congress about how the agency would meet the act's requirements.
Its plan would delay the launching of space arms but would have one land-based battery of interceptors ready in 1997. The battery site would have 100 interceptors housed in underground silos, ready to blast into space.
More complete protection of the United States from a variety of threats would require seven sites across the country with some 700 interceptors in all, agency officials say. They put the cost at $35 billion.
The rocket-powered interceptors would have non-nuclear warheads that use advanced sensors to pinpoint a target, which would then be destroyed on impact with the warhead.
The challenge in developing such a system was illustrated on March 13 when an experimental interceptor called Eris blasted off from Kwajalein atoll in the Western Pacific but, because of technical errors, failed to hit a mock warhead in space. Eris is the general prototype for the proposed system of land-based interceptors.
The deployment plan recently came under the scrutiny of Dr. Chu, who in essence is the Pentagon's technical conscience, studying arms programs to make them more efficient as they move from research to production. He reports to the Secretary of Defense, and draws on a force of about 100 analysts.
Dr. Chu, a Yale-educated economist, has directed program analysis and evaluation since 1981 and has a reputation for rigor. In the early 1980's he insisted that the Army subject its division air defense gun, or Divad, to strenuous field tests that it ultimately failed; in 1985 the $1.8 billion program was canceled.
 
Plan Called Too Risky
 Writing on May 15 to Donald J. Yockey, Under Secretary of Defense for acquisition, Dr. Chu warned that the $35 billion plan for interceptor deployment was too risky and "almost certain to suffer early, significant cost growth and schedule slippage" because little of the initial apparatus would be tested thoroughly before manufacturing. The emerging system, he wrote, thus might have to undergo extensive repairs and revisions.
Worse, Dr. Chu wrote, the plan could produce interceptors and other antimissile hardware that were "technologically inferior" and unable to adequately defend the nation.
In addition, he wrote, speeding the program to achieve the 1997 deployment date would require exemption from more than a dozen laws and directives that govern the purchase of military equipment.
Dr. Chu recommended an alternative plan in which prototype hardware would be subjected to "a rigorous test program" and its experimental data used to forge final designs, pushing back the date of initial antimissile deployments to the years 2002 or 2003.
While private experts and some members of Congress have recently expressed alarm over possible technical risks and cost overruns in the proposed land-based system, this is believed to be the first time such criticisms have been leveled by a senior Pentagon official.
 
Both Cautious and Confident
 Five days after Dr. Chu's analysis was sent to Under Secretary Yockey, Dr. Cooper, the head of the antimissile program, summarized the plan before Congress in testimony that was alternately cautious and confident.
"Meeting the 1997 date represents a major challenge," Dr. Cooper said May 20 in a statement to a subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee. But he added, "I believe the risk, although high, is acceptable given the urgency related to our uncertainty in predicting when we might actually be threatened with ballistic missile attack."
He said he would press for "an acceleration of the normal acquisition processes and procedures in light of the very high priority assigned by the Congress to meeting the goals" of the Missile Defense Act.
In the interview on Friday, Dr. Cooper said past arms programs had succeeded even though their testing and production had been accelerated, pointing to the Pershing II missile as an example.
But Mr. Pike of the Federation of American Scientists said a successful quickening of the antimissile program was highly unlikely, given its past difficulties. "Most tests," he said, "have been behind schedule and failed or had major shortcomings."

HEADLINE: Bush, Trying to Counter Criticism, Offers Plan to Save Earth's Forests

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GREENBELT, Md., June 1

 BODY:
Seeking to counter foreign and domestic criticism of his environmental record, President Bush presented a new program today to conserve the world's dwindling forests, a crucial issue at this month's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.
Standing at a NASA research center before a huge blue photograph of the earth taken from space, Mr. Bush said the White House would increase its aid to other nations' forestry programs by $150 million, to $270 million, starting in the fiscal year that begins in October. 
 He also challenged other nations to double spending on forest conservation to $2.7 billion annually, to halt the worldwide loss of trees.
Today's actions, details of which had been circulated over the weekend, were described by Mr. Bush as part of a commitment to improve the quality of the environment without affecting economic growth.
But they were also clearly aimed at critics who have charged the White House with trying to weaken domestic environmental laws and sabotaging the goals of the Earth Summit by withholding support for forceful language in proposed treaties.
As delegates to the summit meeting began to gather in Rio de Janeiro today, the Brazilian press painted the Bush Administration as an environmental villain. [Page A10.]
As recently as Sunday, Mr. Bush was calling such critics "extremists" and saying he would not rely on "unsound science" to make basic decisions about global warming and other environmental issues.
"I came to this office committed to extend America's record of environmental leadership and I've worked to do so in a way that is compatible with economic growth," Mr. Bush said today, "because this balance is absolutely essential, and because these are twin goals, not mutually exclusive objectives."
Mr. Bush's words reflected a continuing struggle at the top of his Administration over environmental politics. On one side are his most conservative advisers, who view most environmental rules as a drag on the economy and want to appeal to business and industry executives. On the other side are some senior political advisers who are wary of alienating a large environmentalist constituency in the middle of Mr. Bush's re-election campaign.
In his speech today, Mr. Bush also announced three other measures to combat the warming of the earth's atmosphere:
*He pledged to establish a Technology Cooperation Corps of United States business experts to survey the environmental needs of developing nations and to find ways to introduce new pollution-control technologies.
*He offered to help pay for studies of developing nations to determine what policy changes would make it easier to cut emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
*He promised to distribute thousands of computer discs at Rio with scientific data from United States studies of global warming. Data from satellite studies by NASA of the Earth's climate will be offered soon to scientists and governments worldwide to support new research into changes in climate, he said.
 
Urged Less Strict Controls
 Last month, Mr. Bush successfully wielded a threat to boycott the Earth Summit to win concessions from most of the world's nations on a global warming treaty, eliminating language that would have required the United States to cap its emissions of carbon dioxide by 2000 at 1990 levels. The treaty now calls for "action plans" to reduce emissions of gases that are thought to promote global warming, but does not mandate reductions.
The Administration's plan leaves open the prospect of capping all the greenhouse gases at 1990 levels, but suggests that United States emissions of carbon dioxide, by far the most threatening of the gases, will rise by about 6 percent.
Only last week, the Administration announced that it would not sign the other major treaty at the Rio meeting, which calls for new measures to slow the extinction of plants and animals. The State Department said the Administration objected to language decreeing how preservation would be financed and to other measures that were said to injure industry in the United States and impinge on patent rights.
 
Focus on Forests
 Administration officials today depicted the new forest-conservation program as an alternative to the strictures of both treaties. New forests, they said, would reduce global levels of carbon dioxide faster than mandated pollution controls. And they argued that the program would save more threatened species because forests already are home to half the world's plants and animals.
The reaction from many environmental leaders and political critics was harsh. The Sierra Club and the Wilderness Society called Mr. Bush's announcements hypocrisy, and several groups noted that the United States had opposed an international agreement on forest preservation that was to have been offered at Rio.
Some also noted that the Administration had recently moved to allow clear-cutting of old-growth forests in the Pacific Northwest and to allow limited logging in Oregon forests that are home to the endangered northern spotted owl. Both actions have come under strong attack from environmentalists.
 
Losing 1.5 Acres Each Second
 Still, the President won some guarded praise for focusing on the loss of forests, one of the most serious and stubborn problems.
The Earth loses an average of 1.5 acres of forest each second to lumbering and land-clearing operations, or a space roughly equal to the State of Washington each year. Forests prevent erosion, stem drought, store carbon dioxide and purify rain water.
Mr. Bush has sent letters outlining his program to leaders in major industrial nations and hopes to have a good sense of the world's response by the time he leaves Brazil in mid-June, Administration sources said.
"The forest plan is the basis for a good program," Gustave Speth, president of the World Resources Institute in Washington, said of the proposal. "It has the germ of a good idea. But there are some significant flaws in the plan. It's much too narrowly focused on the forest sector and on the funding issue."
Beyond increasing spending on existing efforts to preserve forests, Mr. Speth said, the Administration should try to change development policies that encourage tree-cutting in developing nations. And it should work harder to ease the debt problems that drag down those economies, forcing the poor to subsist by clearing forest land.
Senator Albert Gore Jr., Democrat of Tennessee, derided the plan as "a diversion."
"I'm not sure I'd put the trees in my backyard in his care, because I'm not convinced he wouldn't have a chain saw in his trunk," Mr. Gore said.

HEADLINE: New York's Teen-Agers Face Worst Job Market in Decades

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
The job market for New York City teen-agers is the worst in memory and shows few signs of immediate improvement, government labor experts and business executives say.
Across the nation, the percentage of young people who have jobs has fallen sharply during the recession. But the problem is most acute, the experts say, in New York, where only slightly more than 1 in 10 youths is working. 
 The city's employment rate for 16- to 19-year-olds for the first three months of this year was 12.6 percent, compared with a 37 percent average for the United States.
 
Fewer Entry-Level Jobs
 No comparable figures are available yet for other major cities for the same period. But for all of 1991, New York's employment rate for teen-agers was 16.9 percent, lower than the rates in Chicago, Detroit and Los Angeles.
Analysts say some of the reasons for the problem include fewer entry-level jobs for workers of all ages and tougher competition for those jobs because of the increasing number of immigrants. "This economy has been bad for everyone, and teen-agers are at the bottom," said Eli Ginzberg, a labor economist at Columbia University.
Chris Lewis, 18, of the Bronx, said he has searched in vain in the last month for maintenance work in Manhattan, where he believes the pay is better. Not having a high school diploma, he said, has been his biggest liability.
"Before, I didn't run into that problem so much," he said. "But now I see they are looking for older people with more training. I'm a little bit worried."
New York's job market has always been a tough one for teen-agers, particularly as manufacturing jobs declined sharply over the last 40 years. The percentage of 16- to 19-year-olds with jobs in New York City was more than 30 percent in the late 1960's, but it has fallen almost steadily since then, statistics from the United States Department of Labor show. The 12.6 percent employment rate for New York for the first quarter of this year, the department said, was the worst ever recorded for the age category.
"Our parents just don't understand," said Robert Hargrove, a 21-year-old who lives in Long Island City, Queens, and who said he spent three years searching for a job before finding one for this summer as a camp counselor in Westchester County. "It is a lot harder these days."
John Ottulich, vice president of York Ladder Inc., a distributor of construction supplies in Queens, said that "with so many adults out of work, it is difficult to rationalize hiring as many young people as we used to." He said his company has been hiring teen-agers to load trucks in the summer for more than 20 years. In 1988, he said, the company hired five. This year, it plans to hire two.
 
Scrambling for Jobs
 A combination of geographic and economic factors have wracked the city's job market for teen-agers, labor experts say.
In addition to the decline in manufacturing jobs in the last few decades, other industries that provided many of the city's entry-level jobs have fallen off precipitiously since the onset of the recession in 1988. Chief among them is retail sales, where young people have always been sought for weekend and after-school work but where a raft of department-store closings has left experienced sales clerks scrambling for jobs.
Jamoda Fuller, a 20-year-old freshman at York College in Queens, said she has spent a year applying to clothing shops and jewelry stores for part-time or full-time work. But so far she has come up empty.
Computers and telecommunications have also taken a toll, making thousands of entry-level jobs obsolete. Where teen-agers once found work as clerks, telephone operators and messengers, now the fax machines, phone mail systems and computerized data processing are abuzz.
And because most of the city's jobs are concentrated in the office towers of Manhattan while most of its young people are concentrated in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx, after-school and part-time jobs are harder to get to than in many other cities.
The problem of geography has been underlined by the shift of retailing, data processing and corporate services to suburban malls and offices over the last decade.
Business executives say part of the blame for low levels of youth employment lies with the schools, which they maintain do not provide even the minimal level of literacy and job skills. Faced with that, employers in some cases are relying on more experienced workers, who are paid higher wages, to do menial tasks in addition to their regular duties. In other cases, with no shortage of job-seekers, the employers are simply hiring older, more qualified workers.
 
Reflection of Problem
 "The irony is that the jobs are there, but 16- to 19-year-olds are not qualified," said Ronald Shelp, president of New York City Partnership, a business group that sponsors the city's largest program to match teen-agers with summer jobs.
In a reflection of the problem, a survey of 300 businesses in the city in September by Price Waterhouse, the accounting firm, found that a large majority of them considered the quality of mid- and upper-level workers in the city as good as or better than elsewhere. But when asked to assess entry-level employees' performance, 42 percent found them as good as or better than elsewhere, and 37 percent said they were worse.
Another reason that few New York teen-agers are working may be because not that many bother to look, believing that entry-level jobs pay too little when some movies cost $7 and a shearling coat may cost several hundred.
 
Influx of Immigrants
 "New York kids aren't stupid," said Vernon M. Briggs, a labor economist at Cornell University. He said the influx of immigrants willing to work long hours for low wages has kept entry-level wages low, just as it has also reduced the number of openings available to teen-agers.
"To an immigrant willing to work two or three jobs at once, $5 an hour may not look bad," he said. "But to a kid from Brooklyn or the Bronx, it is a turnoff."
Federal labor statistics show that employment of youths 16 to 19 years old has traditionally been lower in New York City than across the nation. Beginning in the late 1960's, the New York City rate fell from slightly over 30 percent to 16.9 percent last year and 12.6 percent for the first quarter of this year.
Other cities fared better. The employment rate for teen-agers last year was 23.6 percent in Detroit, 29.5 percent in Los Angeles and 32.2 percent in Houston.
Even the summer jobs program sponsored by the New York City Partnership, now in its 11th year, has felt the employment pinch. More than 100 New York companies, from large corporations and small businesses, participate in the program by offering teen-agers summer jobs.
The program provided rising numbers of jobs for teen-agers from 1981 to 1990, when 52,913 jobs were filled. Jobs offered through the program began to wane last year, to 45,852. Now, Mr. Shelp said, the group hopes to find 45,000 jobs for teen-agers this summer, slightly fewer than last year.
"We think we will make it, but it is tough going," he said. "This is the worst market we've seen."

HEADLINE: High Court Gives Airline Industry Victory Over States on Fare Ads

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 1

 BODY:
In a victory for the airline industry, the Supreme Court ruled today that states may not regulate the way airlines advertise their fares.
The 5-to-3 decision, upholding a ruling last year by a Federal appeals court, came in a long-running battle between the airlines and a national organization representing the attorneys general of all 50 states. 
 The state officials, who in most states are responsible for enforcing consumer protection laws, sought the right to prohibit airline advertising that they consider misleading and to require prominent disclosure of the restrictions and surcharges that are often attached to the advertised offers of low air fares.
 
U.S. Rules Called Lax
 Airline advertising is already regulated by a Federal agency, the Department of Transportation, which prohibits airlines from making deceptive claims about their fares. The state attorneys general, however, have regarded the Federal standards as lax and Federal enforcement as lacking, and they wanted a specific code of disclosures.
The dispute between the airlines and the attorneys general dates to 1987, when the National Association of Attorneys General adopted a set of guidelines for applying general consumer protection laws to the particular problems of airline passengers.
For example, the guidelines called for requiring that disclosures of restrictions and conditions on the availability of low-fare seats be made in a particular size of type. The guidelines also provided that if seats at an advertised fare were not actually going to be available in quantities sufficient to "meet reasonably foreseeable demand" on every flight, the advertisement had to disclose that in a "clear and conspicuous" way.
The decision today, written by Justice Antonin Scalia, was based on an interpretation of the 1978 Federal law that deregulated the airline industry. Congress, wanting to make sure that the states did not take up the regulatory role that the Government was abandoning, put into the law a clause prohibiting the states from enacting any rules "relating to rates, routes or services of any air carrier."
The question for the Court was whether the phrase "relating to rates" simply barred the states from regulating fares, as the states argued, or whether its meaning was broad enough to keep the states from regulating the advertising of air fares as well.
Justice Scalia wrote that "we note that our decision does not give the airlines carte blanche to lie to and deceive consumers." He added that the Transportation Department had the authority to prohibit advertisements, "which in its opinion do not further competitive pricing."
A brief filed in the case by the Bush Administration, which supported the airlines, said that in nine enforcement actions since 1985, the department had imposed $265,000 in penalties against airlines for unfair or deceptive advertising.
 
Economic Analysis Accepted
 Justice Scalia accepted the airlines' analysis of the economic impact of such regulations. The airlines argued that the restrictions and disclosures would interfere with their ability to adjust the mix of fares in response to demand and market conditions.
Justice Scalia noted that the airlines' marketing strategy was to sell as many high-priced seats as possible to business travelers who are not particularly sensitive to price, and then to use advertising to sell the rest of the seats at low prices with conditions attached. The attorneys generals' guidelines "may make it impossible to use this marketing process at all," he said.
On the issue of the phrasing of the 1978 law, Justice Scalia cited a legal dictionary for the definition of the phrase "relating to." He concluded that "the ordinary meaning of these words is a broad one," meaning to pertain or refer to, and that "the words thus express a broad pre-emptive purpose."
He noted that the Court, in interpreting the identical phrase in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, had found extensive Federal pre-emption of state laws on the subject of pensions and employee benefit plans. "We think it appropriate to adopt the same standard here," he said.
The majority opinion was joined by Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas. Justice John Paul Stevens filed a dissenting opinion that Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Harry A. Blackmun joined.
 
Souter Isn't a Participant
 Justice David H. Souter did not participate in the case. He gave no reason, but as a former Attorney General of New Hampshire, he may have considered himself too closely tied to one side in the case.
The decision, Morales v. Trans World Airlines, No. 90-1604, came in a lawsuit brought by T.W.A., Continental Airlines and British Airways against the State of Texas, which in 1988 had threatened the airlines with a lawsuit for failing to comply with the state's laws governing deceptive advertising and trade practices.
A Federal District Court in Texas issued an injunction barring Texas and 33 other states from taking action against the airlines. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, upheld the injunction last year.
The Supreme Court today limited its ruling to the fare-advertising question, setting aside other aspects of the injunction on the ground that the state had not threatened to bring any other legal action against the airlines.
The dissenters to today's decision said the majority had interpreted the pre-emption provision of the Federal law in a way "that is neither compelled by its text nor supported by its legislative history."
There were these other developments at the Court today:
 
Interstate Waste
 The Court ruled, 8 to 1, that states may not discriminate against other states in providing for waste disposal.
With only Chief Justice Rehnquist dissenting, the opinion by Justice White invalidated a special fee of $72 a ton that Alabama had imposed on all hazardous waste shipped from other states to a commercial hazardous-waste landfill at Emelle, Ala., the biggest such landfill in the country.
The decision, Chemical Waste Management v. Hunt, No. 91-471, was based on the constitutional prohibition of state barriers to interstate commerce. "No state may attempt to isolate itself from a problem common to the several states by raising barriers to the free flow of interstate trade," Justice White said.
The decision overturned a ruling by the Alabama Supreme Court. The appeal was brought by Chemical Waste Management Inc., an Illinois company that owns the Emelle landfill and had sued the state over the out-of-state fee.
 
Redistricting
 The Court agreed to decide a potentially important Ohio redistricting case that could set new rules on whether black voters and members of other minorities can or should be concentrated into districts in which they make up a large majority. In the current round of redistrictings, Republicans in many states have advocated this as a way of making suburban districts more white and presumably more reliably Republican.
The Ohio case, Voinovich v. Quilter, No. 91-1618, typifies this trend. A Republican-dominated reapportionment board drew new state legislative districts with heavy concentrations of black voters, eliminating a dozen racially integrated districts in which blacks, while not a majority, were in a position to influence the outcome of elections. A three-judge Federal District Court ruled earlier this year that by "packing" minority voters into a small number of districts without adequate justification, the plan violated the Voting Rights Act.
Gov. George V. Voinovich, a Republican, appealed to the Supreme Court. The Court earlier issued a stay of the District Court decision, and is not likely to decide the case until after the November election.
In a second redistricting case, the Court today upheld, without a written opinion, the new district lines for the four Congressional districts in Arkansas. The districts were challenged by a group of black voters on the ground that no district had a substantial enough black population to influence the outcome of elections. The case was Turner v. Arkansas, No. 91-1615.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
CLINTON IS FACING A DIFFICULT HURDLE IN CALIFORNIA VOTE

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., June 1

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who has had more than his share of discouraging news in the last five months, could get some more from the California Presidential primary on Tuesday.
The experts still expect him to win. Indeed, he seems sure to pick up, here and in the five other primaries on the schedule, far more than the 167 delegates that he needs, according to the latest New York Times tally, to assure him a first-ballot majority at the Democratic convention in New York City next month. More than 700 delegates are at stake in the six tests. 
 But he had hoped to sprint, not limp, across the finish line, and he may be hard pressed to do it. A disappointing showing by Mr. Clinton here in the nation's largest state, whose big block of electoral votes are considered essential to a Democratic victory in November, would constitute a psychological downer for his party.
 
Clinton Has Narrow Lead
 The final California Poll of the primary campaign, made public today, showed Mr. Clinton with a relatively narrow lead over his sole remaining party rival, former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, who was written off as a major force in the race after the New York primary two months ago. Among likely voters, the survey found, the Arkansas Governor led by only 35 percent to 28.
In an apparent reflection of the surging popularity of Ross Perot, the presumed independent candidate, the poll showed former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, long since withdrawn from the race, at 17 percent, other candidates at 9 percent, and undecided voters at 11 percent. The margin of sampling error in the statewide survey, conducted Wednesday through Saturday, was 5 percentage points in either direction.
Mr. Perot's name is not on the ballot, but those of Mr. Tsongas and others still are.
 
California's Distinctive Vision
 In the past Democratic nominees have run weak primary races in this state, which has always had a distinctive political vision. Several, including Jimmy Carter on two occasions, have actually lost the primary and gone on to easy nominations.
But Mr. Clinton arrived in California in poorer political health than his predecessors, looking for a cure. Mr. Brown is also a weaker foe than Gary Hart or Edward M. Kennedy or others who have scored upsets here.
Until a month or so ago, Mr. Brown was considered by some to be the favorite in California, his home state, although he was the subject of controversy during his time as Governor. But the rules of the expectations game changed when Mr. Brown lost much of his national following after he took a drubbing in New York, then failed to recover in the primary in Pennsylvania.
So if Mr. Clinton loses this time, or only narrowly edges Mr. Brown, or sees his own vote fall below 40 percent, he may stir some fresh speculation within his party about an alternative candidate. That will be especially true if surveys of voters leaving the polls show a large write-in, officially uncounted, for Mr. Perot, and show Mr. Clinton running third in a three-way trial heat for the fall against Mr. Perot and President Bush.
In theory, the superdelegates could turn against Mr. Clinton and deny him the nomination. Of the 1,978 votes credited to him in a tally by The Times, 433 are those of superdelegates; if a significant portion of those deserted him and joined with the uncommitted delegates and superdelegates, who number more than 650, Mr. Clinton's momentum might be stopped. But that would require an alternative candidate and a strategist willing to organize such a move. Neither is in sight.
A weak showing by Mr. Clinton is far more likely to slow his preparation for the convention and the general election, and to give further scope to Mr. Perot's insurgency, than it is to cost him the nomination.
The Arkansas Governor has gone all out in the final week of the campaign to achieve an impressive victory here. He had planned to spend some time over the weekend in Ohio and New Jersey, but changed his schedule to concentrate on California.
Today, Mr. Clinton campaigned in Fresno, in the agriculturally rich Central Valley; in Los Angeles, and in this economically troubled city across the bay from San Francisco.
At a lunchtime rally here, he was welcomed by local officials and a raucous crowd. Portraying himself as a Washington outsider, he appealed to voters to "take our political system back" and accused the Bush Administration of not being aggressive enough to help the environment.
But it has not been easy for him, even with a heavy schedule of television commercials, to catch the attention of the state's electorate.
Despite a pair of closely fought Senate races, and dozens of Congressional and state legislative primaries brought on by reapportionment, political participation is declining in California, which will chose 52 representatives in November, the largest delegation in American history.
As recently as 1976, the primary attracted a turnout of 72.6 percent of registered voters. Eight years later, in 1984, the turnout was 48.6 percent. On Tuesday, a turnout under 40 percent has been predicted, or not much more than half of the 1976 figure, and apparently a record low.
For all the efforts by Mr. Clinton and Mr. Brown, it has been Mr. Perot who has attracted the attention of the politically alienated voters in this state. Many of the tens of thousands of Californians who have signed his nominating petitions and put his bumper stickers on their cars describe themselves as people who have never voted or who gave up on the established parties several years ago.
Nationally, a new poll conducted by CBS News showed that in a three-way race Mr. Bush was favored by 35 percent of registered voters, while Mr. Clinton and Mr. Perot were tied for second with 27 and 26 percent support, respectively.
A previous poll, by The New York Times and CBS News in early May, showed Mr. Bush at 36 percent, Mr. Clinton at 30 percent and Mr. Perot at 25 percent.
 
People Want to Hear More
 In the new telephone poll of 1,347 adults, taken Wednesday to Saturday, voters said none of the three Presidential contenders have been clear on issues. Sixty-one percent of registered voters said Mr. Perot was not telling enough for them to judge what he would do if elected, 58 percent said that about Mr. Clinton and 62 percent even said that about the incumbent President. The survey had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. Another new national poll today also showed Mr. Perot in a strong position. The survey by ABC News and The Washington Post that tested a three-man contest put Mr. Perot's backing at 36 percent, to 31 percent for Mr. Bush and 27 percent for Mr. Clinton. The differences between Mr. Perot and Mr. Bush, and between Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton, were within the poll's four-percentage-point margin of sampling error.

HEADLINE: India Is Facing Quandary in Plan to Dam a River

BYLINE: By SANJOY HAZARIKA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, June 1

 BODY:
When it was conceived in the 1940's and redesigned in the 1970's, the huge Narmada River hydroelectric dam project in central India was intended to supply a vast impoverished area with drinking and irrigation water.
Now the World Bank and the Indian Government have been forced to review their support of the $20 billion project because of pressure from Indian politicians, newspapers, environmentalists and hundreds of thousands of villagers whose homes would be wiped away if the Narmada River were dammed. 
 In addition, the World Bank and rich nations as well as the Indian Government are under pressure to develop cheaper and more environmentally sound energy alternatives. If it goes through, the Narmada project will be built over the next several decades, Indian officials said.
The Narmada River project is not simply a symbol of India's struggle to reconcile its growing demands for energy and development with concerns over protecting the environment.
 
India Seeks Leading Role
 With the approach of the world environmental summit meeting, which begins on Wednesday in Rio de Janeiro, India has tried to become a spokesman for developing countries that are demanding financial help from rich countries to help sustain their natural resources.
India's goals have not been made any easier by its critics at home, with environmentalists saying the Government's difficulty in balancing environmental issues shows a lack of development and conservation strategy.
"India is screaming its head off about the North's exploitation, but there is no commitment to set its own house in order," said Ashish Kothari, who has organized central Indian opposition to the Narmada project.
Indian officials defend their record, saying that they are prepared to turn the Rio conference into a forum for demands that the United States and other industrialized countries stop lecturing poor countries about the environment and start setting a better example themselves.
"At meeting after meeting, we have told the developed world, especially the United States, that the North has far greater responsibility to clean up its act," said Kamal Nath, India's State Environment Minister. "They have polluted the most, per capita and in gross national terms, and they should carry the burden of cleaning up."
Negotiators said it was difficult to explain to Western delegations that economic development and environmental protection cannot be separated.
"The developed world just cannot say, 'O.K., chaps, you freeze at the current state of development,' " said Chandrashekhar Dasgupta, a senior Indian diplomat and negotiator on the issue of global warming. "You cannot freeze people into permanent poverty while the West continues to sustain unsustainable life styles."
On the issue of global warming, India and other developing nations have asserted that Western nations must reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide instead of placing future limitations on emissions for poor countries.
Indian negotiators take credit for the fact that the draft treaty on climate issues, which sets goals for reducing emissions, states that nations that produce more pollution have a greater responsibility for cleaning up. But differences persist on financing, and the best that either side could muster in the draft climate convention was a bland declaration that financing would be voluntary. Mr. Nath, the Environment Minister, said that such an approach is unacceptable.
"If their reactions are voluntary, so will mine be," he said, insisting that the West first cut back on what he described as its wasteful life style. Mr. Nath said he would support moves by rich nations to subsidize programs to expand or protect forest areas in the third world as a means of reducing and combating carbon dioxide emissions by both sides.
The question of damage to the ozone layer from the use of chlorofluorocarbons -- gases used in refrigerators, air conditioners and aerosol sprays -- also rouses strong passions here. At current levels, India and China, with nearly two-fifths of the global population, produce only two percent of the world's chlorofluorocarbons. But their share is predicted to rise sharply in the next decades with their growing affluence and populations.
"India and China today account for more than one-third of the world's population," said Anil Aggarwal of the Center for Science and Environment, an Indian environmental group. "The question is whether we are consuming one-third of the world's resources or contributing one-third of the muck and dirt in the atmosphere or the oceans."

HEADLINE: Unions Ease Overhead At Javits Center Shows

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB

 BODY:
When Lloyd R. Reeder arrived to exhibit his company's lighting fixtures at a recent trade show in the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, he braced himself for clashes with workers over union rules, high costs and bribe demands.
Mr. Reeder recalled that at two previous shows in the hall, on the West Side, he was forced to pay carpenters $200 to install a prefabricated booth that he could quickly assemble by himself without a tool. An electrician charged him $70 to plug in a lamp and when it came time to leave, teamsters and other workers demanded payments of $50 to retrieve his packing crates. 
 "All of us used to dread coming to the Javits Center," said Mr. Reeder, who works for the Greenlee Lighting Company of Carrollton, Tex. "It was a nightmare."
 
A 'Stunning Surprise'
 But at the Lightfare trade show last month, Mr. Reeder found that the work rules had suddenly been relaxed, labor expenses had been sharply cut and no one even hinted at a bribe for routine services.
"It sure was a stunning surprise," he says now.
In the last several years, even as national trade-show business has remained steady despite the recession, the Javits Center has been losing business amid complaints like Mr. Reeder's: exorbitant costs, labor racketeering and bribery. Now, however, the center's management is campaigning to convince the trade-show industry that Mr. Reeder's stunning surprise was no aberration, that new labor agreements and a law-enforcement crackdown on racketeers will combine to make the hall a more affordable and hospitable place for exhibitors to bring their business.
 
Some Exhibitors Skeptical
 Still, trade organizations and show arrangers caution that it could take several years before business picks up at the center. The experts say that major trade shows and conventions are scheduled years in advance and that bookers will wait to see if costs drop significantly and abuses end.
One skeptic is Michael R. Hough, the president of A/E/C Systems in Newington, Conn., which organizes trade shows for the computer industry. Despite the changes, Mr. Hough noted that the center's rental fees and labor costs generally remain the highest in the country and that New York is one of the nation's most expensive cities to visit.
"The changes at Javits sound good," said Mr. Hough. "But I want to see if they're implemented before making any commitments."
The new work rules came after a yearlong campaign by Fabian G. Palomino, the center's chief executive, to obtain concessions from four unions that represent employees at the center. The revisions, announced last month, will reduce some daily wages by 25 percent and limit the number of employees exhibitors are required to hire for simple tasks.
Companies that arrange trade shows estimated that the new contracts would shave between $100 and $1,000 from costs that range from $3,000 to over $25,000, depending on the size and complexity of an exhibit at the crystalline hall, which extends from West 35th to West 39th Street and from 11th to 12th Avenue.
Under the revised contract exhibitors for the first time can screw in a light bulb without paying an electrician $70, assemble a small booth, known as a pop-up, without paying two carpenters $120 and carry small packages to and from their display booths rather than paying $50 to a teamster or an exposition worker.
 
Hourly Wage Rates to Fall
 Previously, according to a survey by Tradeshow Week, an industry newspaper, electricians at the Javits Center were paid $72.50 an hour compared with costs averaging $43.07 at other convention halls; carpenters, $60.13 an hour compared with $40.24, and teamsters and laborers about $55 an hour compared with $38.41.
From the day the center opened in April 1986, bookers and exhibitors have complained about excessive costs, featherbedding and bribery demands. Mr. Palomino, in an interview, said that he had warned union leaders that the center was becoming increasingly uncompetitive.
 
Fewer Visitors and Shows
 Indeed, in the fiscal year that ended on March 31 about 3.3 million visitors attended 129 trade shows and events at the center compared with 3.9 million people at 155 shows and events the previous year.
The $486 million construction cost for the center was financed through bonds authorized by the state in the mid-1980's. The center's operating budget comes from rental fees charged to exhibitors.
Before seeking the revisions, Mr. Palomino said he had reduced the center's annual operating budget to $31 million from $36 million, discharged 36 executives, some with salaries of more than $90,000 a year, and frozen the salaries of 317 remaining white-collar employees.
"I had to have credibility with the unions," Mr. Palomino explained. "I pointed out that I had cut expenses as much as I could."
John G. Hohmann, a teamsters' official at the center, acknowledged that "business is dropping, our members are hurting and we had to give the exhibitors a break."
"Palomino said he wanted changes and we knew we had to make them," added Mr. Hohmann, the secretary-treasurer of Local 807 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.
Steven Hacker, executive director of the National Association of Exposition Managers in Indianapolis, said he believed that the Javits Center was the only major convention hall with fewer events the last two years.
Even so, Mr. Palomino said the center generated more than $5 billion for the city's economy last year by drawing visitors to hotels, restaurants, theaters and shops.
Mr. Palomino was appointed the center's chief executive at a salary of $125,000 in January 1991 by the 13-member state corporation that sets policies for the center. He is the unsalaried Special Counselor to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and a close friend of the Governor's. Those ties to Mr. Cuomo may have helped persuade the unions to go along with Mr. Palomino's proposals.
An investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney's office produced indictments in February against 26 officials and members of Teamsters Local 807, the New York District Council of Carpenters and Joiners, the Exhibition Employees local 829 and Stage Employees Local No. 1. The charges included extortion, fraud, theft and assault.

HEADLINE: Washington at Work;
U.S. Environment Negotiator in Rio Walks a Tightrope in Administration

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 1

 BODY:
William K. Reilly, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, was in Europe last month explaining a proposal to preserve the world's forests that President Bush plans to introduce at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.
Only four days earlier, the Bush Administration introduced legislation that called for cutting four million acres of ancient forests in the Pacific Northwest. 
 "This must be a very hard Administration to read on the outside," Mr. Reilly said in an interview. "It's hard for me to read sometimes from the inside."
Few issues, domestic or foreign, produce quite as much conflict in the White House as the environment. Like a red float on a fishing line, Mr. Reilly's life in the Administration has been up one week and down the next. Lately, Administration fish stronger than he are trying to tug him completely out of sight.
 
Battles Over Environment
 As the Bush Cabinet's lonely professional environmentalist, Mr. Reilly has led fights in the last 10 months to protect the nation's wetlands, prevent companies from secretly increasing toxic air pollution and strengthen the Administration's position on global warming. In each case, he has lost.
But despite these setbacks, Mr. Bush seems determined to extend important gestures that satisfy a Cabinet officer's expectations about his value.
To wit: three times in the last month Mr. Reilly joined Mr. Bush for lunch to discuss environmental issues. And last week Mr. Bush appointed Mr. Reilly as head of the United States delegation to the conference in Rio, a position that will make the E.P.A. Administrator among the most visible and influential negotiators. Mr. Reilly won the position over Clayton K. Yeutter, the domestic policy chief, who had been favored by Administration conservatives.
The Rio assignment will likely test Mr. Reilly's skills even more than usual, since he will have to defend many of the policies that he is on the record as disliking.
It's been a long three years since Mr. Reilly almost single-handedly put distance between Mr. Bush and the environmental record of Ronald Reagan by proposing a more comprehensive clean-air law and arguing successfully for steep increases in the budget and the number of employees at the E.P.A.
Now the gathering momentum of what appears to be a sharp attack by the Bush Administration on environmental laws worries Mr. Reilly. It is poking holes in the green sash the President has draped across his chest since 1988 when he promised to be the "environmental president."
 
Bloodied but Unbowed
 Mr. Reilly insists, however, that the string of losses has produced neither profound gloom nor unbearable embarrassment. Against a cadre of Administration officials who think ecological protection equals economic stagnation, Mr. Reilly said he is willing to battle against policies he considers irresponsible.
"I have been treated by this President, I think, pretty well," he said in an interview. "I feel I make a difference."
His position as the guardian of nature has led to open fights with Vice President Dan Quayle, made him the focus of wisecracks in Cabinet-level meetings from Richard G. Darman, the White House budget director, and Michael J. Boskin, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. It has also strained his relations with Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr.
 
How Long in Office?
 In recent weeks, Mr. Reilly's setbacks have prompted repeated questions from outside the Administration about whether Mr. Bush is setting the stage for his resignation. Environmental leaders in Washington say that might not be such a bad idea because if he stays, Mr. Reilly still affords the President a measure of respectability on environmental issues that they now contend Mr. Bush does not deserve.
"What Reilly should do is ask himself how many more can he lose," said Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate. "He's not losing shades of gray. He's not losing innings. He's losing the whole ball game."
To his critics in and out of the White House, Mr. Reilly is emphatic about his intention to remain.
"The answer is, I have no plans to leave. Loyalty is a must at this level," he said. "I've won big in this Administration. The Clean Air Act was a big victory. I've lost, too."
 
Defender of the Panda
 Mr. Reilly's career -- as a conservative environmentalist with links to the Nixon Administration and as the leader of a wildlife organization devoted to saving pandas -- hardly marks him as an ecological radical. But the idea of strict protection for the environment has become a red cape to the fighting bulls in the Administration, and their view of him seems to be colored more by their contempt for the environmental movement than by particular positions Mr. Reilly holds dear.
Mr. Reilly's isolation in the Administration is matched by his estrangement from former allies in the environmental movement. He often complains that despite his warnings, national environmental leaders arrived much too late last summer to help him defend wetlands from a proposal by Vice President Quayle that would open half the nation's marshes, swamps, and bottom lands to development.
In the White House, the President's closest advisers say Mr. Reilly enjoys as much support as he always has. "Reilly does as well as anybody," said C. Boyden Gray, the President's counsel. "He's a good Cabinet officer. That doesn't mean he doesn't lose."
The strains on Mr. Reilly and in the White House reflect growing pressure from the lingering recession, an approaching election and an environmental backlash stirred up across the country by conservative business and political groups.
 
Is Calamity Near?
 Mr. Darman, Mr. Boskin, the Vice President and Mr. Lujan have pressed with increasing success to loosen environmental regulations, arguing that the benefit will be lower costs to business and preserving jobs.
"The mood is different than it was," Mr. Reilly said in the interview. "The country is preoccupied with jobs, and so is the Administration."
Born in Decatur, Ill., Mr. Reilly spent his childhood following his father, a small businessman, to several states until the family ended up in Fall River, Mass., where he went to high school. Mr. Reilly attended Yale College and Harvard Law School and received a masters in land planning from Columbia University. Tall and slim, with sandy hair and green eyes, the 52-year-old Administrator looks like a young Bob Barker, the host of the daytime television program "The Price is Right."
 
A Seeker of Compromise
 Before joining the Administration, Mr. Reilly was president of the World Wildlife Fund. He convened groups of government officials, business leaders, technical experts and environmentalists to develop compromise solutions to ecological problems. One such group, led by former Gov. Thomas H. Kean, Republican of New Jersey, produced a report in 1988 calling for a policy of "no net loss" for the nation's wetlands.
The "no net loss" idea was adopted by Mr. Bush during the campaign in 1988. Mr. Bush's choice of Mr. Reilly as the E.P.A. Administrator was widely viewed as a clear signal that the President meant what he said about protecting the environment.
Thus, his top aides say, Mr. Reilly has watched with dismay as the Administration busily works to reduce environmental restrictions, rewrite some environmental laws and block new regulations.
The Administration's attack began last summer when Mr. Quayle unveiled a proposal that would open 50 million acres of wetlands to development, which Mr. Reilly argued would violate the "no net loss" promise.
 
Tensions With Quayle
 Though the E.P.A. Administrator has managed to prevent the proposal from going into effect, the rivalry produced a confrontation last December when Mr. Reilly accused Mr. Quayle of "corrupting the process," according to a participant. Mr. Quayle replied, "You've got your job and I've got mine."
The Vice President has proved a formidable foe for Mr. Reilly. Mr. Quayle and his staff helped to develop the moratorium and review of Federal regulations that Mr. Bush announced in January. Mr. Quayle also prevailed last month in the debate over allowing companies to increase, without public intervention, the air pollution they emit above the level allowed on their operating permits.
But Mr. Reilly also has his problems with environmentalists' tactics.
"There is a reflexive interventionism among environmentalists which is associated with classic liberal left politics. Unless the Government is involved managing the problem, nobody else can be trusted to do the job," said Mr. Reilly. "That attitude drives conservatives crazy. And it should. But it's also an increasingly outmoded stereotype. I've never been a polarizer and polarizing the environmental issue is bad politics."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Week;
Being Party's Nominee Is Not a Blessing in '92

BYLINE: By Robin Toner, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 1

 BODY:
The primaries are ending, the conventions are looming on the horizon, and George Bush and Bill Clinton will soon step forward to claim their parties' nominations. They are supposed to look happy. But in their darker moments, as they survey the parties they now inherit, they may wonder whether it was worth it.
Entire academic careers have been spent predicting the decline of American political parties, but the institutions look particularly troubled these days. The likely independent candidacy of Ross Perot, now tied with Mr. Clinton in some polls and ahead of him in others, is a graphic demonstration of the waning influence of party loyalty. "Because of that lack of anchoring, voters are just sort of out there, floating," says Martin P. Wattenberg, an expert in parties at the University of California at Irvine. A billionaire wise to the ways of Larry King and Phil Donahue, with telecommunications savvy and the resources to use it, can obviously catch his share. 
 It is known as "dealignment," and it is not what the Republicans expected a decade ago. Ronald Reagan's allies were convinced that he was ushering in an era of Republican loyalty as profound and lasting as the Democratic era begun by Franklin D. Roosevelt -- a classic realignment of American politics. But voters kept blithely splitting their tickets, producing a Democratic Congress and a Republican White House, and the "gridlock" that Mr. Perot so merrily campaigns against today.
The parties' problems are fed by the anti-politician mood among the voters this year. What better symbol of politicians than parties, particularly parties that seemed stalled in endless partisan warfare, or parties that seem enmeshed in internal struggles, or parties that seem to be creatures of constituent groups? Both Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton face the possibility of conventions that highlight the tensions within their parties -- while Mr. Perot can stage his own, uncomplicated, harmonious "counter-events."
There are, of course, long-term forces behind the weakening of the parties; the country is fundamentally different from the days when party leaders basically organized politics and much of the neighborhood as well. While many Democrats secretly yearn for the days of brokered conventions and smoke-filled rooms, Ann F. Lewis, a Democratic strategist, argued, "Do you really think these educated, suburban voters sitting around watching CNN would cheerfully allow their Presidential votes to be cast by people they don't know?"
Mr. Wattenberg, who wrote "The Decline of American Political Parties, 1952-1988," said that parties have declined "because people don't see them as relevant to today's world; they've become like the British monarchy."
But the parties are also struggling with a host of internal problems, many of their own making. Mr. Bush has yet to figure out a way to re-energize a Republican coalition that was already strained in 1988. The waning of the Communist threat, the slowing of the economy and the rise of the abortion issue have all undermined the Reagan majority. In the weeks to come Mr. Bush faces the probability of a platform fight over the abortion issue that will highlight many of these divisions. Mr. Perot, with his appeal to the Sunbelt, to the entrepreneurial-minded and to the moderate-on-social-issues suburbanites, seems eager to chip away at the cracks.
For their part, the Democrats have struggled unsuccessfully to redefine themselves as a Presidential party for a generation. Mr. Clinton began this election cycle with a carefully-calibrated message intended to recreate his party, and reach out to the middle class, but it was largely lost during the onslaught of character issues. He will have to tread carefully among the party's constituent groups as he chooses a running mate, a process now going on quietly but which will not stay quiet much longer. And he will have to manage, looking triumphant, a convention that he could enter in third place in the polls.
The nomination of a major political party, in short, is hardly an unalloyed blessing in the summer of 1992. For all of that, there is still a base for each party. And given that Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton seem destined to face a three-way race, even a base that is not a majority is important.
The latest CBS Poll showed 28 percent called themselves Republicans, 31 percent called themselves Democrats and 35 percent said they were independents. It also showed Mr. Perot essentially tied with Mr. Clinton in second place. Numbers like these, six months before the election, probably have little to do with what will happen this fall. But they are sure to take the edge off the victory celebrations as the long primary season finally ends.

HEADLINE: U.S. Has a Starring Role At Rio Summit as Villain

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, June 1

 BODY:
The Earth Summit officially opens here on Wednesday, but already "villain," "party pooper" and "Uncle Grubby" are being used to describe the Bush Administration, reviving anti-American sentiment rarely seen in international forums since the Vietnam War.
"The mood in Brazil is that the United States will be the biggest villain of the conference," Fabio Feldman, a Social Democratic congressman in Brazil, said today. "U.S. intransigence is recreating the polarized atmosphere of the 1960's: all civil society and the press against the U.S." 
 Traditionally centrist Brazilian magazines and newspapers are taking an increasingly harsh tone, accusing the Bush Administration of draining content from what Brazilians proudly predict to be the largest gathering of heads of state in history.
Calling President Bush "Uncle Grubby" and "Mr. Smoke," Veja, a Brazilian newsweekly, told its million readers on Sunday, "Bush comes to Rio as Earth Summit enemy."
In contrast, Japan was hailed as the world's "first environmental superpower."
 
Bush Won't Sign Treaty
 The hostility boiled over on Saturday with the news that Mr. Bush would not sign a bio-diversity treaty when he comes here June 11 to 13. Mr. Bush only agreed to appear briefly after timetables and targets were withdrawn from the text of a second treaty to be signed here, on climate change.
"Our feeling is that the world is doing what it should to organize these vast areas, and that the U.S. is not prepared to join, that the U.S. is isolated," said Marco Azamabuja, Brazil's chief negotiator. "What's the point of a major treaty if the U.S. is not on board?"
American efforts to turn the tide in public opinion have been fruitless.
On Thursday, William Reilly, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, gave a long interview by satellite to journalists in Latin America and Europe.
Jornal do Brasil, an influential daily here, printed the interview with an explanation that Mr. Reilly "will have one of the less desirable jobs of the Earth Summit, that of party-pooper."
Reflecting the anti-American mood here, Carlos Minc, a left-wing Rio state deputy, posed on Friday with his new "lie-o-meter." The device, featuring a caricature of Pinocchio, was designed to reflect mendacity levels emanating from televised speeches from the official conference hall. For demonstration purposes, Mr. Minc placed a "U.S.A." plaque on the device and pulled Pinocchio's nose off the chart.
Today, the news that Mr. Bush had offered $150 million in new forest protection aid mollified few environmentalists in a nation that has the largest expanse of tropical forest in the world.
"We feel that the United States is trying to pay to clean their name before the conference," said Joao Paulo Capobianco, executive director, of Brazil's largest environmental group, SOS Mata Atlantica.
Mr. Bush's proposal includes doubling international aid to protect world forests to $2.7 billion in 1992.
The isolation of the United States seemed to take on a physical dimension today as reporters explored the new exhibition and office hall of the Riocentro conference center. In this miniature world's fair, the United States has rented the smallest office space of the eight industrialized nations.

A Plea for Progress
PARIS, June 1 (Special to The New York Times) -- Scientists, writers and other figures from 29 nations today warned Government leaders gathering at the Earth Summit in Rio not to forsake scientific and industrial progress in the name of the environment.
The statement, signed by 264 scientists including 53 Nobel Prize winners, appears to be a defense against what scientists describe as the "anti-science movement."
"Some scientists wanted to stress their ideas amid the growth of environmentalism," said Emanuel Beaurepaire who distributed the text. "They feel scientists do not get enough of a voice and they are afraid governments will take decisions under pressure."
The group includes biologists, physicists, chemists, economists, writers and politicians. Among the writers are Umberto Eco of Italy and Eugene Ionesco of France.

HEADLINE: Post Office Tries Battling Deficit with Stamp Sales

BYLINE: By BARTH HEALEY

 BODY:
Struggling to meet the legal requirement that it break even, the post office is vigorously trying to sell stamps to people who won't put them on letters.
The breadth of this effort is not immediately apparent amid the public-relations furor surrounding the planned Elvis Presley stamp. The design chosen -- a young Elvis or a more mature one -- after a nationwide mail-in vote is to be announced Thursday with appropriate fanfare at Graceland, the Presley house in Memphis. 
 Nevertheless, by aggressively promoting stamps as collectibles to more buyers, the United States Postal Service says, it reaped $175 million in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, almost double the figure from the year before. That made a substantial dent in the deficit that the post office, the nation's eighth-largest corporation in terms of revenue, had built up since 1987.
"We are trying to get adults, married perhaps, with children, to reconsider stamp collecting" for its educational value, said the senior Assistant Postmaster General for marketing, Richard J. Strasser Jr.
 
A String of Losses
 The stamp-buying promotion comes as the Postal Service is struggling with losses and a growing deficit. The service was set up as a Government-sponsored corporation in 1971 with the idea of making enough money to end taxpayer subsidies of regular mail service, a goal it met in 1982.
But the service is also required to break even during any three-year period, and in the last few years its losses have been substantial enough to defeat efforts to balance the books.
The service's losses last year were particularly troubling because they came after an increase in postal rates. The money from that increase, however, was largely offset by a 2 percent decline in third-class mail, mostly advertising circulars, which accounted for 20 percent of the agency's total revenue of $42.51 billion last year. Mr. Strasser ascribed the decline in third-class mail to the recession as well as to the rate adjustments.
The situation has prompted postal officials to seek out the revenue to be derived from promotions like the Elvis stamp, the beginning of a planned series of stamps on popular music stars.
 
Sponsoring Olympic Games
 In seeking more revenue from collectors, the Postal Service is also sponsoring the Olympic Games. This sponsorship, the service's biggest single marketing campaign, brought the agency a substantial share of the special-delivery mail and parcel post generated by the Games that might have gone to private delivery companies, and yielded a profit of $20 million on an investment of $122 million in 1991, the post office calculates.
Most of the profit came from the sale of stamps with an Olympic theme, and this year, the agency expects to make $35 million on the program.
The Postal Service is also working with Hollywood in promoting stamps. When a booklet of five 29-cent stamps showing Al Hirschfeld caricatures of famous comedians was issued last August, MCA/Universal Home Video also released two videotapes of Abbott and Costello that included a promotion of Postal Service products. A similar MCA video of "An American Tale: Fievel Goes West," went on sale on April 10 together with the 29-cent Western Americana envelope.
The marketing effort is clear in the redesign of the post office's catalogue of stamps, prints and albums for sale by mail. Once a drab booklet, it has been transformed into a slick brochure emblazoned with the slogan "Stamps Worth Saving."
Whether that slogan is true is questionable: Ordinary first-class stamps are printed by the billions and never rise in value; indeed, dealers routinely sell older stamps, like those purple 3-cent issues from the 1940's, at 80 percent of their original value. They are still valid as postage, and collectors like to dress up their mail with them.
Higher-value stamps do better because many fewer are printed. The $1 Airlift stamp issued in 1968 now sells for about $2.50, and the $5 Railroad Lantern stamp of 1979 goes for about $9.
The post office seems to be aiming at this market for higher-value stamps with the reprints of the 16 stamps that were issued in 1893 (a year late) to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the first voyage of Columbus.
The 1992 issue, released May 22, uses the original engraved plates to create the reprints. Only two million sets will be printed, a relatively small number for modern United States stamps, and they will not be sold in post offices, only at philatelic centers in large cities and by mail. At $16.34 each, the two million sets, if unused, could yield the post office a profit of more than $32 million.
The market for stamps has risen steadily over the past year after tumbling from speculative highs in 1980-81. A value index of United States stamps compiled by Linn's Stamp News, a weekly newspaper, rose to 436.60 in May (1970 equals 100), the sixth consecutive monthly increase, to a level 8.3 percent higher than a year earlier. But most of the rise came in 19th-century stamps, and the most recent stamp in the index is from 1955.
There is some annoyance among traditional collectors at the flood of new stamps that the Postal Service hopes will never be used. The post office plans about 130 different stamps and envelopes this year.
But Mr. Strasser of the Postal Service said the philatelic push would continue. And, indeed, whether the agency can reverse its four-year decline in equity may depend on new business like that from the philatelic program.
The deficit reached a cumulative $848 million in the year ended Sept. 30, even before allowing for a special charge: a decision by Congress that made the Postal Service responsible for $1.9 billion in retroactive health benefits and cost-of-living pay raises. This put the total deficit in its equity at $2.75 billion.

HEADLINE: Bronx School, Tired of Low Expectations, Has Everyone Taking Japanese

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
When President Jimmy Carter made his famous journey to the South Bronx and looked out over a desolate wasteland, one of the few buildings standing around him was Herman Ridder Junior High School. Its academic prospects were just as bleak as the neighborhood's.
Today, the neighborhood is showing sure signs of life, with suburban-style ranch homes sprouting in the rubble. And so is Ridder, where students who might once have been destined for average or slow classes are studying the formidable language of Japanese. 
 Chie Mochizuki's sixth graders are translating Eric Carle's popular children's book, "The Very Hungry Caterpillar," adorning the text with their own drawings. From lists that Miss Mochizuki has provided, they are copying Japanese characters that make up sentences like "On Saturday, he ate through one piece of chocolate cake, one ice cream cone, one pickle, one slice of Swiss cheese . . ."
Keith Levin, a soft-spoken 11-year-old, and Venus Ramos, a 12-year-old with a large purple bow in her ponytail, have practical reasons for studying this language.
 
A Gift of Challenge
 "If you know Japanese you can read directions on a Japanese VCR," said Keith.
"They need more Japanese speakers to sell U.S. products over there," said Venus.
Japanese is generally confined to gifted classes. But many educators believe that one reason many other children -- especially black and Hispanic youngsters -- do not do well is they are not sufficiently challenged. By learning Japanese, says Diana Castro Caracciolo, the acting principal, and Angel Villareal, the assistant principal, the students will learn more keenly how a language works and apply those lessons to English.
"You are here because you're special," Mrs. Caracciolo says her school is announcing. "And we are going to prove you are special because who else is studying Japanese?"
There are other difficult languages, but Mrs. Caracciolo says she chose Japanese believing that it would one day give students from a neighborhood with high unemployment a competitive edge. All students take it, along with regular subjects.
 
Like Seeing King Kong
 Ridder, at Boston Road and 173d Street near Crotona Park, is a gray Art Deco landmark. Its squat tower has long dominated the scarred landscape and residents like to joke that it would form a perfect second perch for King Kong.
But for more than two decades it was afflicted with academic failure and spurts of violence. The idea of students studying Japanese would have been more incongruous than seeing King Kong on the tower.
Alfredo Mathew, the District 12 superintendent, and the local school board decided to scatter Ridder's children to other schools and reopen it with a smaller, more selective population. Borrowing an idea from District 4 in East Harlem, where students can choose from a roster of theme schools, Mr. Mathew called his school the Foreign Language and Global Studies school, or Flags.
 
Students' Reading Problems
 The school, which can hold 1,000 students, opened in September with only 250 students, mostly sixth graders, chosen from teacher recommendations and reading and math tests. The student population is not gifted, but above average for the district.
Mrs. Caracciolo says there were "glitches" in the screening that admitted "youngsters who do not have their own first language in hand." A third of the students read below the desired grade level, she said.
Still, she says that students, including many slower ones, seem to be reading better and thinking more logically. She and Mr. Villareal are planning to introduce Russian, Arabic, or Chinese next year. They are also hunting for a martial arts instructor.
Learning Japanese is a high expectation. The language uses over 8,000 ideograms, pictorial characters, in addition to two syllabic alphabets. It usually omits personal pronouns and articles and puts verbs at the end of sentences. It has scores of shadings for politeness and social status.
Still, Miss Moshizuki, a 31-year-old native of Tokyo, says she has found that children prefer the Japanese symbols to a mere alphabet. "They are very visually oriented," she said. "To them it's almost like a drawing, not writing a text."
 
Student Likes Ringo
 Keith Levin savors the Japanese word for apple -- ringo. Venus Ramos treasures the word for caterpillar, imomushi, and moon, tsuki. She can sign her name in Japanese.
To simplify lessons, Miss Moshizuki has students tackle sentences together as they work in groups around large tables. The tables are identified by colors: red, blue, yellow, green and orange, or aka, ao, kiiro, midori and orenji.
"It's a Copernican revolution in their psyche," she said. "That is why it is difficult for young children. They're very egocentric. But sixth graders can try to understand another perspective. This is my alphabet. This is your alphabet."

HEADLINE: Danes Vote Today on European Union Treaty

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: COPENHAGEN, June 1

 BODY:
After months of debate over whether to ratify the far-reaching treaty on European union that the 12 European Community countries signed in December, Danish voters appear to be moving toward a "yes" vote in a referendum on Tuesday.
A "no" vote in the referendum, the first in any European country, could force a renegotiation or even scrapping of the treaty, since all 12 member nations must ratify it before it can go into effect at the start of next year. 
 Public opinion polls over the last months have sometimes shown more people against it than in favor, but the latest Gallup telephone survey for Berlingske Tidende newspaper and the Danish radio last week showed 44 percent for and 35 percent against, with 13 percent undecided and the others saying they would not vote or were unsure whether they would.
The debate has raged for months, with television talk shows, poster battles and a huge rally against the treaty in a park all day Sunday. Every family in the country has received a copy of the treaty's impenetrable prose, courtesy of the Government.
"Even in the darkest days of the polls, I was convinced that we'd win," Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen said in an interview today. "How could there ever have been any doubt? Well, Danes are doubters. You just have to read your Hamlet to understand that."
Opponents of the treaty on European union, which was signed by the leaders of the 12 countries at Maastricht, the Netherlands, continued the battle for public opinion all day today, hoping to reach as many as they can of the country's 3.9 million voters.
"I think we still have a chance to win," said Birgit Bjornvig, a leading opponent of the treaty.
"I think it's important to realize that what is good for France or Germany, on one side, or Greece and Portugal, on the other, isn't necessarily good for Denmark," she said. "If Europe becomes a federal state, it will be more centralized than the United States, and I don't think our democracy can survive."
At the heart of the argument, both for and against, are the treaty's requirements for European countries to pool sovereignty in vital areas that up to now have always been jealously guarded national prerogatives. The treaty provides for a European Central Bank to make monetary policy for a common currency for countries that want it and qualify, as early as 1997, and it pledges all 12 to try to make more of their foreign policy and security decisions together.
Most of the nations plan to ratify the treaty by parliamentary vote, but France and Germany also need to make changes to their constitutions, and Ireland has a referendum on June 18. With the ineffectiveness of European Community security policy already embarrassingly apparent through its impotent attempts to stop the fighting in Yugoslavia, supporters of greater unity fear that Denmark could scuttle the whole process by voting against it Tuesday.
But in Denmark, fear of being overwhelmed by a newly united Germany, after the last barriers to internal European trade and immigration are removed in January, is also not far below the surface. The minority coalition Government of Prime Minister Poul Schluter negotiated a protocol in the treaty that gives Danes the right to keep prohibiting Germans from buying summer houses in Denmark.
It is German economic clout, not tanks and troops, that some Danes are afraid of this time. With nearly 80 million mostly landlocked Germans looking longingly at their beaches, the 5.1 million Danes felt they needed the protocol to retain rights to their shores.
Denmark's economy -- with an inflation rate of below 3 percent and a trade surplus even with Japan -- is now intimately bound up with its European neighbors. And, Mr. Ellemann-Jensen argued, with Sweden, Finland and possibly Norway all about to become community members within the next several years, it would make little sense now for Denmark to opt out of provisions designed to bring everybody closer together.

In Peru, Pizarro Won a Battle; the War Goes On

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CUZCO, Peru

 BODY:
High in the thin air of the Andes, sculptors here are raising what will be the largest statue in Peru: a 114-foot-high bronze rendering of Inca Pachakuteq, a 15th-century ruler of the Inca empire.
Far away in the capital, Lima, the nation's Government center is adorned by a statue of a triumphant Spaniard: Francisco Pizarro, conqueror of the Inca empire. 
 The two statues symbolize the hidden regional and racial divisions of modern Peru. And people who have studied this country's Shining Path rebel movement say that now, 500 years after Columbus's voyage foreshadowed the fall of this city as capital of the Inca empire, Peru's legacy of racism and regional isolation helps explain the xenophobia, the rage and the violence of the leftist rebellion.
"It is impossible to understand Peru's political violence if you only look at poverty or political oppression," said Nelson Manrique, a leading researcher of the rebel movement. "Racial discrimination is a very important factor."
 
60 Percent Are Mestizos
 Of Peru's 22 million people, about 60 percent are mestizos, or people of mixed Spanish and Indian heritage, 30 percent are Andean Indians and 10 percent are whites. With ethnicity blurring racial labels, an Indian who moves to the city, cuts his braids, puts on Western clothes and learns Spanish, generally considers himself mestizo or "cholo."
Officially, both Shining Path guerrillas and the Government deny that Peru has a race problem. The Government, headed by Alberto K. Fujimori, a son of Japanese immigrants, maintains an official policy that "we are all cholos."
But one Shining Path supporter, a mechanic from Cuzco interviewed in a Lima shantytown, asked a pointed question: "How can we have a statue of Pizarro, a man who betrayed our forefathers, who stole our gold?"
Coastal Peruvians, when scanning newspapers, rarely fail to note that arrested Shining Path supporters often come from cities of Peru's Andean heartland: Cuzco, Ayacucho, Huancavelica and Huancayo.
Shining Path "seems to attract Andean migrants," said Guido Delran Cousy, director here of the Bartolome de las Casas Center for Andean Regent Studies. "People have made an enormous effort to leave the cultural roots, but haven't found space in the cities."
The split is echoed by a controversy today over how to commemorate the 500th anniversary of Columbus's arrival in the Americas.
Peru's Association of Economists recently delivered to Spain's Ambassador a bill for $647 billion in colonial reparations and a request for an apology over the colonists' genocide. The largest item on the bill was for a ransom of seven tons of gold and 13 tons of silver that a captive Inca, Atahuallpa, paid Pizarro for his release. After the ransom was paid, Pizarro put Atahuallpa to death.
Defending the cause of Western culture, Mario Vargas Llosa, Peru's most prominent novelist, wrote in reply that Atahuallpa's modern-day defenders "never shed a tear for the thousands, or hundreds of thousands, of Indians sacrificed to gods in barbarian ceremonies by Incas, Mayas, Aztecs, Chibchas or Toltecs."
Offering a middle road, other Peruvian intellectuals propose "unhorsing" Pizarro by placing the conqueror's statue in a museum.
After Pizarro founded Lima, the Spanish adopted racial controls to maintain power: Indians were barred from owning horses, from bearing arms, from wearing Spanish dress, and from entering the sumptuous gold-leafed churches.
Hundreds of thousands of Indians died working as slaves in Spanish mines. In the mid-19th century, British companies impressed Indians, Chinese and Polynesians to mine guano, allowing hundreds to be blinded by ammonia fumes. In the 1920's, workers died from fumes from an unregulated copper smelter run by an American company.
This history undoubtedly contributes to the extreme xenophobia of Shining Path. "In sectors of the masses, there is resentment of centuries," said a Lima professor who sympathizes with the Shining Path.
But the rebels say they are motivated by class struggle. A Shining Path ideologist said in a March interview in a Lima jail: "The central problem is not race. It's economics. It's class. Class society appeared long before 1492."
While rigidly Marxist, Shining Path's murals and portraits show a Maoist iconography blurred with Indian images. The group's leader, Abimael Guzman Reynoso, presents himself as a sun figure, a reference to ancient religious beliefs that the Inca descended directly from the sun.
Although Shining Path does not make direct racial appeals, deep racial alienation undoubtedly contributes to bitterness speeding the movement. Signs of this alienation are everywhere.
Every year, judges in the Miss Peru contest invariably choose a contestant who looks as if she arrived yesterday from Barcelona. "You will never find a Miss Peru called Quispe or Mamani," Mr. Manrique said, citing Indian names from the Quechua and Aymara groups. "Indians feel like foreigners in their own country." Mixed-race children typically play with dolls with European features.
Gonzalo Porto Carrero, a Catholic University sociologist, said: "Many poor people see whites as foreigners, and they have revenge fantasies. In some factories where Sendero has killed white managers, the workers approved."

HEADLINE: Milk the Cows. Do the Arithmetic. Sell the Farm.

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: COLEBROOK, Conn.

 BODY:
Cows are George and Gloria Wilber's life. From dawn to midnight, much of their daily routine is crowded with the care and feeding of their 60 Brown Swiss cows. There are cows all over their house, too, painted on the flour canisters and dangling in stained glass from window frames. "You should see our Christmas tree," said their 16-year-old daughter, Katie.
The Wilbers are the last dairy farmers in this northwestern Connecticut town, where a generation ago there were more than a dozen. Soon the Wilbers will be gone, too; after five money-losing years, they are trying to sell their herd. 
 They are part of a trend in the metropolitan area, where the number of dairy farms has fallen by half in the last 10 years in Connecticut and New Jersey, and by one-third in New York.
 
Farms to Shopping Malls
 A combination of local conditions and national policy brought the Wilbers to this point. Federal regulation of the price they get for milk does little to take into account the region's relatively high fuel and labor costs, not to mention taxes, Mr. Wilber said. As those costs have risen, the price of milk has stayed about the same, forcing farmers to absorb the higher expenses.
And as suburbs spread farther from America's cities, farmland has become more valuable as a potential subdivision or shopping mall. The landscape around the Wilber farm, once dotted with grazing cows, is now speckled with weekend homes for New Yorkers.
"The economics are forcing them out," said Richard A. Meinert, a cooperative extension educator with the University of Connecticut in Litchfield. "To an extent, it's happening to everybody, but the dairy farmers are in it worse. They don't have the option of a roadside stand. They have a product they have to market through federally regulated channels."
To keep earning a living in agriculture, some dairy farmers have merged their operations, while others have abandoned cows for corn, hay or flowerbed plants, and still others have sold their land for development.
Farms in the region continue to produce about 70 percent of the milk sold here. But more and more, that milk is coming from large operations with hundreds of cows, which benefit from the economies of scale.
To consumers, this makes little difference, because milk prices are largely determined by Federal policies, not by producers' costs.
 
Farmers in Suburbia
 Still, the trend toward such large farms runs counter to the traditional approach to dairy farming. Across the nation, about 90 percent of all dairy farms are small and family-run, like the Wilbers', with fewer than 100 cows each, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture statistics.
The Wilbers' decision to get out came in part from the loneliness of being the only dairy farmers in town, Mrs. Wilber said.
"What's very hard for me is that there's no support group for farmers," she said. "We have become farmers living in a suburban area. Take us and put us in Ohio or Vermont, and it might be different."
But even there they would not be free of problems they ascribe to the Federal pricing policy for milk, a policy described as complicated and out-of-date even by its supporters. Based on prices paid to dairy farmers in Wisconsin and Minnesota, considered the center of dairy country, the Department of Agriculture computes a minimum price every month for milk in three grades.
The policy makes some allowances for higher costs in different regions. But since prices in a given area are inflexible, the policy encourages the creation of larger farms that can balance costs against higher volume. In densely populated states like Connecticut, however, it is difficult for dairy farmers to buy additional land and expand.
 
State Intervention
 For George Wilber, the discouraging economics of a small dairy farm are best illustrated in a recent monthly statement from Agri-Mark, the marketing cooperative to which he belongs. Of about $4,539 he was paid for his milk, all but $1,115 went to taxes, promotional fees, co-op dues, a $105 "stop charge" to pick up his milk, transportation charges and a $2,000 mortgage payment on the farm; a $1,000 advance he had taken the previous month from the cooperative was deducted as well. His net pay does not cover half of his $3,000-a-month feed bill, he said.
"At one point, we stopped paying for health insurance," Mrs. Wilber said. "And that was when I went back to school. It was just too risky, with farms having such high accident rates." Now she works as a teacher and Mr. Wilber earns a salary as First Selectman of Colebrook.
From time to time, state try to ease the predicament of dairy farmers with land-preservation programs and tax breaks and even by adding to the price they get for their milk. But in general these steps fail to prevent many small farms from going under. In April, a Federal judge in Manhattan struck down a 1991 New York law requiring dealers who sold their milk in New York to pay a premium if they bought from out-of-state farmers. The money collected was to be redistributed to the farmers.
"It tried to keep the playing field level, if you will," said Patrick M. Hooker, a dairy specialist with the Farm Bureau of New York, a lobbying organization near Albany, noting that New York costs could be higher than in Connecticut or Pennsylvania.
 
'A Fluid Commodity'
 The judge disagreed, saying that the policy violated rules of interstate commerce. But many officials in the Northeast say the Federal system does little to consider higher labor and fuel costs in the region that shrink a farmer's profit margin.
"I don't think there's a whole lot that any state can do," said John R. H. Blum, Connecticut's Commissioner of Agriculture. "The difficulty with individual state action is that milk is literally such a fluid commodity, with the interstate system and the big tanker trucks, that if prices are lower in a neighboring state, the dealers just go to that state."
Efforts have begun to change the pricing policy in small ways, said Willard H. Blanchard, director of the dairy division of the United States Department of Agriculture, but there are no plans to sharply revise or replace it.
Barring a major change in pricing policy, farmers could be helped by attracting milk-oriented industry to their states.
"If we were able to locate a large baby-formula plant in Connecticut, that would open up an export market that we haven't got now," Mr. Blum said. "And as the European markets open up, the export of breeding stock is a possibility."
 
Fate of Open Space
 The plight of dairy farmers is also cause for concern among advocates for open space.
"There's a whole generation of disgruntled, underpaid, overworked farmers controlling most of the open land left in Connecticut," said Robert C. Wagner, northeast regional director of the American Farmland Trust, which has its headquarters in Washington. "We've got to be concerned about where dairying goes. Land prices will come back long before milk prices come back."
Mr. Meinert of the University of Connecticut echoes that point. "If you lose the dairy farmers, you lose the open land," he said, "and God knows what comes in to take its place."
For the time being, the Wilbers are trapped by the recession into staying right where they are, unable to get a good price for their land or their cows, which they say are worth about $2,000 apiece.
And Mr. Wilber, who was the state's Commissioner of Agriculture during the late 1970's, said switching to other products is easier said than done. "In the town of Colebrook, our soil is very stony," he said. "You're not going to be able to set strawberry beds or plant sweet corn."
 
A Way of Life
 His concern is echoed by Ray Vail, whose dairy farm in Lagrangeville, N.Y., has been in the family for 197 years. "Vegetables really don't turn me on too much," Mr. Vail said. "And if everybody went into vegetables, there'd be no money in that, either."
The Wilbers may not be as desperate as farmers who have never known any other profession. But it is clear that they will miss their cows, whose twice-daily milkings govern their lives. "They're like members of the family," Mr. Wilber said, calling to Tessie and Carly and Glenda and Tabitha by name.
The couple gave their children calves on special occasions and encouraged them to care for them. Several of the cows have won grand prizes at state and county fairs.
"They say agriculture is the principal industry of Colebrook," Mr. Wilber said, quoting the state manual known as the Blue Book. "Well, it's gone now."

HEADLINE: Brady Warns That Fed Could Delay Recovery

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, June 1

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said here today that the United States economy was starting to show "good solid growth," but he warned that the recovery could be aborted, as it was last summer, by inadequate money supply from the central bank.
Mr. Brady, here for the International Monetary Conference of the American Bankers Association, demonstrated the increasing sensitivity of the Bush Administration this election year to the policies of the independent Federal Reserve Board. The Administration is counting on strong growth later this year to help re-elect the President. 
 "I think it is clear that if the Fed pulls down the lever of money supply in 1992, as was the case in 1991 when the first appearance of growth started in midsummer, then we are taking a chance with this economic recovery that I don't think is wise for this country," Mr. Brady told reporters after an address to the main conference.
 
Personal Assessment
 His comments followed last week's upward revision by the Commerce Department, to 2.4 from 2 percent, in the annual rate of economic growth in the first quarter. The Treasury chief said his own assessment of recovery was based on indicators like a 30 percent rise in shipments of truck motors, "very good" increases in leading department store sales and increased orders for heavy manufacturing equipment.
"What I see are the foundations for growth, not meteoric growth, but if we can get to a 2 1/2 to 3 percent growth mode in the U.S. economy, that will provide for substantial job creation," he stressed.
The Treasury and the banking industry are working out details on legislative proposals to allow banks to set up nationwide branch systems, but Mr. Brady declined to predict what Congress would do about it this year. A similar effort collapsed last year.
"After watching what's gone on in Congress the last three or four months, I can't tell you what is going to get done, but it's quite clearly needed," Mr. Brady said.
He disclosed that the Senate minority leader, Robert J. Dole of Kansas, would shortly introduce legislation that seeks to undo some of the regulations imposed on small banks by last year's Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act, which recapitalized the bank insurance fund with $30 billion.
New reporting requirements on loans to small businesses and farmers would be eliminated under the Dole bill for banks with less than $100 million in assets.
Diane Casey, executive director of the Independent Bankers Association of America, said in a telephone interview from Washington that the relief was "vital" for small banks but noted, "It will be an uphill battle this year."
 
Problems of Japan
 The meeting also focused on financial problems in Japan and the current difficulties of banks of many nations in commercial real estate lending.
In Japan, both the stock and property markets have fallen dramatically, and corporations and individuals as well as banks are financially squeezed.
Toyoo Gyohten, an adviser to the Bank of Tokyo and a former vice minister of finance for international affairs, said the majority view in Japan was that the market declines had "passed the bottom" and that overall economic activity should start picking up in the latter half of this year.
Mr. Brady said he welcomed recent cuts in official Japanese interest rates and hoped they would be matched with fiscal actions to strengthen domestic growth, which would help reduce Japan's trade surplus, the No. 1 source of the United States trade deficit.
 
Multiply Banking Difficulties
 The frmer chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Paul A. Volcker, now an investment adviser in New York, said the difficulties being felt by banks in the United States and elsewhere in real estate lending have come on top of problems with loans to the Soviet Union and the third world.
"How could banks have made so many lending mistakes so repeatedly in such a limited period of time?" he asked.
Yet he pointed out that unlike earlier periods in history, the strains of the banking system had had "little effect" on the real economy because of government safety nets in all the major countries.

HEADLINE: Losses Force Japan's Banks To Halt Expansion Overseas

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 1

 BODY:
After a decade of growth that left them towering over the world financial system, Japan's big commercial banks have been forced to hit the brakes on their global expansion. They have been hobbled by a problem many Japanese thought afflicted only the West: billions of dollars of bad loans.
The pullback from what had seemed an unstoppable march to dominance amounts to a significant shift in the balance of financial power and is likely to be felt from Wall Street to America's industrial centers, as well as in Japan, bankers and analysts say. 
 As the flood of Japanese money dries up, borrowers are already having to give their banks slightly higher profit margins to obtain certain kinds of loans and guarantees than they did a year ago, even though interest rates are broadly lower. Some riskier ventures, like takeovers that rely on borrowed money, are finding it far more difficult to borrow funds.
The result, many analysts say, is likely to be a market in which banks win business based on ideas and efficiency rather than just with financial muscle.
 
'It Should Be Scaled Back'
 "The Japanese banking system has outlived its purpose in its current form, and it should be scaled back," said Akio Mikuni, the president of Mikuni & Company, Japan's only independent credit rating agency. "When this was a closed system banks could just consider size and not worry about profitability. But the system is opened now, and the banks are going to have to pay for having been slow to realize the effects of that fact."
During the Japanese banks' global lending spree in the 1980's, they pushed aside their foreign rivals as they grabbed a growing share of the international banking market. Financing the acquisition of everything from Impressionist paintings to golf courses in California and office towers in New York, the big Japanese banks claimed 7 of 10 places among the world's largest.
"By following the trail of dollars and yen, we can see the accelerating pace at which the Japanese empire is gaining momentum and the American empire is losing ground," warned Daniel Burstein in his 1988 book, "Yen! Japan's New Financial Empire and Its Threat to America."
But the speculative bubble burst two years ago, when the Japanese Government raised interest rates sharply to cool inflationary pressures. Japan has now suffered a record level of corporate bankruptcies, and mounting loan losses for the banks that are likely to take at least five years to clean up.
A series of scandals also created turmoil, forcing the heads of five of the largest banks to resign in the last year and a half because of questionable financial activities. Many analysts say this is Japan's worst banking crisis since World War II.
 
Bad-Loan Losses to Rise
 But with the Japanese economy in a slowdown and bankruptcies still rising, the analysts say they still expect the losses from sour loans to rise. That is forcing Japanese banks to reassess their strategies in a fundamental way.
"Maybe our bank has grown too big," said Hisao Kobayashi, a managing director in charge of international operations at the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, the world's largest commercial bank. "It's time perhaps for us to think about what the appropriate size is. We may need to concentrate more on profits than expansion."
Japanese banks controlled just 4 percent of the international lending market in 1980, with the assets of their overseas branches at just $189 billion. By 1989, aggressive expansion gave them a 40 percent share, with overseas assets of $1.4 trillion. Today, the share is edging down near 30 percent, with assets of $1.26 trillion, the first such decline in overseas assets in years. Although Japanese banks remain among the world's largest, their overall assets declined last year, the first such drop in years.
The banking problems reflect a deeper financial shift taking place. Japan invested so much abroad during the 1980's that it emerged as the world's largest creditor nation -- at the same time that the United States fell to become the world's largest debtor nation. The collapse of stock and real estate prices in Japan has undermined confidence and forced the Japanese to marshal more of their capital at home, and last year Japan suddenly shifted course and slowed its flow of investments abroad, including new bank loans.
 
Focusing on Japanese Business
 Many Japanese banks are cutting back on some overseas operations, refocusing their business on their core Japanese customers rather than the American municipialities and other foreign customers they chased during the 1980's.
During the years of aggressive expansion, Japanese banks issued letters of credit for American authorities planning bond offerings, often charging only a few hundredths of a percentage point. United States banks said the fee was too low, and business flowed to the Japanese. Now, with the Japanese pulling back, municipalities have to pay more for such services.
Adding to the anxiety about the extent of the banks' problems is a striking lack of information on just how many loans at the Japanese banks have become uncollectible.
American banks are required to make detailed disclosures on their problem loans, and they must set aside reserves promptly to offset those losses. As a result, most big American banks reported heavy losses in the last few years because of tumbling real estate prices, failed leveraged buyouts and other loan problems.
But in Japan, the Government does not require that such information be made public in great detail, and the disclosure rules are riddled with loopholes, analysts say, leaving the public in the dark.
"Absolutely nobody knows," said Alicia Ogawa, the banking analyst here for S. G. Warburg Securities. "The Bank of Japan has no idea. The Ministry of Finance has no idea. It's clear, though, that the banks will be working their way through these problems three years from now, and probably more like five."
The Finance Ministry has sought to allay the fears by abandoning its usual reticence and offering a few vague figures. It asserted that the 11 biggest Japanese banks had less than 2 trillion yen in bad loans, about $15.5 billion at current exchange rates. Many analysts and even some Government regulators say the number could easily top $150 billion, and some estimates run to well over $200 billion.
"Whatever the amount is, it will increase substantially during the course of this year, without doubt," said David Atkinson, an analyst here for Salomon Brothers. The banks' profits are likely to be hurt for several years, he added, and that will continue to crimp their ability to expand overseas.
Seeking to end the months of damaging speculation, Government officials have been forced to state openly that they will stand behind every major bank no matter what.
"Our financial system is not so fragile," Tadao Chino, the Vice Minister for International Affairs at the Finance Ministry, insisted recently. But, he felt compelled to add, "We don't think the bankruptcy of a financial institution can be justified."
Yoshihiro Watanabe, deputy general manager of the Bank of Tokyo's planning division, noted that even Japan's ballooning trade surplus, which is headed for a record this year, is not enough to fuel the banking growth it did during the 1980's.
"In the past when the surplus grew, the position of Japanese banks abroad grew," he said. "That is not happening this time. The years of big growth are over."
 
How the Boom Began
 The Japanese boom began in the 1980's, after the Japanese agreed to almost double the value of the yen against the dollar in an effort to shrink their yawning trade surpluses. To avoid a recession, the Government lowered interest rates.
That began a remarkable surge in the growth of the money supply. The financial system was awash in funds, which translated into soaring stock and property prices, strong economic growth and a surplus of funds for Japanese bankers to lend.
Looking for ways to use this cheap money to grab market share overseas, Japanese banks became major lenders for leveraged buyouts on Wall Street and for foreign property companies, like Olympia & York Developments Ltd., whose empire is now tottering. They also made a major business of issuing letter of credit to American municipalities that were financing municipal bonds, at rates that American banks said were absurdly low.
The number of Japanese bank branches overseas grew to 327 at the end of last year, from 139 in 1980. The Japanese banks also acquired banks in California and elsewhere to channel their loans around the world.
Mr. Kobayashi of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank spent four and a half years in Los Angeles trying to expand his bank's influence. "I had a mission there," he said. "It was to look for an acquisition."
As it happens, he failed, which in hindsight is proving to be a kind of success. Dai-Ichi Kangyo did end up acquiring 60 percent of CIT Financial from Manufacturers Hanover Trust in 1989, but otherwise it is scaling back.
"Our market share is declining in the United States, but this is still our most important foreign market," Mr. Kobayashi said. "It's just not necessary for us to grow overseas with the speed we did in the past."
Within Japan, the banks' loan problems have been worse. Among the prominent casualties here are these:
*Itoman & Company, once a textile trading house, lost hundreds of millions of dollars on purchases of art and property and is now suffocating under nearly $11 billion of debts, owed mostly to Sumitomo Bank.
*Dai-Ichi Real Estate, which owns the Tiffany Building in New York, is struggling under about $10 billion of borrowings, owed to a group headed by Mitsui Trust and Banking Corporation.
*The Shuwa Corporation, whose properties include Arco Plaza in Los Angeles, has been swamped by $10 billion in debt and is being rehabilitated by a group that includes Sumitomo Bank.
*E.I.E., a little-known electronics concern that suddenly began acquiring hotels around the world, is now suffering under about $7.7 billion of debt, owed mostly to the Long-Term Credit Bank.
"The banks overexpanded," said Mr. Mikuni of Mikuni & Company. "We cannot muddle through without changing the system in some fundamental ways."

FEW JOBS FOR TEEN-AGERS
The job market for New York City teen-agers is the worst in memory and the worst among major cities in the United States, government labor experts and business executives say. Analysts attribute the erosion in youth employment to cutbacks in entry-level jobs and new competition from immigrant workers. "This economy has been bad for everyone, and teen-agers are at the bottom," said Eli Ginzberg, a labor economist at Columbia University. A1.
 
TEACHERS PROTEST A BEATING
Outraged over the beating of a social studies teacher in his classroom, teachers at Adlai E. Stevenson High School in the east Bronx rallied against what they called dangerous conditions at the school. The teachers have asked their union to authorize a strike if safety does not improve. Shortly after the protest, a student was charged in the assault. B3.
 
CRIME FALLS IN MIDTOWN
Major crime in midtown Manhattan fell sharply in the first four months of this year, continuing a major decline in the area over the last several years, a ranking police official told business leaders. The drop was attributed to the presence of more police officers on patrol, augmented by an increase in private security guards hired by business groups. B3.

New Jersey's Presidential primary season ended fittingly -- with a rally on the State House steps for Paul Tsongas, who retired from the campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination several weeks ago. President Bush did not visit New Jersey during his campaign. The Democratic front-runner, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, visited two New Jersey schools but avoided reporters over the last two weeks.

"The time has come to put political posturing aside," said Joseph N. Mondello, the Republican county chairman, as he announced his support for a county mortgage-recording tax that would be one of the highest in the state. B4.
 
FIGHTING DRUNKEN DRIVING
Suffolk County's District Attorney declared war on drunken drivers, imposing what he called the toughest regulations in the state to deal with the state's highest rate of alcohol-related highway fatalities.

HEADLINE: Diving for Diversion;
Albany Considers a Shipwreck Park

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST HAMPTON, L.I., June 1

 BODY:
Forget the hot dogs, rolls and charcoal. The new state park proposed by the Town of East Hampton is going to be 20 feet below the surface of Fort Pond Bay.
If approved, the park would be New York's first underwater state park, and the main attraction would be the H.M.S. Culloden, a 74-gun frigate that sank more than 200 years ago and is one of the oldest known shipwrecks in the vicinity of Montauk Point. 
 "It would be an interpretive underwater trail for divers, monitored and guided, and an on-land museum," said Larry Penny, director of the Town of East Hampton's Department of Natural Resources.
The 161-foot Culloden sank off the eastern highland of Fort Pond Bay on Jan. 22, 1781, while in pursuit of French vessels sent to assist the American colonists. All 600 crewmen escaped with their lives. The wreck was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.
 
Looted by Hurricane
 Town officials believe that turning the site into a state park would help protect the Culloden from treasure hunters. There are still several triangular stacks of cannonballs and a few cannon on the wreck, local divers say. But once there were a few thousand cannonballs, and local lore has it that every East End resident with a boat and a wet suit has one.
Some security is offered by employees of the State Department of Environmental Conservation and the town, who randomly check boats and divers for stolen artifacts.
Last summer, Hurricane Bob washed artifacts from the Culloden ashore, and dive boats congregated like a flock of seagulls. Cannonballs weighing 25 to 30 pounds, bits of brass fastenings, silverware and pottery were taken away, Mr. Penny said.
Much of the Culloden's hull is buried in the sand, and local officials have drafted plans to excavate it under the sponsorship of the Montauk Historical Society. A $1.5 million state grant under the 1988 Environmental Quality Bond Act is pending for the project, Mr. Penny said. Additionally, Suffolk County has promised $3.5 million, and the state Heritage Fund has pledged $1.5 million. No additional state financing would be required to turn the site into a state park, officials said.
Three agencies -- the Education Department, the Office of General Services and Department of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation -- must review the state park proposal.
"We're looking for a site that has an interesting experience for diving and is not historically or environmentally sensitive," said Philip Lord, a senior scientist at the Department of Education and a member of the review panel.
Mr. Lord warned that the Culloden site might not fill the bill and said that, given the state's fiscal problems, "it's hard to imagine any expansion of the park system."
Still, Henry Moeller, a Long Island marine archeologist who spent a decade mapping the Culloden's remains, is hopeful. Mr. Moeller, who has been named the project's official marine archeologist, found the blueprints used by the shipwrights who built the Culloden at Deptford, England, in 1747.
"If Montauk would focus on drawing tourists into the economy by having a museum or an underwater park," he said, "that's the way to help the economy of eastern Long Island, with tourism. There's a lot of material there."

HEADLINE: Nassau Sees Mortgage-Recording Tax as Solution to Its Money Problem

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., June 1

 BODY:
After treading softly for months out of a fear of an anti-tax backlash, county legislators from both parties are coming together on a Nassau County financial bailout plan that includes as its centerpiece a $40 million annual tax increase.
"The time has come to put political posturing aside," said Joseph N. Mondello, the presiding supervisor from the Town of Hempstead and the Republican county chairman, as he announced his support for a county mortgage-recording tax that would be one of the highest in the state. 
 Within hours, several Democrats signaled that they, too, could support at least some portion of the tax if it was part of a package that also cut into county spending on consultants and managers, which Democrats consider patronage, and the outlines of deal began to take shape.
But the shift in priorities appeared to reflect less the ebbing of anti-tax fervor than bipartisan frustration over a budget-cutting exercise that for a time almost halted the delivery of some services in the county without solving its financial problems.
Now both Democrats and Republicans are betting that the new tax will be more palatable to voters, especially those who do not have to pay it, than allowing the county's political stalemate and fiscal disarray to continue.
They are also betting that County Clerk Harold W. McConnell, who would be responsible for collecting the tax, will have cleared up continuing problems in his office by the time the new tax takes effect. Earlier this year, it was reported that the office was months behind in recording deeds and mortgages and that millions of dollars in taxes and fees collected by the office were stashed in envelopes awaiting processing.
After the disclosure, Mr. McConnell, an elected Republican, said he would speed up the automation of his office.
The new tax plan avoids raising the unpopular property tax, which affects most residents, in favor of raising the mortgage-recording tax -- imposed on real estate developers, home buyers and homeowners who refinance their mortgages. Currently, the state imposes a 1 percent tax in Nassau County; the county plan would add another 1 percent county tax. The increase requires the approval of the State Legislature.
The new tax would raise the tax on most mortgages to the highest level in the state. Only New York City has higher rates, and those apply only to mortgages of $500,000 or more.
"The situation is so desperate that I am willing to go along with that," said Benjamin Zwirn, a Democratic supervisor from North Hempstead, "because the tax doesn't affect everyone in the county."
But real-estate agents and developers worry that it would increase the cost of many mortgage refinancings, at a time when low interest rates encourage refinancing, and dampen a real estate industry already in the throes of bankruptcies and faltering property values.
"This is an unbelievably callous disregard of economic realities," said Stephen Hess, president of the Association for a Better Long Island. "They are not only going to kill the golden goose, they are going to render it."
After watching several incumbents swept from office last November by voters enraged over soaring property taxes, Republicans on the Board of Supervisors rewrote the budget prepared by the Republican County Executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, to reduce the county work force by one-fourth.
But after more than 2,600 full-time workers were pared from the payroll, many through layoffs, the layoff program was called to a halt as officials began to fear that services in one of the wealthiest and most heavily taxed counties in the country would crumble. The county was left with a $129 million deficit this year.
Under a plan put forward by Republican supervisors, the gap would be closed over the next 18 months by a series of steps: $53 million through the mortgage-recording tax, a $15 million cut in consulting contracts, $8 million through attrition. The balance would be made up by up to $75 million in general obligation bonds.
 
County Executive's Role
 Republican supervisors put the plan together, after months of stalled talks with Democrats, in a legislative body with a complicated weighted voting system in which neither party has a working majority.
Last week, Mr. Gulotta, the County Executive, held separate meetings with Democratic and Republican supervisors, but to the frustration of supervisors was unwilling to put forward any plan of his own to solve the county's fiscal mess.
Members of both parties said they believed that Mr. Gulotta wanted to ask the Legislature for the authority to borrow up to $125 million in bonds to close the county deficit, produce a surplus and cut county taxes next year, before he faces re-election.
In the end the Republican plan included many ideas originally proposed by Democrats, including deeper cuts in consultants, and the establishment of a bipartisan spending review panel.

Chevron Set To Combine Five Units

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
The Chevron Corporation said yesterday that it would combine its five oil and gas research and technology organizations into one unit, which the company said would save more than $60 million a year in operating costs.
The consolidation, which will trim the units' current staff by 450, to 1,100, adds to several cost-cutting moves by San Francisco-based Chevron since last fall that are part of a restructuring started two years ago by Kenneth T. Derr, chairman and chief executive. It also reflects the push to streamline operations at many American oil companies that are trying to cope with depressed margins in their refinery operations. Many oil companies, Chevron included, are also increasingly focusing their exploration and production efforts overseas. 
 Analysts said yesterday that the move had been anticipated, and the announcement had little impact on Chevron's stock, which closed yesterday at $71.50, up 12.5 cents, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. "It's just another step in the process," said Michael L. Mayer, an oil industry analyst with Wertheim Schroder.
Chevron, the largest producer of oil products in the United States, has established a new company, the Chevron Petroleum Technology Company, to be responsible for technical services and research in oil and gas exploration and production. "We must focus our technology efforts more clearly to improve the long-term competitiveness of the company," said Bill Crain, corporate vice president of exploration and production.
The president of the new Houston-based subsidariy is Donald L. Paul, 46 years old, the vice president of exploration research for the Chevron Oil Field Research Company.
Chevron said in April that it would slash its exploration and production subsidiary by 2,300 workers, or 28 percent of its staff. The company also announced in April that it planned to lay off 700 workers at its refinery in Port Arthur, Tex.
Chevron's earnings have suffered lately along with those of other oil companies because of lower prices for crude oil and natural gas, and weak demand for chemicals and refined products. In the first quarter, its net income was $304 million on revenues of $9.7 billion, compared with $557 million on revenues of $10.8 billion in the period a year earlier.
Because of its focus on the United States market, Ron Londe, an analyst with A. G. Edwards, said the company's fortunes should improve with the nation's economy. "I think they're doing the right things to improve the company, and when things turn around, you'll see benefits to the bottom line," he said.

Banks Are Urged to Discuss Study on Low-Income Loans

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
A community group that has often criticized banks for lending too little in low-income areas sent letters last week to the chief executives of more than 350 banks across the country, asking them to participate in a conference on July 12 in New York City to discuss new lending programs.
The community group -- the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, known as Acorn -- is expected to publish a study on Thursday of bank lending and deposit-taking showing that residents of low-income areas provide far more in deposits to banks than the banks use to make loans in those areas. 
 Acorn officials describe the study as proof that banks are denying credit to businesses and consumers in low-income areas, and thus contributing to the areas' economic problems.
 
 
An 'Eye-Opening' Difference
 "The discrepancy between what banks take in deposits in low-income areas and what they issue in loans is not surprising,' said John L. Kest, Acorn's chief organizer in New York City. "But the magnitude of the gap is eye-opening."
Acorn officials had not yet compiled all the data for the study, which covers 20 cities and does not focus on the practices of individual banks. Other studies, however, have shown that some banks have issued loans equal to only 25 percent of the deposits they collect in low-income neighborhoods, or half the lending rate in higher-income neighborhoods.
Deepak Bhargava, a legislative representative at Acorn's Washington office, said the low level of lending in poor neighborhoods was one reason some banks cited when contending that branches in poor areas were not profitable and should be closed. He noted that the new study was limited to mortgage lending because data on other kinds of bank loans were not readily available with the ZIP codes of the borrowers.
 Although people do not always do their banking where they live, Mr. Bhargava said the gap between deposits and mortgage loans was great enough to justify more efforts by bankers to issue loans in poor areas.
Chemical Bank of New York is the largest bank so far to agree to attend the conference. "We are interested in economic development of the low-income areas where we do business, and Acorn's agenda is also our agenda," said Carol Parry, managing director at Chemical for community development.
Acorn is seeking to help banks develop lending programs that would reduce the high rejection rate for low-income mortgage applicants and would make more money available for small businesses.

HEADLINE: Purchasing Index Has A Big Gain

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Spurred by sharp increases in industrial production and exports, the nation's manufacturing economy expanded robustly in May, according to a monthly survey of the nation's purchasing managers. Economists interpreted the rise as a strong sign that the economy was strengthening.
The National Association of Purchasing Management said its index of economic activity rose to 56.3 percent in May from 51.3 percent in April. It was the index's highest reading in nearly four years; the figure stood at 58.2 percent in July 1988. The group says a reading below 50 percent indicates that the economy is contracting, while a reading above 50 is a sign of expansion. 
 "It's a solid sign that this recovery is shaping up as a manufacturing-led recovery," said Stephen H. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. "We've got manufacturing companies benefiting from a competitive dollar, from restructurings and lean inventories. And as demand picks up, they are really building momentum. And all the signs suggest that this manufacturing revival is for real and has staying power."
 
 
First Monthly Indicator
 The monthly index is compiled from a survey of more than 300 purchasing managers at a wide range of industrial companies. It is considered important because it is the first significant indicator of economic activity in the previous month.
Last week, the Commerce Department said that the economy grew 2.4 percent in the first quarter, the largest quarterly gain in three years. The department also said corporate profits increased at an annual rate of 8 percent, the highest gain in four years.
But the purchasing managers report came amid other, mixed economic news today. The Commerce Department said that income from wages, salaries, rents and other sources inched up a tenth of a percent in April, and that consumer spending rose three-tenths of a percent. In a more bullish report, the department said the country's trade performance in the first quarter of 1992 was its second best in nearly a decade, largely because of lower oil prices. The merchandise trade deficit shrank by 5.8 percent, to $17.5 billion. But construction spending slipped slightly in April. [Page D20.]
 
 
Bad News for Bonds
 The sharp increase in the purchasing managers' report was taken as an unfavorable development in the bond market, where it apparently curbed hopes for additional cuts in interest rates by the Federal Reserve to stimulate the economy.
"After slowing in April, the economy resumed the steady growth trend, which began in February, with a sharp increase in May," said Robert J. Bretz, director of corporate purchasing at Pitney Bowes Inc. and the chairman of the purchasing managers' survey committee. He added that "the lofty level of new orders should be more than enough to assure that growth in the second quarter" will be respectably better than in the first.
New orders, which have generally remained strong for several months, rose sharply in May, the report said. The association's index of new orders rose to 61 percent, from 56.7 percent in April. The increase in new orders is widely expected to carry over into growth in industrial production.
Orders for export, which had slipped in recent months, also showed a strong increase, despite the generally higher value of the dollar and a slowdown in many foreign economies. The association's index of new orders for export rose to 56.9 percent, from 52.3 percent in April.
 As a result of the increases in orders, production soared in May to the highest level in more than four years. The production index rose to 62.9 percent in May from 56.6 percent in April. The association said that the production improvement was widespread and affected virtually all industries.
The association's price index also rose sharply, to 56.3 in May from 49.6 in April. It was the highest level since December 1990, when the index stood at 58.4 percent. The association said that many manufacturers, who have been trying to raise prices for some time, were beginning to have some success, largely because of increased demand for some products.
Inventories rose sharply in May, with the index of inventories increasing to 49.2 percent, from 42.4 percent in April.
Employment levels increased in May, with the association's employment index rising to 49.1 percent, from 43.9 percent in April. The May figure was the highest since April 1989, when the index stood at 50 percent. Economists said the May increase was a signal that the economic recovery was beginning to have some impact on industrial companies' hiring patterns.

HEADLINE: Board Room Back-Scratching?

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
At first glance, the latest proxy statement from the B. F. Goodrich Company sounds all the right notes in the executive pay debate. It details for the first time how the company links pay and performance and boasts that executive pay is reviewed by a board committee that "consists entirely of outside directors."
What the proxy does not spotlight is that until a year ago one of the outside directors who helped set the pay for Goodrich's chief executive, John D. Ong, was Joseph A. Pichler, the chief executive of the Kroger Company -- whose compensation committee included Mr. Ong as an outside director. Thus, Mr. Pichler's $890,370 pay for 1991 was partly determined by a man whose own $905,113 pay Mr. Pichler helped set. 
 Such interlocking arrangements, which are difficult to detect from public documents, do not in themselves constitute impropriety. Indeed, Mr. Ong's 1991 pay dropped by about a million dollars from 1990.
Yet in a year when politicians, investors and even the Japanese are pointing to executive pay as a symbol of corporate America's ills, the potential for conflicts is being singled out by some shareholder activists and others as evidence that some board rooms are closed societies where friends often decide sensitive issues among themselves.
"That's the worst sort of potential conflict of interest, when you're serving on each other's jury to determine compensation," said Thomas J. Neff. president of Spencer Stuart, an executive search firm that conducts about 50 director searches a year in the United States. "There's the temptation and the risk of not being objective."
A recent computer search of the proxy statements of the 788 largest public companies by Directorship, a Westport, Conn., consulting firm, disclosed 39 instances, or nearly 5 percent, where heads of companies sit on each other's boards. Five of those couplings have unusual influence over each other's pay since they also sit on each other's compensation committees.
Besides Goodrich and Kroger, they are Conagra Inc. and Valmont Industries; the Kellogg Company and the Upjohn Company; the Sonoco Products Company and the Nationsbank Corporation, and Allergan Inc. and Beckman Instruments Inc.
It is only in the last few years that computers have been enlisted to help analyze the minutiae contained in corporate documents that disclose executive pay. But sociologists, business historians and others who have studied the issue believe that the incidence of interlocking directorships has remained fairly constant since the early part of the century, when the fear was collusion.
Catapulting the issue back into the spotlight today is the public's concern over the spectacle of an already well-paid corporate elite more preoccupied with their pay packages than corporate performance. Now, there is growing apprehension that those charged with policing pay are not always independent.
The mere presence of interlocking directors does not automatically raise improprieties. Indeed senior executives at 3 of the 10 companies in question including Goodrich saw their total compensation tumble in 1991, while the others for the most part took home pay packages that were roughly clustered around the $2 million or so that the average chief executive earned in those years. But the abundance of interlocking directorships may be symptomatic of some of the deeper problems in the board room.
Not surprisingly, 5 of the 10 companies with interlocking compensation committee members include other members whose independence could be questioned.
For instance, 4 of the 10 companies have executives on their compensation committees whose business dealings with the company are extensive enough that they have to be disclosed in the proxy statements.
 
Relatives on Committee
 Sonoco Products, a packaging concern based in Hartsville, S.C., describes the members of its compensation committees as nonemployees of the company. Nonetheless, it has one executive on its compensation committee who once worked for the company and another whose objectivity could very well be tested: He is F .L. H. Coker, brother of the chief executive, C. W. Coker.
The company does show some restraint. Also on its board, though not on its compensation committee, is a third Coker, J. L., the chief executive's cousin, and a fourth director, J. C. Fort, whom a company spokesman described as a distant relative of Mr. Coker, though that fact is omitted from the proxy. A Coker family ancestor founded the company, although none of the four descendants on the board individually own more than 2 percent of the company's stock.
And indeed, the precise makeup of the committee may be moot. According to the proxy, the committee annually "reviews the salaries of executive officers and recommends increases as deemed appropriate." The possibility of salary decreases is never broached.
"Last year was just about the second time in over 20 years when our earnings from continuing operations didn't better the previous year," said Richard Puffer, Sonoco's spokesman. "So, we normally do have increases."
Asked about the propriety of these symbiotic relationships, the 10 companies insisted that such people should be counted as outside directors so long as they were not currently on the payroll.
Even Goodrich and Kroger, which took Mr. Ong and Mr. Pichler off each other's compensation committees last year, defended the arrangement while it lasted and explained the moves as nothing more than the normal rotation of committee assignments. "The important thing to focus on is whether the company's compensation program is performance-based, and ours is," said Gary Habegger, Goodrich's vice president for human resources. "If it is, you have much less chance for that type of situation to be a real issue."
Two companies, Nationsbank and Valmont, do not contend that their compensation committees consist exclusively of outsiders. After all, Nationsbank's chief executive, Hugh L. McColl Jr., serves on his company's compensation committee and Valmont's chairman and biggest shareholder, Robert B. Daugherty, sits on his company's committee.
Spokesmen for both companies point out that neither man is chairman of his respective committee and that they abstain whenever their own pay is discussed. "If they were the sole members of the compensation committee, you'd have a point," said Brian Stanley, the treasurer of Valmont, a metal fabricator outside Omaha. "But when we have six people, it's just not an issue."
Most companies are free to put anyone they please on their compensation committee -- since there is no Federal requirement to even form a committee. "If you do your compensation by throwing darts against the wall, as long as you disclose it, you've fulfilled your duties," said John D. Heine, a spokesman for the Securities and Exchange Commission.
That regulatory attitude may be one reason why 75, or 9.5 percent, of the 788 companies in the Directorship study report that their chairmen serve on the panels that decide their pay. Even people who are very much part of the business establishment say that such committee configurations create unfortunate appearance problems. Indeed, the Business Roundtable, a group of the leaders of several major companies, recommended as much as two years ago that compensation committees should "limit membership to nonmanagement directors only."
Not doing that "opens you up for a lot of difficult scrutiny," said Thomas F. Madison, the president of markets for U S West Communications and a director who serves on several compensation committees, including Valmont's. Though he said he ordinarily would not tolerate having the chief executive on the compensation committee, he said Valmont was a special case since Mr. Daugherty dropped the chief executive's title in 1988 and drew relatively little compensation from the company.
Since chief executives have exactly the sort of experience that other bosses value, many shareholders say they would tolerate having a few chief executives in the mix.
But how tough might a watchdog be when the object of surveillance can always retaliate? "It would just be very difficult for the type of independence that is required of a board member to exist in that kind of environment," said Ralph V. Whitworth, president of the United Shareholders Association.
Further skewing how much chief executives take home on average is the tendency of many companies to deliberately set pay above their industry average to prevent defections. "That process of peer adustment is a problem to me as an economist because I see what it does to the average," said M. Kathryn Eickhoff, an economist who serves on the boards of five large public companies, including Upjohn.
The other culprit, in her view, is not interlocking directorships like the one that exists between Upjohn and Kellogg but simply the sheer number of chief executives who serve on compensation committees.
"I wonder whether it is too easy for them to rationalize the salaries being suggested," she said. "It seems to me it's easier to find such salaries acceptable if you've previously received one."
 
Regional Patterns Seen
 Another common pattern is that interlocking directors tend to be part of tight regional clusters, such as Conagra and Valmont, both Nebraska companies. "We're a fairly small town and we don't have many public companies that would be called industrials, so there's not a great variety of locals to draw from," said Charles M. Harper, chief executive of Conagra and a member of the compensation committee of Valmont.
Personally, he does not see anything wrong with looking close to home for directorial talent. "If I trusted somebody, I don't care if they were a second cousin to the c.e.o.," said Mr. Harper, who predicts that his own fiscal year 1992 compensation will be down significantly, as he believes it should, given this year's performance. "The way to test that from a shareholder's point of view is what are the results, and how does compensation track with results?"

HEADLINE: Report Benefits Big 3's Shares

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 1

 BODY:
Shares of Detroit's Big Three auto makers jumped today on a report that the companies planned to raise third-quarter production sharply.
The General Motors Corporation topped the New York Stock Exchange's list of most-active stocks, gaining $2.125, to $41.50. The second-most-active issue was Chrysler, which jumped $1.625, to $19.75. Ford Motor's shares were the third most heavily traded, rising $2, to $46.375. 
 Analysts said investors rushed to buy the shares based on a report in Ward's Automotive Reports, a trade publication. Ward's said the American car makers and the seven Japanese "transplant" companies planned to build 17.4 percent more cars and 19.5 percent more trucks in the third quarter than they did a year earlier.
The production goals were stronger than expected, said David Garrity, an analyst at McDonald & Company. "That's indicating stronger demand," he said.
Mr. Garrity said the third-quarter production schedules added to growing evidence, including stronger sales and rising consumer confidence, that the American industry was recovering from its worst year ever. The Big Three auto makers lost a combined $4.5 billion last year.
Many analysts had predicted a third-quarter loss for the nation's car makers. But analysts have recently revised their figures upward.

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Performance Much Better in Quarter

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 1

 BODY:
The country's trade performance in the first three months of 1992 was its second best in nearly a decade, the Government said today.
The Commerce Department said that the country's merchandise trade deficit shrank by 5.8 percent, to $17.5 billion in the first quarter from $18.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 1991, as a big decline in oil prices helped offset a slowdown in export demand. 
 Since the spring of 1983, only a $16.4 billion deficit in the spring of last year was lower.
Exports totaled $107.83 billion in the quarter, essentially unchanged from the last three months of 1991, while imports fell nine-tenths of 1 percent, to $125.29 billion. The trade deficit is the difference between imports and exports. American demand for manufactured goods and farm products climbed by $743 million, but was offset by a 15 percent drop in the bill for imported oil, by $1.8 billion, to $10.4 billion, reflecting a price decline to $15.28 a barrel, down from $18.04 in the fourth quarter. The volume was essentially unchanged at 7.42 million barrels a day.
United States exports were off by $26 million, leaving them essentially unchanged from their fourth-quarter level, which had been a record high.
Economists said the lack of further growth in this area showed that the export boom, one of the few bright spots over the last three years, was ending. Last year's recession, which saw the economy shrink by seven-tenths of 1 percent, would have been three times as bad if it had not been for strength in overseas sales, Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch, said.
"But this year the shoe is on the other foot," Mr. Steinberg said. "The U.S. economy is beginning to recover, but the rest of the world economy is either in or near recession."
Mr. Steinberg forecast that this year's trade deficit was likely to worsen by around $10 billion, reflecting sluggish demand in Europe, Japan and Canada. Paul Lally, an economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates, said he believed the country's trade deficit would gradually deteriorate for the rest of the year "as our economy perks up, and there is sluggishness overseas." Such forecasts are not welcome news to Bush Administration officials, who are counting on further export gains to help keep the recovery alive in an election year.
The Administration has been pressing Germany and Japan in particular to stimulate their domestic economies to lift demand for American products.
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said that while the Administration was happy with recent interest rate cuts by the Bank of Japan, he still hoped to see the Japanese Government increase spending even more to stimulate domestic demand and lower the country's growing trade surplus.

HEADLINE: Consumer Income Rose 0.1% in April, U.S. Says

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 1

 BODY:
A revival in the manufacturing sector led to a slight rise in consumer incomes during April, the Government said today, raising hopes that the recovery is gathering momentum.
The Commerce Department said income from wages, salaries, rents and other sources inched up one-tenth of 1 percent in April. It was the third increase in a row but was well below gains of four-tenths of 1 percent in March and 1 percent in February. 
 But the department said manufacturing payrolls jumped by $4.4 billion in April, four times the $1.1 billion increase registered in March.
 
Consumer Spending Rose 0.3%
Consumer spending, the engine of recovery that fuels two-thirds of national economic activity, rose three-tenths of 1 percent in April after a flat performance in March.
Jack Albertine, an economist who heads Albertine Enterprises Inc. in Washington, said the figures showed "a recovery that is on track, with slow but steady gains being made in most sectors."
Lynn Reaser, an economist with First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles, referring to stronger hiring by manufacturing companies, said, "That will support increased consumer spending in May after the slowdowns we've seen in March and April."
Figures on May employment are scheduled for publication by the Labor Department on Friday.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Has Mixed Results Despite U.S. Economic Data

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled mixed on world currency markets yesterday, losing ground in domestic trading despite good news about the health of the American economy.
Gold prices rose after losing ground overseas. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $337.80 an ounce, up $1.40 from Friday. The Republic National Bank said gold was up $1.35, to a late bid of $337.60. 
 The dollar settled higher in overseas trading, aided by a report showing that American manufacturing strengthened in May for the fourth straight month and grew at the fastest clip in almost four years, according to the National Association of Purchasing Management.
But the report was balanced somewhat by fresh Government data showing that Americans' incomes and spending rose anemically in April while construction spending fell three-tenths of 1 percent. The data seemed to underscore the fitful nature of the economic recovery.
 
'Down Trend' Seen for Dollar
 Unconfirmed reports that the Bank of Japan had entered the market to sell dollars and buy yen in a move to support the Japanese currency pulled the dollar from its highs.
"It's perceived that the dollar has slipped into a down trend," said Kevin Lawrie, director of foreign exchange at the Bank of Boston. "If a string of good economic data is not enough to bring the dollar higher, I don't know what is."
In Tokyo the dollar closed at 126.78 yen, down 1.55 yen from last Friday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 127.55 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 126.95 yen, down from 127.60 yen on Friday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.8220, from $1.8295 late Friday. In New York it cost $1.8275 to buy one pound, less expensive than Friday's $1.8282.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.6045 German marks, down from 1.6080; 1.4550 Swiss francs, down from 1.4560; 5.3910 French francs, down from 5.3990; 1,209.00 Italian lire, down from 1,210.00, and 1.2031 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2048.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
The Trend In Dividend Payments

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
The revival in dividend payments may be running out of gas.
The Standard & Poor's Corporation reported yesterday that 106 companies announced dividend increases in May. That figure was up from 89 in May 1991, but was below the 110 that reported increases in May 1990, on the eve of the recession. 
 The S.& P. figures also showed that 13 companies reduced their dividends in May, one more than in May 1991. It was the first time this year that that figure showed an increase, providing another indication that the revival of dividends might be slowing.
Changes in dividends are often lagging indicators of corporate performance, because companies hesitate to raise dividends until managements are certain that profits have risen and will not soon decline, and because companies often try to avoid cutting dividends until bad news on the profit front is unmistakable. Thus the dip in good news on dividends need not be a sign that the economy is again weakening.
Nonetheless, the news on May dividends did remove some of the excitement -- and the hopes for a rapid revival in corporate profits -- that was generated when S.& P. reported a month ago that dividend payouts had risen to 136 in April, exceeding not only 1991's recession figure of 106 but also the April 1990 level of 129.
The S.& P. figures count only the number of companies that change their dividends, not the amount of the changes. As such, the figures provide a view of actions by both large and small companies.
But another indicator of dividend payments, reflecting the large companies that dominate the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index, moved higher in May. That could be a sign that larger companies are doing better than the rest, which would be consistent with the stock market's movement since early this year, in which large stocks generally outperformed smaller ones.
Arnold Kaufman, the editor of Standard & Poor's Outlook newsletter, said that the indicated annual payout rate of the S.& P. 500 index, assuming all companies pay their current dividends for the foreseeable future, without increases or decreases, was now $12.42, up from a rate of $12.28 at the end of April.
That rise came as companies from Home Depot to McDonald's, and from Waste Management to American International, all members of the S.& P. 500, announced higher dividends.
Last year, the S.& P. 500 paid $12.20 in dividends. But early this year, with many companies cutting payouts, the annual rate was down to $12.13. Mr. Kaufman estimated that the total for this year would rise by 5 percent.
Although profits were surprisingly strong in the first quarter of this year, dividend increases may still be held back by the fact that dividends now make up an unusually large percentage of profits. For that proportion to decline to more normal levels, profits will have to rise faster than dividend payouts.
The figures on the numbers of companies raising dividends are highly seasonal, because many companies make dividend decisions in the same month each year. Mr. Kaufman said that May was one of the less active months and that it was too early to conclude that this year's mild surge in the number of companies increasing dividends was slowing.
He said he expected the number of companies raising payouts this year to be up about 18 percent, to around the same level as in 1990. That year, he noted, "was not a good year, but it was not a disaster like 1991," when a total of 1,086 dividend increases was announced, down from 1,263 in 1990.
The 1991 figure was the lowest for any full year since 1962, with the exception of 1970 and 1971, when Federal wage and price controls restrained dividend increases.

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
Owners Take Leash And Make It Longer

BYLINE: By Murray Chass

 BODY:
Rosa Wilson was filled with pride yesterday when the Wilson family of Bamberg, S.C., learned that son Preston was a first-round choice of the Mets in the baseball draft of high school and college players. She was even prouder that "my baby," an outfielder and pitcher and the president of the Ehrhardt High School student body, will graduate Thursday with a 4.0 grade average.
But there was one aspect of this week's major developments in the life of her son and Mookie Wilson's adopted son that did not please Rosa Wilson: the new rule that extends a club's rights to a drafted player from one year to as long as five years. 
 "We are aware of the rule," she said by telephone. "I hate it. I don't think it's fair. I really don't think it's fair for a club to tie up a player that long. It's not fair to any player."
When the club owners changed the rule earlier this year, they were not trying to be fair to the high school and college students. They said the rule would actually encourage high school students to go to college because they could still sign with the drafting team when they finished. But they didn't fool anyone.
This is the Brien Taylor rule, named for the No. 1 pick a year ago, who used the threat of going to college -- a place he previously had made clear he had no desire to be -- to extract $1.55 million from the Yankees. The rule is intended to eliminate such a threat as a negotiating weapon and reduce the cost of signing the player.
"There's been so much controversy about this rule that I don't really know everything about it," said Derek Jeter, the high school shortstop the Yankees made their first-round pick this year. "My goal is just to play professionally. I guess there's nothing I can do about it."
Neither Jeter nor any other drafted player has any desire to fight the rule in court, but next Monday, George Nicolau, baseball's arbitrator, will begin a hearing on the Players Association's challenge to the rule. The owners' labor lawyers will argue that Nicolau doesn't have jurisdiction because amateur players aren't covered by the collective bargaining agreement. Union lawyers will counter that Nicolau does have jurisdiction and, anyway, the fairness issue overrides the jurisdictional question.
Allocation without representation is bad enough; drafts in all sports always have impinged on the rights of the players drafted because they don't have a say in where they will be working. But restricting the drafted player to negotiating with one club until one year after he leaves college makes the procedure even more onerous for the player, if economical for the club.
Economics dictated this year's draft. Scott Boras, the devil incarnate in the clubs' view, called it "the Wall Street draft."
"It's not a talent draft," said Boras, the agent who "advised" Taylor and other wealthy young men before him. "It's determined by what a team can assure itself it can sign a player for. On Wall Street, the value of the stock on the market is not necessarily the true value of the piece of paper. That's what you have here now. Economics are playing more a part of this."
When Houston selected third baseman Phil Nevin, Cleveland chose relief pitcher Paul Shuey and Montreal picked pitcher B. J. Wallace in the first three selections yesterday, they did not draft the player they felt was the most talented available. They drafted the player they felt they could sign for what they were willing to spend.
The Baltimore Orioles, awash in money from the gold mine they have discovered at Camden Yards, were the first team to pick they player considered the best available, money notwithstanding. Drafting fourth, they took Jeffrey Hammonds, a Stanford outfielder scouts generally felt was the best player in the draft.
Charles Johnson, a catcher with the University of Miami in the College World Series, was considered one of the best in the draft, but he lasted until the very last pick in the first round. The expansion Florida Marlins, Johnson's hometown team, finally uttered his name.
Unlike other clubs, the Yankees, for one, the Marlins were not uttering Boras's name in vain. Boras will advise Johnson and his family -- N.C.A.A. rules, absurd in their own right, prohibit college players from having agents.
So many clubs have expressed their distaste for Boras that the father of one prospective first-rounder felt compelled to correct an erroneous newsaper report that Boras would advise his son.
On May 22, Calvin Tucker of Chase City, Va., wrote the following to the Players Association: "USA Today printed incorrect information about my son Michael Tucker. Mr. Scott Boras is not and will not be our family adviser, agent or anything else. Please let the teams know this for us."
The association passed on the information to the clubs, and yesterday the Kansas City Royals made shortstop Michael Tucker the 10th pick in the draft.
"The clubs are putting themselves in a questionable legal position because that's a restraint of trade," Boras, a lawyer, said.
Boras said that Brien Taylor's mother was told last year by "something like 15 clubs" that if Boras were advising the family they would not draft the flame-throwing pitcher. Boras said Charles Johnson's family was contacted by 13 or 14 clubs asking if he would sign for a certain amount, numbers, he added, "far below his true-market value."
At least Johnson won't be subjected to the new rule. He and 14 other first-round selections had been chosen in prior drafts and thus come under the old rule that gives the drafting club rights to the player until the next draft. Preston Wilson and a dozen other first-rounders face the fallout from the Brien Taylor signing.
"We're going to leave it totally in the hands of his father," Rosa Wilson said of the former Mets' outfielder. "He definitely had his share of dealings with the business aspect. We'll be watching it very closely."

HEADLINE: Architects Rediscover the Best City Planners: Citizens

BYLINE: By DANIEL GOLEMAN

 BODY:
BORROWING the methods of social science, a school of architects and urban planners is going beyond bricks and mortar to incorporate the often-ignored needs and preferences of those who will use public projects in their design.
That common-sense approach is taken for granted when people build for themselves, and it enjoyed a short-lived prominence in the urban planning of the 1960's and 1970's. But social scientists say it is rare in the inner city. 
 The results, they say, are parks and playgrounds that go unused, public housing that rapidly decays because people living there do not care for it and neighborhoods that are destroyed by projects meant to preserve them.
"It remains a radical idea to most architects in public projects to talk to the people who will use what they build, instead of just to those agencies who hire them," said Troy West, an architect at the School of Architecture of the New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark. "We have several sociologists on our architecture faculty. We believe in integrating design with how people actually live, rather than forcing their lives to fit our designs."
The resurgence of this type of planning, known as "participatory design" or "advocacy planning," is being led by groups of social scientists, architects and urban planners who see themselves as being at the service of residents for whom they are building, rather than simply seeking to please the agencies that finance projects.
"Advocacy planning means speaking for those who will actually use the building, instead of doing research about them for those who hold the power," said Dr. Roger Hart, a psychologist who directs the Children's Environments Research Group at the City University of New York Graduate School. "It means helping people in a community do their own planning."
Mr. West cited very recently built low-income housing in Newark as an example of what happens when architects never meet the people who will use their buildings. "The houses are concrete blocks with tiny windows that make them look like prisons, no porches, and, instead of having yards, the houses front on a parking lot," he said, even though there was no need for the parking.
By contrast, a "sweat-equity" project of low-income housing near New Haven on which Mr. West worked with the occupants in the redesign has very different features: large, sunny windows, wood siding that can be freshly painted every few years, yards where gardens can be grown or children can play and porches where people can gather with neighbors in warm weather.
Like many others, the Newark project seems to have been designed to protect the buildings against the people who live there, rather than the effort in New Haven to give people buildings they will like and care for.
Mr. West first employed the new planning approach in successfully rebuilding an Pittsburgh neighborhood after riots there in the mid-1960's, and it is coming to center stage again.
Perhaps the most methodical example of advocacy planning is an international movement called "Healthy Cities." The movement, involving researchers in public health, social science and urban studies, measures the "health" of cities or neighborhoods using 30 or more variables, including rates of violent crimes, unemployment, poverty, homelessness, loneliness, air pollution, death and even an "annoyance index" linked to levels of noise and dirt.
 
'Multiplicity of Life'
 Such measures, most based on data already collected, are used to point to the areas of most urgent need in a city. Then these social scientists apply the participatory approach, "something akin to family therapy for a city," said Dr. Leonard Duhl, a psychiatrist and professor of public health and city planning at the University of California at Berkeley who is a founder of the Healthy Cities program.
The program convenes meetings of residents, business people, community groups and city agencies, where all are on an equal footing. Those most affected by a problem are asked to help from the start in designing a solution.
"You've got to deal with the multiplicity of life in the city rather than just one dimension," said Dr. Duhl, who is convening a meeting of those involved in Healthy City programs around the world, sponsored by the World Health Organization, in San Francisco in December 1993.
In Quebec, for example, a Healthy City project consulted with nearly 6,000 citizens of Rouyn-Noranda, a mining town of 27,000 northwest of Montreal. The result was six plans of action, including reducing sulfur emissions from a local smelter, and building a botanical garden and a recreational park for year-round use. In another Quebec city, the projects were very different, with prevention of vandalism near the top of the list.
 
Difference in Practice
 But the Healthy Cities approach is the exception rather than the rule. While many city planners and architects invoke the words of involving those for whom they plan, few actually do so in any meaningful way, proponents of advocacy planning say. For example, even when government guidelines require consulting those who will use buildings about the design, planners typically nod in that direction by simply offering two different designs and using public meetings to ask community leaders to choose one.
By contrast, full involvement means that people who will use a project are among those generating the basic specifications for it.
"It's the detailed knowledge that residents have that will make a design work or not," said Dr. Hart. "What will work is unique to each site. You have to adapt your design based on what residents tell you."
A case in point is the design of a playground to be built in the West Farms neighborhood, a poor, drug-ridden district of the South Bronx, peppered with glass-strewn vacant lots and bordered by two expressways and the Bronx Zoo.
In research with Selim Iltus, an architect and environmental psychologist, Dr. Hart held long discussions with groups of parents, teen-agers and children. It emerged that neighborhood residents avoided several city-built playgrounds in favor of impromptu basketball courts improvised using traffic signs as backboards and a vacant lot several blocks out of the neighborhood that is also used for basketball.
 
Dangers at Playgrounds
 To live in a topography of peril, parents, children and teen-agers avoid zones of drug dealers, crack users, prostitutes and homeless people. The city-built basketball court was popular 10 years ago, for instance, but since then it has become the most heavily used corner for drug deals.
Parents would not let their children play after school in two large, open schoolyards because they said the schoolyards were too isolated. The Bronx River Park playground was similarly off limits because it is home to drug dealers and prostitutes.
With neighborhood residents as co-researchers, Dr. Hart and his students conducted a series of surveys to find a site and design for a playground that would be used. Part of that planning involved asking the 900 students of the local public school what they would like in the playground.
What people think of as well-equipped playgrounds typically take care of only 10 percent of what children like to do when they play, Dr. Hart found in his research.
The standard features, like jungle gyms, are irrelevant to imaginary play like "house," to efforts like dam and road-building in dirt or sand and to socializing. "Getting together and talking in pairs or small groups is the single most popular playground activity," Dr. Hart said.
In addition, he found that standard playgrounds with basketball courts and baseball diamonds ignored the needs of girls. "Conventional wisdom in playground design holds that what teen-age girls mainly want is seats so they can watch boys play basketball and other sports, Dr. Hart said. "If you ask girls, that's just not so. But that's what they've been left with."
He found that teen-age girls in West Farms wanted a volleyball court, a small stage to practice dancing and out-of-the-way places where they could sit and talk.
The city has budgeted more than $2 million for the new playground in West Farms. Dr. Hart and his students have acted as consultants to help the neighborhood tell the Park Department just where in the neighborhood the playground will work best and what should be in it. The place chosen is an empty lot next to a strip of stores.
"The residents chose that site because between police on foot, shoppers, and association patrols, there will be enough eyes to protect the children there," Dr. Hart said. But rather than wait the five or so years it will take the city to begin building, a residents' association will hold its own unofficial opening of the lot, with a baseball diamond and other equipment residents are making themselves, on the Fourth of July.
"One of the goals of participation in planning is to develop a sense of symbolic ownership and control -- that it's your neighborhood, your community," said Mark Francis, a landscape architect at the University of California at Davis, a leader of the advocacy planning movement.
"I got a call from a colleague who has been helping people in South-Central Los Angeles take vacant land and turn it into gardens or little parks," Mr. Francis said. "During the riots not one of these was touched, even though some were right next to burned stores. The gardens and parks were seen as community space, while the stores were seen as invaders."

HEADLINE: New York Rediscovers the U.N.

 BODY:
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany has come up with an offer that three United Nations agencies in New York City may find hard to refuse. Come to Bonn, says Mr. Kohl, and we'll pay the moving expenses, give you rent-free offices and toss in German lessons for your staff. Another agency, the United Nations Children's Fund, is being tempted by suburban New Rochelle, which offers an annual rent of $531,156, compared with the $10 million Unicef now pays.
The right response for New York City is an effective counter-campaign. This means providing short-term inducements and a long-term plan for a growing world organization. It also means nudging Washington to behave responsibly by paying its U.N. dues, on time and in full. 
 For New York, more is at stake than losing 2,300 jobs, which generate $200 million in salaries, rents and other expenses. The U.N. also generates news and tourism, global conferences and state visits; it gives New York its cachet as an international capital. If four agencies depart, other suitors will soon appear to grab what remains.
The U.N. agencies that Bonn covets -- the Development Program, the Population Fund and the Development Fund for Women -- now occupy rented offices in two buildings facing U.N. Plaza and in the Daily News building. Total annual rent is around $14 million. Shaving that figure by finding new space or renegotiating leases is a task ideally suited to Barry Sullivan, the city's new Deputy Mayor for finance and economic development.
More ambitious proposals are also essential. With new members and larger tasks, the U.N. has outgrown its glass shell. It thus makes eminent sense to begin searching now for space elsewhere. One possibility is Hunters Point in Queens, already scheduled for commercial and residential development. According to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns some of the land, waterborne transport could provide a direct link to U.N. headquarters.
The precondition for any such effort, however, is ending Washington's shameful financial delinquency; the U.S. owes the U.N. $555 million in general dues and $112 million for peacekeeping. Not only is Germany paid up, but Mr. Kohl promises a substantial increase in voluntary contributions. The Bush Administration can hardly fault Mr. Kohl's generous effort to fill empty buildings in Bonn as Germany's capital moves to Berlin.
In any case, the U.N. stands to benefit from this competition. New York's concern marks a wholesome change from the days when former Mayor Edward Koch groused about troublesome foreigners and a Reagan Administration official said he would gladly bid adieu at dockside to the U.N. Nowadays the U.N. is viewed as a jewel in the city's crown; keeping it there will take energy and diligence, in New York and in Washington.

HEADLINE: When Perot Says 'Goofy,' Voters Say Amen

BYLINE: By Cokie Roberts; Cokie Roberts is a correspondent for ABC News and an analyst for National Public Radio.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Whatever pathetically small percentage of eligible voters casts ballots in the final round of primaries today, on their way out of the booth a good number will almost certainly tell pollsters that other candidates should have been on the ballot, that the choice leaves them cold. That's been true throughout this nomination season. The difference this time: a lot of voters now know the name of their ideal contender, Ross Perot.
If any one incident explains the Texas billionaire's appeal, it's the flap over the television character Murphy Brown. While Vice President Dan Quayle attacked her and Gov. Bill Clinton solemnly stated that the unwed anchor was less than an ideal role model, and while White House and Republican campaign operatives debated the wisdom of taking on a popular situation comedy, and while columnists and commentators entered the fray weightily on all sides, Ross Perot had only one word for the spectacle of grownups debating the decisions of a fictional character -- "goofy." 
 The voters have shouted that message for months. They started the primary season by elevating someone the media had virtually ignored, Paul Tsongas, and removing the men from Washington, two senators, from the contest. They kept the born-again outsider candidacy of Jerry Brown alive until the end and defied the pundits who early on declared Bill Clinton dead, even as voters told exit pollsters they questioned whether he had the honesty and integrity to be President.
Despite the continued presence of Pat Buchanan on the ballot, most Republicans who bothered to vote went for President Bush but gave him high disapproval ratings. Democrats nominated little-known women to carry their banner into the Senate races in Pennsylvania and Illinois, and in both parties exit polls showed huge percentages expressing dissatisfaction with or anger at the Government.
And why not? Why would people who feel strapped by a stagnant economy and burdened by taxes that don't seem to buy anything be satisfied? In interviews all over the country, voters recite the same refrain. More and and more money comes out of paychecks for Social Security and Medicare, they say, but we worry about the long-term care for our parents and rising health insurance premiums for ourselves and our children.
They say that despite increasing state taxes, budget cutbacks have caused overcrowded classes in public schools, reduced hours in public libraries and eliminated recreation department programs, so we have to send our kids to private schools.
They say they hate seeing homeless people and knowing children go to bed hungry right here in the U.S., but no one seems to be doing anything about it. "I grew up in this neighborhood, when nobody locked their doors, and now I'm afraid to go outside alone at night," they say.
Nobody trusts the politicians of either party, or the Government, to fix the problems. They think George Bush is out of touch, playing golf with his rich friends. They think the Democrats are out of control, ready to give their hard-earned money to the bureaucrats who administer programs -- the people who make it an all-day event to renew a driver's license, an ordeal to get a copy of a birth certificate. But voters also don't buy Democratic plans to soak the rich or Republican attempts to eliminate Government programs.
What the voters tell us most is that they are tired of politicians saying its someone else's fault. Jimmy Carter ran to clean up the mess in Washington, to be the President who would never lie. Ronald Reagan ran to clean up the mess in Washington -- even in his second term. George Bush ran to carry on the Reagan legacy. Members of Congress run against their own institution. And the public screams: "Stop fixing the blame. Fix the problems."
Enter Ross Perot. A man who seems to be able to fix things. A man not tied to either party. Americans always proclaim that they vote for the man, not the party, anyway. What better way to prove the point? As for President, most vote the way their gut tells them to, not on the issues. So it doesn't much matter -- it could even be a plus -- that Mr. Perot's programs and plans remain a mystery.
Bill Clinton complains that he hasn't been able to get his message across. The people respond that they don't want to hear it. They don't think campaign speeches mean anything when it comes to governing, and they think politicians treat them as fools with statements like "I didn't inhale" or "race played no role in my choice of Clarence Thomas."
During the gulf war, the public responded positively to George Bush because he didn't just talk, he acted and led. That's why Californians expressed such disappointment after the Los Angeles riots. They looked for leadership; they got vacillation.
Right after Mr. Bush visited the riot area, I interviewed conservative Republicans in Orange County. They seemed genuinely distressed by life in the ghetto. They talked of the hopelessness, the need for education and jobs, and they showed an interest in imaginative Government programs and a desire to do something to help. "Give those people opportunities," said one rock-ribbed Republican, "and the crime will take care of itself."
Rather than reaching out to those suburbanites at that moment, uniting the communities in a time of tragedy, their leaders chose to divide, to talk of the lack of personal responsibility in the inner city, rather than the personal responsibility to help one's neighbor. The moment for action, for the involvement of individuals, was lost.
Ross Perot offers his supporters the opportunity of involvement. Instead of surrounding himself with political consultants, he recruits armies of volunteers to circulate petitions, answer phones, collect contributions -- to act. Obviously, he can afford it. He doesn't have to pay someone to calculate which TV spots will work because he can buy whatever time he needs to get his face into the family room.
For those who have dedicated their lives to public service, men like George Bush and Bill Clinton, the appeal of the cowboy riding in out of nowhere with no responsibilities or record must be maddening. Politicians find their frustration so great they are opting for private life in record numbers, and those who choose again to run grumble that colleagues and columnists lionize the quitters.
But the politicians bring grief on themselves, choosing repeatedly to do what they think will sell, not what they think is right. Rather than do something real to bring down the deficit, for instance, they've decided that a constitutional amendment to balance the budget -- something many have ridiculed for years -- is the better part of wisdom. And rather than fight the amendment on its merits, opponents put forward what they believe is a less damaging amendment of their own. The battle of the amendments will convince voters Washington is producing more wishy-washy words -- and the political amateur will look better and better.
The novelty of the noncandidate could soon wear off. Voters could grow as tired of Mr. Perot as they are of the professionals. He's already in danger of overexposure. But what he represents should not be lost. It's not just change, it's action.
Mr. Perot's followers look for someone who says what he thinks and seems ready to act on it without worrying about whom it offends. That's what voters mean when they talk about leadership. That's what they insist is lacking among politicians. And, in times like these, they find that lack goofy.

HEADLINE: As Forests Fall, Environmental Movement Rises in Brazil

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH HEILMAN BROOKE

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO

 BODY:
A TELEVISION announcement here features a lithe, bikinied beauty sunning herself on a crowded beach. She carelessly throws a piece of trash on the sand and suddenly transforms into a bikinied pig.
The message, which is the work of a private group, the Blue Wave Foundation, is one sign of the growing concern about the environment in Brazil. As in many third world countries, conservation and environmental awareness have little history here. But in recent years, an impressive domestic environmental movement has taken root. 
 The nation's environmental record is coming under scrutiny as thousands of people from all corners of the earth arrive in Rio de Janeiro for the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development that opens tomorrow. In addition to governmental representatives and environmental specialists, there will be private groups composed of or representing women, children, Indians, trade unionists, business people, economists and scientists. Nearly 100 Brazilian environmental groups plan to debate the host nation's ecological problems and progress.
 
Natural Resources
 Rio sits in the middle of an Atlantic coastal forest that has shrunk to 3 percent of its original size. The world's fifth largest country in area and the sixth largest in population, Brazil is first in biological diversity, but also high in habitat destruction. One-third of the world's forests lie in Brazil. More than a fifth of the world's freshwater supply is in Brazil's rivers. Brazil holds claim not only to the world's largest river, the Amazon, but to the world's largest tropical forest, the Amazon forest.
More than 1,000 local groups are working to save Brazil's threatened forests, coastline and animal species. Last year, in a reflection of the new interest, Globo Television, Brazil's largest network, started showing a weekly environmental program, and Jornal do Brasil, a Rio newspaper, started publishing a weekly environment section.
"In terms of environmental action, Brazil has as sophisticated groups as the United States," said Lou Ann Dietz, the World Wildlife Fund's senior program officer for Brazil. "Many of them are very capable, but most have difficulty in trying to sustain themselves financially, and that's a result of the economic situation in Brazil and the fact that there is not a culture of philanthropy in Brazil."
On a grass-roots level, middle-class Brazilians have raised money to administer state parks and to raise the consciousness of a people who have often destroyed their forests and polluted their waterways in pursuit of short-term economic gain.
 
Wave of Awareness
 Brazilian composers have been celebrating their lush natural surroundings for decades, but it has been the political pull of Gilberto Gil, a Bahian singer, that brought the televised message about the thoughtless sunbather into the nation's living rooms. In an effort to protect Brazil's waters, Mr. Gil founded Ondazul, or the Blue Wave Foundation, in 1989.
Based in Salvador, the capital of the state of Bahia, the foundation has received support from advertising agencies as well as the three major television networks for its national educational campaign aimed at cleaning Brazil's beaches. Thousands of garbage bags have been distributed to encourage citizens to keep the coast clean.
One group considered a pillar of Brazilian environmentalism, Funatura, has a wildlife sanctuary program in the Atlantic coastal forest and other programs in the Grande Sertao Veredas National Park in Bahia and Minas Gerais states. The Brasilia-based group was founded in 1986 by Maria Tereza Jorge Padua, an agricultural engineer, former director of Brazil's national parks and current president of Ibama, the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Resources.
Frequently sought out by foreign groups for partnerships, this highly professional group received $582,000 from the World Bank to complete and administer a 1,300-acre wildlife sanctuary in Brasilia. Conservation International and the Nature Conservancy are helping Funatura with foreign-debt conversion projects, in which foreign lenders forgive portions of Brazil's debt in exchange for environmental protection projects.
 
Setting Aside Land
 Another group, the Pro-Nature Institute, is a private environmental organization founded by Dr. Marcelo Carvalho de Andrade, an orthopedist, in 1986. With sponsorship from international corporations like Esso, Shell and Imperial Chemical Industries, as well as the MacArthur Foundation of the United States, the institute has begun programs in both the Amazon rain forest and the Atlantic coastal forest. Two state parks and a biological reserve have been established and are being maintained in Rio de Janeiro state. Research has been started for a sustainable development program in Juruena, a frontier between farmed land and virgin rain forest in Mato Grosso state.
In an attempt to verify deforestation and to identify areas for conservation, S.O.S. Mata Atlantica, officially called the Brazilian Foundation for the Conservation of the Atlantic Rain Forest, is organizing the first comparative analysis of satellite images of the Atlantic forest in eight Brazilian states in 1985 and 1990.
For five years the group has worked "to protect the biological diversity and ecological processes of Atlantic rain forest ecosystems, to promote sustainable use of the region's natural resources and establish a strong environmental ethic in the area." In a pioneering television and radio campaign, "The Green of Our Earth is Being Destroyed," S.O.S. made a mass audience aware that many of the plant and animal species of Brazil's Atlantic forest were threatened with extinction.
Thomas E. Lovejoy, assistant secretary for external affairs at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, said: "These environmental groups are a relatively new phenomenon in a country that is still getting used to democracy. What is impressive is that there has been an explosion of new environmental groups and it keeps going. There are 100 groups alone in the Brazilian Amazon. Obviously, some of those groups are small and very specialized, but the mere fact that they exist says something about the change in Brazilian society."

HEADLINE: Poor vs. Rich in Rio;
If Development in Southern Hemisphere Is to Be 'Green,' North May Have to Pay

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, June 2

 BODY:
The Earth Summit, a vast environmental jamboree bringing together thousands of delegates from more than 170 countries, countless ecological watchdogs and the world press, gets under way tomorrow in Rio de Janeiro and it has already become mired in discord and suspicion between rich and poor nations.
The central issues are: Who will pay the bill for the first comprehensive attempt to repair the environmental damage caused by industrialization? And who will insure that the poor nations of the southern hemisphere industrialize at a lower cost to the environment than the richer nations of the North did? 
 The largely northern-inspired drive to make the South's development environmentally sustainable has opened a new chapter in a battle between the have and the have-not nations that dates from the 1960's and 70's.
 
The Goals of the South
 If nothing else, the arguments prove that the end of the cold war has not ended recriminations by the developing world directed at the major industrial democracies.
At a news conference today, Maurice Strong, the Earth Summit's normally ebullient Secretary General, put the best face he could on the difficulties confronting him, saying: "Success will not come easily. I predict this conference will look as though it is going to collapse before it is over."
The atmosphere is one of poor and rich countries playing on each other's anxieties.
Poor countries want to exploit northern worries about climate change, the destruction of forests and polluted seas to extract more aid. They say that the rich countries must pay the extra cost of "clean" development, just as 20 years ago they demanded a new world economic order to shift the North's riches southward.
Richer northern countries want to hold the poor to their pledge to pursue sustainable economic development by setting up a commission to monitor the South's strategies. But the developing world is resisting any obligation to abide by outsiders' recommendations.
The Earth Summit's success is also being jeopardized by the Bush Administration's refusal to sign a convention protecting the diversity of nature because of disagreements over patent rights and the way they are paid for.
Britain, Japan and France may withhold support too. But if so powerful a quartet of industrialized countries refuses to sign a convention widely perceived as favorable to the developing world, southern countries warn, they may not sign a convention backed by the North on stabilizing the climate.
Such a deadlock could deal a crippling blow to the meeting here, for the two conventions have been billed as its greatest triumph and their signature is a major reason why nearly 100 heads of state and government will be here for the finale on June 14.
Another looming difficulty is Israel's expected bid on Wednesday to remove references to the environmental rights of "people under occupation" that Arab nations have inserted into several documents even though this threatens to unravel existing agreements.
Austria, the Netherlands and Switzerland are also planning to isolate the United States further by inviting countries that favor stricter control of gas emissions than President Bush will accept to sign a "like-minded countries declaration," pledging to do more to combat global warming.
 
Smaller Nations Weigh In
 The Earth Summit is officially the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, and as that name suggests, its overarching goal is to find a way for rich and poor to raise living standards while insuring that growth is tailored to what the Earth can stand.
But after two years of preparatory talks, poor southern countries are fearful the North wants to keep them that way. The poor countries say they will only match their development to environmental goals if the rich pay the bill.
The industrialized world is afraid of new financial commitments at a time of slow growth and widespread recession. The electoral paralysis that seems to be seeping through the United States only adds to the indecision.
Conference officials are still given to extravagant statements about the meeting's significance. "We have a clear mandate to take new steps towards a new order in the interests of mankind," Brazil's Foreign Minister Celso Lafer said today.
But most delegates' expectations range from low to modest.
"The real test is whether governments carry out their commitments," said Mr. Strong, the Canadian who is leading the conference. "We have to hold them to account."
The last time the developing South sought access to the coffers of the rich on such a scale came 20 years ago when -- encouraged by the oil exporters' success in raising prices tenfold -- they tried to jack up the price of other raw materials.
 
Some Convergence
 That attempt failed. But this time the developing world senses that the North may be more vulnerable.
Already industrialized countries have agreed that nothing less than the "eradication of poverty" must be the cornerstone of ecological survival. And they also know that if China and India industrialize, as Britain did in the 19th century, by burning their coal reserves, all the North's efforts to curb pollution will come to nothing.
In preparatory negotiations stretching back over two years, the North and the South have already reached a measure of agreement on some steps.
They include conventions to curb the emission of gases that may warm the atmosphere and to preserve flora and fauna, as well as an ambitiously detailed plan, called Agenda 21, to clean up virtually every aspect of the environment during the next century.
These will be complemented by a declaration setting out the basic principles that should guide this quest.
 
$125 Billion a Year
 Final negotiations begin in earnest after the ceremonial opening on Wednesday by President Fernando Collor de Mello of Brazil and Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali of the United Nations at the immense, shabby concrete-and-steel conference center almost an hour's drive from the center of town.
The estimated cost of cleaning up the globe are astronomical: some $125 billion a year just for the goals in Agenda 21. But the North so far has only pledged to provide "new and additional resources," without saying how much.
The developing world receives about $55 billion in aid each year; if all this were used for environmentally sound projects, it would take another $70 billion to meet the bill for Agenda 21.
Most of the new money could be found if the industrial world increased aid to the target they have already set: seven-tenths of 1 percent of total economic output.
Developing countries have asked for a commitment to reach this level by 2000. But Britain, Germany and Belgium oppose setting a binding date, and the United States has never accepted the higher target.

HEADLINE: Byrd Predicts Senate Will Defeat Amendment for Balanced Budget

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 2

 BODY:
Prospects for a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced Federal budget, which seemed likely to sail through Congress only a few weeks ago, dimmed dramatically today when Senator Robert C. Byrd, a veteran vote-counter and master of Senate procedure, predicted that the Senate would kill it.
As chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Mr. Byrd has decisive power over the pet projects of every senator, although he said he was not applying this influence in his meetings with one senator after another to argue against the amendment. 
 Today Senator Byrd, a West Virginia Democrat, told reporters, "In the final analysis, Congress will not approve the amendment."
 
'Mischief' and 'Damage' Seen
 "Once members are really informed as to the mischief this amendment could do, and the damage it could do to the country and to the Constitution," he said, "I just have faith that enough members will take a courageous stand against the amendment."
The amendment's sponsor, Senator Paul Simon, said of Mr. Byrd's remarks, "It is possible he is correct" about the amendment's prospects.
Mr. Simon, an Illinois Democrat, added: "I don't need to tell you that when the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee talks, senators pay attention. We all have things we want to get through appropriations."
The amendment has been under steadily increasing attack in recent days, and its prospects now appear uncertain at best.
Senator Byrd and other opponents call the amendment a smokescreen that will allow lawmakers to claim action against the deficit while still postponing hard budgetary decisions. Supporters argue that all other efforts to cut the deficit have failed and it is time for the ultimate discipline of a constitutional amendment.
Passage by the House is still considered probable when the amendment comes up there next week. But in the Senate, which will act after the House does, Mr. Byrd may be able to rally either the 34 votes required to deny the amendment the two-thirds majority required under the Constitution, or to filibuster successfully against it.
Two weeks ago he warned the Senate of a possible filibuster, saying, "Unlimited debate is one of the cornerstones on which this institution, the U.S. Senate, rests."
While it takes 41 votes to sustain a filibuster, some senators might find it easier to cast a procedural vote for unlimited debate than to vote against the popular amendment directly.
 
Effective Lobbying Cited
 Senator Simon said in an interview, "As of two weeks ago, we had the votes." But he added that Mr. Byrd's lobbying had had its effect.
Mr. Simon said Mr. Byrd would never threaten senators that their pet projects would be the first to go if the budget had to be balanced, but some senators might draw that conclusion anyhow.
An aide to Mr. Byrd insisted that when he met with other senators he assured them that his position as chairman of the Appropriations Committee was not a consideration and that they should consider his arguments strictly on their own merits.
Another measure of opposition was sounded at a news conference here by the Economic Policy Institute. The institute made public a statement of opposition signed by 447 economists, including seven who won the Nobel Prize in Economics.
 
Making Recessions Worse
 "When the private economy is in recession," they said, "a constitutional requirement that would force cuts in public or tax increases could worsen the economic downturn, causing greater loss of jobs, production and income."
The Nobel laureates signing the statement were Kenneth J. Arrow of Stanford University, Lawrence R. Klein of the University of Pennsylvania, Herbert A. Simon of Carnegie Mellon University, James Tobin of Yale University and Franco Modigliani, Paul A. Samuelson and Robert M. Solow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
There are different House and Senate versions of the amendment pending, but they are similar. Senator Simon's proposal requires the President to submit a balanced budget to Congress. It compels Congress to enact and abide by annual budgets in which spending does not exceed receipts. That requirement could be suspended, a year at a time, by votes of 60 percent of both houses.
The basic argument for the amendment is that all other narrower measures to cut deficit spending have failed, and that only the compulsion of a constitutional amendment will work.
Mr. Simon said at a news conference today that the amendment "sets up a process of fiscal discipline that will mean painful choices sooner, rather than later."
The amendment, an idea that has been around for years, has gathered steam this year as Congress' own standing declined and deficits continue to increase, with the recession and the savings and loan bailout overcoming the hopes of a 1990 budget agreement between Congress and President Bush that was supposed to curb the deficit.
Senator Byrd, at the Economic Policy Institute meeting, called the proposal an "easy way out."
He and other critics have argued that the amendment itself would accomplish nothing except to give lawmakers political cover; Congress would still have to make the same difficult decisions it has so far been unable to make about what spending to cut or what taxes to increase.
Besides warning that a balanced budget requirement would make recessions worse, the economists said that it would lead to new budgetary gimmicks, invite the courts to meddle with the details of taxes, spending and the economy, and generally discourage constructive budget policies.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: On the Trail

 BODY:

CONGRESSWOMAN LINKED TO SCANDALS WINS NOMINATION
COLUMBUS, Ohio, June 2 (AP) -- Representative Mary Rose Oakar won renomination today despite being linked to the House bank and post office scandals.
Ms. Oakar defeated Tim Hagan, a Cuyahoga County commissioner.
Seeking her ninth term, Ms. Oakar was considered vulnerable because of her 213 overdrafts at the House bank and for her role as chairwoman of the committee overseeing the scandal-ridden House post office. In April, she resigned as co-chairwoman of the Democratic Platform Committee, but denied she was pressured.
 
ALABAMA SENATOR WINS DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION
MONTGOMERY, Ala., June 2 (AP) -- Senator Richard C. Shelby won the Democratic nomination for a second term today. He easily dispatched three opponents, including Chris McNair, a county commissioner whose daughter was one of four black girls killed in the 1963 Birmingham church bombing.
Mr. Shelby led Mr. McNair by nearly 4 to 1. Mr. McNair had sought support from black voters and from women angry over Mr. Shelby's vote to confirm Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court despite accusations of sexual harassment by Prof. Anita F. Hill.
 
BLACK CANDIDATES WIN RUNOFFS IN NORTH CAROLINA
RALEIGH, N.C., June 2 (AP) -- Black candidates won runoffs today in two newly drawn Congressional districts, heightening the possibility that North Carolina could send two blacks to Congress in November. In the First District Democratic primary, Eva Clayton, a black businesswoman, defeated Walter Jones Jr., who is white and the son of the district's incumbent, who is retiring. Ms. Clayton will face a white Republican in November.
Black representation in the 12th District had already been guaranteed, with two black Republicans vying today for the right to face a black Democrat in the fall. In that runoff, Barbara Gore Washington defeated George Jones.
 
PEROT UNVEILS PLANS FOR SOLVING U.S. PROBLEMS
 By Reuters -- Ross Perot, who stole the political limelight yesterday with a strong showing in surveys of voters on the day that President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton won the last round of primaries, said last night that he would treat the United States economy as if it were failed business.
In an interview with CBS News broadcast last night, Mr. Perot called himself "just an ordinary citizen" who wanted to cure American problems by getting the budget deficit under control, reforming the tax system and making education work, especially for poor children. He said he would only raise taxes as a last resort and only after much discussion with the American people, and that he would "bury" himself in meetings from his first day in the White House, to solve the budget deficit. The Texas billionaire also said he would concentrate on problems at home rather than international affairs.
 
MARGOT PEROT BACKS ABORTION RIGHTS
WASHINGTON, June 2 (AP) -- Margot Perot, wife of the undeclared Presidential candidate, says the right to choose an abortion is "probably the most important issue to me."
"I think there are extenuating circumstances where an abortion might be the best choice, and certainly the choice that should be made by that individual," Mrs. Perot said Monday on the NBC News program "Today."
 
 GERALD FORD SEES TROUBLE FOR BUSH
WASHINGTON, June 2 (AP) -- Former President Gerald R. Ford says that the Presidential election would be thrown into the House if it were held now, but that President Bush would win in November if the economy continued to improve.
In a speech on Monday at the National Press Club, Mr. Ford said that in traveling around the country he had concluded that "all incumbents, including the White House in my opinion, are in trouble."
"If the election were held today," he said, "we would have a three-man race, and I don't think any of the three would get the 270 electoral votes" needed to win.
 
MARILYN QUAYLE JOINS ATTACK ON HOLLYWOOD
 HOUSTON, June 2 (Reuters) -- - Marilyn Quayle climbed into the political fray today by joining her husband in attacking Hollywood's values, deadbeat dads and Ross Perot. Mrs. Quayle, who as wife of Vice President Dan Quayle normally avoids political sparring, criticized what she characterized Mr. Ross Perot's effort to buy the White House.
Mrs. Quayle, in Houston to make a speech about breast cancer, defended her husband, who was criticized two weeks ago after attacking the TV show "Murphy Brown" because of its main character's having a child out of wedlock. "The entertainment industry continually knocks the values that we need to have if we are going to have a civilized society," she said. "Men need to be responsible for their actions and they need to be held accountable."

HEADLINE: Bush Seeks Trade Benefits for China

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 2

 BODY:
The White House announced today that it planned to extend preferential trade benefits to China for another year, arguing that it was the best way to support economic and political reform in the world's most populous country.
The announcement immediately drew protests from Democrats on Capitol Hill, who argued that the President's policy of "constructive engagement" with China had produced no tangible results. In fact, they said, China has engaged in increasingly provocative acts -- including the underground testing of a large nuclear bomb, harassment of American reporters, denial of visas to the Chairmen of the Senate Intelligence and Foreign Relations Committees and a failure to make any significant improvement in human rights. 
 Ever since the Tiananmen Square massacre in June 1989 the annual extension of trade benefits to China has produced a fight between the President and Congress, which Mr. Bush has won each time, and this year will probably be no exception.
"The President informed the Congress today that he plans to extend China's most-favored-nation, MFN, status for another year," said the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater. "In making this important decision, the President stressed that it is wrong to isolate China if we hope to influence China. Maintaining a constructive policy of engagement with China has served U.S. interests."
 
Few Improvements in China
 Last year China exported $19 billion of products to the United States and imported $6.3 billion in American goods. The United States is China's largest overseas market, importing more than a fourth of Chinese exports, while China absorbs only 1.5 percent of American exports.
Administration officials acknowledged that the Chinese have made few improvements in human rights during the past year, and in recent months have taken actions that almost seemed designed to "to rub our nose in it," as one official put it.
A senior Bush Administration Asia policymaker argued, however, that this behavior was the result of a "world-class power struggle" now under way in Beijing in advance of the 14th Communist Party Congress, which will take place at the end of the year.
"The hardliners are deliberately trying to embarrass the reformers," the official said, "The hardliners are arguing that engagement with the outside world only brings internal infection on human rights, endless pressures for trade concessions and the denial of China's right to sell arms where it pleases. The reformers are arguing that China has to get along with the world and that China benefits enormously from trade. The President thinks we are doing the right thing by getting on the side of the reformers."
This argument has not impressed opponents of the China policy.
"It's deja vu all over again," said Rep. Stephen J. Solarz, the Brooklyn Democrat who chairs the House Asia subcommittee, "Nothing has changed in China or in Washington. The President sticks to his view that the best way to facilitate change in China is a policy of constructive engagement. He apparently agrees with the philosopher Hegel that if theory and fact disagree, so much for the facts -- because the facts simply don't sustain Mr. Bush's views."
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, Democrat of Maine, and House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri, along with a bipartisan coalition of Congressmen, plan to unveil their own bill on Wednesday that will make extending China's trade privileges for another year contingent on specific improvements in human rights policies. The chances of gaining a veto-proof two-thirds majority of both houses appear slim at best.
"The President's decision is wrong, inconsistent with American values and contrary to American interests," said Senator Mitchell. "The longer the President's policy remains in effect, the greater and more obvious is its failure. It is a classic example of continuing a failed policy."
Representative Nancy Pelosi, who has led the House fight against most-favored-nation status for China, said that opponents may choose a narrower approach this year. They may, for example, seek selective tariff increases on specific Chinese products so they could not be exported to the United States at a profit. Lifting of these selective tariffs might be contingent on China's agreeing to release specific numbers of political prisoners, respect religious freedoms and open prisons and labor camps to international inspection.
The bill's sponsors hope that such an approach might overcome the Administration's concerns about damaging China's nascent free-market sector, which it argues is the best long-term hope for political change there. Administration officials say the proposed bill is unworkable and would elicit a veto.
By law, Mr. Bush had to decide by Wednesday whether to notify Congress of his intention to extend trade benefits for another year. Congress then has three months to try to prevent the move. In an election year, though, it will be very difficult to muster enough Republican votes in Congress to override the President.
Opponents of renewing the benefits argue that Beijing has not followed through on many of the promises it made to Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d last November. It promised to allow a group of some 20 dissidents to leave the country and have only let two go so far. It promised to halt exports of products made by prison inmates to the United States, and were recently caught exporting tools and diesel engines made by prisoners.
The Beijing authorities did come through with a promised accounting of the status of about 800 political prisoners jailed after Tiananmen Square, but provided just the barest of information on each one, some of which has been proven incorrect, according to Congressional officials.

HEADLINE: Army Unrest Stirs Bolivia, the Land of Coups

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LA PAZ, Bolivia

 BODY:
In this country, which has had 77 governments in 167 years, the military coup has often been the engine for political change. Historians note that since independence in 1825, Bolivia has experienced more than 150 coups or attempted coups. And despite 10 years of civilian rule, any rumors of discontent in its armed forces are watched closely.
Encouraged perhaps by recent displays of military assertiveness in Venezuela and Peru, four factions in the Bolivian Army and Navy have been rattling their swords. 
 They are complaining that there is corruption in the armed forces and civilian Government and that the country has become a pawn of the United States. At times there have been calls for a military takeover, once again raising the specter that this fragile democracy could be disrupted at any time.
Military analysts and Government officials say a coup at this point is very unlikely, but they add that the rumblings reflect growing unrest over the diminishing role of the armed forces and severe reductions in their pay and budgets.
 
Diverse in Ideology
 The restive military factions in Bolivia are diverse in ideology. Vivo Rojo, the oldest of the clandestine groups, says its members are Trotskyites. The Group of Ten Stars is made up of naval officers. Its favorite theme is the supposed link between top naval commanders and Bolivian drug traffickers. The Army of Bolivar rails against the economic programs of the International Monetary Fund. And the Movement for Dignity and Renovation makes corruption within the Government of President Jaime Paz Zamora its target.
"No one really knows who are members of these groups," said a retired senior army officer who maintains close ties with the military. "There are many theories, among them that the top commanders let them exist so they can express the frustrations of the high command. But they have remarkably accurate information."
The disquiet is not confined to Bolivia. A group of 50 current and former military officers in Uruguay, apparently rightists, has set off a series of bombs around Montevideo, the capital. And a rebel officers' group in Argentina that has staged four uprisings still has adherents in the ranks of the country's military even though most of its leaders are in prison.
While partaking of Latin America's penchant for military solutions to civilian problems, these groups tend to pursue a different political strategy than military rulers in the past. Instead of forming close relations with business groups and the controlling oligarchies, they seek to appeal to the masses, pointing a finger at government corruption, poverty and drug trafficking.
 
A Loss of Esteem
 Analysts note that these groups generally do not represent the top military hierarchies, who are mostly well paid. Rather they are made up of officers from the lower classes of society who have had their pay and benefits slashed by as much as 50 percent in recent years and now see their once bright hopes for a military future waning.
In addition, border tensions have quieted with the emergence of democracies in Latin America, reducing the military's role and sense of self-esteem and giving time to focus on scandals within the armed forces themselves.
Corruption has been the focus of recent letters written by the four Bolivian groups. Of greatest concern are two scandals involving the sale of large farms north of La Paz that were owned by the army. Not only were much of the proceeds illegally pocketed by army officers, but one farm was sold to a former officer with links to drug dealers. .
The Movement for Dignity and Renovation said in a letter circulated in the last week that "because of the fault of some bad military officers, the entire institution is losing credibility and respect among the Bolivian public."
Jorge Lazarte, a member of Bolivia's National Court of Elections, said: "Right now the military are going to watch and see what happens in the presidential elections next year. If they think the wrong person gets into office, then it could be dangerous."

Finding Plays In Toy Stocks

BYLINE: By Adam Bryant

 BODY:
TOYLAND is busy these days. In the last month, Tyco Toys Inc. and Hasbro Inc. announced plans to acquire Japanese toy companies; Child World Inc., the huge retailer, filed for bankruptcy, and a rash of investor concerns pushed the stock of Mattel Inc. down roughly 20 percent from April to May.
To some investors, the turmoil reinforces a belief that toy stocks are best avoided, a theory born from ill-fated investments in the 1980's in companies like Coleco, whose sales of Cabbage Patch dolls tumbled from more than $500 million in 1985 to $125 million in 1987. 
 But many analysts say the industry is growing increasingly stable, and some feel the recent commotion has created buying opportunities.
Gary M. Jacobson, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody & Company, noted that demographics were driving growth in the toy business. He said more children -- 4.1 million -- were born in the United States last year than in any year since 1964. He added that 40 percent of those babies were first-borns, "who generally get spoiled rotten."
Other analysts noted that a consolidation under way in the industry -- including Tyco's acquisition of the Universal Matchbox Group of Hong Kong and Hasbro's plan to buy the Nomura Toy Company of Japan -- reflected a trend toward internationalization. They also said that the rapid expansion in Japan of Toys "R" Us Inc., the largest American retailer, was creating opportunities for American toy makers in the world's second-largest toy market.
"That's where the biggest opportunities for growth lie," said Greg Simpson, an analyst at A. G. Edwards in St. Louis.
Mattel is seen by some as the most attractive among the four market leaders: Hasbro, Mattel, Tyco and Fisher-Price Inc.
Mattel's stock was battered recently, dropping from $36.75 in mid-April to its recent low of $30.12. Some of the decline came on concerns raised on May 5 when Warburg Pincus, an investment bank and Mattel's largest shareholder, announced it would distribute more than 10 million Mattel shares to its limited partners.
Also, some investors worried about Mattel's relatively large exposure in the May 7 bankruptcy filing by Child World. Tyco's planned acquisition of Matchbox, a maker of miniature cars, also worried investors, who saw competition for Mattel's Hot Wheels.
But some analysts waved off the Tyco threat. That, combined with continued strong sales of Barbie dolls, appears to have helped Mattel's stock rebound sharply in the last week. It closed yesterday at $36, down 62.5 cents on the New York Stock Exchange. Mr. Jacobson said that while the stock was no longer a table-pounding bargain, it remained an attractive long-term investment.
Sean McGowan, an analyst with Gerard, Klauer, Mattison, recommends all the toy stocks. In particular, he applauded Tyco's Matchbox deal, which he said would give Tyco improved distribution networks in Germany and Britain. He said Tyco's sales would probably exceed $1 billion next year -- up from just $87.7 million in 1986 -- moving it past Fisher-Price as the third-largest toy company. "Tyco is in the best position to put up very good growth rates," Mr. McGowan said.
Tyco shares added 37.5 cents each on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, closing at $45.625.
Mr. McGowan also likes Hasbro, the industry leader. The company recently offered analysts a glimpse of cost reductions achieved from its acquisition of the Tonka Corporation in May 1991 for $486 million, and most think sales of its Batman toys will probably be buoyed by the release this year of a sequel to the movie.
Hasbro shares closed at $28.625 on the American Stock Exchange yesterday, down 25 cents.
Mr. McGowan also recommends Fisher-Price, in part because of its rapid sales increases in the United States. But Mr. Jacobson is more skeptical, arguing that long-term growth will be difficult because of the company's narrow focus on infant and pre-school toys. "Four-year-olds want to play with Barbie and Sega," he said.
Fisher-Price shares gained 25 cents each on the Big Board yesterday, closing at $18.875.
Despite the heady growth that is anticipated abroad, some analysts feel that toy stocks are already overpriced. "There are some fantastic numbers there, and these companies didn't suffer in the recession," a neutral Mr. Simpson said. "It's more a matter of where do we feel comfortable getting into these things."

HEADLINE: New Data Show Continued Slow Recovery

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 2

 BODY:
In reports suggesting a continued ragged and lackluster economic recovery, the Government said today that sales of new homes edged up 1.3 percent in April while its chief economic-forecasting index rose four-tenths of 1 percent.
The results, analysts say, mean that the economy is likely to keep forging ahead but without the long-awaited acceleration some thought they detected in Monday's report by purchasing managers of stepped-up activity in the industrial sector. 
 "The recovery is in place," said Stuart G. Hoffman of the PNC Financial Corporation in Pittsburgh. "But this also reminds us that it's not going to be robust, not going to surprise us on the upside."
The skimpy gain in new-home sales, virtually all of it in the West, followed a plunge of 15.9 percent in March and left the sector that Mr. Hoffman called the epicenter of the recovery running only 5 percent above the level a year earlier.
The April annual selling rate was 530,000 units, compared with 523,000 in March and an average of 644,500 for the first two months of the year, when falling interest rates and warm weather helped spur demand.
Sales actually fell in the South and Midwest and gained only insignificantly, to a 53,000 rate from 52,000, in the Northeast. The West posted a 22.5 percent gain, to 169,000, but still a slower pace than in December, January or February.
At the end of April, there were 274,000 unsold new homes, representing a 6.4-month supply at that month's rate of sales, a figure unchanged from March, according to the report, issued jointly by the Departments of Commerce and Housing and Urban Development.
The index of leading indicators for April climbed for the fourth straight month and by slightly more than had been expected. Yet analysts found no particular comfort in the rise of four-tenths of 1 percent, which was almost entirely accounted for by higher prices for materials sensitive to the business cycle. These prices have since flattened.
And the increases of four-tenths of 1 percent for both April and March were only half those chalked up in January and February.
"These numbers are giving us pause," said Laurence H. Meyer, who heads a consultancy by that name in St. Louis. He cited the lack of a gain in April in a companion index of indicators that reflect current conditions.. That index, the index of coincident indicators, was also revised to show a one-tenth of 1 percent rise in March after having initially been reported to have been unchanged.
 
Reversal of a Pattern
 The economy is not building momentum, Mr. Meyer said, noting that in the first quarter, the consumer sector was strong while production lagged, a pattern reversed in the current quarter.
"There's no indication that this economy is going to fall back into recession," Mr. Meyer said, but he added that the lack of momentum was "a source of concern."
Only 4 of 11 components of the leading indicators index contributed to the advance, with higher materials prices far outweighing a decline in first-time claims for unemployment insurance, higher factory orders for consumer goods and a rise in consumer expectations.
Holding the index back were a drop in the M-2 money supply, lower building permits, a decline in the proportion of companies reporting slower deliveries from suppliers, lower contracts and orders for new plant and equipment and lower manufacturers' backlogs of unfilled orders.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: New Jersey;
Perot Not on Ballot but on Many Minds

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 2

 BODY:
As expected, New Jersey voters endorsed the nominations of George Bush and Bill Clinton today to head the tickets of their respective parties, but more than a quarter of the voters on both sides would have defected to Ross Perot if the Texas billionaire had been on the ballot, according to a survey of those leaving the polls.
Among voters in the Democratic primary who were questioned as they left the polls around the state, about half said they had voted for Governor Clinton of Arkansas as the party's nominee for President, 1 in 5 said they had voted for former Gov. Edmund G. Brown of California, 1 in 10 said they had supported former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, who ended his active campaign in March but was still on the ballot here, and another 1 in 10 voted for an uncommitted slate that appeared on ballots in some counties. 
 Among voters in the Republican primary, almost three-quarters said they had voted for Mr. Bush, while about 1 in 8 voted for Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative newspaper columnist, with fewer than five percent supporting uncommitted delegates.
Mr. Perot was not on the ballot, but about 3 in 10 the Democrats and more a third of the Republicans said they would have voted for him if they had been given the option.
Commenting on those results, Thomas V. O'Neil, a former executive director of the state Democratic Party who is now a consultant to businesses on governmental affairs, said: "And that is among committed party voters in partisan primaries. I would guess these are party regulars, and if you included independents" the percentages would probably be higher.
 
Suggestion of Anger
 The poll results, the random voices of voters as they left the voting booths and the analysis of political professionals of both parties all point in the same direction: New Jersey's voters are angry, disappointed to the point of disgust with the candidates, and ready to turn to almost any alternative.
Marilyn Greenberg, 58 years old, of Cherry Hill, said she wrote in Mr. Perot's name "because I didn't like any of the others" and "he's the lesser of all evils."
And Jim Welch, a Republican leaving the polls in Red Bank, voted for candidates for other offices, but not for a Presidential candidate. "I don't like Bush," he said. "I don't like either one of them." His wife, Toni Welch, said she had voted for Mr. Bush, but "it wasn't an enthusiastic choice."
Similarly, Robert M. Fugazzi, who voted in the Democratic primary in Red Bank, said he voted for Mr. Clinton but would have voted for Mr. Perot had he been on the ballot. "I just think, from what I hear, he'd do a much better job," he said.
 
Voices of Despair
 To Jay Severin, a New York political consultant who works in New Jersey for Republican candidates and the party, those are voices of despair. "It's not the corruption, the bad checks and the post office scandal," he said. "It's the impotence, the feeling it's not working, government in gridlock.
"No one should draw any joy from this, Democrats or Republicans or anyone else," he said, adding that many voters are so alienated that they no longer seem to care very much how they vote.
"They used to look at the candidates and say, 'We can do better than this,' but now it's a step further. Now they say, 'How can we do any worse?' They vote for somebody they don't even know."
Mr. O'Neil agreed. "The problems are so significant that people believe they can no longer be entrusted to the politicians or to the parties. They prefer anyone else," he said.
Former Gov. Thomas H. Kean, now the president of Drew University and the chairman of the Bush campaign in New Jersey, said Mr. Perot should not take comfort in the numbers. "I think voters are confused and disillusioned," he said, "and Perot is the only way they can find to say that. They are unhappy with the process. It's not an affirmation of Perot.
"If the voters don't pull out of it, you'll have third-party candidates all over the country" in state and local elections, he added.
Steven A. Salmore of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University said that the disaffection in both parties results more from distaste for recent candidates than from anger with the process itself. "The voter is saying, 'I don't really like Bush or Clinton, so I'll send a message and vote for Perot,' " he said. "When they actually have to vote for a President in November, will Perot's numbers come down?"
 
Frustrated Voters
 Whatever the cause, the voters are frustrated, angry and cynical.
Bruce Pfeffer, 28, of Maple Shade, an unemployed industrial engineer, voted for Mr. Clinton but would have preferred to support Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey or Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York. "I don't particularly believe in Brown," he said. "He flip-flops."
Carole Szcykalski, 48, a child care worker from Maple Shade, said she voted for Mr. Brown, albeit reluctantly. "I'm Catholic, and he was in the seminary," she said. "But to tell the truth, it was hard to vote for anybody. Clinton, I don't trust him because of what came out about him running around. I'm waiting to see about Perot. I do not see myself voting for Bush because he really hasn't helped the middle-income-type people."
The disappointment clearly cut across party lines. Fran Kupko of Edison, a teacher, said she would vote for President Bush "reluctantly."
"I'm not really happy with any of the candidates," she explained, echoing what seemed a universally dispirited attitude in this primary. "I was considering Perot, but he's not on the ballot."

HEADLINE: Poll Shows New Yorkers Prefer To Put State in Private Hands

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Most New Yorkers are so angry with state government that they believe a private commission would do a better job than their elected officials, a public-opinion survey commissioned by State Comptroller Edward V. Regan has found.
The results suggest further evidence of a frustration with incumbents and may not bode well for those seeking re-election in state legislative races this year. Mr. Regan said he planned to run for Comptroller again in 1994 and had commissioned the poll, which was released last week, to determine whether his warnings and proposed remedies regarding fiscal stability were being heard. 
 The survey seems to indicate that many were not, which Mr. Regan attributed to what he described as the news media's inattention to the underlying problems behind recurring deficits. Only one in five respondents said that Mr. Regan had offered long-term plans to deal with deficits -- evidence, he indicated, of a gap between his efforts to call attention to budgetary irresponsibility and the public's perception of his effectiveness.
The telephone survey of 800 registered voters statewide was conducted by Penn & Schoen Associates between April 26 and May 6. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
Almost 7 in 10 surveyed said that the state's problems were so big and steeped in politics that a private commission would do a better job of proposing nonpartisan legislative solutions than politicians.
 
Unexpected Answers
 The survey found dissatisfaction about high spending and support for reducing inefficiency in state programs. But some results were less predictable, particularly in a poll released by the ranking Republican in state government.
Nearly two in three respondents agreed that the state's budget problems were a direct result of "the failed economic policies of the Reagan and Bush Administrations."
Given a choice of raising taxes for state programs or cutting those programs, one in three people preferred the tax increase. Nearly as many blamed the Legislature (about one in five) as blamed Gov. Mario M. Cuomo (about one in three) for fiscal problems.
Asked which single expense they would cut, one in four respondents volunteered welfare, and one in six preferred to prune legislators' salaries.

HEADLINE: Hand Injuries In Workplace Ignite Battle

BYLINE: By DONATELLA LORCH

 BODY:
In a decision that creates a forum for the legal battle over one of the nation's fastest growing workplace disabilities, a Federal judge in Brooklyn agreed yesterday to combine 44 hand-injury suits into one consolidated case.
Such hand injuries -- which are known as repetitive stress injuries and which medical experts say can be caused by the routine use of computers, supermarket checkout scanners and other mechanical and electrical devices -- have spawned hundreds of individual lawsuits across the country in recent years. 
 But legal experts said that yesterday's decision by Judge Jack B. Weinstein marked the first time that many repetitive stress cases had been consolidated, a technique that has previously produced legal precedents in such areas as asbestos.
 
Possible Precedent
 And while the decision could be revised or overturned at a later date, the experts say the outcome of these cases could also set a precedent for future litigation.
The consolidated cases were assigned to Judge Denis R. Hurley. But before they go to trial, Judge Hurley will have to rule on whether they have factual, legal and scientific issues in common. At the heart of the case will be whether repetitive stress injury can be considered a general syndrome, or even whether there is any such medically recognized injury. Only then will the question of responsibility be assessed.
The plaintiffs run the gamut from stenographers, postal workers, and data inputers to word processors and journalists, among others.
The workers are suing the manufacturers of the equipment they use -- multi-million dollar companies like Apple Computer, A.T.& T., I.B.M., and Atex and its parent company Eastman Kodak. Workers' compensation laws prohibit employees injured on the job from suing their company.
The injured workers include employees from Nynex, Blue Cross-Blue Shield, the New Jersey Department of Taxation, The New York Times, The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Philadelphia Daily News, and Newsday, said Steven Phillips, a lawyer in the New York firm of Levy, Phillips and Konigsberg, which is representing 37 of the plaintiffs.
Aside from the 44 consolidated lawsuits in Brooklyn Federal Court, there are 16 similar lawsuits pending in the Southern District of New York and 84 in the New York State courts. Judge Weinstein suggested that they, too, might be included in the suit at a later date.
"The message is that it's time to take litigation seriously," said Mr. Phillips, the lawyer who presented the original motion. "We want a single judge to decide it so we don't have to reinvent the wheel hundreds of times." Mr. Phillips said he had more than a hundred other such cases pending.
While some conceded that the judge's decision lent an appearance of greater credibility to the plaintiffs' claims, lawyers for the defendants said yesterday that there were no genuine links among the claims and that they should not have been joined.
"The types of machinery are different from one case to another, so without the commonality of product, of work history, of individual's background as well, there isn't a reason for all of the cases to be thrown into one hopper," said Arthur J. Liederman, a lawyer representing Matsushita Electronics and C. Itoh. "It's one thing if somebody is exposed to asbestos. That's one fiber, one product."
 
'Heard on the Merits'
 But Michael Cerussi, who represents International Business Machines, said, "I'm not necessarily displeased by the decision." The decision will speed up the legal process, he said. "What'll happen now is that I.B.M. is going to have the opportunity to get heard on the merits of this sooner rather than later."
And, like other defense lawyers, Mr. Cerussi argued that there were no merits. "One, there's nothing wrong with the product in the first instance, and, two, the nexus between the product and claimed injury doesn't exist," he said.
With the rise in theuse of personal computers, injuries caused by repeating the same motions thousands of times a day crept from assembly lines into the previously low-risk white-collar world during the last decade, according to physicians who treat people with repetitive stress injuries
By sitting in the same position for four or five hours to punch keys without pause or variation, telephone operators, data entry workers, reporters and other computer operators can overtax the muscles and tendons in their wrists and forearms. As the strain accumulates, it can lead to swelling and inflammation of those tissues, causing weakness, numbness, tingling and pain.
In extreme cases, the injuries can render a victim unemployable, turning motions as routine as gripping a doorknob or lifting a coffee cup into painful ordeals.
"It can be anywhere from three months to two years to recover, depending upon the severity of the injury," said Dr. Emil F. Pascarelli, who has treated hundreds of musicians and computer operators with repetitive stress injuries at the Miller Institute at St. Lukes Roosevelt Hospital Center.
Consolidation has benefits. A single or a series of larger lawsuits economize time and money. In fact, in the opinion document, Judge Weinstein stressed that consolidation of law suits "will provide for convenience and economy of effort." "A significant feature in these cases supporting consolidation is that the litigation is still in infancy," Judge Weinstein wrote.
Depending on the number of consolidated cases, there will be fewer juries and verdicts and depositions by experts would be limited.
Consolidated cases can also create a ripple effect, bringing it to the attention of other injured workers who have not filed suit. "It lets other plaintiffs know about that litigation," said Melvin Friedman, a senior partner at Kreindler & Kreindler a firm that has dealt with consolidated cases. "One of its goals is to wake up people to an injury whose source they may not know."
 
'Slip Through Cracks'
 Mr. Phillips said that individual repetitive stress suits might make it easier for manufacturers to "slip through cracks in a confused, serendipitous situation."
But there are downsides as well. Large numbers of cases lumped together make it very difficult for cases to be settled, said Stuart Speiser, senior partner at Speiser, Krause, Madole, & Nolan a firm that has dealt in large aviation cases. "Total consolidation of cases I don't think is good for anybody," Mr. Speiser said. "The preferable method is to have them pending before the same judge so that there is no duplication and then if appropriate have one trial on liability."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGNBUSH WIDENS PLAN ON BUSINESS ZONES

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 2

 BODY:
As Congress and the White House continued to fight over the response to the recent rioting in Los Angeles, the Bush Administration today announced a plan to expand urban enterprise zones, one of its favorite antipoverty proposals.
Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp, the Administration's most ardent advocate of enterprise zones, said in a telephone interview that the new plan would increase both the number of zones as well as the tax breaks they offer. 
 To sell his proposals, President Bush brought Mayor Tom Bradley of Los Angeles and other California leaders to the White House today to tell Democratic Congressional leaders that the initiative would help rebuild the nation's cities.
The meeting was part of a negotiating effort by the White House to back increased aid for urban summer-job programs in exchange for a pledge by Congressional leaders to move quickly on the President's proposal to grant tax advantages to businesses willing to invest in inner-city neighborhoods.
 
Plans for Passage
 The House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley, said Mr. Bush had suggested at the meeting that his enterprise-zone proposal be broken out of his broader urban package to expedite passage before the Fourth of July Congressional recess. "We are going to discuss that and get back to the President," said Mr. Foley, a Washington Democrat.
Enterprise zones are intended to lure businesses into impoverished areas by means of tax cuts. The Administration contends that this approach will bring jobs to those who need them most, although Congress has viewed such claims with skepticism and has allowed previous proposals to languish for more than a decade.
While the previous Administration proposal would have created 50 enterprise zones, Mr. Kemp said the new one would create them in any community that meets criteria like endemic poverty, unemployment and a shrinking tax base.
In addition, Mr. Kemp said the new plan for expanded enterprise zones would eliminate all capital gains taxes in such areas, while the previous proposal did away with only some of those taxes. It would also eliminate the "alternative minimum tax" that investors pay, and would allow investors who buy stock in companies in enterprise zones to deduct that investment from their taxes immediately.
Despite today's maneuvering, officials close to the negotiations between the White House and Democratic leaders said they were inching closer to an agreement on a measure to help the nation's cities. The bill would include most of a $1.5 billion provision for summer jobs, Head Start and law enforcement for 75 big cities that was passed by the Senate but not by the House.
 
'Hope, Faith and Confidence'
 After the meeting at the White House, Mr. Bradley told reporters that urban enterprise zones would "add greatly to our desire to restore the hope, faith and confidence of the people in the cities of America."
Standing alongside Gov. Pete Wilson of California and Peter Ueberroth, the leader of the effort to rebuild parts of Los Angeles scarred by rioting last month, Mr. Bradley added, "We've got to demonstrate to the people of our cities that the Government means business."
Democratic Congressional leaders said they also support urban enterprise zones, but expressed dismay that Mr. Bush did not specify how he would pay for the program, which will involve an estimated $2.3 billion in tax breaks over five years.
The Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell, said he was concerned that if Congress considered the urban enterprise zone legislation apart from other initiatives, public interest could wane and momentum would be lost in legislating job and school relief.
"We think enterprise zones make sense," said Mr. Mitchell, a Democrat from Maine. But he added that "to achieve the full beneficial effect of enterprise zones, it's important to have education, job training and other initiatives at the same time."
The House Republican whip, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, said the Democrats were stalling. He and other conservatives contend that the Democrats are more interested in raising taxes and expanding urban bureaucracies than in promoting solutions based on private enterprise.

HEADLINE: Cynicism and Hope: Diverse Voices of Black Youth

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEMPHIS

 BODY:
This is a city of song and sorrow, a great fount of blues music and the place where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was murdered in 1968, touching off riots across the country.
This year, while the wounds from the recent rioting are still raw in Los Angeles, all seems calm here. On these late spring weekends the sweet, smoky aroma of barbecue floats over shabby patches of the inner city. Children play tag while the grownups set up folding chairs, stock ice coolers and slap grandma's secret sauce on the ribs. 
 But a visitor who asks will find that many of these Memphis residents, largely black and struggling, feel increasingly isolated from the American mainstream by poverty, unemployment and racism.
And the suspicion and cynicism have a hard edge especially among the young. They voice a sharp distrust and fear of the police, the courts and the government and its leaders.
"They don't really care about black people," Marissa Dicluson, 15 years old, said the other day. "It's hard to choose a political role model, black or white. They lie. 'No new taxes.' Right. They're so phony and fake. They say how they're going to fix up the projects around here, but they never do."
 
Are Whites to Blame
 In more than two dozen interviews, from public housing projects to street corners along blues-soaked Beale Street, inner-city teen-agers and young adults talked about their lives, their hopes and their heroes. Their voices sounded like echoes from the streets of Watts or the South Side of Chicago or Harlem, and they were just as diverse. Black America is not a monolith.
"It seems like white folks want to do away with us," said William Grant, 18. "During wars they always put us on the front lines so we'll die first."
Less than a block away, though, Mark Williams, 20, said: "You can't blame everything on the white man now. I think racism is over. Opportunity is out there, you just got to go out and get it."
But so far, Mr. Williams said, he has not been able to just go out and get a job.
"I need a job bad," he said with a sigh. "Any job. But nobody will hire me."
After the April 29 acquittal of four white Los Angeles police officers in the beating of Rodney G. King, the black motorist, some of the boys at the Dixie Boys Club, on the grounds of a public housing project here, were angry, said Joe Jones, the club's 28-year-old program director, but others just called the verdict business as usual.
"We try to convince the kids to work and strive within the system," Mr. Jones said. "It's hard to teach them that when they see things like the Rodney King incident."
 
Meeting at the Club
 The gym at the John Dustin Buckman Boys Club on the city's struggling north side is crowded when school lets out for the day.
"The Boys Club is really a lifesaver for a lot of these kids," said Bernal E. Smith, the club director. "On the streets it's a survival-of-the-fittest situation. Inner-city youth don't have summer jobs, and that's a big part of the problem."
Patrice Ray, 19, his brother Solomon, 17, and their friend Caesar Davis, 17, play basketball at the club on most afternoons because, in the words of Mr. Davis, "it's too violent out there."
When asked whom they look to for guidance, the three friends named their parents and then several rap stars, including Ice Cube and Ice T.
"Rappers, they educate through reality," Solomon Ray said. "They talk about how politicians be crooked, how TV and newspapers lie. They tell the truth about the world."
The rap stars also tell the truth "about how wrong the police be treating us," Patrice Ray said.
His brother interjected: "Their job is to serve and protect us. Who's going to protect us from them?"
"Being broke all the time is how selling dope gets started," Solomon Ray continued. "We need some jobs in the ghetto, and they need to raise the minimum wage. Slavery days is over."
 
A Principal's Lament
 Not far away is Booker T. Washington High School, the city's oldest predominantly black high school. The principal, Elsie Lewis Bailey, spends much of her time nurturing the aspirations of her students.
"Our children can learn just like anybody else," Mrs. Bailey said. "But the children lack a lot of experiences. Many of our kids don't get out of this community for anything.
"We're in an area that is terribly economically depressed. Our kids aspire to the same things that other students aspire to. But some of them don't know how to get there."
Late one recent afternoon, six students sat around a table in the school. Although they said they generally did not trust politicians or others who are usually called "leaders," there were exceptions like the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Memphis's first black mayor, W. W. Herenton, who was elected last November by 172 votes.
"But it's hard to succeed when you only see good examples every 10 years or so," said Freddrick Dupree, who hopes to become a doctor. "All we have now is the Mayor."
The students said it was also hard to succeed when they were confronted and held back by stereotypes. Mr. Dupree said the police harassed young black people in his neighborhood regardless of whether they were selling dope or jumping rope.
"It seems like society wants us to fall flat on our faces," Ms. Dicluson added. "Other schools call us a 'project school.' They say stuff like we can't go anywhere without a police escort. They call us 'at risk.' When they stick these tags on us, we end up doing exactly what they want us to do: fail."
"But I'm not at risk," she said. "I'm not going to fail."
 
Legacy of the King Era
 Dr. King came to Memphis in 1968 to support a strike by public works employees. Willie Cooper, then and now, worked for that department, and he marched with Dr. King.
"I carried a sign for 65 days saying, 'I am a man,' " Mr. Cooper said. "I thought things would change, would get better, but it looks like they're slipping back. These youngsters today aren't going to take what we took or half of what we took."
There is a generation gap in the Cooper family -- more than one, in fact. Willie Cooper's 35-year-old son, Arthur, is more hopeful about race relations, at least when he begins to talk.
"It was the happiest day of my life when we elected a black Mayor," Arthur Cooper said. "It was like some big chains fell off my back."
The younger Mr. Cooper then said that he had an 18-year-old daughter and that she and her friends were restless and angry about their lives. A black Mayor does not mean as much to them, he said.
"I'm not prejudiced," he went on. "But when black people earn anything, it's always a struggle. It gets on your nerves. We always have to struggle. Something is going to have to give. These kids are too mad."
 
A Budding Family
 Hurt Village, a troubled public housing project, is a series of red two-story buildings in the style of row houses not far from the fun, music and tourists of Beale Street. The Police Department has recently begun an aggressive foot patrol in the project to curtail the frequent shootings and drug dealing there.
Tanya Minor, 19, has lived in Hurt Village for much of her life. She and her 19-year-old boyfriend, Rico Monet, have a baby girl. "We aren't on welfare," Ms. Minor said. "We're going to raise this baby ourselves."
The other day Ms. Minor sat in front of the home she shares with her family and said race relations "are going back to the way they used to be."
Mr. Monet ground out a cigarette butt in the dirt yard and said, "It don't make a difference what we say or do, white folks is going to treat us like dogs."
"White people the ones bringing the drugs into the country, but we the only ones going to jail for it," he said.
Nearby, Judy Price, 19, said she was happy to see so many police officers walking through the project, chasing away the drug dealers. "Now the kids can go out and play," she said.
Around the corner, William Grant stood talking with his family. He said that he had two role models -- his grandmother and Marcus Garvey, the black back-to-Africa advocate of the 1920's -- but that it was the words of a stranger who helped persuade him to stop selling drugs.
Mr. Grant said he had attended a meeting for teen-agers conducted by 100 Black Men, a group of professionals who also do neighborhood work. One speaker told the group that one measure of a man was what the women of his life thought about him.
"That made me think," Mr. Grant said. "If I ever have a family, I want my kids to look up to me. I don't want them saying I was a dope dealer, destroying our own people.
"You know, Coretta Scott King can tell her kids that Dr. King died fighting for his people. His kids are proud of that and want to follow in his footsteps. I want my kids to be proud of me like that, too."

Papers Merge In Alaska

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ANCHORAGE, June 2

 BODY:
The Anchorage Times was sold today to its rival's owner and was to publish its last edition on Wednesday.
The closing makes Alaska's largest city a one-newspaper town and lowers to 60 the number of American cities with more than one daily. 
 The Times was sold to McClatchy Newspapers Inc., based in Sacramento, Calif. McClatchy owns The Anchorage Daily News.
"It's real hard for two newspapers to make it economically, so we elected to sell," said Bill Allen, The Time's owner and publisher. "It's a sad day and a good day."
No purchase price was disclosed. A severance package equivalent to two months' wages was offered to Times employees, Mr. Allen said. The Times employed 471 people and The Daily News 476 people last year.
McClatchy bought The Daily News in 1979 when its daily circulation was 11,500 to The Times' 45,600.The Daily News overtook The Times in circulation 10 years ago.

HEADLINE: MILITARY IN HAITI NAMES A PREMIER

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, June 2

 BODY:
The military-backed Government named a conservative politician today to become the country's new leader, the state-run National Radio said.
The politician, Marc Bazin, a former World Bank official and businessman, would become Prime Minister and run a consensus Government under a plan backed by the army and many politicians. Parliament is expected to ratify his selection in about a week. 
 Mr. Bazin's appointment has been opposed by the international community and supporters of the ousted President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
Haiti has been shaken by growing violence and an exodus of thousands of Haitians by boat over the last several weeks as hemisphere-wide sanctions have squeezed the economy.
A radio report broadcast from Parliament quoted an "official and authorized source" as saying Mr. Bazin had been designated by the interim President, Joseph Nerette. Under the plan, Mr. Nerette and Prime Minister Jean-Jacques Honorat would step down once Mr. Bazin's appointment was approved. The presidency would remain vacant.
Mr. Nerette and Mr. Honorat were appointed by parliament, under heavy pressure from the army, shortly after Father Aristide's ouster on Sept. 30 in a bloody coup.
Mr. Bazin, 60 years old, holds a law degree from the University of Paris and spent more than 20 years as a development expert for the World Bank in West Africa and Haiti.
In 1982, he was economy minister for the dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier, but he was ousted after just four months for attacking corruption. The brief stint earned him the nickname "Mr. Clean."
In the elections in December 1990, Mr. Bazin, who speaks fluent English, was said to be favored by the United States (some have called him "Mr. America"), but he ran a distant second to Father Aristide. Mr. Bazin's relationship with the American embassy soured after Father Aristide's ouster.
Mr. Bazin is despised by many supporters of Father Aristide. The ousted President remains highly popular and a leftist coalition that has sought his reinstatement, the National Front for Change and Democracy, has vowed to boycott the ratification proceedings for Mr. Bazin. A co-leader of the Front, Victor Benoit, has said the coalition, which holds almost half the votes in the House of Deputies, would refuse to recognize Mr. Bazin.

HEADLINE: Rumors Fly On Meeting At Salomon

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON Jr.

 BODY:
Wall Street eats rumors for breakfast, and its plate was heaped high yesterday. The topic was who will be named today to replace Warren E. Buffett at Salomon Inc., where he has served as interim chairman since last year.
Salomon's directors are scheduled to gather for a monthly meeting in New York this morning, and executives close to the firm said Mr. Buffett had said he would name a successor. No one could be sure, however, just who it would be. 
 John J. Byrne is the name that jumped off many a tongue yesterday. As chief executive of the Fund American Companies, Mr. Byrne is a big investor who is familiar with Wall Street's peculiar ways and, perhaps more important, is a longtime acquaintance of Mr. Buffett.
 
'In the Buffett Mold'
 "Byrne is a man in the Buffett mold," said one Wall Street executive who asked not to be named. "He can be a strong leader without meddling, which is apparently what Warren wants."
Other candidates mentioned by Wall Street executives included John C. Whitehead, the former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company; Thomas S. Murphy, the chairman of Capital Cities/ABC Inc., and Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve.
"Warren's been looking for a Volckeresque character, since Volcker himself apparently isn't interested in the job," said another executive, who also asked not to be named. "Someone of stature, who understands the Street."
Mr. Byrne, 60 years old, may not have Mr. Volcker's stature, but he earned a reputation for able management by leading the Government Employee Insurance Company from insolvency in 1976 to a solidly profitable enterprise in the mid-1980's.
One of the insurer's leading investors was Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Mr. Buffett's Omaha-based investment company, which also assisted Mr. Byrne when he led the Fireman's Fund Corporation, with well-known results.
"Jack Byrne is a very logical choice," said John Keefe, the president of Keefe Worldwide Information Services. "He's not only an eminence grise, he's one with substance."
 
Competitor's Ties Cited
 But another executive pointed out Mr. Byrne's position as a director at the American Express Company, which owns Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., a Salomon competitor, and said he thought it unlikely that Mr. Byrne would be Mr. Buffett's choice.
When Mr. Buffett detailed the requirements for the job in Salomon's annual report in March, he said the chairman should be "an owner-oriented and business-wise man or woman" who can supervise and counsel the heads of Salomon's two subsidiaries, Salomon Brothers Inc. and Phibro Energy Inc.
"Essentially, the holder of the job will act as a strong, nonoperating chairman of two companies lodged under one corporate roof," he said in the report. "This position may not require the full time of its occupant but it will demand significant time."
Deryck C. Maughan was named chairman and chief executive of Salomon Brothers last week, and Andrew J. Hall is Phibro's chairman and chief executive.
 
Byrne Unavailable for Comment
 Mr. Byrne's office in Norwich, Vt., said yesterday that he was traveling and could not be reached for comment. A Salomon spokesman, Robert F. Baker Jr., said the board meeting had been scheduled long in advance, and he declined to discuss the agenda.
Mr. Buffett told reporters last autumn, when Salomon was still under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission for its role in a Treasury scandal, that his successor would need to have experience running a business, and he expressly ruled out Mr. Volcker, who was the Fed chairman from 1979 to 1987.
On May 20, Salomon agreed to pay $290 million to settle charges that it had systematically submitted phony bids in Treasury auctions, freeing Mr. Buffett to pursue his often-stated goal of retreating from Salomon once its legal problems related to the scandal were resolved.
 
A Noted Dictum
 Mr. Keefe of Keefe Worldwide Information Services noted that one of Mr. Buffett's well-known dictums was that when management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for bad economics, it is invariably the reputation of the business that survives.
"Byrne is one of the few cases," Mr. Keefe said, "where good management has collided with crummy industry, and everybody still thinks they're good managers."
Another executive recalled that Mr. Byrne was mentioned as a possible successor in the current issue of Business Week magazine and said that he wondered how much of yesterday's talk was, like so much gossip, a blanket of speculation wrapped around a germ of information.

HEADLINE: Afro-American Studies Get New Life at Harvard

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., May 29

 BODY:
Since it was founded amid the political protests of the late 1960's, the Afro-American studies department at Harvard has struggled. Professors elsewhere in the university criticized the new department's scholarly work as mediocre. Some said the department was run by radical black students. And students and professors in Afro-American studies felt Harvard neglected them.
By the 1990-1991 academic year, the department seemed on the verge of collapse. Only one tenured professor remained, and Harvard students majoring in Afro-American studies found themselves in the unfamiliar position of having to go to Tufts University or Boston University to take required courses. 
 But now the Afro-American studies department has handsome new offices overlooking Harvard Square, four new professors have joined the faculty, and the department's new chairman, Henry Louis Gates Jr., a prominent black literary critic, has reorganized and re-energized the program.
In one year, the number of undergraduates majoring in Afro-American studies at Harvard has almost doubled, going to 37 from 19. "Gates has done miracles; the department is as different as night and day," said Mecca Nelson, a 21-year-old senior from Flint, Mich., who is majoring in Afro-American studies.
 
National Implications
 Perhaps even more important, the transformation of the department at Harvard has national implications, at a time when Afro-American studies as a discipline has been under assault.
"Because of Harvard's national pre-eminence, what happens there gives Afro-American studies an intellectual legitimacy for other places," said Cornel West, the director of the Afro-American studies program at Princeton, considered by many to be the best in the country. "What's happening at Harvard makes it more difficult to trash Afro-American studies."
John Blassingame, a tenured professor of history and African-American studies at Yale University, concurred. "I've always said that until Harvard has a strong program, the enterprise called African-American studies won't arrive," he said.
At the center of the changes at Harvard is Professor Gates, known as "Skip" to his friends and colleagues, a 41-year-old academic entrepreneur who has been one of the most sought-after scholars in the country in the last decade. Cornell University made him a full professor at the age of 33 to lure him away from Yale, his alma mater; Duke University then gave him an endowed chair.
But he stayed at Duke only a year before accepting an offer from Harvard that made him simultaneously chairman of the Afro-American studies department, the W. E. B. Du Bois professor of the humanities and the director of the W. E. B. Du Bois Institute, a research institute.
 
Fear of Closing
 When he was first offered the job at Harvard, Professor Gates said in an interview in his office: "I thought the department had been cursed. Afro-American studies here were about to be shut down."
But Henry Rosovsky, the longtime dean of the faculty of arts and sciences, assured him that Harvard was now serious about building the best Afro-American studies program in the world.
"Harvard was the ideal situation," Professor Gates said. "I had always wanted to build an institution, and there was no dead wood to clear out."
In 1990, Mr. Rosovksy said, when both he and Derek Bok, who had been president of Harvard for two decades, were about to retire from administrative work, they decided to "make one last very determined effort" to build a good Afro-American studies department.
"We didn't want to leave that one last item in poor condition," said Mr. Rosovsky, who is still a professor of economics. "So we went out to look for the person who could do it, and we got Skip."
 
Time of Protest
 It may have helped that a number of black students at Harvard were protesting the lack of a first-rate Afro-American studies program.
Professor Gates has moved quickly, securing the new offices and helping to bring in three new professors, including his closest intellectual friend, K. Anthony Appiah, a Ghanian-born philosopher who was also hired away from Duke. Professor Gates hopes to bring in several more new professors in the next few years, conserving his resources by making the appointments jointly with other departments like the Divinity School, and the music, fine arts and history departments.
In the past, making such joint appointments at Harvard proved difficult because many professors were skeptical of the academic quality of the work being done in Afro-American studies. Harvard's history department does not have a single professor working on Afro-American topics, and it recently cut short a search for a new professor in that field, concluding that none of sufficient stature was available, several professors said.
Mr. Gates has also made several high-profile moves to fill in the gaps in the department's course offerings and to give Afro-American studies more excitement. Last winter he invited a friend, Spike Lee, the film director, to teach a seminar at Harvard. The course was oversubscribed and so successful that Mr. Lee has agreed to come back again in the fall.
The Afro-American Studies Department has not offered graduate degrees, reflecting its diminished status at Harvard. But Professor Gates is optimistic that there will be a master's degree program soon, and after that a Ph.D. program.
Politically, Mr. Gates has disappointed some of the more radical students because he does not share their black nationalist or Afrocentric views. The Afrocentrists believe that the ancient Egyptians were black and that therefore Western civilization is derived from black Africans.
Mr. Gates said that some of the work being done in the more than 200 Afro-American studies programs around the country is intellectually "bogus" because, he contends, they are essentially inventing an African past that never was.
"You would think that the most urgent issue in Afro-American studies departments today would be the causes of poverty and how they can be remedied," he said. "But this is not the most urgent issue.
"The most urgent issue is whether Cleopatra was black. This is classic escapism and romanticism."
Professor Gates would like to see more rigorous scholarship, rather than what he calls "ethnic cheerleading," to separate truth from fiction.
In a conciliatory gesture this spring, Professor Gates invited the more radical students to send him their comments, and he has agreed to lead an informal reading course next fall examining some of the Afrocentric writings, Professor Appiah said.
"We told them we're grateful that they made a fuss, because that's why we're here," Professor Appiah said, referring to the student protests in 1990.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Move Higher

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved higher yesterday after the Federal Reserve Board surprised credit market participants when it aggressively purchased notes and bonds for its own account.
Market prices were down from Monday's late levels at the time the Fed made its so-called coupon pass. 
 "Of the coupon passes I have seen, this was on the aggressive side," said one government bond trader.
Analysts estimated the Fed bought about $3 billion worth of securities, and said the move had no policy implications. The Fed routinely declines to comment on its open market operations. Purchases of Treasury securities by the Fed add reserves to the banking system.
The Fed's action "was a pleasant surprise for those who had some coupon-bearing securities they wanted to unload," said Dana Johnson, chief money market economist at the First National Bank of Chicago, "but there is no reason to think that this pass was anything other than technical."
Economic data released yesterday continued to support those who argue for a mild recovery.
The four-tenths of a percent rise in the Government's index of leading economic indicators was bigger than expected, but the 1.3 percent increase in new-home sales during April was an extremely mild rebound from the nearly 16 percent decline registered in March.
"New-home sales were running at an unsustainably rapid rate in the first quarter," said Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial economist at Fuji Securities Inc. "From here on I expect they will work their way higher, but slowly and irregularly."
Despite the price gains recorded during the session, traders said they remain cautious in advance of May employment data to be released on Friday.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 101 19/32 , up 1/4 point, to yield 7.86 percent, compared with 7.88 percent late Monday.
Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 101 6/32 in late trading, up 1/4 point, to yield 7.32 percent. The 6 3/4 percent five-year notes were offered at 100 5/8, up 1/4 point, to yield 6.60 percent. And the 5 1/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 7/8, up 1/8 point, to yield 5.19 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates inched lower.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.72 percent late yesterday, down one basis point, or one one-hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by two basis points, to a late offered rate of 3.85 percent.
In the corporate bond market, Cinemark USA, a movie theater operator, offered $125 million worth of high-yield 10-year senior notes through an underwriting group led by Bear, Stearns & Company.
The 12 percent notes, which are callable in five years at a price of 106, were priced at $100, or par.
The securities are rated B-1 by Moody's Investors Service and B+ by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
The Morgan Guaranty Trust Company offered $500 million worth of one-year notes through underwriters led by Morgan Stanley & Company.

HEADLINE: Dow Back Under 3,400 With 17.11 Decline

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stock prices fell in active trading yesterday, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average below 3,400 as investors took profits.
Drug issues slipped on worries about earnings as fickle investor attitudes about the economy turned pessimistic. 
 The Dow, which closed past the 3,400 threshold for the first time on Monday, fell 17.11 points yesterday to end at 3,396.10.
 
Stock Hangover
 "The market had a little bit of a hangover from breaking into record territory," said Philip Orlando, a trader at Unity Management.
Declining issues led advancers, 917 to 815, on a New York Stock Exchange volume of 203.1 million shares, compared with 190.6 million on Monday. The Big Board's composite index fell 1.70 to close at 228.20.
Broader market gauges were mostly lower. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 issues fell 3.80 points, to 413.50, as the American Stock Exchange's composite index finished 0.89 point lower at 393.95. In over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index rose 0.81 point, to 589.18.
"The market made a couple attempts to best its closing level of yesterday and failed, and that created a little bit of concern," said Eugene Peroni, a trader at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.
 
Selling Programs a Factor
 Traders said some selling programs late in the session knocked the Dow to its low for the day of about 3,393. A sharp selloff in drug stocks kept many investors hesitant, analysts said.
Drug issues fell after a warning from Bristol-Myers Squibb on profits and after Miriam Cutler, an analyst at Lehman Brothers Inc., downgraded Johnson & Johnson.
Mr. Orlando of Unity Management said disappointing earnings from Syntex last week were also a factor. "The Street said that if three drug companies are having problems, maybe the rest of the group is, too," he said.
Bristol-Myers tumbled 6 7/8, to 66 7/8; Johnson & Johnson dropped 5 5/8, to 92 3/8, and Merck lost 1 1/2, to 49 5/8. Syntex was off 2 3/4, to 35 3/8.
 
Sun Microsystems Off 2
 Sun Microsystems fell 2, to 26, in over-the-counter trading. Alex. Brown & Sons removed the computer maker from its "emphasis" list and cut forecasts. Harley Davidson, the Milwaukee-based motorcycle maker, fell 2 7/8, to 55 7/8. The company said it had fallen behind on its production schedule. Salomon Brothers was among the brokerages trimming its estimates as a result.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts Broad Gains As Denmark Rejects Treaty

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended mostly higher on world currency markets yesterday after early returns from a referendum in Denmark showed voters rejected a treaty on European political and economic union.
Gold also rose. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $339.30 an ounce, up $1.50 from Monday. The Republic National Bank said gold was up $1.35 an ounce, to $337.60. 
 The dollar settled higher in overseas trading, aided by buying from traders seeking to offset previous bets that the dollar would fall. But the overseas gains faded in New York on disappointing economic data.
The Government reported that sales of new homes rose just 1.3 percent in April; many analysts had expected a gain of about 7 percent.
In addition, the sharp March decline in home sales was revised even further downward, to 15.9 percent from 14.8 percent. That was the largest drop in a decade. But another report, on the Government's main economic forecasting tool, showed the index of leading indicators rose more than expected in April.
The data seemed to underscore the fitful nature of the economic recovery.
"The market is more reactive to bad news than good," said Kevin Lawrie, director of foreign exchange at the Bank of Boston.
However, as initial results of the Danish voting began to filter out just before the market's close, "the dollar took off," Mr. Lawrie said.
After currency trading ceased in New York, it was reported that in the final count, Danish voters, by a slim margin, had rejected having Denmark adhere to the European treaty.
European officials had said Danish rejection of the treaty would mean the other 11 nations in the community would have to produce a new accord.
"In times of confusion, people tend to buy dollars," Mr. Lawrie said.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 127.48 yen, up 0.70 yen from Monday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 127.55 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 127.45 yen, up from 126.95 Monday.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Platinum's Price Up Sharply On Strong Europe Demand

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Strong European demand and some hints of an improving American economy sent platinum futures sharply higher yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Platinum for delivery in July settled $8.90 higher at $377.20 an ounce. 
 "The key to platinum's advance seems to be a surge in commercial demand, mainly out of Europe," said William O'Neill, senior futures strategist in New York with Merrill Lynch Futures. "We started to hear last week of tight supplies in Europe, and some of this may be related to the emission standards that go into effect there later this year."
A primary use for platinum is in automobile catalytic converters.
 
No Long-Term Shortage Seen
 In addition to the increased demand, the Commonwealth of Independent States, created from parts of the old Soviet Union, is expected to sell less of the metal this year.
While there are no signs of long-term shortages of platinum, there could be short-term tightness, Mr. O'Neill said.
In addition to the overseas influence on platinum futures, domestic news also played a part.
"The data continue to show an economic rebound," said Peter Cardillo, research director in New York for Westfalia Investments Inc. "That is a major plus for the metals."
The Commerce Department said Tuesday that its index of leading indicators increased four-tenths of 1 percent in April -- better than expected but still less than robust.
On the Chicago Board of Trade, forecasts for some rain in the Midwest this week were brushed aside, and soybean and corn futures prices rose.
Dry conditions are posing a particular threat to the heart of the corn region.
"The indications now are that some of the drier areas of Iowa, Illinois and Indiana probably will get no rain until at least a week from this Thursday," said Joel Karlin, an analyst in Chicago with K & S Research.
Wheat was also higher because of continuing rains in the southern Plains that have delayed the harvest of the winter wheat crop.
"The rain just can't get past a high-pressure area," Mr. Karlin said.
Cattle futures slumped in late trading at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. While the cash cattle and wholesale beef prices are supportive now, traders say they are not convinced that these markets will not turn weaker in the coming weeks.
Energy futures were mixed on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Light crude oil for July delivery was 8 cents higher at $22.11 a barrel; July heating oil was 0.13 cent higher at 60.38 cents a gallon; July unleaded gasoline was 0.13 cent lower at 65.79 cents a gallon, and July natural gas was 0.8 cent lower at $1.652 for 1,000 cubic feet.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Another Recovery Forecast, This One a Quarter Delayed

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
LIKE the station master who keeps reassuring impatient passengers that yes, indeed, the train is coming, a leading advertising industry forecaster said yesterday that domestic ad spending was beginning its much-anticipated recovery, albeit at a slower pace than had been hoped.
"I am convinced the economic recovery is on its way," Robert J. Coen, senior vice president and director of forecasting at McCann-Erickson U.S.A., said during a presentation in Manhattan. "Unfortunately, its arrival is about a quarter delayed." 
 "We're on our way back, finally," he added, "but there could be a little lag before everyone gets into the act."
For 1992, Mr. Coen expects ad spending in the United States to total $132.7 billion, which would represent a 5 percent increase from what he called the "terrible" results of last year. In 1991, ad spending actually fell for the first time since 1961, suffering its largest annual decline since 1942. It was a sobering event, perhaps even a watershed, for the advertising, marketing and media industries, for which optimism over ever-rising expenditures has become second nature.
Though a 5 percent gain for ad spending this year would stand in sharp contrast to a decline last year of 1.7 percent, to $126.4 billion, the rebound would not be as robust as Mr. Coen predicted in December. He forecast then that ad spending would rise 6.2 percent in 1992. And it is far from the 8.5 percent increase Mr. Coen forecast in a preliminary estimate a year ago.
Offsetting that, Mr. Coen offered the "good news" that a "recovery will occur in 1993." In his first look at ad spending for next year, he predicted it would total $143 billion, representing a healthier gain of 7.5 percent.
Underscoring Mr. Coen's ambivalence over the course of the economy, he used the word "mixed" almost a dozen times in his remarks. And he noted at several points he had been chided for "being far too optimistic" in the two forecasts he made last year about 1992.
"We're starting to see some improvement in the marketplace," he said. "But it sure isn't booming yet."
If ad spending does rise 5 percent this year, that would match its increase in 1989; the following year, it rose just 3.8 percent. Mr. Coen's forecast assumes an increase in gross domestic product, including inflation, of 4.8 percent, and an increase of 2.1 percent in real gross domestic product.
Mr. Coen, perhaps the most widely followed forecaster of ad spending, has been tracking those trends since 1948. He issues his predictions twice a year, in June and December, updating and revising his figures at subsequent presentations.
J. Kendrick Noble, a longtime advertising and media analyst who attended the presentation yesterday, said he had "been tracking Bob for decades, and he's about as good a forecaster as there is -- his midyear forecast last year notwithstanding."
"He was pretty far off," he added, "but so was I."
 Mr. Noble said he agreed with Mr. Coen's current forecast of slowly improving results for 1992, followed by a 1993 that is "even better."
Alan J. Gottesman, an analyst for Paine Webber Inc. in New York who also attended the presentation, described himself as perhaps more sanguine than Mr. Coen.
Mr. Gottesman said that given the low expectations of most industry executives, there are "odds of a feeding frenzy," that is, even a slight improvement in sentiment could produce "an incredible amount of leverage" to raise advertising demand.
Mr. Coen forecast that national advertising would increase 5.2 percent this year, to $76.4 billion, while local ad spending would increase 4.6 percent, to $56.3 billion.
Among the media categories that he expects to fuel growth are local newspapers, particularly in help-wanted classified ads, which are "going against such bad past results," and local television, which in the first quarter registered solid gains from advertisers like department stores and fast-food restaurants.
Those increases would offset continued weaknesses, Mr. Coen said, in areas like local and national Yellow Pages advertising and national mailings by direct marketers.
Outside the United States, Mr. Coen said that total ad spending should reach $161.8 billion, up 5.4 percent from 1991. That is a slight rise from his forecast in December of $161.5 billion.
And in his preliminary forecast for overseas ad spending next year, Mr. Coen predicted a total of $172 billion, up 6.3 percent from his revised 1992 estimate. Adding that to his prediction for domestic ad spending in 1993 would produce a total of $315 billion -- and it would be the first time ad spending worldwide had ever topped $300 billion.

HEADLINE: Yields Down on C.D.'s and Bank Funds

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
In what has become an almost familiar pattern in the last few months, yields on bank money market accounts and certificates of deposit were down in the week that ended yesterday, according to The Bank Rate Monitor's most recent survey.
The average decline was a little sharper for New York area banks than for those outside the market, reversing last week's trend. 
 If the auction of new three- and six-month Treasury bills on Monday is a harbinger of things to come, the bottom of the current rate decline may be near. The auction is considered by many interest-rate watchers as a good barometer of what banks might be paying their depositors in the weeks ahead.
 
3-Month Rate at 3.75%
 The average rate on a three-month bill was unchanged at 3.75 percent and the six-month bill rate also remained at the previous week's level of 3.90 percent.
Robert K. Heady, the publisher of the interest-rate publication, also noted some easing in the recent modest declines, but he does not see an upturn yet.
"If we begin to receive more bullish news about the economy like this week's leading indicators, then banks' interest rates will turn up," Mr. Heady said. "But one rosy indicator does not a trend make. If the economic news is mixed as it has been over the last couple of months, then rates will remain depressed longer."
 
Money Market Yield at 3.41%
 Yields at New York area banks were down, but the decline was a little less than the previous week, as the average money market account dropped by 3 basis points, to 3.41 percent. The yield on three- and six-month certificates declined by 2 basis points and 1 basis point, respectively, to 3.52 percent and 3.69 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Commercial banks, which make up half of the New York area's composite index, slightly lowered the yield of an average money market account to 3.19 percent, down by 2 basis points, and cut those on the average three-month and six-month certificate, by a basis point each, to 3.38 percent and 3.46 percent, respectively.
Savings banks, which make up the other half of the composite index, made more significant cuts, lowering the average money market account yield by 5 basis points, to 3.62 percent; a three-month C.D. yield by 4 basis points, to 3.67 percent, and a six-month C.D. yield by 3 basis points, to 3.92 percent.
 
Big Cuts in New York
 The sharpest yield changes were among the New York savings banks. First Nationwide dropped 20 basis points from its money matket account yield, to 3.80 percent, and the Anchor Savings Bank trimmed its three-month C.D. yield by 11 basis points, to 3.64 percent. Crossland Savings, for the second time in as many weeks, chopped a quarter of a percentage point off its six-month C.D. yield, to 4 percent.
For 20 large banks outside the New York market, yields were also down, but less so, with a money market account off by 2 basis points, to 3.27 percent, and a six-month C.D. off a basis point, to 3.63 percent.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Producer-Friendly Oil Conservation

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
NOW that Saddam Hussein has been shoved back within his own borders and the pragmatists in Teheran are oozing moderation, is Saudi Arabia once again summoning the courage to flex its formidable energy muscles?
That was certainly the spin the kingdom's leaders wished to put on their decision last week to side with the price hawks in OPEC. And while there is widespread feeling that the Saudis are bluffing, it raises anew the question of how far oil-importing nations should go along to get along. 
 To Morris Adelman, professor emeritus of economics at M.I.T., the Saudis' reported motive, pique at the prospect of an anti-greenhouse tax on carbon fuels, is just a frustrating reminder that OPEC's efforts to raise oil prices have always been vulnerable to strategic countermeasures. Philip Verleger, an oil specialist at the Institute of International Economics in Washington, is more cautious: The Saudi tilt, he suggests, is a warning that the West would be well advised to curb carbon in ways less likely to provoke confrontation.
According to news reports last week, Saudi Arabia had planned to raise output this summer in order to keep oil prices near the current $18-$21 a barrel benchmark at a time of rising demand. But the Saudis changed their mind, serving notice that they would no longer champion price moderation if the industrialized nations went along with a European Community proposal to tax carbon emissions.
Mr. Verleger doubts the Saudis are showing all their cards. The carbon-tax proposal, he notes, was already dead on arrival at the Rio environmental summit since the Bush Administration is not buying it, and the Europeans will not go it alone.
The real story, Mr. Verleger speculates, goes something like this. Oil prices spiked a bit before the OPEC meeting, perhaps on rumors of an assassination attempt on the King of Saudi Arabia. The Saudis then quietly decided to allow prices to stay up for a few months as a gift to the financially pressed (and politically unstable) governments of Venezuela and Nigeria -- but chose to use the occasion to register their protest over carbon taxes.
This fits with the near-consensus view that Saudi Arabia's strategy for long-term survival -- an image of moderation built around stable oil prices -- has not really changed. It also meshes with the view that the Saudis no longer believe they could keep prices much above the current level without racheting down the flow of oil below the rate that keeps them in Rolexes and Range Rovers.
Mr. Adelman, who has long believed that the importers were foolish to concede any price-setting power to OPEC, says the Saudis have done us a favor. The right course, he argues, is full speed ahead on conservation.
He says the Saudis are right to worry about carbon taxes. For while the money would initially come out of the pockets of consumers, the ultimate incidence of carbon tax, like any other excise tax, would turn on how buyers and sellers responded. And since energy consumers have substantial capacity to shift to energy-conserving technologies, the tax would almost certainly reduce the price of oil at the wellhead.
While other energy analysts do not disagree with the thrust of Mr. Adelman's analysis, many still fear there is risk to playing hardball. Jack Riggs, the staff director of the House Subcommittee on Energy and Power, guesses that the Saudis do perceive some flexibility in long-term pricing -- surely not the $10 or $15 a barrel assumed by OPEC hawks in the 1970's, but perhaps a few dollars. And it hardly seems wise to provoke them to try for a higher price if importing countries can find producer-friendlier ways to meet policy objectives.
That, of course, leaves open the question of how to put meat on these worthy bones. One way, suggests Mr. Verleger, would be to use free markets -- but not taxes -- to limit carbon emissions.
The model is the trading system now in place for sulfur. An overall national limit on sulfur emissions was set in the 1990 Clean Air Act, with each polluting electric utility assigned a quota according to past rates of emissions. The utilities are now free to clean up their own mess, or to buy emissions rights from others who can trap sulfur at lower cost.
The design and enforcement of a trading system for carbon would be far more problematic because there are so many sources of emissions. But economists at the Environmental Defense Fund say it could be done. And the ends, least-cost adjustment to fossil fuel conservation, would be identical to that achievable through a carbon tax.
The one big difference is that the Government would not collect a giant pot of money. That might be seen as a big disadvantage by people who would use the tax to fund the budget. But it could prove a big advantage in dealing with Saudi Arabia, which apparently sees itself in competition with governments for the oil consumer's dollar.

HEADLINE: The Pop Life

BYLINE: By Peter Watrous

 BODY:

Los Lobos
Los Lobos, one of the few Mexican-American bands working in pop, will come to town tomorrow for three nights at the Bottom Line to support its new album, "Kiko" (Warner Brothers). In 1987, the Los Angeles-based band had a hit with the track "La Bamba," but since then things haven't gone well commercially. The group released "La Pistola y el Corazon," a record of Mexican folk music, and followed that with "The Neighborhood," a decent enough rock album that vanished like snow in the Mojave. "Kiko," instead of returning the band to form, finds it in an experimental mode.
"This strange thing happened with 'La Bamba': it twisted things, and it took us a little bit to get back on the path again," said Louie Perez, one of Los Lobos' songwriters. "The first reaction was to dig into the roots, so we made 'La Pistola,' which gave us the opportunity to perform more in Spanish using traditional forms. When we did "The Neighborhood," we found ourselves looking into the rock-and-roll base, part of that was going back and redefining things for ourselves." 
 Where the band had often been working in rhythm-and-blues, blues and rock-and-roll, "Kiko" gives less of a nod to specific styles. Rather, songs are spare and the arrangements use odd instrumental configurations; all sorts of sounds percolate in the background.
"At the end of the session for 'Neighborhood,' we started working up some songs that were really different," Mr. Perez said. "They were taking shape like flashes and impressions. We were looking for more of an atmosphere than something conventional, and sonically we were trying to create a climate instead of saying 'Here's where the guitar solo goes.' This is a record where there's a sense of freedom to explore different things."
Los Lobos' songs often have references to Mexican culture, whether they're in the lyrics or in the music itself. In an era where borrowing and eclecticism are standard practices, the record fits right into mainstream pop, something it might not have done 10 years ago.
"It's a balancing act for us," said Mr. Perez. "We live in a different, separate world, and it's not the world that we found ourselves in when we turned on TV when we were kids. This is part of living as an ethnic person in America, I guess. Those differences made us draw chalk lines around ourselves, limiting ourselves, but through music we found a way to go beyond those boundaries. Music connected us with something outside social and economic factors that defined us and led us to a life in larger American culture."
 
Charlie Rich's Way
 When Charlie Rich canceled his appearance at the Bottom Line last week, groans could be heard through the critical world. Mr. Rich, who had been a huge country star in the 1960's, has just released a record, "Pictures and Paintings" (Sire/Warner Brothers), and it had excited people. Mixing jazz and country and blues, it is a particularly American album, moving easily between black and white music, making the connections between styles more important than the differences.
"American music is a good way of putting it," said Mr. Rich, who said he had canceled because of a tooth infection and would reschedule his appearance in New York. "I always have to be careful about what I say, that I did feel confined, because country was a big part of my musical career.
"But I grew up listening to all sorts of music in Arkansas, because black and white people lived very close by. So I heard gospel and blues and country and just about everything. A lot of country people are interested in all sorts of music -- Chet Atkins can play great jazz -- but people cut loose behind closed doors. I don't hate to be a country singer, but this was my fun record."
Mr. Rich has basically been retired since 1981. He'd tired of the road and he and his wife have been writing songs, which is what they say they prefer to do musically. Three years ago, he recorded an album for sale on television, but beyond that, Mr. Rich has lived quietly out of the limelight in Memphis.
"I just settled back in and figured out what to do," he said. "A couple things I kind of wanted to do, like raising my family, I'd been putting off. I just decided that it might be the best thing to do. Now we play around the house quite a bit. We just write songs, we love to do that first of all."

HEADLINE: Some Top Urban Chefs Find New Life Outside the City Limits

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT

 BODY:
WHEN Brendan Walsh packed up his sacks of blue cornmeal and strings of dried chilies to head for Island Park, L.I., in 1990, the acclaim he had earned at Arizona 206 in Manhattan immediately put his new Southwestern-style restaurant, the Coyote Grill, on the map. His venture out of the city to Long Island was so satisfying that last fall, he and his partner, John Vitale, opened another restaurant, the North Street Grill, in Great Neck.
With innovative chefs like Mr. Walsh choosing to do their cooking outside urban centers like Manhattan, the limelight they are used to is spreading beyond the city limits. 
 "I think somebody like Brendan, with that kind of New York reputation, in a restaurant on Long Island has made people notice what's going on," said Michael Meehan, the chef at the Mill River Inn in Oyster Bay, on the North Shore of Long Island. Mr. Meehan, 35 years old, grew up on the Island and cooked in restaurants there before working in Manhattan. He returned to Long Island three years ago, and his cooking now depends heavily on local ingredients.
"It's a great time to be cooking on Long Island," he said. "The public here now appreciates contemporary new American cuisine, and there's a growing network of chefs with lots of imagination and spirit."
In outlying areas all over the New York region, restaurants are adding a measure of urban style in their cooking, service and wine lists, as well as in their sometimes noisy settings. The recession, which hurt restaurants in cities all over the country, made the communities surrounding urban areas more attractive to chefs looking for work or seeking to open their own places.
Chefs and restaurateurs find that it is easier and less expensive to do business outside urban centers. And some chefs in their 30's are now married with young children, so, like many other young parents, they have chosen a life outside the city.
Some chefs, like Barry Squier of Girafe in Basking Ridge, N.J., cultivate their own tomatoes, herbs, berries and lettuces. At the same time, suppliers of the best ingredients, who might have delivered only to the city five years ago, have expanded their routes, making it even easier for the chefs to maintain high standards.
Take Jimmy Burke. He is filling his rustic new Tuscan Grill in Waltham, Mass., outside Boston, with people eager for garlicky wood-grilled shrimp, pappardelle with rabbit and spit-roasted chicken. The Tuscan Grill represents his return to Waltham, where in 1981 he opened a restaurant named Allegro. Encouraged by critical acclaim and a full reservation book, he left Waltham to open another Allegro, in Boston.
But the Boston fling fizzled, and Mr. Burke is now contentedly cooking in Waltham. "We are now seeing more business and from a more varied clientele than we ever had at either Allegro," he said.
In July 1991, Jeff Farnham, formerly a chef on the Queen Elizabeth 2, opened Amadeus in Stamford, Conn., with George Welser and Rudolph Sodamin, who also worked for Cunard, the line that owns the QE2.
"The economics in this area were right," he said. "and we thought it might be more forgiving and less cutthroat than in Manhattan. Manhattan is every chef's aspiration. But when people tell us they're coming here instead of driving to the city, that's very satisfying."
With a nucleus of energetic chefs and restaurateurs in the areas outside cities, not just in luxury restaurants but in new, more casual places, differences in style between those areas and the cities have narrowed.
Mr. Walsh's restaurants -- he is also a consulting chef for Mr. Vitale's seafood restaurant, Paddy McGee's, in Island Park, L.I. -- are all stylish but informal, with a good measure of noise. At the North Street Grill the food departs from Mr. Walsh's Southwestern mode to explore the shores of the Mediterranean. But dishes like wood-oven pizza with artichokes and roasted peppers, and Long Island duck salad with grilled eggplant and dried fruit, still bear his exuberant, well-seasoned stamp.
Christian Bertrand, whose reputation as sous-chef at Lutece in Manhattan preceded him when he opened Bertrand in Greenwich, Conn., nearly five years ago, said he was serving essentially the same kind of haute cuisine. "My customers are very demanding," he added. "They want perfection for their money."
Maxime Ribera, one of the first New York City chefs to open restaurants in Westchester, said: "Suburban customers are more sophisticated today. They want good value, and they understand that you don't need truffles or fancy ingredients for food to have quality."
Mr. Ribera has just converted his formal French restaurant, Maxime's, in Granite Springs in northern Westchester, to a more casual place called Maxime's Brasserie. But before he shifted the emphasis and lowered his prices, he tested the waters with a country bistro, Bistrot Maxime, in nearby Chappaqua. That was just two years ago, and the water's still fine.
Still, some characteristics will always separate city restaurants from those in outlying regions, especially around New York. People outside cities tend to dine out more on the weekends, for example, making for a crush of reservations and a need for larger staffs at those times. As a result, the restaurants must rely on a pool of part-time help. Lately, theme dinners with wine makers and famous chefs have become popular promotions to fill seats during the week.
In the past, it might have taken half a decade or more for a cutting-edge trend to seep outside a city. Today, chefs everywhere are keeping in step.
At Maxime's Brasserie the food is the lusty, classic French bourgeois fare that delights customers and critics at places like Park Bistro and Quatorze in Manhattan. Coq au vin in earthenware casseroles and a Rabelaisian braised lamb shank, at less than $15, have replaced the $25 Dover sole and rack of lamb.
Two years ago Peter Kelly, a young self-taught chef whose restaurants have all achieved high marks from the critics, opened the Freelance Cafe, a casual dining spot next to his elegant Xaviar's in Piermont, in Rockland County, New York, near the Tappan Zee Bridge.
"We considered expanding Xaviar's," Mr. Kelly said, "but we saw that people also wanted quality in a more relaxed, less expensive context, so we created the Freelance Cafe."
At Xaviar's the food is elaborate, befitting a $42 prix fixe. The cooking tends to be richer than at some trend-setting French-style places in Manhattan, with dishes like lobster ravioli in a saffron butter sauce and black bass sheathed in potatoes in chive beurre blanc, but it is generally well conceived, carefully wrought and impeccably served. The restaurant's 32 seats can sometimes be as difficult to obtain as tables at JoJo, a hot restaurant in Manhattan.
The menu at the Freelance Cafe offers small plates like spinach and shrimp fritters and pasta dishes averaging $7 each, and large plates like grilled duck breast with fettuccine or steak pommes frites for around $15.
"Not long ago, people found it hard to believe there could be a good restaurant in Rockland County," Mr. Kelly said. "There is plenty of competition now, and I think it will be easier for suburban chefs to get the recognition and respect they deserve."
Some chefs like Jean-Louis Gerin of Restaurant Jean-Louis in Greenwich regularly participate in charitable events, finding that they help to build loyalty among customers and to reach a wider audience. And when several regional chefs cook together at such events, they find a welcome camaraderie and capitalize on the reputations of all their restaurants.
Even the hotels built near sprawling industrial parks have attracted well-known chefs. Yannick Cam, who owned Le Pavillon, a superb Washington restaurant that could not weather the economic storm and closed in December 1990, now cooks at the Radisson Plaza Hotel in Alexandria, Va. He has not altered his lavishly elegant cooking style at Yannick's, the restaurant there.
A few years ago, it probably would have been unthinkable to encounter fine dining in a chain hotel like the Radisson Plaza or the Hilton in Short Hills, N.J., with its opulent Dining Room, where the quality of food, wine and service attracts guest chefs like Jean-Louis Palladin of Jean-Louis at the Watergate in Washington.
Inevitably, as the status of chefs outside urban centers is enhanced, culinary Broadway beckons some chefs starring out of town. Joseph Verde, who worked at Lafayette and Le Cirque in Manhattan before becoming the chef at the Hilton in Short Hills, has just been hired by the Sea Grill in Rockefeller Center.
But the Hilton found a qualified young chef from Manhattan who recognized opportunity across the Hudson. Anthony Demes, 27, who has been working at Maxim's in Manhattan, started there this week.
"Even though it's not New York City, there's plenty of opportunity for creativity," Mr. Demes said. "They have a clientele that knows and appreciates good food and wine."

HEADLINE: The No-Party System

 BODY:
If Ross Perot, candidate of no political party, had been on the California ballot yesterday, he might conceivably have defeated an incumbent President in the Republican primary and the front-runner in the Democratic primary.
Likewise, in New Jersey and Ohio, surprisingly large numbers of voters told exit-poll takers that they too would have voted Perot had his name been before them; he would have won the Ohio Democratic primary in a walk. 
 These findings warrant contemplation now that the 1992 Presidential primary campaign has ended. All this Perot support comes from primary voters, the people most likely to come to the aid of their party. And it comes for a man who has never held public office.
The scrappy Texas businessman has yet to spell out his positions. Under the microscope that goes with being taken seriously, he may come to be seen as harsh or hypocritical. But Ross Perot has already triumphantly demonstrated something recently unimaginable: It is now possible to mount a plausible campaign for President without backing from any political party at all.
That fact may portend a scary future, leading away from the certitudes of two-party politics to a system open to manipulation by the super-rich. But to judge by the present campaign, this evolution also could produce highly welcome results -- involving more citizens in politics, bringing politics closer to questions that affect their lives and giving them more say in how those questions are answered.
Ross Perot's showing represents a convergence of two tidal trends, of media and message. The media in question are the parties, whose role in Presidential politics has been degenerating for years. Before telephones, let alone television, they served as organs of communication, conveying information, buttons and enthusiasm to the faithful.
John Kennedy pushed the diminution of parties past one milestone when he used a handful of 1960 primaries to prove himself to Democratic elders. George McGovern in 1972 and Jimmy Carter in 1976 seized on multiple primaries to win nomination in spite of party elders. Richard Nixon and later Ronald Reagan perfected the selling of the Presidency not by party but by television.
Parties are not dead, but as a medium in Presidential politics they can be superseded by electronic means. Ross Perot rides the new medium to connect with the other tide, of voters dissatisfied with the two-party system and its candidates. He has already demonstrated how to use back-channel television -- interview and talk shows -- to denounce politics as usual.
Why do Americans so hate politics? The recession explains much sourness. So does the strong dissatisfaction at the choice of George Bush or Bill Clinton. Voters also think Washington has performed miserably in dealing with, for instance, the savings and loan debacle.
Worse, Washington has failed to respond to urgent problems that bedevil people in real life. The Los Angeles rioting ended five weeks ago. The Administration and Congress are still dickering over emergency aid.
In this climate, it's easy for Ross Perot, personification of None of the Above, to sound good. It will get harder. Even he is not so well liked. From a third to half of voters interviewed yesterday hold an unfavorable opinion of him. Judging by the experience of third-party candidates George Wallace in 1968 and John Anderson in 1980, chances are his support will diminish as November nears.
But if yesterday's exit poll results proved anything, it is that dissatisfied voters need no longer wish for another path, for None of the Above. At the moment, at least, they can look to a Someone.

HEADLINE: University Presidents Less Secure in Jobs and Stature

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
By the end of a tough year of handling screaming students, angry professors, jealous alumni and hawk-eyed Federal auditors, the presidents of many elite American universities admit they have given serious thought to quitting.
Still, Benno C. Schmidt Jr.'s resignation last week as president of Yale University -- the fourth departure by a leading college president this year -- surprised nearly everyone and is widely seen as another sign that America's top universities are losing a whole class of leaders without a clear sense of who will replace them. 
 Mr. Schmidt was the lastest prominent president to call it quits. Hanna H. Gray announced that she would resign from the University of Chicago, where she has been president for 14 years. H. Keith H. Brodie is leaving Duke University after seven years. And Donald Kennedy resigned after 12 years as president of Stanford University, the last two years in a dispute over government research reimbursements.
 
Is Prestige Undermined?
 Their sudden departures have raised concerns about the strength of higher education's leadership. But more than that, since the presidents of these elite universities have often become de facto leaders off campus as well, the rash of resignations raises questions about the ability of future presidents to play that role.
"University presidents have gotten bashed a bit over the last couple of years," said Frank Newman, president of the Education Commission of the States and a former president of the University of Rhode Island. He said events had "gradually eroded the sense we have of the president of a university as being a moral and civic leader for our society."
The Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, who retired in 1987 after 35 years as president of the University of Notre Dame and was active in many social causes, fit the role of "moral leader," Mr. Newman said, but many current presidents are so immersed in the problems of their own campuses that they cannot undertake a larger role. And new appointees are likely to face even more pressure.
For many presidents of America's most important universities, the demands of running the campus have become close to unbearable. The average tenure for all university presidents is less than seven years. The public image of presidents may be at its least flattering since the campus protest days of the 1960's, when some presidents were being splashed with red paint and escorted from their offices by armed students.
 
Trouble on All Fronts
 Today, they must deal with Federal and state governments that have cut their financial support. University curriculums have been criticized. Parents, students and alumni have been shocked by intercollegiate sports scandals, tuition bills and racial and ethnic conflicts, real or perceived, on campus.
Traditionally, the president of Harvard University has by dint of the prestige of that position been one of the most influential education leaders in the nation. The new president there, Neil L. Rudenstine, is completing his first year, a year in which his voice has not been heard much.
"Pulpits are earned, they're not conferred or made," Mr. Rudenstine said. "It will take a bit of time, but on the whole, people are speaking out so much more than they are thinking these days that a little more time, patience and thought wouldn't hurt at all."
Mr. Rudenstine will begin to earn his pulpit tomorrow with his first commencement speech address, in which he will tackle some of the most complicated issues on campus today: diversity, free speech and the values that make a good education.
 
Puzzling Over Schmidt
 Those issues have been addressed on occasion by Mr. Schmidt in his six years heading Yale. Six years would not seem to be much time, relatively, and so Mr. Schmidt's resignation still puzzles many. Even with its budget problems, Yale is one of America's most influential institutions.
In explaining why he was leaving to join a for-profit venture to establish a national system of private schools, the 50-year-old Mr. Schmidt said that while his tenure may have been short, it was intense, and that his goal was to improve the nation's schools.
But then, describing his proudest achievement, he made an unusual observation: "There's never been a blemish or even a suspicion about Yale's integrity or my own." The statement seemed to reflect the degree to which presidents today are suspect, rather than revered.
Most of Mr. Schmidt's colleagues were reluctant to criticize his decision, but some were concerned about the perception his leaving would present.
"His move, however laudable the motive may be, adds yet another dimension to the perception that in this country, the public sector and excellence do not go hand in hand," said Vartan Gregorian, the president of Brown University. "It suggests that excellence belongs in the private domain only."
 
Ivy League Survivors
 In the Ivy League, the two longest-serving presidents are Frank H. Rhodes, at Cornell for 15 years, and Michael I. Sovern, the president of Columbia since 1980. Both say the job has changed fundamentally during their time in office. The demands of dealing with more pressing economic conditions, more onerous government regulation and increasingly complex social issues on campus leave far less time to be "presidential," in the sense of speaking out on issues of importance beyond their own campuses.
Mr. Sovern said that it is still possible for him to speak out on national issues, but that the opportunities are more limited. At Columbia's commencement, for example, he spoke about the plight of the author Salman Rushdie and called for freedom of speech to be defended everywhere.
"It is a national issue," he said, "but it's a national issue of special importance to universities."
Mr. Sovern said it is increasingly difficult, given the burdens of office, for presidents to get involved in off-campus issues, as he did a few years ago when he headed a state commission on integrity in government. "I could not have said yes to that invitation this year, and I don't think I could say yes next year," said Mr. Sovern.
Mr. Rhodes was asked recently by the university's board of trustees to stay on indefinitely; he agreed, although he said, "The pressures increase each year," and, "The physical demands are enormous."
 
Essential Skills Change
 The skills considered essential to run a university shift with the times. Lawyers, like Mr. Sovern and Mr. Schmidt, with their skills at mediation and analysis, have been in demand for a while. The ability to raise money is taking on more importance. But with that comes some traps.
Mr. Gregorian is considered one of the more outspoken presidents, a trait he honed as head of the New York Public Library before going to Brown. But even he said that with so much emphasis today placed on a university president's ability to raise money and solicit support from alumni, speaking out on public issues becomes more delicate.
"You're frightened to take a stand as an educator because you are afraid that the Federal or state authorities, or your private benefactors, may retaliate against your institution by not giving money," Mr. Gregorian said.
With their different schools and deans, universities on many levels run themselves. But if something goes wrong, it is often the president who takes the blame.
 
How They See Themselves
 In the recent investigations into research costs at Stanford, the president, Mr. Kennedy, became a visible target, especially after it was learned that the Government had been charged a portion of the costs for improvements and even flowers at Mr. Kennedy's university-owned home. His rough treatment on network television and in the local newspapers was so scathing that it has changed the way university presidents are perceived -- and the way many university presidents see their jobs.
"That hurt, all right," Mr. Kennedy said, "but I certainly hope that no one will be discouraged by the fact that I went though such a tough passage."
Other presidents have said that Mr. Kennedy's experience was likely to make recruiting leaders more difficult, though by no means impossible. Mr. Kennedy's replacement at Stanford, Gerhard Casper, the former provost at the University of Chicago, said that at first he had been reluctant to give up teaching and take on the administrative responsibilities of heading Stanford.
"Wally Sterling, a former president of Stanford, said after he was selected that the trustees had been looking for a person who is sufficiently intelligent to do the job and sufficiently foolish to take it," Mr. Casper said soon after his own selection was announced.
"My intelligence, I wouldn't dare comment on, but I certainly am displaying a sense of foolishness, no doubt about it."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: California;
2 Women Win Nomination In California Senate Races

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 2

 BODY:
Democratic voters in California nominated two women in separate Senate contests today, setting the stage for a first in American political history: an election with two women running for the United States Senate from the same state.
The two women, Dianne Feinstein, a former mayor of San Francisco, and Representative Barbara Boxer, easily defeated their male opponents in races that many political experts called a historic watershed in a year of female political outrage and growing public demand for candidates who represent a break from the establishment politics of government in Washington. 
 Both Ms. Feinstein and Ms. Boxer received concessions from their opponents in three-way races and claimed victory less than three hours after the polls had closed.
"It's historic," said Katherine Spillar, national coordinator of the Fund for the Feminist Majority, "It shows the power of what's happening this year, with women winning elections that, just a few months ago, the political pundits were saying were impossible."
Ms. Feinstein and Ms. Boxer joined a growing number of women seeking Senate seats. Including them, six serious contenders have won major party nominations. If they all win election to the Senate, it would be major change for a body that has never had more than two female members at once.
A dozen women are also contesting primaries in seven other states, including two New York Democrats, Geraldine A. Ferraro and Elizabeth Holtzman.
At her headquarters in San Francisco, Ms. Feinstein accepted congratulationss from her opponents, State Controller Gray Davis and Joseph M. Alioto, a San Francisco lawyer.
 
2 California Contests
 "I think the message of this primary campaign is that once again Californians have spoken loudly and clearly and sent the whole country a message: the status quo must go," Ms. Feinstein said. "We Californians want fundamental change and we won't settle for anything less.
"We must put America's domestic needs first: jobs, health care, educations, crimes, drugs, gangs, environmental cleanup, the right to choice. That change begins tonight. They don't get it yet in Washington, but they will once we get there."
In Los Angeles, Ms. Boxer received concessions from Lieut. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy and Representative Mel Levine.
In a victory speech to supporters, Ms. Boxer said: "I promised to take this campaign to the people and the people have responded. They want a fighter in the Senate, don't they? They want someone who will shake up the Senate, don't they? I will be a fighter in the Senate."
In one Republican contest, the incumbent Senator, John Seymour, far outdistanced the field for one seat. The other race appeared to be a toss-up between Representative Tom Campbell and Bruce Herschensohn, a conservative television commentator.
The two women benefited both from being women in a year of female political outrage and from the growing public demand for candidates who represent a break from the norm in a year of near revolution against the establishment in Washington.
"I think it's a very exciting result," said Kathleen Brown, the Democratic State Treasurer who was not on the ballot this year but is widely believed to be contemplating a run for Governor in 1994. "It means that people are really anxious for change, and women symbolize change because they have not been part of the old way of doing things. They have not been insiders, they have not been present when the rules were being made that got us into the mess we're in."
Tony Podesta, a Democratic political consultant who ran the Presidential campaign in California for former Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts in 1988, called the results "a revolution in American politics."
 
Role of Women's Vote
 A survey of voters leaving the polls showed that female voters solidly backed the two women and that they were heavily influenced by the abortion issue and the furor surrounding the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the United States Supreme Court. Both also did well among male voters, especially Ms. Feinstein.
The voting also represented a rebuke for the kind of manipulative television campaigns now common in this, the largest state. Despite spending about $4 million for a campaign that was almost entirely limited to television commercials that in the end turned to denouncing "mob rule" in the Los Angeles riots, Representative Mel Levine was trailing badly, running last in a field of three led by Ms. Boxer.
On the Republican side, Senator Seymour, a moderate Republican appointed to the seat until the November election, was well ahead of Representativ William E. Dannemeyer, a conservative from Orange County. He will face Ms. Feinstein in the general election. In the close race for the other Senate seat, Mr. Campbell, a moderate from of Palo Alto, was running neck-and-neck with Mr. Herschensohn of Los Angeles. A third candidate, Mayor Sonny Bono, the former Mayor of Palm Springs, was well behind.
Californians have a rare opportunity to vote for two Senators this year because Pete Wilson vacated his Senate seat after being elected Governor in 1990. By law, his appointed successor, Mr. Seymour, a former State Senator, had to run again in the next general election.
 
Year of the Woman
 Most of the attention was focused on the two women. They have much in common: both are from the San Francisco Bay area, both are Jewish, both are forceful and pugnacious and they dislike each other. But they are likely to share a Democratic ticket in what is shaping up as the year of the woman in California and nationally.
Previous primaries in other states have put three other women who are serious contenders into Senate races: Carol Moseley Braun in Illinois, Lynn H. Yeakel in Pennsylvania, and Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, the incumbent running for re-election in Maryland, all Democrats. The other female incumbent in the Senate, Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas, a Republican, is not up for re-election.
In addition, two other women have won major party nominations for the Senate, but both are running against entrenched incumbents and are considered underdogs. They are Charlene Haar, a Republican who is running against Senator Tom Daschle, a South Dakota Democrat, and Jean Lloyd-Jones, a Democrat who is challenging Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican.
The female factor was striking in California contests, the voter survey, conducted by Voter Research Surveys, showed. The male candidates seemed to do particularly well only among those voters who considered crime a top issue.
The two women appeared to share the same voters. More than 80 percent of the votes of those who said they voted for Ms. Boxer said they also voted for Ms. Feinstein, while two-thirds of those who said they voted for Ms. Boxer said they also voted for Ms. Feinstein.
Ms. Boxer, a former Marin County housewife who won national attention when she and six other women in the House of Representatives paid an angry visit to the Senate during the confirmation hearings for Judge Thomas after accusations of sexual harassment were leveled against him, won more than half of the women's votes and almost half of the men's votes, according to the surveys. The runner-up, Mr. McCarthy, won less than a quarter of the female vote.
Ms. Feinstein received nearly two-thirds of both the male and female votes.
More than half the Democratic primary voters said Justice Thomas should not have been confirmed, and almost two-thirds of them voted for Ms. Boxer. Mr. McCarthy did very well among those who thought the Justice should have been confirmed, but that was only one-fifth of the voters.
 
Role of Abortion Issue
 Similarly, on the abortion issue, nearly two-thirds of the Democrats said they thought the Democrat national platform should support keeping abortion legal. Ms. Boxer received one-half of the that vote from that heavily female group, while her two male opponents, who also support abortion rights, lagged with the group.
In the Feinstein-Davis race, three- quarters of those who opposed Justice Thomas voted for Ms. Feinstein. Similarly, those favoring strong abortion rights voted went for her by more than 3 to 1.
 In the Republican primary, Senator Seymour, as expected, was comfortably ahead of Representative Dannemeyer. He overwhelmed the staunchly conservative Congressman among nearly all demographic groups except fundamentalist Christians and those who want the Republican platform to oppose abortion rights. The polling found that half of California Republicans supported an abortion-rights plank, one-quarter wanted an anti-abortion plank and one-fifth believed that the party should take no stand on abortion. Like Governor Wilson, Senator Seymour supports abortion rights.
The extremely close race between Mr. Campbell and Mr. Herschensohn race was more complex, and underscoring the battle between moderates and conservatives for California Republicans.
The 39-year-old Mr. Campbell is a former economics professor at Stanford University who takes an internationalist position on free and open trade and markets and is a something of a liberal on most social issues like abortion and the environment. Mr. Herschensohn, 59, who ran a close second for a Republican Senate nomination in 1986, appeals to a more traditional Republicans, who opposed to higher taxes and to excessive environmental protection.

HEADLINE: Exiled Haiti Leader Chides U.S. on Response to Coup

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 3

 BODY:
The exiled President of Haiti asked the United States and other countries in the hemisphere today to stop talking about democracy and start taking direct action to restore it, beginning with the interception of oil tankers bound for Port-au-Prince.
The exile, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, said that sooner or later a naval blockade of Haiti might be necessary to bring down the military Government that ousted him eight months ago. 
 While avoiding direct criticism of the Bush Administration, Father Aristide, who was elected President of Haiti in 1990 with more than two-thirds of the popular vote, delivered a bitter and sarcastic indictment against "friends of democracy" who he said seem unable to act to support it.
"They say: 'We will give democracy to them, we are with them. We will tighten the embargo,' " he said in an interview. "But when we saw more tankers arriving in Haiti only four days ago with oil, we thought, 'is this the best way to tighten an embargo?' "
 
Questions on Sincerity
 "It is not difficult to do what we have to do," he said. "It is a question of knowing whether or not they believe in what they are saying."
Father Aristide also said the level of anger was rising among Haitians, who are running out of patience after eight months of military rule. He agreed with comments by Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York, who said after returning from a recent visit to Haiti that "a head of steam is building up there."
"It is true, it is like a volcano," Father Aristide said. "At this moment, it is very explosive."
He added that as a "responsible" head of government he had to urge nonviolence to head off an explosion like that in Los Angeles -- a parallel he has been drawing in speeches around the United States as he meets business leaders, human rights groups and, on this trip, Jewish organizations.
But he also said that nonviolent people expect justice to be done. He said his job was not to teach Haitians patience but to bring back their elected government.
Father Aristide, a charismatic priest whose strong language has at times disconcerted officials in the Bush Administration, spoke with low-key, sharply focused determination in an interview at his hotel here. He dismissed the naming Tuesday of the conservative economist Marc Bazin as a new Haitian prime minister, saying that this was another time-wasting ploy by the military under Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, which overthrew him on Sept. 30.
The Secretary General of the Organization of American States, Joao Clemente Baena Soares, also rejected the Bazin nomination today, saying that "no government that may result from this illegal situation will be accepted."
Father Aristide insisted that developments in Haiti had created a propitious moment for a real tightening of the embargo on Haiti. He said some original financial and political backers of the coup are now breaking ranks and coming here to tell him that they are exhausted, fearful of spreading violence and ready to discuss his return.
"Some of them are really tired," he said. "They are really afraid. They know, day after day, the anger of people is increasing. They realize that the only way to avoid violence, vengeance, retaliation is to have democracy back."
 
Tensions in Military
 Father Aristide said that the emergence of rival "gangs" within the military has created disaffection, and that he was receiving letters from soldiers complaining about the level of killing.
He restated his belief that many refugees are "politically oppressed." Last week, President Bush said in Atlanta that he was convinced that Haitians fleeing in boats were not "physically oppressed" or deserving of political safe haven in the United States.
"They say they want to stop refugees," Father Aristide said of the Administration. "I want to stop refugees. So we have the same goal. They say, we want democracy. We say, we want democracy. We have the same goal. So I say, let's do it."
He said that some steps taken by the United States to punish the leaders and supporters of the coup, including the cancellation of American visas, had been partial measures at best.
 
Coup Leaders 'Still Flying'
 "They don't see any kind of real sign of action against them," he said of the coup leaders. "Visas? Just some were seized. What about the others? The people involved in the de facto regime are still flying."
Father Aristide said that only an effective oil embargo, stopping ships from all over the world, would make an impression on the Haitian military.
"Once Cedras realizes there is no petrol coming to Haiti, that will be the first sign to show him he has no allies," the exiled President said.
"I cannot stop remembering how in 1986 Jean-Claude Duvalier left Haiti after a phone call," he said, referring to the intervention of the United States. "Why after eight months is that criminal Cedras still there? Is he strong enough to say no to the world?
"No," Father Aristide laughed softly. "No. No."

HEADLINE: Denmark's Signal;
Rejection of European Union Treaty Points Up Anxieties on Sovereignty

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OSLO, June 2

 BODY:
By its rejection on Tuesday of the treaty on European union, Denmark exposed the idea of European political unity for the fragile cold-war creature that it really was.
The message sent by Denmark, one of the smallest and proudest nations in Europe, was that it feared being swallowed up in a federal state dominated by larger and more powerful neighbors. But the concern of the supporters of union was that the Danes were not alone in their anxieties. Some officials in 10 Downing Street expressed relief that finally it was not just Britain that had doubts about how far national interests and ancient symbols of national sovereignty should be submerged in a European federal state.
 
2 Different Views
 Nationalism nearly destroyed Europe in two world wars, and it lies at the heart of the unresolved contradiction between two different views of what the European Community should be today: a confederation of freely cooperating sovereign states, or a federation with a single currency, a single economic policy and a single foreign and security policy. 
 On the idea of building a prosperous and powerful trading bloc together and never going to war again with one another, there has been a true unity of views in Europe, a remarkable achievement in itself. But it has not been enough to make the European Community a powerful and cohesive political force in the world, or even to enable it to defend itself. For that, as long as the Soviet Union existed, Europe needed the United States, through the NATO alliance.
NATO's conventional forces were designed to deter Soviet attack, and thus, in a sense, never to be used. Now they are impractical for use in dealing with new kinds of threats, resulting in the European Community's difficulties in coping with the violence in the Balkans, where ethnic brush fires threaten to become conflagrations.
The treaty that Denmark rejected was to try to create a common European foreign and security policy as well as a common currency. But the crisis in the Balkans has already made clear the difficulties in achieving a common foreign policy.
Last week the European community imposed economic sanctions on the rump Yugoslav state dominated by Serbia, but it finally imposed an oil embargo only after the United Nations Security Council did so. France went along reluctantly after arguing earlier that the sanctions would not be effective.
The nightly television shots of Serbs killing ethnic Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina and mortar bombs falling on the ancient Croatian port of Dubrovnik are a shame and a scandal, western Europeans agree, and the violence has already confronted them with hundreds of thousands of refugees huddling on their doorsteps.
 
Rapid Reaction Force
 Yet neither NATO nor the European Community has any realistic plan or policy, yet, to quell the fighting or prevent it from spilling over into other countries.
NATO agreed last year to create a rapid reaction corps that will consist of 70,000 to 100,000 troops from European countries and be supported by American helicopters and airplanes. If it existed today, it might conceivably be sent in to enforce peace in the Balkans.
But the corps will not even be ready until 1995. And there is no consensus among European members of NATO for using those troops or any others in such a peacekeeping role anyway. The 51-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which unites all European countries, could theoretically ask NATO to undertake such a role, according to the alliance's secretary general, Manfred Worner, but there is no European consensus as yet on whether NATO should entertain such requests.
Denmark's rejection of a treaty on unity, unsurprisingly, came as a discouraging sign to Mr. Worner. "Looking at the picture in Europe at this very moment, confronted with very serious crises, I think what Europe needs is the opposite of such a vote," he said.
France and Germany, saying they both want to strengthen Europe's ability to provide for its own defense, have announced the formation of a joint corps of 35,000 troops, but that has aroused British and American fears that it could undermine NATO.
But the French-German corps, too, does not yet exist in reality, and even if it did, the Bonn Government has insisted that the German soldiers in it could not go anywhere to do anything until the German Constitution is changed.
"We Europeans have to admit openly: Europe has not yet gone so far as to be able to deal with this new kind of challenge," the German Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel, said in Paris on Tuesday.
Mr. Kinkel and his counterparts in NATO and the European Community are to meet here on Thursday, and they plan to issue a statement deploring the continuing violence in Yugoslavia. But, a NATO diplomat said today, "It's clear to everyone that Yugoslavia is not the right place to start with a peacekeeping force."
 
Consensus and Inaction
 In Denmark, supporters of a yes vote in the referendum this week echoed concerns of the referendum's critics that European unity might require participating countries to accept steps they did not like. Interviewed on Monday, the Danish Foreign Minister, Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, who led the failed campaign for a yes vote, said that Denmark, too, did not want European foreign policy decisions made over its head, and that consensus was better.
But some diplomats in Europe, particularly those from America, observe that consensus often leads mostly to inaction, and that inaction in security affairs is really what most of the Europeans, led by small countries like Denmark, really want.
These American officials believe that Europe still needs the United States to help it solve its most acute security problems, and that it may yet need the United States to lead it to effective action in Yugoslavia. That may be a little clearer after Thursday's meetings here in Oslo, but not much.

HEADLINE: Chinese Police Halt Tiananmen Square Memorial

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, June 3

 BODY:
The police arrested several Chinese today as they tried to mark the third anniversary of the army's attack on democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square, and detained and roughed up foreign journalists covering the incident.
The police detained seven foreign journalists for about three hours, and beat up a Tokyo Broadcasting System television cameraman who had been trying to film plainclothes policemen on the square. The cameraman, Atsushi Yamagiwa, was reportedly knocked to the ground and kicked before being taken away bleeding. 
 An hour earlier, a Chinese man named Wang Wanxin was dragged away after he tried to unfurl a banner calling on Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, to apologize for the 1989 army crackdown in which hundreds were killed and thousands wounded. It is unclear what happened to Mr. Wang, who is said to be in his 40's.
Foreign reporters who were present at the detention of Mr. Wang and the beating of Mr. Yamagiwa were detained and their film was exposed. Among those detained were jounalists from the United States, Canada, Germany and Japan. The police punched and kicked several of the reporters before taking them away.
In 1989, the army attack on the student protesters began late at night on June 3 and continued for most of June 4. The attack is widely known in Chinese as the June 4 incident.
A new sign in the center of Tiananmen Square warns visitors not to lay mourning wreaths, unless the authorities have given approval five days in advance. The sign also forbids laughing and joking in the vicinity.
The authorities have warned dissidents and others not to cause trouble on the anniversary, and security has been stepped up throughout the capital.
One unusual precautionary measure was taken at Beijing University, which in the years since the crackdown has seen some unrest on the June 4 anniversary. In an effort to reduce the availability of glass to smash, a common gesture of protest for some students, bottle-collectors were sent around the dormitories, offering to pay about four cents per glass bottle.
The Foreign Ministry expressed appreciation of President Bush's announcement on Tuesday that he was recommending unconditional renewal of low-tariff trade benefits for China.
"The Chinese Government appreciates this realistic and wise decision of President Bush," a Foreign Ministry spokesman said. A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade also expressed appreciation of Mr. Bush's recommendation to extend most-favored-nation trade benefits, but said the annual debate over the issue in Congress made the Chinese authorities "uncomfortable." The spokesman called on Washington to come up with a "more efficient" way of providing low-tariff trade.
The Government also said that it would now allow Dai Qing, a journalist who this year is holding a fellowship at Harvard University, to return to visit her family in Beijing. On Saturday, Ms. Dai, who is 50 years old and is often critical of the Government, was refused permission to board a plane in Hong Kong for Beijing. She now has a ticket to fly to Beijing on Sunday.
Another Chinese living in the United States, Gong Xiaoxia, was also recently refused entry to China because of her political views. It is unclear if she will now be allowed to return.

The spare 15-year-old in a tattered shirt stood stiffly, shaking his head. "No," he said. "I don't know Bharat."

 Around Mr. Satyarthi and the 15-year-old, Bushan Lal, hovered a dozen other young men, some nodding in understanding, others wrestling with a new idea, the idea of India.
Mr. Satyarthi explained: "These men have never seen a white person. They have never seen a newspaper. They have never heard of America. They don't know what money is. Some don't even know the name of their country. They were bonded laborers, people who have been in complete servitude."
Throughout India, bonded laborers toil, unpaid and ill treated, in what amounts to slavery in stone quarries, in brick kilns and yards, and in the rice paddies of central and southern India.
 
40,000 Are Liberated
 Bonded labor -- the practice of engaging laborers without wages to pay off real or imagined debts -- is against the law. But it persists despite court rulings, occasional police intervention and the work of people like Mr. Satyarthi, who works here at his center for bonded laborers 20 miles northeast of New Delhi.
"We estimate," he said, "a very conservative estimate, that there are 5 million adults and 10 million children in bonded labor in India," which has a population of 844 million.
For more than a decade, Mr. Satyarthi, a former engineer, has devoted his energies to freeing India's bonded laborers from servitude.
"Since 1980 we have liberated more than 40,000 bonded laborers from around the country," Mr. Satyarthi said. "I have lost two friends while trying to liberate laborers, both in 1985. One was beaten to death with iron rods. One was shot dead. Both were in the quarries. Some people were arrested, but all were released later on."
Virtually all of India's bonded laborers are untouchables, who are at the bottom of the caste hierarchy. Some were born into their condition because their parents or grandparents were sold long before they were born. Others were lured into servitude by agents for quarry owners or brick kiln managers with promises of higher paying jobs than those they had. Still others fell into their position from the need to repay loans that were readily given, but that can never be fully repaid. Once indentured, it is almost impossible to escape.
Only through repeated court orders from the Indian Supreme Court has Mr. Satyarthi been able to free any bonded laborers. And even then, he said, local police and government officials often ignored the court's ruling. "There is so much corruption," he said.
Hari Krishna Kandoi said: "I'm a harijan. My family has been bonded labor for generations. My father was bonded labor and also my grandfather. I worked on a rice field in Chaunaurdiha Village," in Madhya Pradesh in central India. "I was never paid any wages. I was just given some food. I was released three months ago by the Supreme Court."
But freedom alone, Mr. Satyarthi said, is not enough for men like Mr. Kandoi. "We realized that here was a problem of looking after these people, otherwise they would go back to being bonded laborers," Mr. Satyarthi said.
So last year he formed what he calls Mukti Ashram, or Liberation Retreat, where he works with former bonded laborers.
 
'Afraid of Everyone'
 "People who are bonded laborers are mental slaves," he said. "It is hard for them to mix in society. They feel themselves very inferior. They feel the burden of being casteless. They have no way of earning a living. They have no idea what to do with money. And they are afraid of everyone."
With money from private donors, he bought an acre of land on the outskirts of this village. He hired a tailor, carpenter, weaver, iron worker and mason to teach trades to the bonded laborers, a counselor to help with their adjustment problems and a cook to feed them.
From his decade of work with bonded labor, he has 100 people around India working full time to free laborers from servitude, mostly by trying to get court orders enforced. And every three months, his colleagues send 50 to 60 bonded laborers to Mukti Ashram for training.
"Caste, religion, the political system, the economic system -- all are helping the bonded labor owners," Mr. Satyarthi said. "I believe in Gandhi's philosophy of the last man, that is, the bonded laborer is the last man in Indian society, that we are here to liberate the last man."
 
Ranks Still Grow
 Despite the efforts of his ashram, and the injunctions of the law, the ranks of bonded laborers continue to grow, Mr. Satyarthi said. "We have liberated about 5,000 children in the last 10 years. But in the last 10 years, about 100,000 children have come into the industry."
Mr. Satyarthi walked across the ashram compound toward the communal hall where a new group of bonded laborers were gathering. They sat cross-legged in precise rows on coir mats, expectant, unsure of what the next three months would hold. Then Mr. Satyarthi turned to Bushan Lal, the 15-year-old, and said quietly, "Show us a dance."
And the young man, to the beat of a drum from another laborer, began a slow folk dance and song from his native village. Bushan Lal, Mr. Satyarthi said later, was beginning to learn to be himself.

HEADLINE: To Recapture an Uptown Elegance

BYLINE: By SUZANNE SLESIN

 BODY:
SINCE 1976, Josephine E. Jones has been the proud owner of a house with an unglazed terra-cotta front on West 122d Street, one of seven houses dating from 1887. Mrs. Jones has always had two goals: to be sure her daughter, Wendy, got an education -- "I've been a single mother since Wendy was 6 months old," she said -- and to own her own house.
Now that her daughter has been educated (Dalton class of '71, Yale '75, Columbia graduate school '81, now a playwright and English professor), Mrs. Jones is a bit freer to concentrate on the house. It is an ambitious project, but having held three jobs at a time, Mrs. Jones said, "Don't tell me what I can't do." 
 All seven houses on the street, in the Mount Morris Park section of Harlem, were designed by Francis H. Kimball, said Michael H. Adams, the president of the Upper Manhattan Society for Progress Through Preservation, a nonprofit group. Kimball also designed the Montauk Club in Brooklyn and the Waldo mansion that is now the Ralph Lauren store at Madison Avenue and 72d Street.
"These houses are extraordinarily exuberant examples of the Queen Anne style, which Kimball knew firsthand from working in England for the famous architect William Burgess," Mr. Adams said.
For five years, Mr. Adams has been an enthusiastic leader of what he calls "a celebration of Harlem." He leads walking tours through historic neighborhoods there, including Hamilton Heights, Jumel Terrace and Striver's and Astor rows, as well as Marcus Garvey Park.
The Mount Morris Park area, loosely bounded by West 119th and West 126th streets and Seventh and Madison avenues, will be the site of a June 14 house tour. It will include five landmark churches, a carillon recital at St. Martin's Episcopal Church, a walk led by Urban Park Rangers to the historic fire watchtower and bell tower in Marcus Garvey Park, an architectural tour and visits to 12 private homes.
Until last year, ailanthus trees were growing inside the upper part of Mrs. Jones's house and climbing through the terra-cotta roof tiles, as others still do in adjoining buildings. The removal of the trees was her first step in restoring the house.
After meeting Susan Henshaw Jones, the executive director of the New York Landmarks Conservancy, at a conservation conference, Mrs. Jones got a 3 percent loan from the conservancy to continue her renovation.
"We feel preservation is the key to community renewal," Susan Jones said. "Although hard as it is to believe that these houses are not designated landmarks, because they were eligible for the National Register of Historic Places, we were able to make the loan."
Two doors down, a house covered with a latticework of scaffolding is under renovation by the Harlem Urban Development Corporation, a state-sponsored development group. The house, which is being converted into apartments, is also on the tour.
The interior of Josephine Jones's house is amazingly intact, considering that until she bought it in 1976 it had been a warren of one-room apartments. The years the tenants had spent in the house, which was built for a single family, had taken a toll. But the Minton tile fireplace surrounds, embossed firebacks, leaded-glass sliding doors and stained-glass transom windows are still there. Mrs. Jones seems determined to persevere in tasks that might seem impossible to others.
There is more than a little of her in her daughter, who has written a one-character play about the crusading 19th-century journalist Ida B. Wells.
"She was a woman of the 1990's who happened to live in the 1880's," Wendy Jones said of her subject.
One of the most impressive homes on the tour is the majestic four-story 1890 brownstone where 21-year-old Lynai Williams lives with her 8-year-old sister, Leah Williams; her 16-year-old cousin, Imani Walker; her aunt Paula Walker, and Ms. Walker's husband, Roosevelt Madison.
"On June 14, about 500 people will be coming to your house," Mr. Adams said last week to Lynai Williams, who seemed surprised and maybe not overjoyed. He added quickly: "Don't worry. They won't all be here at the same time."
"It took at least seven years to get it in this condition," Ms. Williams said as she showed visitors the dining room, with its high ceiling, gas fireplace, beveled glass panels and pristinely stripped woodwork. Charcoal and sepia artworks by John Biggers hang above the stripped oak paneling, and an imposing African carving leans against the wall.
"I'm a native of Harlem and always vowed that if I lived in New York, I would live in my hometown, and that's Harlem," said Paula Walker, the assistant news director at WNBC television. The century-old house, on West 119th Street, has been in her family since 1980.
The architectural firm of Neville & Bagge designed the house. The wrought-iron gates on the front door incorporate an H, for the house's original owner, Daniel Huber Jr., a real estate developer of the time.
Ms. Williams remembers moving to the house when she was in the sixth grade. After graduating recently from Vassar College, she thought of moving elsewhere. "But I looked around," she said, "then decided it would be better to stay here."
"Our goal was to raise these girls and still like each other," Paula Walker said. "And in a house of this size all the people who make noise can have their own floors."
"Taking into account the kind of job I have and the income level, I feel that people like me should also live in Harlem," she continued. "Neighborhoods can then remain neighborhoods, and people who live there are in the position to demand services and demand that Harlem gets its fair share."
At first, Mr. Madison, a television and film makeup artist, balked at letting people walk through their home. His wife persevered. "If you were trying to get people of different income levels back to Harlem," she asked, "how could you convince them it's a good place to be if you don't let them see it?" Mr. Madison agreed.
Their house is a rare example not only of Harlem's past but also of its potential future. Hundreds of single-family houses were built by some of the most successful architectural firms at the end of the 19th century, though most were turned into rooming houses during the Depression.
"There are all kinds of great places up here," said Ruth-Miriam Garnett, a poet who lives in a renovated apartment on the top floor of an 1890 brownstone on West 121st Street that was designed by the New York architectural firm of Cleverdon & Putzel.
In the 1890's, when the neighborhood was prosperous, the house belonged to Lippman Tannenbaum, a diamond merchant on Nassau Street. His neighbors included Thomas F. Gilroy, a Mayor of New York. The fancifully carved brownstone was recently converted from a rooming house into small apartments.
"I'm a tenant, so I'm not striving for perfection," said Ms. Garnett, who comes from St. Louis and is living in her third Harlem apartment. "I've always lived in a brownstone. When I'm ready to move, I look in black communities to see what's up." Ms. Garnett has only a few reservations about living in Harlem. "There are not a lot of services uptown," she continued. "Eventually you have to go to Fairway," which is almost 50 downtown blocks away.
Ms. Garnett's two-bedroom floor-through apartment, for which she pays $900 a month, has a view of the neo-classical dome of the Mount Morris Park Ascension Presbyterian Church and offers a quiet place to work.
She likes to tell a story about her cats, Latifah and Olivia, that illustrates the wariness some people have about her neighborhood.
After discovering a mouse on another floor, she called an animal rights group and asked for two cats. A man offered to deliver them. "He was very nervous coming up here," Ms. Garnett recalled. "Then he told me that the day before his car had gotten broken into near Lincoln Center.
"I told him to relax."
 
A Journey to the 1800's, in Walking Shoes
 The Mount Morris Park Open House Tour sponsored by the Mount Morris Park Community Improvement Association will take place on June 14 from 11 A.M. to 4 P.M. The meeting place is the Harlem branch of the New York Public Library, 9 West 124th Street. Tickets are $15 each ($10 in advance; $8 each for groups of 10 or more). Information: (212) 234-8206.
The subway stop closest to the library is the 125th Street station on the No. 2 and No. 3 lines. Or you can take the M7, M100, M101, or M102 bus to 125th Street and Malcolm X Boulevard (Lenox Avenue).

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Politics' Cutting Edge;
Californians Making Political Waves That May Wash Over Nation by Fall

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 3

 BODY:
Once again, Californians are at the cutting edge of national trends, pushing non-interest in politics to the outer limits. The turnout for Tuesday's primary was the lowest for a Presidential primary in more than half a century.
But those who did vote made waves, with Democrats nominating two women for United States Senate seats and an extraordinary number of women for Congress and the state Legislature. In what one official portrayed as a gesture to the ultimate outsider, 18 women, Democratic and Republican, were nominated for the state's 52 seats in Congress, 15 of which are open. 
 The stage is now set for a crucial November election, with control of the largest state at stake. With the Legislature running under newly re-drawn districts, and with seven new seats in Congress, California will see the most sweeping turnover of elected officials in recent memory.
Apart from the nomination of the two women, Dianne Feinstein and Representative Barbara Boxer, for Senate, perhaps the most stunning result of the election was the setback suffered by the Waxman-Berman political machine of Los Angeles. The machine, dominated by Representatives Henry A. Waxman and Howard L. Berman, has long held sway over California liberal Democratic politics.
Representative Mel Levine, the machine's candidate for Senate, ran a poor third behind Ms. Boxer in a race in which he spent $4 million in television advertising but made almost no public appearances. Ms. Boxer won 44 percent of the vote, while Lieut. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy gained 31 percent, and Mr. Levine trailed with 22 percent.
One of the Waxman-Berman stalwarts, State Senator Herschl Rosenthal of Los Angeles, appears to have narrowly lost his seat to, of all people, the former radical, Assemblyman Tom Hayden, in a re-drawn district that includes Beverly Hills. The political consulting firm associated with the machine, BAD Campaigns, saw many of its clients go down to defeat, including State Controller Gray Davis in the Senate race. Ms. Feinstein won with 58 percent of the vote to 33 percent for Mr. Davis. In the Republican race for the same seat, Senator John Seymour won with 51 percent of the vote to 27 percent for Representative Bill Dannemeyer.
"The Waxman-Berman grip has been broken," said Joe Scott, editor of The California Eye, a political newsletter. "This opens a whole new chapter in Democratic politics in the state, a rejection of the hubris we've seen here for so long.
The implications for Republicans were less clear. It was mostly conservative politics as usual, with a Senate nomination going to Bruce Herschensohn, a conservative television commentator who has never held office before and who wants to abolish the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Energy and the Federal Reserve Bank. Mr. Herschensohn squeezed out a victory over Representative Tom Campbell, with 38 percent of the vote to Mr. Campbell's 36 percent. Sonny Bono collected 17 percent.
 
Mixed Results for Governor
 For Gov. Pete Wilson, the results were mixed. He had endorsed a number of middle-of-the road Republicans for the Assembly in the hope of reducing the number of far-right-wing Republicans who have opposed his programs. Some of his candidates won, including B. T. Collins in Sacramento, Tricia R. Hunter in Riverside and Imperial Counties, Jeffrey I. Marston in San Diego and Jan Goldsmith in San Diego.
But others lost, including Veronica A. Delaney and Gregory R. Cox in San Diego, and Barbara G. Pieper, who is for the right to abortion, in Pasadena.
"Moderate Republicans are so disaffected from the Bush-Quayle Republican Party that they stayed home," said Eileen Padberg, a political consultant who ran the campaign of Judith M. Ryan, a backer of abortion rights who unsuccessfully tried to take the Republican nomination away from the conservative Congressman, Robert K. Dornan, in Orange County. Only 20,000 voters turned out.
On the Democratic side, the clout of women was stunning. Mark DiCamillo of The California Poll called it "a major defining" force in the Democratic primary.
Calling women "the ultimate outsiders," William Schneider of the American Enterprise Institute said that having two well-known women on the California ballot could well serve as the spark that galvanizes the women's vote this year.
Among the women who won Congressional races were Anna Eshoo, a Democrat in the southern suburbs of San Francisco; Lynn Woolsey, a Democrat in Marin and Sonoma counties, north of San Francisco, now represented by Ms. Boxer, and Lucille Roybal-Allard, running in a heavily Hispanic district carved from one that had long been represented by her father, Edward R. Roybal.
In the new 49th Congressional District in San Diego, two women will face each other in November: Judy Jarvis, a Republican, and Lynn Schenk, a Democrat.
The dynamics of the general election in November are likely to be vastly different from the underpopulated primary Tuesday. The two Democratic women in United States Senate races have substantially different political philosophies and styles, share little affection for each other and face vastly different opponents.
The gap between the liberal Ms. Boxer, who represents the Marin County area north of San Francisco in Congress, and Mr. Herschensohn is of Grand Canyon proportions.
 
Middle-of-Road Race
 But the decision is tougher in the race between Ms. Feinstein, a former Mayor of San Francisco, and Mr. Seymour, the incumbent Republican who was appointed by Governor Wilson. Both are middle-of-the-roaders, and they share certain stands, like opposing off-shore oil drilling and favoring abortion rights.
But they are likely to clash on economic issues, like cutting military spending and about whether the Free Trade Agreement with Mexico will be good for California. (No, says Ms. Feinstein; yes, says Mr. Seymour.)
In the final days of the campaign, and again today as they flew around the state for victory rallies together, Ms. Feinstein and Ms. Boxer put aside differences and linked their campaigns under the banner of feminine unity. But two years ago, when Ms. Feinstein was running in the primary for governor, Ms. Boxer endorsed her male opponent, although she supported Ms. Feinstein in the general election.
"Feinstein is not as liberal as Boxer," said Herbert Alexander, a political scientist at the University of Southern California. "So it will be interesting to see if they run in tandem, saying it is a major breakthrough for women. There is some danger in that for Feinstein, who is not as much a feminist as Boxer."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN
Woman in the News: Barbara Boxer;
2 Senate Nominees Who Have Paid Political Dues

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 3

 BODY:
As newlyweds in 1962, Barbara and Stewart Boxer chose a Brooklyn apartment that seemed the perfect place to start their marriage, but for the musty carpet in the lobby, which the landlord promised would be replaced any day.
Months passed with no action. 
 So Ms. Boxer, fresh out of Brooklyn College with an economics degree and a go-get-'em attitude, organized the tenants of 770 Ocean Parkway, began planning all manner of protest, got the landlord's attention and quickly won a new rug.
Mr. Boxer, a lawyer specializing in worker's compensation cases, told the emblematic story of his wife's first political victory last night as a victory celebration swirled around him at a Holywood recording studio. Ms. Boxer, a five-term Democratic member of Congress, was on the stage promising her supporters that she was ready to shake up the Senate and go head to head with the entrenched, male political establishment, if she beats Bruce Herschensohn, a conservative Republican television commentator, in the fall.
 
Step by Step Into Politics
 Her husband looked up at her, a tiny woman who needs a riser to see over most lecterns, and smiled a shy, proud smile. There was nothing she was saying, Mr. Boxer said, that he had not known for 30 years.
During those three decades, Ms. Boxer, born Nov. 11, 1940, in Brooklyn as Barbara Levy, moved step by step into politics, following the community-oriented track common to women entering public life.
After moving west to the wild beauty of Marin County, following a sister who had already settled there, Ms. Boxer worked part time as a stockbroker while raising two children.
Aroused by the Vietnam War, and casting about for a worthy local project while her husband pursued his legal career, Ms. Boxer invited some neighborhood women to her backyard in Greenbrae. "Are you feeling what I'm feeling," she remembers asking them. The group organized a program to counsel high school dropouts, which was so successful it was taken over by the county school system.
Soon, Ms. Boxer was dabbling in journalism, at the weekly newspaper Pacific Sun, and from 1974-76 she was a district aide to Representative John Burton, a Democrat. From 1976 to 1982, she served on the county Board of Supervisors and then won election to the House of Representatives.
Ms. Boxer's daughter, Nicole, now 25, remembers her childhood home as command central for a group of animated, busy women who were constantly hatching plans.
"I was always sneaking downstairs in my pajamas," Nicole Boxer said, "because it was too exciting to go to bed."
 
Attack on Pentagon
 Once Ms. Boxer reached Congress, where she started her career with a highly publicized attack on Pentagon coffee pots that cost $7,622, she did lots of "telephone parenting," her children said.
Unlike some politicians, Ms. Boxer rarely trots her family out in public. Using them as campaign surrogates does not work, Mr. Boxer said, "because the certain magic Barbara has with people doesn't transfer to the rest of us."
Ms. Boxer made the most of her personality in a primary race that began months before the candidacies of women were galvanized nationwide by the spectacle last fall of the all-male Senate Judiciary Committee hearing charges of sexual harrassment against a Supreme Court nominee. Back then, and through the final days of the race when she made a 27-hour, 7-city campaign tour, Ms. Boxer built her campaign around cozy gatherings of like-minded women, much like the ones years ago.
In her base of Northern California and in the unfamilar southern precincts where California elections are won and lost, Ms. Boxer attended backyard barbeques, lox and bagel brunches, reunions of former Brooklynites, gripe sessions at senior centers.
Her supporters and strategists argued on Tuesday night that the person-to-person style was a perfect complement to a female candidacy, touching the same nerve in voters searching for leaders who understand their daily lives.
"She touched people and she talked to them," said Gloria Molina, the first woman and the first Hispanic politician elected to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors.

HEADLINE: New York City Begins Talks With Its Unions

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
A broad coalition of municipal labor unions, representing 200,000 New York City workers, began contract negotiations with the Dinkins administration yesterday by demanding a raise, job security and improved health and welfare benefits, despite an earlier warning by Mayor David N. Dinkins that the city had no money and would grant no raises without productivity gains.
The talks come while all the city's labor unions are working without contracts and have not had wage increases for more than a year, raising the possibility of a work slowdown or other job action by irate unions. They have already threatened to withhold their political support from Mayor Dinkins in next year's election. 
 "We have done a lot to help the city through these hard fiscal times, and we intend to bargain hard to get our fair share of the budget as the city's financial condition improves," said Stanley Hill, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees District Council 37, a coalition member that represents 117,000 workers.
To help the city close huge budget deficits during the last two years, the unions have endured the loss of 20,000 jobs through layoffs and attrition and agreed to furloughs and other concessions. Union leaders said yesterday that their members had earned raises and that the city could finance them through expected improvement in city tax revenues from an expanding economy.
 
Finances to Precede Raises
 But the administration stood its ground, maintaining that any improvement in city revenues would be first used to balance the budget by eliminating the city's dependence on risky or uncertain financing sources, like new borrowing, new taxes or increased Federal aid.
Both the unions and the administration described the opening talks as cordial and respectful, but they predicted that negotiations would grow contentious before long, given the city's need to cut costs and growing pressure on union leaders by members to get raises.
Among the major demands of the unions are a two-year labor agreement, an unspecified wage increase effective each new year of the contract, and job security in the form of no layoffs and limitations on the amount of services that the city contracts out to private business.

Sales Gain Of 11.1% for U.S. Vehicles

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 3

 BODY:
Sales of domestically built vehicles closed out the month on a strong note, rising 11.1 percent from May 21 to 31 and reinforcing hopes that the automotive sector is finally joining in the overall economic recovery.
Sales of domestically built cars rose 2.1 percent, to 237,400, and sales of domestically built light trucks, a category that includes mini-vans and utility vehicles, rose 27.9 percent, to 158,025. Together, domestic light vehicle sales totaled 395,425. 
 The seasonally adjusted annual rate for car sales was 6.5 million, down slightly from 6.7 million in mid-May and 6.6 million during the comparable period last year.
Tom Webb, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association, said: "The surge in the final 20 days of May was no fluke. The industry has a lot of catching up to do. Until now, auto sales were a weak link in the recovery."
 
An Optimistic Sign
 Even analysts who have been cautious until now conceded that late May sales were an optimistic sign that the market was turning. "The numbers suggest that what we had in mid-May wasn't an aberration," said Harvey Heinbach, an analyst for Merrill Lynch. "I'm feeling better that we might be at the start of an upturn."
For the last few weeks auto makers, feeling more bullish because of the increased sales, have responded by sharply increasing the numbers of cars and trucks they plan to build in the coming months, according to reports in the trade press.
"Not only has manufacturing for export held steady, but manufacturing in general shows some expansion," said Yale Gieszl, executive vice president of the Toyota Motor Corporation's United States sales arm. "That means more overtime, and the next step is increased hiring."
Matt Chesonis, sales manager of Ricard Ford in Columbus, Ohio, said, "Showroom traffic last year was higher than this year, but we're seeing more serious buyers this year."
For the entire month of May, sales of all vehicles, imported and domestic, rose 3.8 percent, to 1,147,155. Car sales dropped 1.3 percent, to 736,758, while light trucks rose 14.3 percent, to 410,397. May's seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales for domestically produced cars was 6.3 million, the highest monthly rate since last July.
 
Business Won Back
 Sales of vehicles produced in North America, by the Big Three and transplants, were proportionately higher than last year; they captured 82.6 percent of the total, compared with 79.9 percent of the total last year.
The Big Three, with improved quality and generally lower prices than Japanese competitors, were able to win back some lost business, capturing 72.4 percent of all vehicle sales in May, up from 68.7 percent last year.
The General Motors Corporation sold 273,263 import and domestic cars in May, up 2.5 percent from a year ago. G. M.'s light-truck sales rose 5.4 percent, to 141,174. The Pontiac division lifted monthly sales by 20.7 percent. Only Saturn, which more than doubled sales, was a better performer among G. M. car divisions.
The Ford Motor Company sold 153,115 cars, up 7.6 percent from last year. Ford's light-truck sales rose 17 percent, to 125,331. Ford's Explorer light utility vehicle established a monthly sales record in May.
The Chrysler Corporation sold 58,482 cars, down 10.1 percent from last year. Chrysler's light-truck sales rose 39.1 percent, to 99,446, largely on the strength of the popularity of the Chrysler mini-van and the new Jeep Grand Cherokee.
 
Honda Sales Drop
 The Honda Motor Company sold 65,628 cars, down 14.9 percent from last year. A Honda spokesman said sales were lower because the American economy had not recovered as strongly as hoped. He also conceded that competition against the Honda Accord in the midsize market was especially fierce, particularly from new models like the Toyota Camry, Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable.
Toyota sold 65,562 cars, down 5.8 percent from last year. But Toyota's Lexus luxury division was up 38.1 percent. Toyota's light-truck sales rose 6.1 percent, to 15,570.
The Nissan Motor Company sold 35,911 cars, up eight-tenths of a percent from last year. Nissan's light- truck sales fell 17.2 percent, to 11,507.

HEADLINE: Executives Say Hiring Will Be Back in Vogue

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
After a steady stream of layoffs last fall and winter, a new optimism is taking hold in executive suites across the country. In contrast to last year, many businesses are turning confident enough to map new hiring and expansion plans.
Interviews with chief executives, along with the results of several recent polls, show a marked upturn in hiring plans and general agreement that outside a handful industries in the throes of reorganizing, including the military, computer and banking businesses, the worst of the layoffs are over. 
 "The jump in hiring plans for the third quarter is huge," said Dun & Bradstreet's chief economist, Joseph W. Duncan.
 
Higher Sales Expected
 Preliminary results from Dun & Bradstreet's latest quarterly survey of 3,000 companies found that nearly 60 percent of executives predicted higher sales this summer and fall and the number of firms that planned to add workers nearly doubled from last winter. At least three other comprehensive surveys also found a signficant upturn in hiring plans this summer comparable to increases early in the recovery of 1983.
"These are actual plans, not just hopes and dreams," added William Dunkelberg, chief economist of the National Federation of Small Businesses, who reports a upturn in optimism among small companies.
Companies in many industries are planning to hire at least a few more people.
In Miami, for example, M. Anthony Burns, chairman of Ryder System, one of the nation's largest truck-rental companies, is planning to hire several hundred truckers for his auto-hauling business and to add 5,000 to 10,000 trucks to its fleet of 160,000 trucks in the coming months.
In Minneapolis, Kenneth A. Macke, chairman of Dayton Hudson, the department store chain and discount retailer, is planning to expand his payroll by 3 or 4 percent in the coming year, mostly to staff the 50 or so stores it plans to open.
And in Hickman, Ark., Nucor plans to open a steel mill after Labor Day even as it increases production at its other plants to five-day workweeks from the four days that about half are now on.
Mr. Duncan estimates that the resumption in new hiring -- payrolls have already increased by about 200,000 since February -- could add more than one million jobs this year, jobs that will put people back to work.
That is still far below the two million to three million jobs created every year during the robust recovery that followed that deep 1981-82 recession. But even this modest job growth is critical if the economic recovery is to keep gaining momentum rather than stalling , as it did in the latter half of last year. Executives and economists expect economic growth of 3 percent, about half the normal pace in a recovery.
At that time, executives were not convinced that expansion would last and hesitated to replenish inventories or recall workers. That lack of faith helped to bring economic growth to a standstill last fall before it picked up again this winter.
Business executives' confidence in the economic recovery has been growing for several months. But what is changing, is that the executives say that they are willing to back their confidence with cold, hard cash -- to hire more hands, replenish inventories and even open a new store or two.
 
Willing to Take Risks
 "People have more confidence that this recovery will continue so they are more willing to take the risk of hiring," said Mitchell S. Fromstein, chairman and chief executive of Manpower Inc., the nation's biggest temporary help company. He said that there had been a substantial increase in his business, and that that was typically a forerunner of permanent hiring.
To be sure, not a single executive interviewed thought that the recovery would be anything but a slow, drawn-out affair. And all still see signficant risks -- from a sharp weakening of export markets to a run-up in interest rates to a surprise jump in oil prices -- that could, despite all the positive signs, still knock the slow recovery down.
"The recovery is still very, very fragile," said Ward Smith, chief executive of Nacco Industries, a Cleveland-based conglomerate that makes products from fork lifts to toasters. The biggest risk for highly leveraged companies like his, Mr. Smith said, is a spurt in interest rates.
 
There Are Still Threats
 For Mr. Macke of Dayton Hudson, more big layoffs in the auto, airline and military industries would also be a threat. "When California went from boom to one of worst in the country, it really hurt our business," he said.
Bad news could still lead many businesses to put their hiring plans on ice. Nonetheless, Kermit Baker, the chief economist at Cahners Economics, which surveys 300 manufacturers on a monthly basis, said, "The reason we ask about the next three months is that the plans, in theory, are already pretty much in place."
But barring any nasty surprises, the new optimism represents a real turning point.
That message comes through in many different ways. Most of the recent surveys, including those by Cahners and the National Federation of Small Businesses, found not only stronger hiring plans, but also plans by more companies to increase inventories, marketing outlays and spending on new plants and equipment. In most cases, businesses' plans are less stingy than at any time since last spring, when the halting and uneven recovery first got under way.
 
Lower Interest Rates Help
 Businesses' new-found willingness to spend augers well for the year's second half and reflects a host of happy developments from lower interest rates and easier credit conditions to a pickup in profits, fatter orders books and ringing cash registers.
Indeed, the nation's total output of goods and services has nudged higher in each of the past four quarters, even though payrolls have grown very little in the past year and the unemployment rate has barely budged since March, when it reached 7.3 percent.
"The big difference is that the Fed didn't really get serious until last October," said Dexter Baker, who just retired as chief executive and chairman of Air Products, a producer of industrial gases in Allentown, Pa.
By past standards, the spending plans and hiring plans are still conservative.
"We've always worked hard to redeploy the assets we have," said Scott G. McNealy, the chief executive at Sun Microsystems. "We don't plan any massive rehiring." Still, with nine million businesses in the United States, even very selective hiring adds up.
Finally, hiring plans vary greatly depending on industry, region and even size of company. It may be a long time, therefore, before the recovery spreads across the board.
Big companies, according to a second Dun & Bradstreet survey, are likely to keep trimming while small ones with a couple of dozen employees or fewer may account for most of the job growth. Hiring plans in the Northeast are showing signs of life, but remain dead in the water in the West.
The most compelling testimonials of businesses' intentions, however, come not from anonymous polls, but from the decision makers who hire and fire, and crank up assembly lines.
"Last summer people told us the economy was getting stronger, but we didn't see it in our business," said Mr. Burns, the chairman of Miami-based Ryder System. "Now we're seeing a good solid expansion."
 
Strong Faith in the Upturn
 It is his confidence in the upturn -- which he thinks will be far more gradual than past recoveries -- that makes him willing to expand his fleet. What makes him so sure? His customers, who number in the tens of thousands, are more upbeat.
But even the most cautious executives are going ahead with expansion plans, and not necessarily gingerly either. "We don't really believe the recession is over," said Mr. Macke of Dayton Hudson, noting that his stores have seen only modest sales increases.
Nonetheless, he is proceeding with plans to spend $1 billion to open more than 50 stores and increase payrolls by 3 or 4 percent.
What the surveys show, and many of the executives attest to, is that they plan to raise production further this summer, largely because orders are gradually improving and inventories are already extremely lean.
Indeed, just keeping inventories from shrinking further could give production a lift for a couple of quarters. "We've let inventories rise in anticipation of slightly more robust sales," said E. W. Deavenport, chief executive of the Eastman Chemical Corporation in Kingsport, Tenn.
Still, with lots of unused production capacity at hand and continued pressure to keep costs under control, managers will keep a far tighter rein on inventories than in the past.
"Nobody's producing any more inventory than they have to, " said Mr. Smith of Nacco.
At the moment, many businesses are filling the new orders by stretching out short workweeks, adding overtime and hiring temps -- and generally finding ways to wring more work out of the existing work force.
"Orders and production are up, but we haven't recalled workers in any substantial numbers," said Leonard Hadley, the chairman and chief executive of Maytag. "I will use productivity and overtime to meet my needs before I recall or add." He expects that time to arrive within a year.
But as slow as the process may be, executives are already beginning to see the current phase as the prelude of better times to come. "Nineteen ninety-two will probably turn out to be a fair year, " said Mr. Deavenport of Eastman Chemicals. "Nineteen ninety-three might be average. And by 1994, we might have a good year."

HEADLINE: U.S. Increases Figures Showing Loss of Jobs

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 3

 BODY:
The Labor Department disclosed today that 164,000 more payroll jobs were lost than had previously been thought during the 12 months through February. But it contended that these and a number of other mostly downward revisions in job data did not materially change the shape of the recession or the budding recovery.
"The recession was much milder than the average postwar recession under both the previously published and the revised time series," the department declared, calculating a 1.8 percent loss of nonfarm jobs from July 1990 to the new low point of January 1992. Previously, figures showed a recession-period job loss of 1.4 percent through a low point in April 1991. 
 But the chairman of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, focused on 2.2 million jobs now shown as lost since June 1990 to argue that "these figures much more accurately represent what American workers have known all along: that this was a severe recession and a disaster for workers."
Today's numbers resulted from the annual benchmark revision under which estimates of payrolls based on samples are "re-anchored" to actual unemployment insurance tax records filed with state agencies. Officials provided them today during a briefing that anticipated the publication on Friday of the monthly employment and unemployment figures for May.
Revisions of payrolls for March and April will be announced that day.
The department's survey of payrolls is one of the most intensely scrutinized of economic indicators. It involves polling more than 350,000 business establishments each month, capturing the activity of people holding more than one job. It is separate from the Government's survey of households, which counts the number of people holding one or more jobs and which produces the monthly unemployment rate.
This year's benchmark revision has been eagerly awaited since reports of a huge change, concentrated in California, circulated last fall. This prompted the department to announce in November that the March 1991 count was overstated by about 650,000.
Today, the final employment figure for March 1991 was chopped by 640,000 before adjustment for seasonal variation and 558,000 after adjustment. While the department called these results approximately equal to the original projection, it acknowledged that this year's benchmark revision was unusually large. The average revision over the last decade has been about 200,000.
After conducting what it called an exhaustive analysis of the error, much of it occurring in January 1991, officials cited several contributing factors. But they were at a loss to determine whether the economy had performed more poorly than had been thought or whether the revision reflected faulty data collection.
One factor was that most states introduced better reporting forms and instructions during the benchmark period, specifying to employers, for example, that they must report only those people working during the week that includes the 12th of the month rather than total employment for the month.
Another factor was improved data for areas of the economy not well covered by the data-gathering process, like day-care services provided at churches and other nonprofit institutions. That industry accounted for 10 percent of the revision.

HEADLINE: Dow Up 10.89, but Broader Market Lags

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks ended with moderate gains yesterday, but the broader market trailed as investors focused on cyclical shares at the expense of growth stocks.
The Dow Jones industrial average climbed back over the 3,400 barrier, rising 10.89 points, to 3,406.99. 
 "The important thing today is that we closed again above 3,400," said Harry Laubscher, a market analyst at Tucker Anthony. "Based on that we should see some higher prices. Breadth may not be that great, but volume is O.K.," he added.
In the broad market, declines led advances, 848 to 843, on strong New York Stock Exchange volume of 215.8 million shares, up from Tuesday's 203.1 million.
The Dow traded just above and below the 3,400 level for much of the day, but a recovery in bond prices in the afternoon lifted sentiment enough to spur more buying, traders said.
"Greenspan's comments earlier today that he sees no indication of inflation for two years gave a little boost to bonds, and that helped us," said Tom Luker, head of the trading desk at Nikko Securities. Mr. Luker's reference was to Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Mr. Greenspan, speaking to the International Monetary Conference in Toronto, said he saw "no evidence that inflation will be an emerging factor in the next two to three years."
A Government report that factory orders rose 1 percent in April, bettering forecasts by one-tenth of 1 percent, had little influence on stocks. Analysts said many investors stayed on the sidelines to await the May jobs report due tomorrow.
Oil company shares were pushed up by higher oil prices. Light crude for July delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange was up 32 cents a barrel to close at $22.43.
Exxon gained 1 1/2, to 62 7/8, and Texaco added 7/8, to 64 3/8. The oilfield services specialist Schlumberger was up 2 3/8, to 67 1/2 and Mobil rose 3/8, to 65 1/8.
The Big Three auto makers were among the most active issues, with General MotorsChrysler rose 1/2, to 19 7/8 and Ford Motor was up 5/8, at 46 3/4.
Among decliners, the integrated circuit maker Altera Corporation slumped 4 1/8, to 15 1/2. Traders said Smith Barney had cut earnings estimates.
In other trading, the Nasdaq over-the-counter composite index gained 0.75, to 589.93, while the American Stock Exchange's Amex index rose 1.70, to 395.65.
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks rose 1.09, to 414.59.
The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index rose 0.45, to 228.65, and the average price per share rose 7 cents.

HEADLINE: Fed's Chief Says Inflation Is Under Control

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, June 3

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve Board's chairman, Alan Greenspan, said today that even as the economy expanded, he did not see inflation re-emerging as an economic threat in the United States in the next two or three years.
"Short of an extraordinary expansion, which does not seem to be embodied in the data, inflation seems to be well contained," Mr. Greenspan said here at the International Monetary Conference of the American Bankers Association. 
 Although he declined to discuss the prospects for short-term interest rates, his analysis suggested that if current economic growth, which he termed "gradual but persistent," should falter, the central bank could provide additional stimulus by lowering rates another notch.
 
Fears of a Long-Term Threat
 His comments are likely to be welcomed by the Bush Administration, which is counting on renewed growth to improve re-election prospects for the President.
Mr. Greenspan, who appeared here with central bank leaders from Europe and Japan, acknowledged that the financial markets still saw a long-term inflation threat in the United States and said these inflation expectations had generated higher long-term interest rates than were justified.
While inflation is running around 2 percent, 30-year Treasury bonds are yielding 7 3/4 to 8 percent.
"I hope that when it becomes evident as time goes on that indeed inflation will not be emerging in the United States, that these inflation premiums will indeed fall, and with them long-term interest rates," the Fed's chairman told reporters after his address to the closed meeting.
 
Dissent on the Board
 Stephen D. Slifer, managing director of Lehman Brothers, said in a telephone interview from New York that some other members of the Federal Reserve Board were not as pleased as Mr. Greenspan with the current rate of inflation and believe it should be cut to zero.
As a result, Mr. Slifer said he did not see the Fed cutting short-term rates again unless there was some "real economic weakening."
The meeting brought together central bank governors from most of the countries that will participate in next month's economic summit meeting in Munich -- Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England; Jacques de Larosiere, governor of the Banque de France; Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank of Germany, and Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan. Each pointed to improved growth prospects in his economy.
Mr. Mieno also discussed conditions in the Japanese financial system after the "bursting of the bubble" in real estate and stock market values. He estimated that less than 1 percent of outstanding Japanese bank loans would have to be written off. "In view of the effective earnings of Japanese banks, this problem is not serious enough to cause any major friction in the Japanese financial system," he insisted.
The European central bank governors all said they intended to push ahead with European monetary union plans, despite a referendum in Denmark which narrowly opposed a European Community treaty on economic and political integration.
"The thrust is there" for a European currency, "which I consider absolutely to be the case," Mr. de Larosiere said.

HEADLINE: Economic Watch;
Hiring Russian Scientists: Exploitation of the Workers?

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
A dollar does not buy much these days -- unless you are in the market for a superbly trained physicist, software designer or materials engineer working in the former Soviet Union.
And the opportunity is not being ignored by the masters of capitalism: Last week A.T.& T. and Corning Inc. announced separate deals that would link Russian specialists in glass technology to major producers of fiber-optic cable and other glass materials in the United States. 
 They joined a small but elite group of Western businesses hiring the services of whole laboratories of the best and the brightest Russian scientists for the price of a newly minted American Ph.D.
Are these foreign companies simply acting as Marx would have predicted, exploiting the talents of the workers in their hour of misery? They are certainly taking advantage of the collapse of the ruble, temporarily shelling out trivial sums in dollars to cover the scientists' going wage in the local currency.
But the Westerners' gain is hardly the Russians' loss. "If you look at their alternatives," points out C. Fred Bergsten, the director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington, "$40 or $50 a month looks pretty impressive."
More important from the broader Russian perspective, continuing employment of the technological elite in established institutes and laboratories could pay enormous dividends in the future. "Expertise is perishable," notes Paul Krugman, an economist at M.I.T.: If Russia does not find a way to keep its most productive scientific groups intact through the current financial crunch, the hard job of building a modern market economy will be even harder.
It is easy to see why A.T.& T. hired some 100 specialists from the General Physics Institute in Moscow and why Corning scooped up 115 more from the Vavilov State Optical Institute and the Institute of Silicate Chemistry in St. Petersburg, in both cases to work on glass materials technology. Like Sun Microsystems, United Technologies and General Atomics, they know a bargain when they see it.
"We're going to gain more than we give," concluded Alastair Glass, the director of passive components research at A.T.& T.
While Soviet technology was generally inferior to the Western competition, there were pockets -- everything from metallurgy to ceramics to rocket propulsion systems -- in which Soviet science and engineering was the very best. And now, thanks to the double whammy of capital flight and government belt tightening, the services of the scientists who kept the Soviet Union in arms and space races can be had for a song.
Judging by the benchmark of the recent public auctions of foreign currency as well as the terms of exchange in the thriving black market, the ruble is worth less than a penny. But David Lipton, an economic consultant to the Russian Government, points out this measure is more a reflection of ruble holders' desperation to convert their evaporating assets into a more stable form of wealth than the relative purchasing power of the two currencies. Thus while a typical Russian family's monthly income would barely pay for a pair of seats to a Broadway musical, it is still enough to cover bread, rent and an occasional pair of shoes at home.
And if every Russian's wage seems shockingly modest when converted to dollars at free market rates, the collapse of the old Soviet order has left scientists' wages more modest than most.
Herbert Levine of the University of Pennsylvania points out that the Communist leadership kept the differences in money wages between blue- and white-collar work to a minimum. The elite -- among them, senior scientists and academics -- took much of their compensation in access to heavily subsidized stores, clinics, resorts and schools, rather than in rubles.
 
No More Privileges
 Now the worm has turned. For many, the privileges of rank have been lost. And the current squeeze on the government budget has meant that wages in all but key sectors -- notably transportation and energy -- have failed to keep up with exploding inflation. Scientists who would have been merely cheap to hire a few years ago, are now grateful for the trivial sums available from Western companies.
But Mr. Lipton, the consultant, argues that these super-bargains are likely to be short-lived. Russian economic reformers hope to hammer down inflation to tolerable levels in the next year and to make the ruble freely convertible to Western currency at a rate that better reflects the relative purchasing power of the ruble. He expects that average wages, denominated in dollars, will settle in the range of the other Eastern European economies -- somewhere between $100 and $200 a month.
The most productive and mobile workers in science, those with skills that private enterprise needs to make internationally tradable products, are likely to earn far more than the average. That does not bother Mr. Glass of A.T.& T., who acknowledges that in the long run scientists' salaries will be determined by the competitive value of their services.
Could the Russian Government, which has the authority to veto these scientist-for-hire deals, extract more on their behalf in the meantime? Charles Wolf, dean of the Rand Graduate School in Santa Monica, Calif., concedes there may be room for a surcharge on the export of specialized services -- an "optimal export tax" that offsets the impact of temporary distortions in the exchange rate. If Russian scientists are worth hiring at $50 a month, it is hard to imagine they are not worth hiring at $100.
But everyone agrees this is hardly a high-priority matter for a government that is hard pressed to sustain a civil society during the transition to democratic capitalism. And in any case, the economic reformers have good reason to be grateful for any source of help in keeping Russia's huge science establishment intact in the face of collapsing military budgets.
Modern science, especially the sort that goes into marketable products, Mr. Krugman notes, depends on teamwork. And if good scientists cannot raise the money to pay their own salaries, let alone purchase high-quality equipment, they are bound to scatter to the four winds. Reassembling the first-rate institutes and laboratories that served the Soviet military industrial complex would be next to impossible.
By the same token, association with Western companies is very likely to pay off for the Russian economy as a whole. One reason is that Soviet scientists hired to create technology for Western companies will inevitably gain from the backwash of technical information. Another is that Soviet producers of technology will learn how to learn.
Martin Weitzman, an economist at Harvard, points out that Soviet science has always outclassed Soviet technology, most likely because the authoritarian culture inhibited the efficient diffusion of knowledge. Thus while the Russians from the Institute of Silicate Chemistry are bound to pick up a lot of specific information about making glass materials, the biggest payoff will likely come in knowledge about how Corning channels research into usable technology.
"They've never been exposed to applications," said George Beall, a research fellow at Corning who is coordinating the company's Russian initiative.
To economists, the whole point of trade is mutual benefit. And they believe exports of Russian scientific services are no exception: "It's a win-win, positive sum game," Mr. Bergsten concludes.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Mixed as Traders Focus on European Money

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled mixed on world currency markets yesterday as trading focused on the European currencies.
Gold prices eased after rising overseas. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $338.70 a troy ounce, off 60 cents from Tuesday. The Republic National Bank said gold had slipped 20 cents an ounce to a late bid price of $338.50. 
 Dealers spent the session reacting to news that Denmark had rejected the Maastricht Treaty on closer European economic and political union. Some investors who felt uncertain about the weaker European currencies bought dollars, but the biggest beneficiary was the German mark.
"The reasoning is that the Germans have the least to lose in terms of European unity, because they already are economically independent," said Randolph Donney, research director at Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J.
 
Dollar Moves Erratically
 The dollar moved in erratic fashion for most of the session as traders "tried to figure out the ramifications" of Denmark's rejection of the treaty.
Dealers essentially ignored a report showing that orders to United States factories rose 1 percent in April, the fourth consecutive monthly gain. The report was in line with expecations.
Traders are anxiously awaiting the Labor Department report on unemployment data for May, due tomorrow.
In Tokyo the dollar fell to 126.90 Japanese yen, from 127.48 yen on Tuesday. Later, in London, it rose to 127.75 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 127.45 yen, unchanged from Tuesday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.8180, from $1.8240 late Tuesday. In New York, it cost $1.8185 to buy one pound, more expensive than Tuesday's $1.8145.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.6040 German marks, down from 1.6140; 1.4700 Swiss francs, up from 1.4640; 5.4025 French francs, down from 5.4210; 1,213.00 Italian lire, down from 1,217.00, and 1.2007 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2035.
Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $339.30 a troy ounce, up from $338.65 bid late Tuesday. In Zurich it rose to a closing bid of $339.00 from $338.50. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.62 to close at a bid $339.56.

60 Seconds Of Persuasion Isn't Cheap

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
AN industry that produces the world's most costly minutes of film is worrying about its own financial health.
The nation's television-commercial production industry faces daunting challenges, brought on largely by the continued recession at the advertising agencies they work for. Agencies want to entice consumers with spectacular spots that can cost as much as $1 million a minute to film, score and edit. Yet at the same time, cutbacks in client spending, and account losses, are forcing agencies to urge production companies to economize, sometimes to the point of making once-lucrative assignments unprofitable. 
 As production industry executives gather in New York for a national convention, which begins today, they will ponder their problems at seminars on subjects like "The Future of Advertising" or "A Pre-Nuptial Guide to Directorial Contracts."
"Our significant concerns continue to be our relationships with our clients -- the advertising agencies -- and their clients," said Jon Kamen, executive producer at Sandbank & Partners in Hawthorne, N.Y., which has produced spots for marketers like BMW, Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Nike and Nynex.
"The economic pressure being put on all of us," he added, "is clearly being felt." Mr. Kamen is also the national president of the Association of Independent Commercial Producers, a 20-year-old organization that is sponsoring the convention; by his estimate, its 800 member companies represent about 85 percent of the production industry.
Jordan Kalfus, executive producer at Harmony Pictures in New York, decried the "bottom-line mentality" infecting both sides of the commercial production process. As marketers increasingly consider their agencies little more than suppliers, he said, agencies in turn treat production firms in the same fashion.
"Even in a story-telling commercial, where people are talking to people, we try to make the spot stand out," Mr. Kalfus said, "by differentiating it in terms of the originality of the work. That demands time, expertise and effort." Not to mention money.
Complicating the industry's difficulties has been a trend toward clients becoming competitors, Mr. Kamen said, as "the agencies aggressively push for their own in-house production." Association members believe this threat has receded to some degree, he added, because of the inability of in-house operations to duplicate what he called the "entrepreneurial spirit" of independent producers.
A microcosm of what producers face can be found in the struggle by production companies in New York to cope with their especially high costs. Since the association has chapters in eight other cities, it does not take sides in the tug-of-war over where spots will be shot. Still, the migration of work to other sites, primarily on the West Coast, is an important issue; Mr. Kamen estimated that the volume of spots produced in New York had plunged to 20 percent or less from as high as 60 to 70 percent a decade or more ago.
One element of the association's strategy to address the cost issue is to burnish its image among agency clients, by convincing them that cost should not be the sole determinant in their commercial-production decisions.
To that end, during the convention the association will co-sponsor, with the Museum of Modern Art, its first annual show, ambitiously titled "The Art and Technique of the American Television Commercial."
Mr. Kalfus, who is chairman of the show, called it a showcase for "the craft of making commercials." Eighty spots will be presented to the museum for its collection, and some of the best-known and busiest commercial directors, like Ridley Scott, Joe Pytka and Steve Horn, are scheduled to give lectures.

Tax-Exempt Fund Yields Fall for 4th Time in 5 Weeks

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields offered by money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were mixed in the latest week.
In the period ended Tuesday, tax-exempt money fund yields were down for the fourth time in five weeks. Analysts noted, however, that the demand for tax-exempt funds continued to be fed by the narrowing of the yield spread between taxable funds and tax-exempt ones. 
 "There is a fair amount of investor demand for tax-free paper and the money continues to flow into the longer maturities for the higher yields," said Walter S. Frank, IBC/Donoghue's chief economist. "Most of the reports I've seen from the fund families say there is a heavy flow of cash into the bond area."
The seven-day compounded average yield for a tax-exempt fund took a sharp drop of 10 basis points, to 2.93 percent, and the simple yield dropped by a same amount, to 2.89 percent. During the period, the lagging 30-day compounded average yield fell eight basis points, to 3.05 percent, and the simple yield fell by seven basis points, to 3.01 percent. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
Analysts at Donoghue's said the average number of days left to maturity on tax-exempt securities held in fund portfolios was down a day, to 51.
For investors in the 28 percent tax bracket, the taxable equivalent of the current seven-day tax-free yield is 4.07 percent, while the equivalent for those in the 31 percent tax bracket is 4.24 percent.
In its weekly survey of tax-exempt funds with assets greater than $100 million, Donoghue's said the Fidelity Spartan Municipal Money Market Fund and the Strong Municipal Money Market Fund both tied for the best return, at 3.71 percent, or about 15 basis points below last week's best return. The funds' distributors are the Fidelity Distributors Corporation of Boston and Strong/Corneliuson Capital Management in Milwaukee, respectively.
 
Taxable Assets Fall
 In tracking the taxable funds for the seven-day period ended yesterday, Donoghue's reports that their assets declined by $8.9 billion, to a total of $483.3 billion. Institutional assets were off by $5.9 billion, to $160.2 billion, lured perhaps by the better interest rates in the open market. Meanwhile, the assets of money funds for individual investors dropped $3 billion, to $323.1 billion.
For taxable funds, the average seven-day compounded and simple yields were both up a couple of basis points, to 3.55 percent and 3.49 percent, respectively, while the average 30-day compounded and simple yields, which lag by a bit, both declined by two basis points, to 3.56 percent and 3.50 percent, respectively.
Of the taxable funds surveyed this week, the Dreyfus Basic Money Market Fund had the best return, with a yield of 4.48 percent. The newly formed fund is distributed by the Dreyfus Service Corporation II in Uniondale, L.I.
By comparison, the average yield on a bank money market account, a leading competitor of the money funds, stands at 3.39 percent.

HEADLINE: April Orders To Factories Rose by 1%

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 3

 BODY:
Factory orders rose 1 percent in April for the fourth straight monthly gain, and inventories shrank, the Government reported today in a sign that the manufacturing sector is slowly pushing the economy forward.
"The manufacturing sector is really cranking up," said Sung Won Sohn, an economist with the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis. 
 The April rise in factory orders followed a revised 1.9 percent increase in March. The decline in inventories brought supplies of unsold goods to the lowest point in three years.
Most of the gain came from improved orders for durable goods -- long-lasting items like new cars and refrigerators, which require significant labor to produce.
Inventories of finished goods were down by three-tenths of 1 percent in April to the lowest level since January 1989. It was the 13th decline in 14 months for stocks of unsold goods and creates potential for future production increases. Transportation and military goods contributed the most to the pickup in orders, the Commerce Department said.
The last time there was a longer string of monthly rises in factory orders was during the six months from March through August 1988, officials said.
Economists said the report supported the view that a weaker-than-normal economic recovery was in place that would push gross domestic product about 2.5 percent to 3 percent higher in 1992.
That is approximately half the pace of growth normally seen in the first year after a recession ends, and it is unlikely to pull the unemployment rate much below 7 percent.
Orders for transportation equipment climbed by 5.9 percent in April after a 7 percent increase in March.
Shipments of motor vehicles and parts -- which correspond to orders -- gained by 1.6 percent after rising 1.7 percent in March.
Shipments of manufactured goods, which reflect more immediate demand than orders, increased by two-tenths of 1 percent in April after a 1 percent rise in March.
Military contractors' orders, which are subject to wide monthly swings, increased by 20.4 percent after a 9.2 percent rise in March.
Excluding military industries, factory orders were up four-tenths of 1 percent in April and up 1.7 percent in March.
The backlog of unfilled orders for manufacturing industries decreased for the eighth month in a row in April, falling two-tenths of 1 percent.

Treasuries Mixed in Light Trading

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were narrowly mixed in light trading yesterday, influenced by a snag in Europe's march toward unification, another strong sales report from automobile manufacturers and very positive comments about inflation by the Federal Reserve Board chairman, Alan Greenspan.
Selling pressure first emerged in Europe after Denmark rejected the European Community's treaty for political and monetary union, even though analysts said the vote might eventually benefit dollar-denominated financial assets. 
 At an annualized 6.5 million units, car sales during the last 10 days of May were strong for the second straight period. Moreover, the 6.3-million-unit rate recorded for the month represented a solid improvement from the 5.9 million vehicles sold during April.
"It is pretty much a given that the economy is strengthening," one government bond trader said. "But for the time being the market is in O.K. shape. There is still excellent reinvestment demand, and inventories at Wall Street firms are light."
 
'Fed Is on Hold'
 Steven Slifer, an executive vice president and financial market economist at Lehman Brothers, said that "the auto and manufacturing sectors are doing better, but my sense is that market participants feel the risk of a rapid recovery is not at all great, and that the Fed is on hold."
In remarks to reporters in Toronto after attending an international monetary conference sponsored by the American Bankers Association, Mr. Greenspan gave no indication of what direction Fed policy might take in the future.
However, he did cause bond prices to bounce off their lows of the day when he remarked that inflation premiums built into current bond yields were too high, given his inflation outlook.
Mr. Greenspan said he saw almost no evidence of inflation emerging for two or three years.
In the secondary market for Treasury notes and bonds, the 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 101 1/2, down 3/32 , to yield 7.86 percent, unchanged from late Tuesday.
Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 101 1/8 in late trading, down 2/32 to yield 7.33 percent. But prices of the 5 1/8 percent two-year notes rose by 1/32 , to 9929/32 , to yield 5.17 percent.
 
Bill Rates Decline
 Short-term Treasury bill rates fell slightly.
Three-month bills were offered late yesterday at a discount rate of 3.69 percent, down 3 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by 1 basis point, to a late offered rate of 3.84 percent.
New-issue volume was extremely heavy in the tax-exempt municipal bond market again yesterday, as more than $1 billion worth of new securities were priced. So far this week, roughly $4 billion of new tax-exempt issues have been priced.
Among the municipal issuers yesterday was the Illinois Regional Transportation Authority, which sold $218 million worth of revenue bonds in a negotiated sale through underwriters led by Bear, Stearns & Company, Inc.
Yields on serial bonds sold range from 5.35 percent in 1998 to 6.15 percent in 2004. Serial bonds maturing from 2005 through 2009 were not reoffered.
Yields on term bonds range from 6.50 percent in 2012 to 6.61 percent on bonds maturing in 2022.
The bonds are insured by the Ambac Indemnity Corporation, and are rated triple-A by both Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Despite the heavy volume of new issues, prices of outstanding tax-exempt municipal bonds were unchanged to up 1/8 point, traders said.
In the corporate bond market, Lehman Brothers acted as lead manager on an offering of $100 million worth of high-yield 11-year senior secured notes from J & F Industries.
The 11 7/8 percent notes, which mature Dec. 1, 2003, are noncallable for five years. They were priced at $100, or par.
The issue is rated B-1 by Moody's and B+ by Standard & Poor's.

HEADLINE: No EZ Answer for Cities

 BODY:
Groping for responses to the Los Angeles riots, President Bush rushed to embrace enterprise zones, and now he promises to make them bigger and better. There's much less here than meets the eye; indeed, more can only mean less.
Enterprise zones, EZ's for short, are surely worth modest experimentation -- but no more. Inflating a dubious idea does not make it a practical answer to the torments of American cities. 
 The idea, pushed with commendable concern for cities by Housing Secretary Jack Kemp, is simple: Let Government encourage job-creating investment in ghettos by offering investors tax breaks and regulatory relief. Mr. Bush, having proposed 50 such zones in his January State of the Union Message, now says he wants 125, and proposes even larger tax incentives.
But bigger and better still won't deliver much wallop. Enterprise zones are flawed in theory and also in practice, judging by hundreds of EZ's in about 40 states.
To be fair, the incentives offered by a Federal EZ program would be much more powerful than state subsidies. Mr. Bush's new plan would lure business into urban ghettos by offering investors large tax write-offs, waivers from costly regulations and big Federal tax exemptions.
Mr. Kemp fervently believes tax breaks will generate waves of entrepreneurial investment. But even his passion to help cities cannot give warmth to cold evidence. Study after study shows that companies won't enter drug- and crime-ridden ghettos for the sake of a tax break or two. To make zones work, Mr. Bush would have to add huge investments in transportation and telecommunication, crime prevention and drug treatment.
Businesses that now operate in existing state EZ's often have relocated from nearby neighborhoods, only slightly less poor. That's not necessarily wrong, but beggar-thy-neighbor doesn't go very far as a policy. And excluded neighborhoods are sure to clamor for similar designation in one Congressional district after another, dissipating available Federal funds.
Another lesson from state experiments is that companies drawn to EZ's rely on workers who live outside the zone. That's not surprising. If the problem for ghetto residents were lack of nearby jobs, the simple answer would be to give them transportation subsidies. The real problem is that long-term unemployed ghetto residents lack the skills to find and hold productive jobs.
These unemployed need education and training. They also need day care, health insurance and job-search assistance. If the list sounds familiar, it comes right out of the 1988 Family Support Act. Yet the White House and Congress have provided only meager funds to make it work.
It can't hurt to try out Federal EZ's in a few places and carefully study the results. But modest experimentation is no urban policy. There is as yet no factual justification for pumping up the notion to the point of great expectations. Far from allaying urban disorder, that risks inciting it.

Israel: Rabin Redux

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: TEL AVIV

 BODY:
The legendary Brooklyn Democratic leader Hymie Shorenstein used to refer to F.D.R. as "the Staten Island Ferry." Asked why, he replied: "You know how when the boat glides into the ferry slip, it drags in all the garbage from the harbor behind it? For the rest of our candidates, F.D.R. is the Staten Island Ferry."
The election in Israel three weeks from now centers on one man: Yitzhak Rabin. 
 If the gut issue were settlements on the West Bank, the current Prime Minister, Yitzhak Shamir, would lead the right-wing Likud to victory. By populating the West Bank with Jews, he tells me, "we will make impossible the establishment of a Palestinian state."
Labor's Mr. Rabin, who was Prime Minister in the 70's, is for the less popular "territorial compromise." He would continue settlements in the Jordan Valley and the southern approaches and suburbs of Jerusalem for security purposes, but says, "I oppose political settlements." That opens the door to dealing -- which, counters Likud, is the slippery slope to a P.L.O. state.
That specific issue, paramount in the minds of diplomats and commentators, is not being fought out here. Nor does this campaign pit Socialist economics against free markets; Likud can proudly point to a 6 percent growth rate, but it has failed to remove the dead hand of government ownership from the Israeli economy.
The scrap is about the comeback of Rabin. In the TV spots just begun, Labor hardly mentions the party or other candidates; instead, Rabin's exploits as commander of the six-day war of 25 years ago this week are recounted and his familiar visage dominates the screen.
Contrariwise, Mr. Shamir is downplayed in many Likud ads; they picture the unpopular Labor candidates and warn they would run the country if Rabin won. The right's theme (which worked in Britain) is "Stop the left."
In the street campaign as well, Rabin is the issue. He was smeared early for a nervous breakdown decades ago, and -- though a genuinely private public man -- had to discuss it at length in an interview. He is also denounced as a drunk (as was Boris Yeltsin); some of his angry supporters responded with an attack on the 76-year old Shamir as impotent, nap-prone and short. America is not the only democracy where campaigns focus below the belt.
I like and respect both Yitzhaks, and as a card-carrying right-wing hawk I am leery of the lefties hiding behind Rabin. And I don't like the way the Bush Administration is trying to influence the election by withholding loan guarantees in hopes of ousting the Shamir Government.
But I think Likud is blowing this election all by itself. The dissension among the triumvirate under Shamir -- Arens, Sharon and Levy -- is something fierce, and swing voters know it.
That unresolved succession is in sharp contrast to the clear-cut victory of Rabin over his longtime rival, Shimon Peres. I mistakenly went to Labor headquarters, with its old pictures of Peres and halls filled with hacks, to meet Rabin; it turned out my appointment was at his "personal headquarters," with plain pipe racks and busy young people bustling about. He's running alone, and other Labor candidates know that Rabin's comeback is their comeback.
"The problem in Israel's political system," he says, "is that we have no clear-cut decision. We tried to change the system to the direct election of the prime minister, but Likud torpedoed the idea this time. They were afraid of the verdict of the people."
Over at Prime Minister Shamir's office, after pointing out that the Rabin popularity "is baseless -- he was a failure as Prime Minister," the short but potent Likudnik revealingly said: "I don't like the American personification, personalization of campaigns. I prefer the other way, where people vote for strategies and principles, not for a man. What is a man? Nothing."
To me, that illuminates the basic difference in approach to politics that characterizes this Israeli campaign. Rabin is a strong individual leader topping a listless list; Shamir is a principled movement politician on top of a bickering bunch of talented individuals.
What is a man? In politics, everything -- if he can sail into office like the Staten Island Ferry.

HEADLINE: Fed's Chief Says Inflation Is Under Control;
View on Japanese Banks

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 3

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan said in a statement released today by the Senate Banking Committee that the troubles of Japan's banks should make it easier for many American banks to increase their profits.
In written answers to questions that the Senate Banking Committee posed about Japan, Mr. Greenspan said that as a result of the turmoil in Japan's financial markets, Japanese banks had scaled back their involvement in overseas markets. In addition, he said, Japanese banks were now tending to seek a bigger spread between their cost of capital and the interest rates on their loans.
He said this development "lends support to forecasts of improved earnings prospects for competing U.S. banks."
 
Reduced Lending in the U.S.
 Mr. Greenspan said the financial pressures on Japanese banks had generally caused them to reduce their lending in the United States, especially for real estate and highly leveraged corporate restructurings. 
 "Companies that have relied on Japanese banks as lenders may have to turn to other funding sources, and Japanese banks have become less active in guaranteeing local government issues," he said.
The Fed's chairman said some American banks and securities firms had "sizable exposure to Japanese banks that have been greatly affected by the fall in Japanese stock prices." He said that at the end of 1991, American banks reported $53 billion in Japanese exposure, or about 35 percent of the reporting banks' capital.
He suggested that the failure of a leading Japanese bank could upset American and other financial markets, and he added that it was wrong for American banks to act on the assumption that the Japanese Government would never permit a large bank to fail.
Mr. Greenspan also said that judging from Japanese yield curves, "the market does not expect any significant further monetary policy actions" by Japan's central bank "over the next several months."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Candidate's Record;
PEROT AND HANOI DISCUSSED BUSINESS

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 3

 BODY:
After going to Hanoi in 1987 to try to free Americans who might have remained in captivity after the Vietnam war, Ross Perot and an associate discussed private business opportunities with top Vietnamese officials, according to a Vietnamese official and Mr. Perot.
In a June 1990 letter the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry designated Mr. Perot and his company as a business agent of the Government of Vietnam to help procure American investment after diplomatic and trade relations were normalized, Mr. Perot said today. Those criteria have yet to be met. 
 But Mr. Perot and the Vietnamese official agree about little else in accounts they provided this week about the business discussions that appear to have overlapped with Mr. Perot's efforts to determine if any American prisoners of war remained in Southeast Asia, and if they did to free them.
None of Mr. Perot's contacts with Hanoi after his 1987 trip were disclosed to United States Government officials who were engaged in delicate negotiations with Vietnam. Nothing about the business discussions was illegal, but several American officials dealing with prisoner-of-war and missing-in-action issues expressed surprise at the discussions, and some criticized them.
Mr. Perot said that he had never had any intention to invest in Vietnam or Southeast Asia and that his 1987 trip to Hanoi and the eight subsequent trips by his associate, Harry McKillip, to meet with Vietnamese officials had been related to P.O.W. or M.I.A. issues or been purely social in nature.
He said he engaged in several "philosophical" discussions about business opportunities with Vietnamese officials, but he dismissed the talks as the initiative of the Vietnamese, including the country's Vice Premier, who also served as Foreign Minister.
Mr. McKillip, responding to questions on a speaker phone in Mr. Perot's Dallas office, said he had not engaged in commercial negotiations with Vietnamese officials. He said he merely supplied the Vice Premier, Nguyen Co Thach, with books on management, investment and finance to help Mr. Thach develop a code of foreign investment.
Mr. Perot said he never acted on the June 1990 letter from Mr. Thach when Mr. McKillip returned with it from Hanoi and never replied to the Vietnamese, though Mr. McKillip continued his contacts with Hanoi, including a social call on Mr. Thach at his retirement last August.
In a lengthy response today in several interviews, Mr. Perot read the letter over the telephone, but declined to make public a copy of it. He said he feared that would harm current discussions between Vietnam and the United States.
A senior official of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry, Le Van Bang, said in a telephone interview from Hanoi that his Government had been discussing commercial ventures with Mr. Perot's representative since some time after Mr. Perot's 1987 visit, a visit that Mr. Bang said was mostly devoted to discussions about P.O.W.'s and M.I.A.'s.
In an interview with C-Span last month, Mr. Bang said Mr. Perot and Mr. McKillip promised money, medicines, medical equipment and other humanitarian aid in discussions that eventually included much larger commercial assistance.
 Mr. Perot categorically rejected Mr. Bang's assertion that his company actively pursued a commercial relationship with Vietnam. "When the dust settles, no matter how you write it, you have my word, my oath on it: none of this is true," he said. "It did not occur."
Mr. Perot raised the possibility that Vietnam's ruling politburo had determined it could curry favor with the Bush Administration and speed normalization of trade and diplomatic ties with the United States by sabotaging his putative Presidential campaign.
 
Contents of the Letter
 Mr. Bang, who has responded to questions about Mr. Perot from several reporters in recent weeks, characterized in positive terms what he said were Mr. Perot's efforts to help Vietnam's commercial reconstruction. Mr. Bang has also complained to a reporter that Mr. Perot has not acted on promises to help Hanoi with development assistance.
"Mr. Perot asked if he could help Vietnam in some of the economic areas," Mr. Bang said in the telephone interview. "And therefore we have given him a letter of intent to help him so he can inform American companies to concentrate on the areas where he has expertise, like electronics, oil and gas, metallurgy, food, agriculture, transportation and real estate."
Mr. Perot acknowledged today that Mr. McKillip's trips to Hanoi were not disclosed to American officials who were pursuing a complex diplomatic strategy to persuade Hanoi to end the stalemate over resolving all cases of P.O.W.'s and M.I.A.'s. The question of American investment was an integral part of that diplomatic strategy.
The June 1990 letter, which was issued by Mr. Thach, referred to a possible timetable for American-Vietnamese normalization as early as September 1990.
According to Mr. Perot's reading today, which he said was somewhat abbreviated, the letter begins: "In anticipation of normalization of relations between the United States and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, this letter is to formally invite Ross Perot and/or his designated companies to assist Vietnam in its economic recovery and redevelopment effort. Vietnam will appoint Ross Perot and his company as agent of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in the procurement of capital investment" and other services from American companies.
 
Anger About Contacts
 Mr. Perot said the letter stated that "compensation" would be "mutually agreed and based on effort and investment." He said it made clear that any transactions would have to comply with the laws of both countries and abide by any conditions of any normalization agreement between Washington and Hanoi.
Reacting to the disclosure of the letter, Ann Mills Griffiths, the director of the League of Families of American P.O.W.'s and M.I.A.'s, said "I am shocked and had no idea, and I can just imagine what the Vietnamese must have been thinking of official efforts" to negotiate with Hanoi "if this was going on during this period."
Gen. John W. Vessey Jr., retired, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and for the last five years the Presidential emissary for P.O.W. and M.I.A. negotiations with Vietnam, said in a telephone interview from Minnesota that Mr. Perot never disclosed the letter or discussions surrounding it.
The general said he was not aware that after Mr. Perot's visit to Hanoi in 1987 the Texas businessman continued a dialogue there through Mr. McKillip. "I have not heard that from the Vietnamese, from Mr. Perot or from anybody else," he said.
Several American officials suggested that Mr. Perot's private dealings with Hanoi could reinforce hardline views in the Vietnamese politburo, where there is strong sentiment to delay cooperation on the repatriation of P.O.W. remains and other outstanding war-related issues as a way to exert leverage on Washington to speed normal relations and the end of a trade embargo.
"The more negotiators there are, the more danger there is the other party will start playing one off against the other," General Vessey said, adding that he was not criticizing Mr. Perot's dealings until he fully understood them.
 
'Not to Ever Go Back'
 There is nothing illegal about American companies discussing prospective business dealings with Vietnam's Government after the normalization of relations, and Mr. Perot said he felt no obligation to respond to Mr. Thach's letter or to disclose it.
"I told Harry just not to ever go back again," Mr. Perot said. "I didn't want to dignify it with a response."
Asked why he thought Vietnam issued the letter, Mr. McKillip said, "Mr. Thach had great admiration for Ross Perot and always believed someday Ross Perot would help him.
"Mr. Thach was getting the extra assignment of writing an investment code as they started to think about business enterprise," he added, "and he had great confidence that Mr. Perot would help him or help Vietnam because they were getting a lot of offers and deals from all over the world.
"It was an invitation and a hope on his behalf that Mr. Perot would come in and help him.".
When Mr. McKillip arrived from Hanoi with the letter, Mr. Perot said that his first reaction was, "What the hell is this?"
"That was the sixth of seven trips," Mr. Perot said, "and at that point I shut it down."
But Mr. Perot said contacts with Vietnamese officials continued the next year. Mr. Bang said there were 13 trips in all.
In an initial set of responses faxed to The New York Times today, Mr. Perot had seemed to deny any contact after Vietnam issued the letter.
"We never responded," his initial statement said. "In fact, nobody representing me ever returned to Vietnam after that meeting" when the letter was handed to Mr. McKillip.
In April 1991, a year after the letter, Mr. Bang came to Washington as a fellow of The United States-Vietnam Trade Council, which represents American companies wishing to do business in Vietnam after a normalization of relations.
Virginia Foote, the director of the council, said Mr. McKillip called her several times trying to secure permission to fly Mr. Bang to Dallas for meetings at Perot headquarters.
"I found McKillip aggressive," Ms. Foote said. "He was mysterious about it."
She said it was agreed that Mr. McKillip could meet with Mr. Bang in Washington. Mr. Perot said he did not know about this meeting but Mr. McKillip said it was innocuous and "social" in nature.

HEADLINE: THE EARTH SUMMIT;
WHITE HOUSE SNUBS U.S. ENVOY'S PLEA TO SIGN RIO TREATY

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 4

 BODY:
The chief American negotiator at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro made a last-minute appeal to the White House on Wednesday night to reverse its refusal to sign a treaty on protecting animals and plants.
But the negotiator, William K. Reilly, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, was firmly rebuffed today by top aides to President Bush, who rejected any effort to change the American position. 
 It was another in a series of rebukes by the White House to environmental proposals favored by Mr. Reilly, who heads the United States delegation to the Rio summit, formally called the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development.
 
Strains in Administration
 Mr. Reilly's action and the White House reaction reflect not only the enormous strains that exist in the Bush Administration over environmental policy, but the personal pressure Mr. Reilly is under in Rio as the United States is increasingly denounced as having abandoned its role as the world's most environmentally concerned country.
In a confidential memorandum sent to the White House on Wednesday night suggesting the policy change, Mr. Reilly said the Administration's announcement last Friday that it would not sign the treaty "is the major subject of press and delegate concern here." The memorandum was made available to The New York Times by an official opposed to Mr. Reilly's position. [Excerpts, page A6.]
But hours after Mr. Reilly proposed treaty changes in the memorandum and then announced some aspects of the plan at a news conference in Rio this morning, the White House chief of staff, Samuel K. Skinner, and the President's domestic policy chief, Clayton Yeutter, rejected the idea.
 
Giving Reilly 'More Guidance'
 "The modifications were minor and it was communicated to Reilly that this doesn't come close to fitting the bill," said a senior White House official who asked to remain unidentified. "Clayton called him and said no way. The feeling here is that he was trying to present an option and that's his role. We'll just have to give him more guidance."
President Bush said tonight he was not concerned about the criticism in Rio of his Administration, which he attributed to environmental extremists who "started protesting before they even knew what our position was."
Questioned on the issue at a news conference, he vigorously defended his environmental record and suggested that signing the biodiversity treaty would imperil American jobs.
"I am not going to go down there and forget about people that need jobs in the United States of America," he said. "I'm going to take a strong record, the leading record on science and technology, the leading record on oceans, the leading record on forests, the leading records on protecting the elephant, the leading records on C.F.C.'s. We've got a good record." [Excerpts from news conference, page A16.]
 In an interview in Rio earlier today, Mr. Reilly was visibly upset when informed that the someone in the Administration had disclosed his memorandum, which was stamped confidential.
The brief interview ended abruptly when Mr. Reilly was shown the memorandum. He said, "I think I've said enough," and walked out of the room.
At home, Mr. Reilly has lost almost every major internal battle he has fought in the last 10 months that pits environmental initiatives against economic growth. Beginning last summer, Mr. Reilly fought unsuccessfully to block a proposal by Vice President Dan Quayle that would open half the nation's wetlands to development. He has been unable to speed new regulations required by the 1990 Clean Air Act that have been delayed by the President's Council on Competitiveness headed by Mr. Quayle, and last week he lost another struggle when President Bush personally took Mr. Quayle's side and allowed companies to increase air pollution without public comment.
In Rio, he is defending policies he does not eagerly support. The treaty to preserve biodiversity, which was the product of intense negotiations in Nairobi last month, is considered one of the two main achievements of the Rio conference.
The State Department announced on Friday that Mr. Bush would not sign the treaty because of the Administration's concern that it would limit biotechnology development in the United States and could infringe on American patent protection for biological inventions. It also said the Administration was concerned about how money for the plan would be dispersed.
 
'Relatively Small Fixes'
 Brazil, however, has been eager for the United States to sign the treaty because of the prestige that would add to the conference. On Tuesday, representatives of Germany, Canada, Britain and India indicated their nations would sign the treaty, joining 98 other countries that had already announced their intentions to approve it.
In the memorandum to Mr. Yeutter, Mr. Reilly said that Brazil had offered to try to "fix" the biodiversity treaty so that the United States would support it. Mr. Reilly attached a list of modest changes in the text of the treaty that he argued might be enough to gain the White House's support.
Mr. Reilly said he proposed "relatively small fixes of language, the removal of some small, troublesome clauses that create anxieties about intellectual property rights, technology transfer, concessional terms, the regulation of biotechnology."
In the memorandum, Mr. Reilly said: "The changes proposed, while not making everyone in the U.S. Government totally happy, would address the critical issues that have been identified. They are worth a last examination."
Administration officials said the changes did not come close to resolving the more fundamental concerns they had about the treaty. "It caused a little commotion at the White House," another official said. "The response was what you'd expect. A flat no."
 
U.S. Is Isolated
 The Administration's refusal to sign the treaty has isolated the United States and made it the focus of international scorn at the Earth Summit, which has attracted representatives from 178 nations to Rio.
Mr. Reilly was eager for the United States to sign because the treaty could lead to the preservation of hundreds of millions of acres of forests and other wild habitat around the world.
He was supported by Curtis Bohlen, Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, who led the American delegation that negotiated the biodiversity treaty in Nairobi. The two are friends and before joining the Bush Administration worked together at the World Wildlife Fund, an international conservation group in Washington that specializes in biodiversity issues.
The Administration's decision not to sign the treaty was based in large part on a memorandum written by David M. McIntosh, the executive director of the President's Council on Competitiveness. Mr. McIntosh argued in the April 14 memorandum that economic harm from signing the treaty would substantially outweigh environmental benefits.
In particular, Mr. McIntosh said, the American biotechnology industry, one of the more promising new industrial sectors, could suffer because the treaty could harm the ability of American biotechnology companies to protect their biological inventions overseas, and it opened questions about how biotechnology companies would be compensated for products developed from biological resources collected from foreign countries.
 
'Extensively Flawed'
 "The current draft convention is so extensively flawed that it is highly unlikely that the sufficient corrective action could be accomplished at a single negotiating session, and thus, any final convention that might be completed in May would remain seriously flawed," Mr. McIntosh said in his memo.
Today, Mr. McIntosh was at the center of a group of White House staff members that met to determine how to react to Mr. Reilly's proposal, and then quickly decided to reject it.
The White House's decision was communicated to the United States delegation in Rio, and this afternoon Mr. Reilly's first assurances to reporters -- "We have prepared specific language that would satisfy our concerns," he said this morning -- began to shift.
This afternoon Mr. Reilly said there was too little time to revise the treaty, since it was to be signed on Friday. "I don't foresee any reasonable possibility this treaty will change between now and tomorrow morning," he said.
The biodiversity treaty requires nations to adopt national strategies and plans for conserving species and ecosystems while at the same time advancing economic development. Both the treaty and a separate one to control global warming require rich industrial countries to provide money and technology to help poor developing countries carry out the treaties.

HEADLINE: Bill to Aid Former Soviet Lands Is Stuck in Capitol Hill Quagmire

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 4

 BODY:
The Bush Administration's multibillion-dollar assistance package for Russia is stalled in Congress, as election-year politics and the Los Angeles riots have sapped much of the enthusiasm for the foreign aid legislation.
Both Administration and Congressional leaders say the bill will not be passed before President Boris N. Yeltsin's meeting with President Bush on June 15 -- as Mr. Bush had requested in April -- and that they do not know when, or if, it will be approved. 
 The Russian aid bill's limbo reflects the ambivalent moment in which American foreign policy finds itself after the cold war. One day officials and lawmakers say the United States is the world's only superpower, and therefore it must lead on issues, such as Russian aid or peacekeeping in Yugoslavia. The next day, though, the same officials and lawmakers say that domestic problems should take precedence, foreign initiatives are too expensive, and therefore Washington cannot afford to lead. In the wake of the Los Angeles riots in particular, the latter mood seems to be dominating.
"It's in trouble," said a senior Administration official involved with the the aid package, which includes much of the United States' contribution to the $24 billion program the Western allies planned for Russia. "Yeltsin is over there trying to change the world and we are saying, 'Don't bother me until Nov. 4th.' "
While Administration officials will not be able to present Mr. Yeltsin with the Russian aid package as hoped, they are planning a full range of arms control negotiations, including talks about possibly amending the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.
The problem with the Russian aid package, the official added, is not that a majority is against the bill -- known as the Freedom Support Act -- but that at a time of economic troubles at home, and in the middle of an election season, only a few lawmakers are prepared to push for it. Mr. Bush has met with lawmakers to lobby for the package, but he too has been reluctant to make it a high-profile campaign issue. At his nationally televised press conference from the White House tonight, Mr. Bush made no mention of the aid.
 
A Lack of Momentum
 "Right now, the aid package for the former Soviet Union is stalled, because there is little momentum in the Senate, outright opposition in the House and a tepid effort by the President," Senator Joseph R. Biden, the Delaware Democrat and a strong advocate of the bill, said in a statement. "Consequently, there is little prospect that the bill will pass by the time of Yeltsin's visit. Without a bipartisan bill we will make it harder to secure democracy in Russia."
Sen. Richard Lugar, Republican of Indiana, who also supports the bill, said too many Senators, particularly Democrats, "don't want to be perceived as pushing assistance for Russia ahead of assistance for America."
"And in the House they are sort of running for the hills," he added.
The draft bill was approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday and is awaiting review by other committees before it goes to the Senate floor. Then it moves to the House. For now, Administration officials are simply hoping the Senate will vote by the time Mr. Yeltsin arrives, but few Senators are pressing for that. Some Senate Democrats say they should not vote until there is a clear signal that the House will follow suit; otherwise they could end up with an unpopular vote on something that will not even happen.
Representative Jim Leach, an Iowa Republican, said: "The world tends to assume that at every key point in the century the United States does the rational thing, but there is a real potential here for the United States punting of its leadership.
"This is Congressional responsibility, and Congress has not acted. They have not acted because of a four-letter word: 'fear' -- fear that they won't get re-elected," he said.
 
Reluctance to Ante Up
 Failure to pass the bill soon will have both political and economic implications. The heart of the bill is $12 billion to replenish the American account with the International Monetary Fund, so that the fund can lend more money to the former Soviet republics as they enact reform programs approved by the International Monetary Fund.
Without that $12 billion the I.M.F. will still be able to lend to Russia, but aid to other republics will be limited.
Politically, failure to pass the bill could send a signal to America's allies, or as one senior official put it: "There are a lot of other countries who will hold back if they see us holding back. No one wants to be the one to put the first dollar on the table."
The bill also grants the Presidentauthority to waive restrictions on lending money to Russia that date to the cold war. It also endorses an Administration contribution to a $6 billion allied economic stabilization fund. The Administration can make that contribution from existing funds without Congressional approval, but it would be difficult to replace the full $620 million in technical and humanitarian assistance the bill also allocates.
 
Taking on Missile Treaty
 On the arms control front, Administration officials say Mr. Bush will raise with Mr. Yeltsin how they might redefine the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty from an agreement designed to ban missile defenses to one that would regulate Russian and American cooperation against renegade states with ballistic missiles, such as Iraq or North Korea.
During their meeting at Camp David in January, the Presidents discussed the idea of a joint global missile defense system. The Russians are particularly interested in such a system because some of the radar systems that they had deployed along their southern flank and in the Baltics to provide early warning of missile attacks have been lost with the breakup of the Soviet Union.
A joint global missile defense system could require effectively gutting the A.B.M. treaty -- an idea some Bush Administration officials have long advocated in order to introduce the space-based Star Wars defense systems banned by the accord. The Soviets resisted this because they were less advanced in space-based defenses.
Russia might be interested in amending the A.B.M. treaty, provided that the alternative missile system is truly jointly developed and operated so the Americans can never use it against Russia, Administration officials said.
It is precisely such joint control that has the British and the French worried, and the Pentagon strongly opposes the idea as well.
Britain is trying to justify continued funding of its independent nuclear deterrent, based on the Trident missile, and the only compelling justification remains the threat of "a big bad Russia," as one official put it.
 
The Passing of Tridents?
 "If the Russians are in partnership with us, and have their own missile shield that we help to provide and that the British cannot penetrate, why do they need the Trident program?" said the official. "The French have the same concern."
As a compromise, Administration officials say they are likely to propose limited amendments to allow for the deployment of sophisticated space-based infra-red sensors and more ground-based radars that would be able to detect missile launches anywhere in the world and relay information to a Russian-American early warning station.
While the Russians certainly have an interest in enhanced anti-ballistic missile radars, they will want to make sure that such sensors are limited so that they could not also serve to target ballistic missiles as part of a full-blown space-based defense.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: White House;
PRESIDENT AVOIDS DISCUSSING PEROT AT NEWS SESSION

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 4

 BODY:
Using a prime-time news conference a la Ronald Reagan to evoke an image of Presidential statesmanship, President Bush refused tonight to be drawn into direct criticism of Ross Perot.
But the effort, which underscored the alarm that Mr. Perot's unexpected showing in recent polls has caused among Mr. Bush's political advisers, was marred by the refusal of three of the four major television networks to carry the event live. Mr. Bush, who has held only one other prime time news conference in his tenure, was left beseeching the television reporters who were there to give him some attention. 
 The President took a few indirect swipes at Mr. Perot over his opposition to the Persian Gulf war and other issues. Mr. Bush suggested that Mr. Perot's appeal as a problem-solving outsider might not withstand close questioning from the press. But he refused to discuss in any detail Mr. Perot's standing in the polls, his fitness for office, or even whether he would debate the Texas billionaire after the summer's nominating conventions.
 
'A Funny Time Here'
 Instead, Mr. Bush tried to focus public attention away from his staggering campaign and toward his own programs and leadership. Complaining about what he called "a funny time here, time warp" in the campaign, Mr. Bush said he was in a "nonpolitical mode," dealing with substantive issues and eager to solve the economic problems that threaten his re-election. He sought to keep attention on his support for a constitutional amendment aimed at balancing the Federal budget and on his anti-crime, education and economic legislative proposals. [Excerpts from the President's news conference appear on page A16.]
"I will be ready to join the fray after the conventions," Mr. Bush said. "But as you know, I have not challenged either Perot or Clinton, Mr. Perot or Governor Clinton. I have no intention of changing that before the conventions. I am trying to get things done that will help this country."
 
Perot Aide Is Delighted
 He also suggested that he was untroubled by the rapid plunge in popularity that he took last year and his inability so far to recover from record-low public approval ratings. But the President's decision to break with his pattern of holding news conferences in the informal briefing room and move to the ornate East Room in prime time was a clear sign of concern about what Mr. Bush conceded was his lingering inability to persuade voters that he deserves re-election.
Mr. Perot's top campaign official, his longtime adviser Tom Luce, reacted with open pleasure at the sight of Mr. Bush spending a news conference fielding questions about an opponent who has not even declared his candidacy. Speaking on Cable News Network immediately after the news conference, Mr. Luce said this showed Mr. Perot "is really going to drive the agenda for the whole country."
The event clearly was intended to give Mr. Bush a political boost by projecting him to the country from the White House, surrounded by the trappings of power, and it was drawn directly from Mr. Reagan's playbook. White House aides even left open the double doors of the East Room, behind Mr. Bush's lectern, as they had done for Mr. Reagan, to provide a television picture of the President striding in from the long hall behind him.
Marlin Fitzwater, the President's spokesman, tried to play down the significance of the refusal by ABC, CBS and NBC to broadcast the event in its entirety.
But White House aides were clearly perturbed that only CNN carried it live, sandwiching it between the "Crossfire" program, whose co-host is Mr. Bush's deposed chief of staff, John H. Sununu, and an appearance by Governor Clinton of Arkansas, the probable Democratic nominee, on "Larry King Live." Mr. Bush competed for viewers with repeats of the popular "Cosby Show" on NBC, the Western program "Young Riders" on ABC, "Top Cops" on CBS and "The Simpsons" on Fox Broadcasting.
 
'I Need Your Assistance'
 It is extremely rare for the broadcast giants to refuse a President prime-time coverage when it is requested, and their decision to do so may in the end only have underscored the difficulty Mr. Bush is having in seizing control of the campaign.
Mr. Bush seemed clearly agitated about the problem as he faced reporters tonight. At one point, addressing the NBC correspondent, Jim Miklaszewski, he said, "I need your assistance, Jim, in getting the message out loud and clear tonight on what the President said about the balanced-budget amendment. And if you can bring an editorial or two on there saying this is a good idea, it would help enormously."
At one point, a reporter asked Mr. Bush why any candidate would submit to grueling primaries, when he could, like Mr. Perot, simply announce his intention to run. "That's what Barbara was asking me a few minutes ago," he said, referring to his wife.
Pressed for an answer, Mr. Bush said, "Say, hey, I want to continue this job to help this country." He added, "To get out of the arena, to suggest that you're going to run because it's not particularly pleasant, that's not the way I operate."
 
Serene or Drowsy?
 Mr. Bush seemed to be trying to assume a confident serenity that sometimes took on a drowsy quality when projected through the television screen. He became animated only when talking about his leadership in the Persian Gulf war, which he sees as his greatest accomplishment and has been trying without much success to introduce into the campaign.
Although Mr. Bush wanted to talk about the balanced-budget amendment and other issues, which he discussed in a prepared opening statement that included no major policy announcements, the subject of Mr. Perot came up repeatedly.
Other members of the Bush camp have not hesitated to attack Mr. Perot directly. Marilyn Quayle, the Vice President's wife, has accused Mr. Perot of trying to buy the White House. Mr. Fitzwater said today: "This is a man who has no history of sitting down with anybody. His entire history is to stomp into the group, demand to do his things his way, and if he doesn't get it, he picks up the football and goes home."
But Mr. Bush at first declined to say anything about Mr. Perot. Asked if he thought it was proper for Mr. Perot, who is said to be prepared to spend $100 million to $300 million of his own money on the campaign, to do that, Mr. Bush said, "I'd love to answer that question."
But he said he would not, "because I've vowed to keep my sights set on these legislative goals and on leading this country, and if I get into characterizing one opponent or another, I diminish my effectiveness in doing that."
 
Landing Indirect Jabs
 Toward the end of the news conference, Mr. Bush did get in some indirect jabs. "I can understand that appeal: 'I'm from the outside, I'll solve all the problems,' " he said.
He added: "And then some day you guys are going to start: How are you going to do it? How are you going to get this through the Congress? What do you believe? Do you think the President is right on a balanced-budget amendment? Are you with him or against him? Do you think he's right to tighten down on crime legislation? How do you feel on the narcotic problem? How do you feel on world peace? Were you with him when he had to make a very tough call on sending back aggression, a move that was saluted all over the entire world and put this country together like it's never been together in the past since World War II?"
Mr. Bush also said: "I have a difference with him clearly as far as the Persian Gulf War goes. I believe the American people supported our actions in that war."
When asked about Mr. Perot's role in negotiations concerning American prisoners of war or those missing in action in the Vietnam War, Mr. Bush said he would "elaborate on that later on." He said Mr. Perot's negotiating role had been "quite helpful," but said that he "simply cannot comment on" reported private dealings between Mr. Perot and the Vietnamese government.
 
Imagines Meeting Perot
 Asked what he would say to Mr. Perot if they met on the street, Mr. Bush said he would ask him to drop his drive for the Presidency and support him. "I'd say: 'Ross, I think I've been a good President. I believe a man of your capability and talents ought to support me.' " He added, ruefully, "Not that I'd be hopeful by a long shot of persuading him."
When Mr. Bush asserted that his own problem was simply that voters had not heard his pitch, a reporter suggested that perhaps they had and were simply rejecting it.
Mr. Bush responded: "I don't think so because you ask in these deadly polls that you read all the time, you know, about -- relating to issues -- and it's vague out there. We've got a good program and tonight, maybe, this is a more effective way to say we want a balanced-budget amendment." Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, on Tuesday predicted defeat for the amendment.
Mr. Bush added, "Most people would concede that my problems stem from this sluggish, anemic economy." But now, he said, "The economy is improving," so he should get credit for it.
Mr. Bush said he accepted a share of the blame for the economy, but added that Congress is also accountable. While he acknowledged that public opinion polls still reflect a gloomy outlook, he said there were clear signs of recovery, including employment statistics.
Mr. Bush said the time for pointing fingers is over, and that he and Congress should work together to solve the nation's problems.
He also acknowledged that the challenge from his fellow Republican, Patrick J. Buchanan, "was not particularly helpful" for his re-election prospects.
But he said that because of Mr. Buchanan's conservative challenge, "maybe I'm a little stronger" and a "better candidate for the fall."
"I've no hard feelings," Mr. Bush said.

HEADLINE: THE EARTH SUMMIT;
$5 BILLION SOUGHT FOR POOR NATIONS

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, June 4

 BODY:
The World Bank has proposed that the United States and other aid-giving countries contribute $5 billion to a fund that would provide virtually free grants to help the world's poorest countries protect their ecological systems, officials disclosed here today.
The plan is being pressed by the World Bank president, Lewis T. Preston, who wrote to the donor countries last week explaining his plan to add a $5 billion "earth increment" to a World Bank subsidiary known as the International Development Agency when its funds are replenished next year. 
 Mr. Preston made his plan public today when he addressed delegates attending the Earth Summit.
Officials say the United States, which contributes 22 percent of the development agency's funds, has said it will consider the plan, and other donors appear to be supportive.
 
Reserved for the Poorest
 The World Bank proposal is one of several schemes under debate for raising the estimated $70 billion in new aid that developing countries say they will need annually to pay for an ambitious global environmental cleanup plan known as Agenda 21, which is expected to be approved at the Earth Summit.
Without a substantial increase in aid, the third world says it cannot afford to continue its development in ways that will safeguard the environment.
Officials say the World Bank fund would be earmarked for projects designed to protect the environment in countries with annual per capita incomes of up to $740.
If donor countries agree to finance the proposal, Mr. Preston told the Earth Summit today, the World Bank will contribute a "substantial" portion of its annual profit of about $1.5 billion, instead of using this money to subsidize loans to developing countries that are more financially stable.
 
Diplomatic Tug of War
 Currently, about 70 countries are poor enough to qualify for development agency loans, which are intended to help countries who are excluded from the commercial loan market and who cannot even afford the World Bank's normal lending terms. Money borrowed from the development agency is repayable over 35 to 40 years and carries a nominal interest rate that is usually suspended for the first 10 years.
Rich and poor countries are locked in a diplomatic struggle here over other ways of raising the additional aid the third world demands as its price for cooperating with Agenda 21 and the new conventions being considered at the summit meeting on stabilizing the climate and protecting the world's biological diversity.
Originally the developing countries wanted all the additional environmental aid channeled through a Green Fund under their control which would make loans with no strings attached.
But donor countries were united in opposing this. Instead, they are offering an expansion of the World Bank's Global Environment Facility, set up two years ago to back environmental projects in the third world, together with reforms designed to give recipients a greater say in how it operates.
 
Wariness of World Bank
 "There is a consensus emerging among donors in favor of doubling or even tripling the G.E.F. from its present level of $1.3 billion when it comes up for renewal next year," Mohammed al-Ashry, the agency's Egyptian chairman, said in an interview.
But developing countries are wary of the World Bank, which is effectively controlled by the donor countries. The compromise being offered is to create a new assembly that would set broad policy guidelines by consensus. Both wealthy and developing coutries represented would have veto power, but specific loan proposals would still require World Bank approval.
The third world countries have agreed that the Global Environment Facility should primarily finance projects designed to prevent global warming, protect endangered species, clean up international waterways and fight depletion of the ozone layer.
To find the bulk of the extra $70 billion, the developing countries are pressing donors to make good by the end of the century on their longstanding commitment to contribute up to 0.7 per cent of their total economic output in development aid.
Currently, rich northern countries are giving about 0.45 percent of their wealth in aid, which amounts to some $55 billion a year. Raising this contribution to 0.7 percent would bring the total close to what the developing world needs to pay for the Agenda 21 plan.
But the United States, which currently gives about 0.21 percent of its wealth in foreign aid, has always refused to accept the 0.7 percent target.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Says New Budget Fails to Cut Spending

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former and future Republican candidate for mayor of New York City, yesterday criticized the $29.5 billion budget approved this week by the City Council and Mayor David N. Dinkins, saying it failed to reduce city spending.
Mr. Giuliani contended that the Mayor and Council had missed an opportunity to trim significantly the size of city government. He said he would have frozen city spending at current levels and would have reduced the size of the work force of more than 200,000 municipal employees by 10 percent over the next year through attrition. 
 "The real problem with this budget is that it doesn't address any of the fundamental problems that make New York one of the largest spending engines in the United States," Mr. Giuliani said at a news conference on the steps of City Hall.
The Republican candidate, a former United States Attorney who lost to Mr. Dinkins in a close race in 1989, said the city would spend $800 million more in the fiscal year beginning on July 1 than it did in the current year. He said he would have given that money back to taxpayers, either by eliminating or significantly reducing one of several city taxes.
Mayoral aides said in response that Mr. Giuliani was misinformed in his comparison between spending this year and next and that he seemed to be unaware of their efforts to trim the size of local government.
The budget for the current fiscal year, when adopted last June, called for the city to spend $28.7 billion. The budget adopted for the coming year calls for $29.5 billion to be spent. City budget officials said, however, that because of changes in the current year, including revenues from several taxes that have been higher than anticipated, the city would end up spending about $29.5 billion this year.
Norman Steisel, the First Deputy Mayor, said that when inflation was taken into account the city would actually spend less next year than this year.

HEADLINE: Fare War Is Coming To an End

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
After a tumultuous 10-day run, the curtain rings down at midnight tonight on the airline industry's smash hit -- the crowd-pleasing half-price ticket sale. But those who have waited until now to book flights are likely to find a sold-out sign.
By yesterday morning American Airlines had sold its entire summer's allotment of sale seats, except on some flights that depart on Tuesdays or Wednesdays, and other carriers were equally overwhelmed by a demand that far exceeded industry expectations. 
 Delta Air Lines, for example, said it had sold more than five million half-priced seats by yesterday morning. And Richard P. Friese, the publisher of Travel Agent magazine, estimated that the carriers sold more than 25 million tickets in the 10 days, totaling about $2.6 billion -- much of it new business. "Despite the low fares," he said, "the carriers could even end up making a few bucks."
 
Boost for Economy
 Including consumer outlays for hotels, car rentals, attractions and restaurants, Mr. Friese estimated, the fare sale will bring an additional $15 billion into the nation's economy. And one airline official estimated that the low fares could generate 100,000 new jobs in related industries.
As if to support such optimism, Avis Inc. reported yesterday that the airlines' half-price sale had spurred rental-car reservations from Monday to Wednesday to almost 300,000 -- the highest three-day total in its 46-year history. Radisson Hotels said reservations were up 30 percent at its 200 domestic hotels compared with last year -- much of it because of the fares.
But future fare cuts will be hard to achieve because the tough tactics of airlines to gain huge cost savings from labor in the last decade will haunt the industry, according to a study of the industry's labor relations commissioned by the Transportation Department. [Page D5.]
 
Volume Could Offset Discounts
 The carriers said they would not know the full financial impact of the sale for several days, though earlier this week American Airlines said that with heavy volume the sale could prove to be revenue neutral -- that is, the high number of bookings could offset the effect of rock-bottom prices.
For example, the $200 round-trip fare between New York and San Francisco works out to less than 2.5 cents a mile -- 6 cents to 8 cents a mile below what airline officials calculate it costs to provide a seat. But while more than 50 percent of the carriers' seats were included in the sale, airline officials said they hoped the average price-per-mile would rise because of higher fares for first-class and unrestricted-coach tickets.
The demand for tickets continued so strong yesterday that several carriers, including United and Delta, extended until Sunday the period in which customers must pick up the tickets they had booked by telephone. Previously they were required to do so within 24 hours. But the other stipulations remain in effect: Tickets, good for flights within the 48 contiguous states, must be booked at least seven days in advance and must include a Saturday stayover; travel must be completed no later than Sept. 13.
 
New Northwest Plan
 On Wednesday, Northwest Airlines added what it said was a new fare level 25 percent lower than the carrier's normal lowest excursion fare. Northwest said the fare, effective until midnight tonight, was created to accommodate passengers in markets where most or all of the half-price seats were no longer available on particular routes. Under Northwest's new fare, for example, a New York-San Francisco ticket is $300, compared with $200 for a half-price ticket. Competitors, who would not speak for the record, categorized the new fare level as a thinly veiled price increase, which Northwest denied.
While some beleaguered airline employees said they could not wait for the end of the sale, with workweeks that have averaged at least 60 hours, they told of equally Herculean efforts by customers intent on booking half-price tickets.
In Fort Lauderdale, Fla., a group of elderly people camped out at the Delta ticket office with lawn chairs and coolers. After a Delta ticket office in an Atlanta shopping mall closed at 9 one recent night, 60 customers continued to wait patiently while agents waited on them. At midday yesterday, a long line of customers on the sidewalk outside American's ticket office in Rockefeller Center, apparently hoping to avail themselves of the carrier's limited remaining selection, wiled away the time reading newspapers and paperbacks.
Reservations agents even reported finding callers on hold who were fast asleep by the time a reservations agent became available. When an American reservations agent eventually answered one call, the caller was snoring so deeply that he failed to respond to the agent's efforts to wake him long distance. Thus, that passenger, in the words of an American spokesman, "slept through his vacation."
Several carriers said that the combination of low fares and guaranteed seats prompted even many of their employees, who are often eligible to fly free or for a nominal price on a space-available basis, to buy sale tickets.
The carriers vow "never again" when asked about the possibility of future half-price sales. They are likely to adhere to that vow for the summer, when many planes will be packed. But travel industry executives -- remembering what happened in the past with the best laid plans of the nation's airlines -- are taking a wait-and-see attitude.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
Excerpts From President's News Conference at White House

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 4

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Bush's news conference tonight at the White House. 

 
OPENING STATEMENT
Well, I have a brief statement and then I'll be glad to take questions. Two months ago I asked the Congress to cut almost $8 billion in wasteful spending projects, and tonight I've just signed the cuts that Congress sent to me in response. It's not all that I asked for, but it's a good start. Eight billion dollars sounds like a lot of money, and it is. But the facts remain it isn't good enough, not by a long shot. The American people know budget deficits threaten the long-term economic health of our country, and over the years we've accumulated Federal debt totaling $65,000 for every family of four in America. This debt does not create more wealth; it merely helps pay for our current consumption.
And it reminds me of the old fellow who bragged to his family that he had finally borrowed enough money to pay off his debts.
Our political system, as it is now, has failed to meet its responsibility to address this problem. And in the face of a several hundred billion-dollar deficit, a piecemeal approach simply will not do the job. We need a constitutional amendment to balance the Federal budget, and we need it now.
Three years ago, in my first address to the Congress, I asked the Senate and the House to pass such an amendment, and every year since then I have repeated a call. Like President Reagan before me, I've tried to get Congress to act responsibly and to restrain the growth of Federal spending. We've tried compromise, we've tried confrontation, we've tried quiet diplomacy with the Congressional leaders. And none of this has been enough.
And tonight I am more convinced than ever that a balanced budget amendment is the only way to force the Federal Government, both the Congress and the executive branch, to live within its means.
 
'Affect Every Other Decision'
 This month both houses of Congress will vote on a balanced budget amendment. It is impossible to underestimate the importance of this one decision. It will affect every other decision that the Government makes from that moment on and it will bear directly on the quality of life that we leave the generations who follow us.
Victory will not come easily. The amendment requires a two-thirds majority from both the Senate and the House. And I'm pleased to say that many serious-minded members, Republicans and Democrats alike, support this measure. They understand that this is not a partisan fight. It goes far beyond election-year politics. It is a fight for the economic security of the American people.
I realize that some in Washington consider a balanced budget amendment a rather radical step. Well, I strongly doubt that the American people consider a balanced budget amendment as radical. It's common sense, pure and simple. Each month millions of American families sit down to balance their checkbooks. Forty-four states -- 44 states have their own constitutional balanced budget requirements. And the Federal Government must now do the same.
The moment is at hand. In the coming days we will face an extraordinary choice. We can choose either to accept the status quo, piling debt upon debt, or we can strike a bold new course, restoring fiscal sanity to the Federal Government. And if we choose wrong, if we choose wrongly, our grandchildren and their grandchildren are going to bear the burden.
I refuse to believe that we will make them pay the price for Washington's irresponsibility, and for their sake I urge every Congressman and every senator to join me in supporting the swift approval of a balanced budget amendment.
Now I will be glad to respond to questions.Terry, I think you have the first.
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 Q. Mr. President, I'd like to ask you about Ross Perot. He complains that you're hiding and you're afraid to take him on directly. Will you commit yourself to debating Mr. Perot as well as Bill Clinton in the fall campaign?
A. I'm sure there will be debates and I will be ready to join the fray after the conventions, but as you know, I have not challenged directly either Perot or Clinton, Mr. Perot or Governor Clinton. I have no intention of changing that before the convention.
I am trying to get things done that will help this country. The balanced budget amendment is a good example of that. And if I get too caught up in the political wars at this time, it will be even more difficult to get things through the Congress that will help -- a crime bill, an education bill, balanced budget amendment -- things that we really need.
And so I'm going to keep on this course that I've been on. I've been faithful to it during the primary season and I will continue to be until I make a decision to change. . . . Q. But I mean in the fall campaign, I'm not talking about immediately, right now, but will you commit yourself to debating the two --
A. There will be debates.
 
On Ross Perot
 Q. Mr. President, granting the legality, is it proper for a man, for a candidate with vast personal wealth and no spending limits to use that to attain the Presidency? And since you've known Mr. Perot for so long, is he an insider, an outsider? Is he a man of principles --
A. Helen.
Q. -- or does he go for the (inaudible)?
A. I'd love to answer that question --
Q. Why won't you?
A. Because I've vowed to keep my sights set on these legislative goals and on leading this country, and if I get into characterizing one opponent or another, I diminish my effectiveness in doing that. We've got a good chance now, and some of it's brought about by the primaries, I think, to pass this balanced budget amendment, for example. I'm a little disappointed that our education reform bill is languishing up there. I'd like to see us get a good energy bill soon. But if I start concentrating on the politics, I'm afraid I will waste an opportunity.
I think we're in a real opportunity situation now.
Q. Well, do you think he's trying to buy the Presidency?
A. Well, so far not. We'll wait and see...
 
Message From Voters
 Q. Mr. President, you've often said that you've not done so terrific a job of getting your message across. Tonight, you changed the venue. But I wanted to ask you if, indeed, what you've seen in the polls of the constant one-third or more of the electorate that's going other ways isn't a rejection of that message in and of itself?
A. I don't think so because you ask in these deadly polls that you read all the time, you know, about -- relating to issues. And it's vague out there.
We've got a good program, and tonight maybe this is a more effective way to say we want a balanced budget amendment. We've got a good program on the Hill to achieve a balanced budget amendment -- or after the balanced budget amendment is passed, to achieve a balanced budget.
And so I -- I think we just gotta keep hammering away on the issues because I believe the American people are with me. If they understand our total reform of education, they'll support it. Most Americans want a tougher crime bill. I heard people out on the West Coast who don't vote for tougher crime legislation all advertising in those 90-second bites they paid for, ads, how tough they are on crime. Maybe we've got a better chance now to pass an Administration crime bill.
So I'm going to keep focusing on those issues. And hopefully the American people will say he has a sound program for domestic affairs, just as he does in foreign relations.
Q. If I could follow up, sir, hasn't the pattern through the primaries been such that the American people have been constantly looking for an alternative?
A. Yes.
 
Problems With Economy
 Q. You may have put Pat Buchanan behind, but now you've got Ross Perot. Is he the inheritor of that?
A. No. Well, I don't think so. Tell you what. I think most people would concede that my problems stem from this sluggish, anemic economy. I think you can trace those problems to getting bigger with that.
Now I think the economy is improving. We still have some big problems there. For a person that's out of work, for him that unemployment is 100 percent. For a woman that can't get a job that wants one, for her, unemployment is 100 percent. So we've got to pushing ahead. And I make the appeal right now for our growth incentives to further stimulate an economy that is beginning to move, and is beginning to move positively.
But, no, I think it's -- I think my fortunes have been related to that, and I think, if I'll take the blame -- some of which I'll take -- is the economy has been sick. I assume the people are fair to get credit when there's recovery. Yeah?
 
More on Perot
 Q. Mr. President, your spokesman today described Mr. Perot as a man whose entire history is to stomp into the group, demand to do things his way, and if he doesn't get it to pick up his football and go home. The Vice President the other day questioned his judgment, saying he had been wrong on your most important decision of the presidency, the Persian Gulf war. Do you share their assessments?
A. I'm glad that they are putting their focus on these problems, but I'm not going to do it myself. I have a difference clearly, as far as the Persian Gulf war goes, no question -- and I think the American people support the actions that I took. I believe it was correct. I believe we performed well. I believe we set back aggression. I believe there was a whole new pride in this country. The international community supported it overwhelmingly.
So as people point these things out, that's fair. And as his supporters point out what they think might be foibles in me, that's fair, too. But I'm going to stay on the path that I've outlined.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Conference in Rio
 Q. Mr. President, if the experience of your E.P.A. chief in Rio to date is any indication, there's quite a reception committee of harsh critics of this Administration and of you, sir, waiting for you down there. Under the circumstances, if that's what the reception is going to be in Rio, why go?
A. Well, because we've got a sound and sensible environmental record and we have a strong role of international leadership. I wonder if the American taxpayer knows that we have spent something like $800 billion in the last 10 years on cleaning up things -- the atmosphere, the environment, in many, many ways. It is estimated that it will be $1.2 trillion spent by the United States taxpayers and businesses over the next 10 years.
We have a superb record to take to that convention. I am not going to go down there and forget about people that need jobs in the United States of America...
 But because I will not sign a treaty that in my view throws too many Americans out of work, I refuse to accept that kind of criticism from what I consider some of the extremes in the environmental movement, internationally or domestically.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
As the Economy Improves
 Q. Mr. President, you say your problems in the primaries have been caused largely by the anemic economy. Yet the economy is improving and the voters seem to be walking away from you in droves, sir.
Don't you take it personally? And what are you going to do about it?
A. I don't -- I don't take it personally. And as a guy who never looks at polls, as you know, I would like to cite a poll figure for you.
Seventy percent of the people in the most recent poll I saw that was done for our campaign said that they thought the economy was getting worse. And the economy is moving. There are still some problems, as I say. When a person is hurting for a job, that worries me. But gross domestic product, G.N.P., is moving; industrial production is up; payroll employment is up. And another thing that's up and soon will be picked up in these broad polls is that Michigan survey on business confidence. So things are turning around, and yet at this juncture, the American people haven't felt it. When they do, I think you'll -- I expect to see some change.
But, no, I don't take it personally at all. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Yugoslavia
 Q. Sir, you say that you have a strong international leadership role, but the new world order that you are promoting is being challenged in Yugoslavia these days. It appears that the sanctions are not working against Serbia.
When are you going to take the lead of an international coalition to force Milosevic out of Bosnia the way you did with Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait?
A. I think the sanctions -- I'm not prepared to give up on the sanctions at all. They've only been in effect for a few days. And as you know, first on this question of Yugoslavia, out in front, was the United Nations. You had -- Cyrus Vance as a representative of the United Nations did a superb job trying to negotiate, ably implemented -- supplemented, I might say, by Peter Carrington. They tried to work that problem, had our full support.
The E.C., which is right there in the neighborhood, tried to have an effective role. It now appears that a U.S. role, catalytic role, is important, and thus we are moving forward. Secretary Baker made a very strong statement on this recently. He has worked closely with the leaders of Europe, and so we are united in this sanctions question, and let's see if it works.
But I'm not prepared to say these sanctions will not work.
Q. Is the fact that the elections are approaching in the U.S. preventing a military action?
A. I think prudence and caution prevents military actions. If I decide to change my mind on that, I will do it in an inclusive way, but at this juncture, I want to stay with these sanctions.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
On Patrick Buchanan
 Q. Mr. President, in the interest of party unity and since he has indicated that he is going to endorse you at the Houston convention, would you like Pat Buchanan to have the prime-time speech that he wants to have at the Republican convention in August?
A. Susan, I'll be honest with you. I haven't focused on that at all. I welcome the support of all Republicans. And let's see how he handles this and let the people handling the convention work it out. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
U.S. Policies on Iraq
 Q. Mr. President, critics of yours on Capitol Hill have said your policies toward Saddam Hussein before the Gulf war strengthened him and made him more likely to make an attack against one of his neighbors. How do you respond to that? I've got a follow-up.
A. I respond that that's not right. As I said at my last press conference, we tried, not through strengthening his nuclear or biological or chemical weapons, as has been alleged, not by giving him part of Kuwait, as has been alleged. But we tried to work with him on grain credits and things of this nature to avoid aggressive action. And it failed. It failed.
That approach, holding out a hand, trying to get him to renounce terrorism and join the family of nations, didn't work. And the minute he moved aggressively, we moved aggressively and set back aggression.
You got a lot of people that opposed what happened in the war, stood there and didn't want to move, that are now trying to revise history. And so I am not persuaded by the critics at all. I know what we did. There wasn't anything illegal. We tried hard and I've said so, and it didn't work. But we were not going to let aggression stand. And when he moved into Kuwait, I decided this will not stand and it didn't.
Yeah, what's the follow-up?
Q. To follow up, the House Judiciary Committee looks like they're going to recommend special prosecutors and counsel to investigate it, and ask the Attorney General --
A. I wonder whether they're going to use the same prosecutors that are trying out there to see whether I was in Paris in 1980 and flew home in an SR-71 Blackbird.
I mean, where are we going with the taxpayers' money in this political year?
So, let them look at it. It's no problem to me. But I think at some point somebody ought to say where is all this money going that goes to pay for these special prosecutors, rummaging through files and proving nothing. I was not in Paris, and we did nothing illegal or wrong here. We tried, and it didn't work, and we moved. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Two-Party System
 Q. Mr. President, you've spent much of your life as part of the two-party system. You've headed one of the major parties.
In this unusual political year, how do you assess the viability of the two-party system in the future, and why would any candidate submit himself to grueling primaries if he could just announce and run?
A. I think the two-party system has really given us the most stable political system in the world. And, yes, we're going through an unusual period. But the two-party system has provided us fantastic historical stability. And you look around the world and compare this system with any other democratic system, and I think that would avail.
I'm sure the Brits take great pride in their parliamentary system. But I think our two-party system has provided us with the stability that heretofore we've simply taken for granted.
So my view, as this campaign unfolds, as all of us spell out our position on the issues, people are going to recognize that, and the two parties will be strong when this election is over.
Q. And the question of why any candidate would expose himself to the primaries.
A. That's what Barbara was asking me a few minutes ago.
Q. What's your answer?
A. Say, hey, I want to continue this job to help this country; I want to help preserve world peace and strengthen it -- and we've done pretty well there. And I want to move forward on these issues that we're talking about here tonight -- the balanced budget amendment -- I won't repeat them all. But it's worth finishing the job. Nobody likes the primary process. I had a call from a senator kind of asking how I was holding up, because he said, hey, you've been criticized a little in the newspapers and on the television; and I said, hey, that goes with the job. I'll do my best and I think things are going to turn around in that regard.
But to get out of the arena, to suggest that you're going to run because it's not particularly pleasant -- that's not the way I operate. . . .
 
On Abortion
 Q. Mr. President, there are many polls that now show that -- in California and elsewhere -- that most Republicans favor a pro-choice position on abortion. And I wonder, in view of that, and in view of the clear feeling of pro-choice in the party, that you feel the platform needs to be changed, and what your own view is on the whole notion of whether the abortion debate is going to be prominent in the fall.
A. Well, no, I hope the platform committee, in their wisdom, adopts the same language as we had before. Having said that, there is room in our party for people that have different views on this issue. I'm not persuaded that people all across this country vote on only one issue -- abortion. I think they're interested in world peace. I think they're interested in education. I think they happen to be very supportive of a balanced budget amendment.
And so my position is well-known, and I'm going to stay with it. But, as I say, we've got many good Republicans who disagree with me on that issue, and they may disagree with me on the balanced budget amendment or some of these other things I feel very passionately about. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Clarence Thomas
 Q. Mr. President, you said that your problems stem from the economy.
In addition, are some of your problems also related to the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill hearings?
A. None. We forget. Now we see a revision. We forget that the American people overwhelmingly supported Clarence Thomas. He is being a good Justice. And the fact that some candidates are out there trying to revise that part of history, I'm sorry -- I don't agree with that.
There may be some -- now I can't say some people don't agree -- that, you know, everyone agrees with what I said. I support Clarence Thomas. I think he'll be an outstanding Justice. He passed a Senate that is controlled by the opposition party. He conducted himself with honor in those hearings. And that's my position. And I'm proud to have stayed with him when the going got tough. . . .
 
Leadership
 Q.: Mr. President, you say that the leadership qualities that are going to come out later are not in focus right now. But it would seem that leadership is the focus, that Ross -- that's the only thing that Ross Perot has been running on, is leadership. He has not addressed the issues. You are addressing the issues.
How do you feel? What do you say to Republicans who are going over and supporting him about your personal leadership quality?
A. I say take a look at what happened in Desert Storm where I didn't have to get anybody else's action. I moved. I saw a threat. I did what was required, and I didn't have to get a Congress controlled by the opposition party to move. The people saw leadership and action there.
The people know that the House of Representatives and the Senate control all the legislation: my crime bill, my balanced budget quest, whatever it is -- they control it all. And so I think when this campaign gets really rolling -- and it hasn't started, from our standpoint -- when that happens, I think these things will be in focus. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
After the Election
 Q. Mr. President, aren't we into a no-win situation here, because even if you do win, even if you do defeat Ross Perot, there are going to be a lot of Republicans out there who supported him, and there is going to be a lot of reprisal and revenge?
A. There will no reprisals. Look, Helen says we're through here -- but let me tell you something: you're dealing in a little cocoon here. We're talking about something big: faith and confidence in the American people. And this isn't done because there's something on the horizon right now, and people are going to -- you know, let 'em decide, let 'em sort out this. And I can understand that appeal: I'm from outside, I'll solve all the problems.
And then some day you guys are going to start: How are you going to do it, how are you going to get this through the Congress, what do you believe -- do you think the President is right on a balanced budget amendment, are you with him or against him, do you think he's right as he tries to tighten down on crime legislation, how do you feel on the narcotic problem, how do you feel on world peace, were you with him when he had to make a very tough call on sending back aggression, a move that was saluted all over the entire world and put this country together like it's never been together in the past since World War II.
And, you see, I think we're dealing in a funny time here, time warp. And I think come fall, when we're out there taking our case to the people, with an improved economy behind us, I still feel confident about the outcome of the political election. And I feel confident about ability to heal any wounds that may have been opened along the way.

HEADLINE: S.E.C.'s View On Big Salaries

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 4

 BODY:
The chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission urged Congress today to reject legislation that would restrict the corporate tax benefits of large executive salaries.
Amid shareholder outrage over multimillion-dollar payouts to many executives, both the House and Senate are considering proposals to limit the deductibility on corporate income taxes for large salaries and benefits. 
 But testifying before a Senate Finance subcommittee today, Richard C. Breeden, chairman of the S.E.C., said there was no need to change the tax code because excessive salaries would probably be curtailed once the commission adopted its own rules to require more detailed disclosure of top salaries and bonuses.
"Market forces, not governmental dictates, should decide what is best," he said.
The House bill extending unemployment insurance benefits includes a provision that would limit the deduction for executive compensation to $1 million per executive. A similar measure is expected to be considered by the Senate Finance Committee.
Democrats in the House and Senate who support the proposals say they want to limit a taxpayer subsidy of excessive paychecks.
The legislation is opposed by the Bush Administration.

HEADLINE: U.S. Suggests It Might Give Trenton Medicaid Funds, but Bond Raters Are Wary

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 4

 BODY:
New Jersey received some good fiscal news today with word that it still had a shot at obtaining most of the $450 million in Medicaid payments it thought it had been denied.
But any celebrations were tempered by the news that Standard & Poor's, the bond rating firm, had placed the state on its credit watch, a move that could jeopardize its AA+ bond rating, the firm's second-highest ranking, and cost the state millions in interest charges. 
 The Standard & Poor's announcement came near the end of a day of pandemonium over the state budget that involved Gov. Jim Florio, State Treasurer Samuel F. Crane, the Republican-controlled Legislature and the White House.
On Tuesday, Mr. Crane announced a new $450 million hole in the state budget caused by what he said was the Federal Government's denial of New Jersey's request for retroactive Medicaid payments for psychiatric hospitals dating to 1989. Together with a $608 million shortfall created two weeks ago when the Legislature rolled back the sales tax to 6 percent from 7 percent, that put the budget for the 1993 fiscal year, which begins in 27 days, $1 billion in the red.
 
G.O.P. Blames Democrats
 Republicans attributed the loss of the Medicaid funds to Democratic bumbling, and the Republicans in the White House today seemed to back them up. Democrats, however, called the Federal denial a technicality.
"There are regulatory requirements that the Florio administration did not meet that resulted in the recent decision by the Health Care Financing Administration to disallow part of the reimbursement claim," the White House Chief of Staff, Samuel K. Skinner, said in a letter to Assembly Speaker Garabed Haytaian. "This initial decision resulted in a final notice of disallowance for $74 million. There remains $412 million in disproportionate share claims that have yet to be resolved."
Mr. Skinner concluded by said he expected a "final resolution" on the remaining amount within a week.
Mr. Crane said that $450 million was at issue, while Mr. Skinner's letter put the total at $486 million.
 
Florio Is 'Flattered'
 "Both are estimates," said Richard McGrath, Mr. Crane's spokesman. "It's not unusual in this sort of Medicaid funding to have different numbers. It depends on the tabulations and cutoff dates you use."
Mr. Florio said he was "flattered by the personal attention of the White House during a time when it has so many important things to be concerned about."
But he said he stood by his administration's interpretation of events and distributed a letter from the regional administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, the Federal agency that ruled on the Medicaid funds, that appeared to indicate that New Jersey would receive no money for any period before Dec. 28, 1991.
"The people of New Jersey are not concerned about semantics, but only about receiving from Washington that which we are due," Mr. Florio said.
"Hopefully, the next communication from the White House will be, 'The check's in the mail.' "
 
Income-Tax Shortfall, Too
 The state constitution requires that New Jersey begin and end its fiscal year with a balanced budget. That has been complicated not only by the sales-tax rollback and the confusion over Medicaid reimbursement, but also by a $652 million shortfall that Mr. Crane attributed to lower-than-expected income-tax revenue.
Mr. Crane submitted a plan to cover the $652 million gap, but he said the $1 billion shortfall in the 1993 budget was the responsibility of the Republicans, who control both houses of the Legislature. Weeks before the current problems, the Republicans promised to cut $1 billion from Mr. Florio's $15.7 billion budget for 1993, but they have yet to present their alternative budget.
Standard & Poor's cited the spate of bad news in announcing its decision to put New Jersey on its credit watch. The action affects $4.7 billion in bond debt.
"I am not surprised at the official expression of concern about the state's fiscal status by Standard & Poor's," said Mr. Crane. "It is obvious that Wall Street shares the same apprehension and uncertainty that the people of New Jersey have about the absence of a budget plan."
 
Shortfall Is Doubted
 Senator Robert Littell, Republican chairman of the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee, urged Standard & Poor's to withhold any action on the bond rating until it could verify some of its information.
"It seems to me that Standard & Poor's based its decision on nothing more than a shortfall manufactured by the Florio administration," Mr. Littell said.
Amid the flurry of activity over the budget, the Senate unanimously approved a bill that would use $200 million as seed money for nearly $1 billion in building projects and to create nearly 100,000 jobs.
Under the so-called Economic Recovery Fund Act, New Jersey will use $200 million in revenues from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for projects like improvements to the Atlantic City airport and building a performing arts center in downtown Newark.
Senator William L. Gormley, the bill's Republican sponsor, said it would add $800 million to the state's economy and help create 20,000 construction jobs and 75,000 permanent jobs in the next three years.

HEADLINE: May Sales Up a Bit at Most Retailers

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Sales in most of the nation's retail chain stores crept up last month, continuing the sluggish growth that began with a bang in January but has wound down ever since.
J. C. Penney & Company and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. continued to confound the trend, posting strong sales increases. But apparel-specialty store companies, like the Limited Inc. and Ann Taylor Inc., lost sales because of unusually cold, rainy weather across most of the country. 
 Most other companies had improvements of one or two percentage points in their sales last month. Analysts said even though the month over all was disappointing, they still saw glimmers of a recovery lurking in the reported sales numbers.
 
Salomon Index Up 4.2%
 The Salomon Brothers retailing index, which tracks the sales of several leading retailers, rose 4.2 percent in May. "The underpinnings for an improved retail sales and earnings picture for the year are becoming more evident," said Jeffrey M. Feiner, a Salomon retail analyst.
The analysts are now looking toward the back-to-school selling season in August, when they expect a slight surge in sales that is expected to continue until Christmas.
"They have really got some momentum now," said Walter F. Loeb, the principal of Loeb Associates Inc., a retail consulting firm. "If you look at all the numbers, while a few are down, you still see spotty improvement in consumer spending."
 
A Warmer May 1991
 Mr. Loeb said bad weather dampened sales, which benefited in the previous year's period from unusually warm weather. In May 1991, temperatures on average were 2 degrees higher than normal, while last month they were 4 degrees colder.
The Kmart Corporation, based in Troy, Mich., said the weather had hurt sales of apparel and gardening implements in its discount stores. Sales in Kmart's discount stores open at least a year dropped by two-tenths of a percent in May, while the comparable-store sales at Kmart's specialty stores, like Payless Drug Stores and Waldenbooks, grew by 7.8 percent.
Over all, Kmart's May sales increased by 6.5 percent, to $2.92 billion, from $2.74 billion in the corresponding period last year.
 
Sears Also Cites Weather
 Cold weather was also blamed for lackluster sales of lawn and garden equipment, air-conditioners and some clothing at Sears, Roebuck & Company. Sears posted a 1.1 percent increase in overall sales, to $1.71 billion. Sales at the company's comparable stores, or those open at least a year, were up by three-tenths of a percent.
But Sears, which is based in Chicago, said it saw some strength in the economy based on strong sales of durable goods, like large appliances, home-office equipment and furniture.
Analysts and investors track a retailer's sales from the company's comparable- or same-store figures. Those figures provide a more accurate assessment of a retailer's performance than the company's statistics on overall sales. New stores typically have strong initial sales that can distort a company's results.
 
Woolworth's Decline
 The Woolworth Corporation, based in New York, also attributed the six-tenths of a percent decline in its same-store sales to poor weather. Over all, the retailer's May sales, dropped slightly, to $688 million from $692 million.
But the weather did not faze Wal-Mart, which sold $4.44 billion in goods during May, a 27.2 percent increase over last year. The sales in Wal-Mart stores open at least one year grew by 12 percent.
Retailers with a strong presence in California, where the recession started later and has lasted longer, said they saw evidence of a rebound in the economy there, as well as in their own May sales figures.
The Dayton Hudson Corporation, whose Target and Mervyn's divisions have large presences in California, said sales in its stores open at least a year grew by 5.5 percent, while overall sales increased by 14.1 percent. Even its Dayton's, Hudson's and Marshall Field's department stores, which like other luxury department store chains had a difficult time increasing sales during the recession, showed a 2 percent gain in comparable-store sales.
 
Penney's Streak Continues
 At Penney, its department stores reported a 8.8 percent increase in sales in stores open at least a year, the third straight month that Penney has outpaced the industry. William R. Howell, the retailer's chairman, attributed the growth to strong sales of children's apparel and women's sportswear and dresses.
The Gap Inc., which routinely posted double-digit comparable store sales figures last year, said its May same-store sales rose 3 percent. While Gap's overall sales increased nearly 16 percent, to $191 million, from $165 million in the corresponding period last year, the retailer said those sales came at the expense of its gross margins.
Sales of the Limited Inc. in Columbus, Ohio, which operates Limited stores, Express and Victoria's Secret among other specialty-store chains, climbed by 11 percent, to $489.2 million, in May. Its sales totaled $439.8 million in the 1991 period. The company's comparable-store sales grew by 1 percent.

HEADLINE: Dinkins's New Economic Chief Finding Life in the Spotlight a Bit Unsettling

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, June 4

 BODY:
Barry F. Sullivan, the former high-powered banker who was appointed New York City's top economic development official five weeks ago, gave a news photographer here an uncomfortable frozen smile today as he demonstrated a French-made public toilet that New York City is considering leasing.
"I can see the headlines you're writing now," Mr. Sullivan said under his breath to reporters. "Well, I've done my part." 
 Being photographed inside a public toilet is emblematic of the many changes in Mr. Sullivan's professional life since he retired last fall as the head of First Chicago Bank and accepted Mayor David N. Dinkins's offer to become his Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development.
In his first significant act in his new post, Mr. Sullivan has escorted Mr. Dinkins through business meetings in London and Paris in the last four days. The trip was organized by the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry. By persuading Mr. Dinkins to lead a delegation of business leaders, Mr. Sullivan has emerged as the administration's main connection to New York's business establishment.
 
Big Switch in Roles
 When he took office in March, Mr. Sullivan, 61 years old and a Bronx native, exchanged the powerful but largely private job of running the United States' 10th-largest bank for the intensely public role of selling New York to investors and persuading failing businesses to remain in a city reeling from the effects of the recession and Federal budget cuts.
Mr. Sullivan says he is trying to adjust to life in the spotlight. Because decisions usually require a political consensus, they take longer than they did in the private sector, he said, and for the first time in his life, how his actions play in the news media counts almost as much as their results.
"The press is far more important in the political arena than I would have thought it was," Mr. Sullivan said in an interview in his Paris hotel room today. "It's tough. It is something that doesn't come naturally to me as it does to the Mayor. I can watch the Mayor think in media terms. And that is not my first instinct. I'm learning to do that."
His appointment was widely interpreted as a sign that Mr. Dinkins wanted to patch up his relationship with the city's business leaders, who have complained bitterly that the administration has not done enough to help business.
His first move was to make peace between the Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Mr. Dinkins, who had to responded to an invitation to lead the delegation to Europe. Mr. Dinkins, bitter about criticism from some prominent Chamber members over his handling of the city's budget negotiations, was planning his own trade mission to Germany.
"I came in and said why don't we see if we can do these two things together, which is exactly what we did," Mr. Sullivan said.
Since Sunday, the Mayor and more than a dozen New York executives have held seminars and meetings with scores of European businesses here and in London. The Mayor has tried to sell New York as a comeback city with a soft commercial real-estate market and declining crime.
 
'Seriously Successful'
 Several delegation members said Mr. Sullivan had played a criticial role in arranging meetings with chief executive officers, especially bankers at National Westminister Bank and Credit Local de France interested in doing business with the city.
"Barry is a seriously successful capitalist," said one member of the Mayor's delegation who insisted on anonymity. "These executives know it when he walks in the door."
Daniel Gronich, a New York real-estate executive, said Mr. Sullivan's appointment had convinced him and other business leaders that Mr. Dinkins was finally serious about economic development.
"This guy was chairman of a money-center bank," Mr. Gronich said. "That broke the ice. The business community said to the Mayor, 'O.K., let's work together.' "
 
Foreign Investment Is Goal
 In the interview, Mr. Sullivan stressed that his general plans for revitalizing the city's economy depended upon attracting foreign investment from service industries already linked to New York's economy, like entertainment, financial services and fashion. But he said he also intended to develop programs to help subsidize biochemical and other high-tech companies and to encourage small businesses to expand.
He conceded that many of his plans were sketchy. "I'm comfortable," he said. "I'm only in the job for five months."
A major difficulty New York faces, he said, is the dearth of cheap labor.
Another significant obstacle to developing new businesses and retaining old ones, he said, is the city bureaucracy itself.
A large corporation that deals with New York, he said, "may deal with seven, eight or nine agencies." Many times, he said, none of the agencies are aware the company is dealing with the others.
In contrast, Mr. Sullivan thinks of the businesses as the city's customers and insists that the government must become "more customer friendly."
Most foreign executives Mr. Sullivan has met on the trip think the United States is coming out of its recession faster than Britain or France, he said, and are eager to invest in New York.
Still, he said, he and Mr. Dinkins have had to fight New York's image as a crime-ridden, deteriorating metropolis with high taxes.
"Where they have an issue, it tends to be the quality of life," Mr. Sullivan said. "They say, 'We want to hear you talk about safety.' "

HEADLINE: Judge Stays Rate Ruling For Hospitals

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, June 4

 BODY:
The Federal judge who struck down New Jersey's system of financing health care for indigent patients last week said today that he would suspend his action if the Governor and the Legislature agreed to deal with the issue at a special summer session.
Judge Alfred M. Wolin of Federal District Court said he recognized the "catalogue of horrors" that would result from his ruling last week, including immediate financial crises at 20 inner-city hospitals serving 900,000 people. He stayed its effect until June 12 to give Gov. Jim Florio and legislative leaders time to deliver to him a signed "statement of principles" agreeing to conduct the special session with a single focus: health care. 
 In his ruling, which was to take effect on Friday, Judge Wolin said self-insured health plans were exempt under Federal law from paying more than the actual cost of health services. The ruling absolved about 2.4 million people covered by union and company self-insurance plans from paying a 19 percent surcharge that has been added to hospital bills to finance services for the poor and to cover bad debts.
 
A Separate Appeal
 Judge Wolin issued the stay after hearing arguments by lawyers for the state, the unions that brought the suit that overturned the financing system and the New Jersey Hospital Association.
The hospital association, which represents 112 health-care institutions, had announced plans to appeal Judge Wolin's ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia by Friday's deadline, and Mr. Florio reluctantly agreed to file a separate appeal to avoid a potential hospital crisis. The Democratic Governor has been urging the Republican-led Legislature to change the system, which has added about $1.4 billion annually to 1.3 million hospital bills.
Although it was a response to a challenge to New Jersey's system, Judge Wolin's decision also could affect the way many states set hospital rates and pay for care for those who lack health insurance, Mr. Florio said.
Judge Wolin's decision to give the state time to find an alternate means of paying hospital bills for the poor was greeted warmly by Louis P. Scibetta, the president of the hospital association. "This is precisely the type of action we hoped would take place," he said.
"The hospital association will work tirelessly with the Governor, the Legislature and other interested parties to avert a situation that would otherwise spell crisis for our hospitals and the public," Mr. Scibetta said.
Mr. Florio met for 30 minutes today with the State Senate President, Donald T. DiFrancesco; the Assembly Speaker, Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian, and other legislators to discuss the health-care crisis. They later released a statement saying they were committed to finding a financing plan that was fairer to state residents and would stabilize the hospital system.
Their staffs will meet on Friday "for a lengthy work session to move this effort forward," the statement said, and the Governor and legislative leaders are to meet again on Monday. But while they noted Judge Wolin's conditions for extending his stay beyond next week, there was no promise that Mr. Florio, Mr. DiFrancesco and Mr. Haytaian would sign the requested statement of principles.
 
Legal Options
 Instead, the statement said the Attorney General's office would brief the legislative leaders on Judge Wolin's decision "and what the legal options are in light of that decision."
Albert G. Kroll, a lawyer for the union health plans that filed the successful challenge to the financing system, called Judge Wolin's decision today "a well-crafted opinion."
"He did an excellent job in identifying the problem," he said. "It lies with the Legislature, which created the problem and which has the power to come up with a solution."
Under the disputed system, the 19 percent surcharge on hospital bills goes into the Uncompensated Care Trust Fund, then is disbursed to hospitals on the basis of their indigent-patient caseload. The trust fund expired in January but was extended for six months by the Legislature and Mr. Florio to allow time to find a substitute.
Nothing has happened since, and the Legislature has passed another extension. Mr. Florio, who has not signed the bill, has insisted on some changes in the health-insurance laws, among them a requirement that commercial insurance companies insure every applicant, regardless of age or health history.
Since they filed suit a year ago, the union health plans have been withholding the 19 percent surcharge and placing the money in an escrow account in the event they eventually lose their suit and have to pay, Mr. Kroll said. The escrow account holds about $5 million that the unions say they will be able to keep as the result of Judge Wolin's ruling.


GRAPHIC: A new judicial ruling in New Jersey would exempt federally regulated insurange funds from souldering the costs of health care for the uninsured. Here is how the system now works:
Chart: "Health Care: Redistributing the Hospital Costs of the Uninsured"
 A 19 percent surcharge is added to the hospital bills of people who have insurance except those covered by Medicare.
 The money from the surcharge, more than $900 million a year, goes to the state's Uncompensated Care Trust Fund.
 The fund distributes the money to hospitals that have treated patients who do not or cannot pay their bills; the bulk of the money goes to 20 inner-city hospitals. The money also provides discounts to patients covered by New Jersey Blue Cross and Blue Shield.
 On May 27, a judge ruled that the surcharge would not have to be paid by federally regulated insurance funds administered by unions and companies. If the ruling takes effect, all the money needed for the uncompensated care fund would have to come from surcharges on the bills paid by private insurers, raising them substantially. This means 20 percent of the patients in the state would be paying for 100 percent of the costs of uncompensated care. (pg. B5)

HEADLINE: 57 Suffolk Officers Retire Over Plan for 10% Pay Cut

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON

DATELINE: HAUPPAUGE, L.I., June 4

 BODY:
A proposal to cut Suffolk County police salaries by 10 percent has led 57 officers to file for retirement this week to avoid a cut in pension benefits, the county's Police Commissioner said today.
At least 700 other officers in the 2,300-member department are eligible for retirement, having served 20 years, and could file for their pensions should the County Legislature adopt the pay cut as part of a plan to close a $90 million budget gap, the Commissioner, Robert Creighton said. 
 He said the pay cut, which would affect all county employees, could have a devastating effect on public safety if it prompts more officers to retire.
"It will certainly affect the response time of police officers," Mr. Creighton said. "People do not expect the police to take an hour or two or three to get to see them, especially if they have a serious problem."
 
$90 Million Budget Gap
 Union officials say the retiring officers are concerned that a pay cut will diminish their pension income. Retirement pay equals half the salary earned during the final year of active service, or half the average salary during the last three years on the job, whichever is higher.
Nassau County was faced with a similar problem earlier this year when scores of officers retired because they were working without a new contract and no pay increase. Since January, 180 have filed to retire in Nassau, compared with 190 for all of last year and 86 in 1990.
The base police salary of about $50,000 a year in Suffolk and Nassau is $10,000 more a year than in New York City, where union officials have historically used Nassau and Suffolk wage and benefit packages as a standard when negotiating labor contracts.
The 10 percent pay cut is one of several measures being considered by the Suffolk Legislature. The county's $1.3 billion budget has a $90 million gap because of sales-tax revenues that were lower than expected and higher costs for welfare programs primarily because of the recession.
 
Police Pledge to Fight
 The Legislature is also considering laying off 1,341 of the county's 10,000 employees, including 300 police officers, raising the sales tax half a percentage point, to 8.5 percent, and selling $90 million in deficit notes. The alternative would be additional layoffs and an increase in property taxes.
Thomas Tohill, president of the Suffolk County Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said union leaders met today and reconfirmed their commitment to fight the layoffs and salary cuts in court, if necessary.
Since January, 140 officers have retired. Mr. Tohill said that over the last six years, an average of 150 officers retired each year.
He said the 57 additional officers who filed this week did so because they were uncertain about their future income and could not take the chance of awaiting the outcome of a court battle that could go against them.
"They feel there is a lack of direction in the county leadership," Mr. Tohill said. "And they can't trust the county when it comes to contractual benefits."
Arthur Cliff, president of the Superior Officers Association, which represents those with the rank of sergeant and above, said his members "felt betrayed by the country."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Are Becalmed

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were essentially unchanged on nearly non-existent volume yesterday, as credit market participants curbed buying and selling until after May employment data are released this morning.
"The past two days have been hideous," one Government securities trader said. "For the most part, people are washed out and waiting for Friday." 
 A rise in weekly initial unemployment claims, the first in three weeks, and sluggish chain-store sales reported for May did not have much impact on prices yesterday. Nor did money supply data that were weaker than expected.
"The recovery continues to look slow and anemic," the trader said. "Until and unless that view changes, the market will pretty much sit where it is."
Analysts noted that the number of individuals receiving unemployment benefits fell during the week ended May 23. The decline raises the possibility that the unemployment rate, which stood at 7.2 percent in April, could show a decline when the data are released.
Most analysts are forecasting that nonfarm payroll employment rose by 100,000 or a bit more last month.
Although market participants chose not to register much reaction to the money supply figures, analysts said the data provided the market with some underlying support going in to today's employment report.
 
Money Supply Moves Down
 The Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday that all three measures of the nation's money supply fell during the week ended May 25.
M-2, the monetary aggregate most closely followed by the Fed, declined by $10.4 billion. With the drop, M-2's growth rate for the year slipped to 1.6 percent, well under the 2.5 percent rate that represents the floor of the Fed's target growth range of 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 101 14/32 , down 2/32 , to yield 7.87 percent, compared with 7.86 percent late Wednesday.
Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 101 1/8, down 1/32 , to yield 7.33 percent. And the 5 1/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 30/32 , up 1/32 , to yield 5.15 percent.
Rates on outstanding short-term Treasury bills moved a tad lower after the money supply figures were released.
In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.67 percent, down two basis points, or two one-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by three basis points, to a late offered rate of 3.81 percent. And one-year bills were offered at a late rate of 4.04 percent, down two basis points.
In the investment-grade corporate bond market, Proctor & Gamble offered $200 million worth of noncallable five-year notes through an underwriting syndicate led by Goldman, Sachs & Company.
The 6.85 percent notes were priced at $100, or par, 25 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 6 3/4 percent five-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated AA-2 by Moody's Investors Service and AA by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
A decision by Standard & Poor's to place the State of New Jersey on creditwatch with the possibility of downgrading its AA rating on outstanding New Jersey debt securities had no impact on prices of those issues yesterday, traders said.
In the broader secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, participants said that prices of most widely quoted issues were unchanged to up 1/8 point.

HEADLINE: Stocks Slip As the Dow Drops 7.26

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks posted moderate losses in slow trading yesterday as investors took a breather ahead of the release today of May employment report.
But the shares of Ford, G.M. and Chrysler continued to entice buyers after the report on Wednesday that late May car sales surged 11.2 percent. 
 "The market is cautious ahead of the unemployment numbers, but a positive has been strength in the autos," said Alan Ackerman at Reich & Company.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 7.26 points to close at 3,399.73, just below the key 3,400 level.
Volume on New York Stock Exchange turnover was 204.5 million shares, off slightly from 215.8 million shares traded Wednesday. Declining stocks led advances, 942 to 762. The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.75, to 227.90.
The Nasdaq composite index closed at 588.26, down 1.67 points. The American Stock Exchange index was up 1.53 points at 397.18. The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 1.31 points, to 413.26.
Traders and analysts expect the jobs numbers to show that nonfarm payrolls grew by 101,000 jobs and that the unemployment rate was unchanged from April, at 7.2 percent. Neither figure was considered reason to buy or sell.
"It's tough to make a Picasso out of a finger painting," said David Holt, director of research at Wedbush Morgan Securities.
The market flirted with the 3,400 level throughout the day, but with both buyers and sellers lacking strong conviction, it was unable to break to the upside.
General Motors topped the Big Board most-active list, adding, 1 7/8 to 43 5/8. Chrysler rose 3/4, to 20 5/8, and Ford Motor rose 1 3/8, to 48 1/8. Bear, Stearns repeated a buy rating on G.M.
Shares of the Xoma Corporation sank 4 3/4, to 15 1/4. The drug maker said regulators in the United States had asked for additional tests of its drug to treat septic shock.
U.S. Surgical rose 1 1/4, to 114 3/4. The company said it could achieve $250 million in revenues next year from the sale of instruments used in less-invasive procedures for hysterectomies.
Monsanto slumped 2 1/2 to 60 1/4. Kidder, Peabody downgraded its rating and estimates on the company.
 The Altera Corporation lost 2 1/4, to 13 1/4, after it said second-quarter net would be below analysts' estimates.
Lehman Brothers upgraded its rating on McDonnell Douglas, citing the stock's attractive price. Shares surged 4 3/8, to 43 1/2.

HEADLINE: Jobless-Benefit Claims Up

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 4

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits edged up by 4,000 during the week ending May 23, the Government said today.
Analysts, however, dismissed the small advance as insignificant and noted that the four-week average for new jobless claims continued to improve, falling to the second-lowest level in 18 months. 
 The Labor Department said the weekly gain had pushed initial claims for unemployment benefits to 407,000, up from 403,000 the previous week, which was the lowest weekly figures in seven months.
But even with the recent advance, the four-week average for claims declined to 410,750, the second-best showing since October 1990.
Because week-to-week changes in jobless claims can be volatile, economists prefer to focus on the four-week moving average.
They noted that the average claims level had now dropped significantly from the 450,000 mark, where it had been stuck for the first three months of the year.
Economists use the jobless claim data to gauge the economy's direction, figuring that lower claims indicate that companies are hiring and expanding output.
Robert Dederick, chief economist of the Northern Trust Company of Chicago, said the slow improvement in jobless claims was consistent with the view that the economy had begun a sustainable, but modest recovery.
On Friday, the Government will issue the unemployment rate for May and Mr. Dederick said he was looking for it to remain at 7.2 percent and stay above 7 percent for most of the rest of the year.
The state with the biggest increase in jobless claims in the week was Oregon. The increase of 3,156 was attributed to computer problems that delayed claims processing in the previous week.
Claims also rose by large amounts in Michigan, up 1,865, a gain attributed to further layoffs in the auto industry; Mississippi, up 1,783, and Texas, up 1,383.
The state with the biggest decline in claims was California, where claims dropped by 4,375, with the improvement attributed to fewer layoffs in the electronics and aerospace industries.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Mixed as Traders Await May's Jobless Report

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled mixed on world currency markets yesterday as traders awaited the release of May unemployment data today.
Gold prices fell. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $338.60 a troy ounce, off 10 cents from Wednesday. Later, the Republic National Bank quoted a bid of $338.40, also down 10 cents. 
 The dollar traded in quite narrow ranges in anticipation of the unemployment figure, expected by analysts to remain at 7.2 percent.
Dealers were trying to figure out the direction of the economy, said Robert Ryan, corporate foreign exchange manager with the Bank of New York.
Weekly data on unemployment insurance claims released yesterday had little impact on the dollar. The Labor Department said the number of Americans filing new claims edged up by 4,000 during the week ended May 23.
"Today's data are just one part of the puzzle," said Jeff Mondschein, a managing director with the Continental Bank in Chicago. "Tomorrow we'll get the whole picture,"
But the dollar's potential to rally significantly if the figures are solid is limited by mixed sentiment toward the economy, dealers said.
There was still uncertainty in the market surrounding Denmark's rejection of the treaty on closer European economic and political union, Mr. Mondschein said.
"Traders are waiting to see how the political dust settles after the Danish vote and where that leaves the currencies," he said.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 127.70 Japanese yen, from 126.90 yen at Wednesday's close. Later, in London, it fell to 127.50 yen. In New York the dollar near unchanged at 127.40 yen, from 127.45 Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday, were: 1.5980 German marks, down from 1.6040; 1.4625 Swiss francs, down from 1.4700; 5.3800 French francs, down from 5.4025; 1,208.00 Italian lire, down from 1,213.00, and 1.19605 Canadian dollars, down from 1.20065.

HEADLINE: New U.S.-Japan Accord on Semiconductors

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 4

 BODY:
In an 11th-hour attempt to head off a trade crisis, Japanese and American electronics companies agreed today on measures aimed at vastly increasing the sale of American semiconductors in Japan this year.
A key part of the plan is that Japan's 10 largest electronics companies, including giants like Hitachi, Toshiba and Sony, will take "emergency special measures" in which they will give American and other non-Japanese suppliers advance information on their need for semiconductor products in the third and fourth quarters. 
 "We have high confidence that these extraordinary measures that have been agreed on today will result in significant increases in market share," said James Norling, the president of the semiconductor group at Motorola Inc. and one of the negotiators for the American trade group, the Semiconductor Industry Association.
But there is still some reason to be skeptical. Giving advance information on the need for chip products does not guarantee that orders will be placed. That will depend on market conditions and other factors.
Tensions have been rising over what American semiconductor companies regard as Japan's failure to live up to a semiconductor trade agreement between the two nations.
A major goal of that agreement was that American and other non-Japanese suppliers would obtain 20 percent of Japan's huge market for computer chips by the end of this year. The market share of foreign chip companies in Japan now stands at 14.4 percent and has not been growing, making it exceedingly unlikely that the 20 percent share can be reached by the deadline.
Japanese companies say the 20 percent figure is not a guarantee, only an expectation. In recent weeks they have expressed increasing annoyance at American demands, saying it is hard for them to take on new suppliers during an economic downturn.
American semiconductor companies have been threatening to seek sanctions against Japanese companies. The American Government has also begun to express its disappointment with the lack of progress in market share. Last week, the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, began a Federal review of how the existing agreement was being carried out.
Today's agreement, announced jointly by Japanese and American trade groups, seems to be aimed at staving off sanctions.
"We have agreed that we'd like to avoid any unfortunate consquences," said Shinichi Itoh, an executive with the NEC Corporation and one of the negotiators of the agreement for the Electronic Industries Association of Japan.
 
A Way to Avoid the Deadline
 But the agreement could also provide a way to postpone the end-of-the-year deadline. If the Japanese companies diligently try to carry out the new measures and the foreign market share improves, it is likely that the American companies will not push for sanctions even if their market share falls a bit short of 20 percent by the deadline.
Many times in the past, American companies have applauded some trade agreements only to see the expected results fail to materialize. In the case of semiconductors, the 20 percent goal was first expected to be achieved by 1991 under a 1986 trade agreement. When that failed, a new trade agreement was signed in 1991 putting the deadline at the end of this year.
There is also the possibility that the emergency program may provide a one-time benefit that does not lead to long-term gains in market share. For instance, a Japanese company could buy a year's worth of foreign chips in six months and stockpile the extras.
The large Japanese companies, in general, already buy 20 percent of their chips from foreign companies. American companies have complained that the smaller companies do not buy as many. Nevertheless, the larger companies are being called on now to increase their purchases even more, in part because they have the capacity to do so and also because they would stand to lose the most from sanctions.

HEADLINE: Saving the Earth From Roasting

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

 BODY:
Is there yet time to save Earth from a catastrophic roasting that some experts now regard as virtually inevitable? A new show at the American Museum of Natural History offers a rare opportunity for visitors to crystallize their thinking about this monstrous prospect.
The museum and its partner in the project, the Environmental Defense Fund, recently opened a spectacular exhibition aimed not only at demonstrating the possibly imminent danger of global warming, but also at suggesting the possibility of salvation, provided that people everywhere begin pitching in. 
 The show, "Global Warming: Understanding the Forecast," occupies a substantial part of the museum's third floor and cost $3.7 million, making it one of the most expensive and elaborate temporary exhibitions the institution has mounted. It also breaks new ground.
"By attempting to look into the future, this exhibition is clearly different from anything we've done in the past," said Dr. George D. Langdon Jr., the museum's president. "We're not an advocacy organization, but our department heads agree that it's important for people to understand the scientific questions involved in the threat of global warming. We also believe that steps should be taken before it's too late."
 
A World Debate
 National leaders are meeting in Rio de Janeiro this week to consider environmental issues, and although many agree that urgent action is needed to head off global warming, President Bush, a participant in the meeting, does not. Mr. Bush's Administration contends that international regulations limiting the amount of carbon dioxide industries may emit would be enormously costly and not justified by the meager evidence that the world has already begun to warm up.
While rancorous debate among experts has not resolved this question, no one disputes the fact that carbon dioxide levels have been rising rapidly in this century and that at least in theory, their continued increase could cause global warming of up to 8 degrees in the 21st century.
The effects of the carbon dioxide may be offset, of course, by increased cloud cover reflecting sunlight away from Earth or by increased levels of sulfur dioxide produced by volcanoes (which increases cloud cover), or by many other mechanisms scientists have hypothesized -- none of them well understood.
But in some worst-case predictions, global warming could rapidly melt polar ice, raising sea levels and inundating Bangladesh, Venice and countless other places. The world's great granaries -- America's Midwest, Ukraine, Argentina and other regions -- might become arid semi-desert land, with incalculable effects on global food supplies.
A strength of the new exhibition is its wealth of displays clearly explaining some of the scientific methods and gadgets used to study Earth's climate. With money from Shearson Lehman Brothers, the National Science Foundation, the MacArthur Foundation, the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation and Turner Broadcasting Systems, the project was able to splurge on unusually elaborate displays.
For example, scientists seeking to calculate how carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere may have raised or lowered global temperatures in the past base some of their calculations on the study of ice buried deep in the Greenland and Antarctic ice caps. Ice core samples brought to the surface by drilling machines are windows into the past.
The age of such a sample can be determined accurately from its depth and the chemical and physical composition of its layers. Best of all, an ice-cap sample contains myriad tiny, highly compressed air bubbles trapped intact since the ice froze.
"Fossil" air in these tiny bubbles is immensely valuable to scientists. Not only does an ancient air bubble reveal how much carbon dioxide the atmosphere contained at a specific time in the past, but also oxygen isotopes trapped in the bubbles indicate the temperature of the atmosphere at that time as well.
 
Greenland Ice and Cows
 The display includes a freezer with a large window, through which viewers can look at a big chunk of real Greenland ice clouded by tiny bubbles of 660-year-old air.
Another eye-catcher is a model cow equipped with a gut represented by a twisted neon tube and a speaker emitting recorded cow burps. The point of the display is that hoofed animals digesting vegetable fodder burp enormous amounts of methane, which, with carbon dioxide, is one of the most potent "greenhouse" gases -- gases that prevent the sun's radiant energy from being reflected back into space. Cattle, mainstays of rural economies throughout the world, may be adding to the greenhouse problem.
An elderly woman said to a companion with whom she had just toured the exhibits: "This is just horrifying. I had no idea Earth was in such trouble. I'm so glad we came."
The climate debate is far from over, and to their credit, the museum and the Environmental Defense Fund offer viewers an assortment of dissenting views. Explanatory panels and interactive computer programs point out, for instance, that climate temperature varies widely and randomly, and that although the past decade has been unusually warm, the degree of warming is within the normal range of variability.
The museum and the Environmental Defense Fund might have skirted the contentious issue of birth control but chose instead to show how unchecked population growth is closely linked to carbon dioxide production and greenhouse warming. One display panel states that "to create a sustainable global society, we must both conserve our resources and stabilize population size" -- a view shared by most scientists but not by the Vatican, by many third world governments or by the Bush Administration.
"Our trustees properly insisted that we address this issue," Dr. Langdon said. "We've tried to do that without shaking our fingers at anyone."
Despite the publicity lavished on environmental problems in recent years, many people remain confused by or ignorant of the complicated facts and can benefit from guidance offered by the show, said Dr. Samuel M. Taylor, the museum's director of exhibitions.
The most common misconception, he said, is mistaking greenhouse warming (caused largely by carbon dioxide in the atmosphere) with the ozone hole (a completely different phenomenon probably caused by the release of chlorofluorocarbon compounds into the upper atmosphere).
Whether for education or the pleasure of strolling through an exceptionally well-conceived museum exhibition, "Global Warming" is worth an hour's visit.

HEADLINE: Review/Art;
Homage to One of Italian Art's Great Draftsmen

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
The Drawing Center in SoHo typically features the work of young and unknown artists who are pushing at the limits of the medium. "Marking Time," a group show seen at the center in the fall, presented big installation pieces that took drawing into three-dimensional space. And in March a show called "Darkness Visible" followed the medium into popular culture, displaying the efforts of professional cartoonists alongside those of cartoon-oriented artists.
But each season, the center mounts at least one show that has its feet planted in the past, and that underscores the breadth of this small, exemplary institution. This year the offering is "Guercino: Drawings From Windsor Castle," an often exhilarating display of 60 sheets by the 17th-century Italian Baroque painter that should appeal to anyone interested in drawing and its traditions. 
 The show pays homage to one of Italian art's great draftsmen, a largely self-taught artist whose real name was Giovanni Francesco Barbieri and who was born in the town of Cento in Emilia-Romagna in 1591. He was known by his nickname, Il Guercino (the Squinter), because of a childhood accident.
One of several exhibitions in the United States and Europe that celebrate the 400th anniversary of Guercino's birth, the new show is a collaborative effort between the Drawing Center, the National Gallery in Washington and the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth.
The drawings are chronologically arranged from the artist's early efforts in the 1610's to near his death in 1666. They have been selected from the 350 verified Guercino drawings that were acquired by the crown of England in the mid-1700's, when George III, an especially avid collector of drawings, was king.
As a painter Guercino worked in different styles during his long and successful career. Earlier on he combined the disparate influences of Carravaggio, the Carracci and great 16th-century Venetian masters like Titian to create works that, at their best, number among the masterpieces of the Baroque. His later paintings are in the more classical style of Guido Reni.
As a draftsman Guercino was a natural virtuoso at ease in all media, the master of a fluid, endlessly varied style infused with a vivacity and freedom that his paintings often lacked. With pen and ink he could create dramatic contrasts of light and shadow, often needing just a few marks to imbue bare paper with a striking suggestion of midday sun. In oiled charcoal he created images so delicate that they seem almost atomized, more dusted than drawn onto the page.
In those media, and red or black chalk, Guercino created both quick sketches and finished studies for commissioned religious works, humorous caricatures and grotesques, and also marvelously economical landscapes that were primarily made for his own pleasure.
The drawings display a consummate awareness and even wit about the drawing process itself.
In "Three Bathers Surprised by a Monster," one of the show's most inventive works, Guercino allows accidental splashes of ink to generate the image. Some of the blots become muddy water that the bathers splash in the direction of the intruder. Other blots determine the monster's grotesque features, although they can also be read as mud being flung in his face.
In "Holy Family With Saints John the Baptist and Anne," an elaborate scene made for an engraver to convert into a print, he incorporates another amusing detail: the image is outlined to create the trompe l'oeil effect of a sheet of paper pinned to a wall.
After its virtuosity the most salient characteristic of Guercino's style is its diversity. A robust naturalism informs much of his art. In his dramatic rendering of "Apollo Flaying Marsyas," the god is shown literally tearing the skin from the satyr's arm. In "The Annunciation" the muscular angel seems depicted in the midst of landing at Mary's feet.
Nonetheless this naturalism was continually adjusted, tailored to each drawing's purpose, subject or material. His religious and mythological studies could be operatic, as in the red-chalk rendition of a recoiling, voluptuous Aurora, who draws her cape across her body.
Or they could be defined by spare flourishes of nearly abstract line. In more than one of the artist's quick pen-and-ink sketches, bodies are described by little more than elegant scribbles that can even bring to mind Picasso or Jackson Pollock. In "Semele and Jupiter," the contrast of loosely drawn, almost caricatural, bodies and carefully detailed, darkly expressive faces seems almost to presage Picasso's "Minotaur" etchings.
When Guercino's subjects were more down to earth, so was his style. In "Three Peasants Picnicking" the roughness of the peasants is matched by the artist's blunt touch and simple forms. A more understated treatment, and greater psychological depth, is seen in "Standing Beggar," where a tall haggard figure, who seems almost too proud to beg, steps tentatively forward.
While the speed and spontaneity of Guercino's sketches can be dazzling, when seen in multiple, they also reflect the care with which he considered and reconsidered an image before committing it to canvas.
In one pen-and-ink-and-wash study for "Assassination of Amnon at the Feast of His Half Brother Absalom," an image fraught with dramatic gestures and contrasts of light and dark, the attackers lunge at their victim across a table, while Absalom turns to flee, as if horrified by the execution he has masterminded.
A second sketch is remarkably different. Here the assassins stand over their victim while Absalom, wearing a plumed hat, remains seated and completely composed, watching and savoring the moment of revenge.
Pushing both the composition and the psychological content of the event in one direction and then the other, the two works show Guercino as a master of narrative invention. And, like much else in this extraordinary show, they also convey a marvelously immediate, even intimate, portrait of the artist at work.
"Guercino: Drawings from Windsor Castle" is at the Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, in SoHo, through Aug. 1.

HEADLINE: Restaurants

BYLINE: By Bryan Miller

 BODY:
Before restaurant chefs began touting homey, assertive food as the wave of the 90's, Alison on Dominick was turning out just that for its scores of faithful customers. This unassuming three-year-old spot in the western fringe of SoHo has survived the crushing recession (and a neighborhood that stumps all but the most seasoned taxi drivers) by offering consistently enticing fare and warm hospitality. A simple formula indeed but one that is often neglected.
The restaurant is named for its owner, Alison Price, an engaging and vigilant host who oversees a well-disciplined staff. Since opening day the chef has been Thomas Valenti, whom Miss Price worked with at Gotham Bar and Grill in Manhattan. 
The compact main dining room is soft and understated, with pastel-colored walls holding black-and-white photographs, royal blue banquettes and indirect lighting. The noise level is surprisingly low considering the size of the space.
If there is a minor shortcoming here, especially for repeat customers, it is a moderate-size menu that usually lacks more than one special supplement. But for first-time visitors there are ample winners from which to choose. Among starters there is a vernal vegetable tart combining slices of tomato, eggplant and zucchini all doused with a roasted tomato vinaigrette. Duck carpaccio is enriched with a well-seasoned lentil salad. And a ziggurat of gravlax is built upon a delicious chickpea pancake and garnished with salmon and whitefish eggs.
On the lighter side is a pellucid tomato consomme that evokes midsummer, holding a delicate seafood-and-leek sausage and shiitake mushrooms. And if you want to splurge, try the sparkling foie gras studded with asparagus, string beans and artichoke hearts.
Alison has a quality wine selection featuring some relatively unknown gems, especially among French labels. Prices are average.
Mr. Valenti's robust style extends to seafood, too. Exceptionally delicate sauteed skate is combined with savoy cabbage, crispy potatoes, pearl onions and cubes of smoked pork. Surprisingly, the fish was not overshadowed by this high-powered company. Halibut is roasted to perfection and served in a lustrous shellfish broth with shallots, tomato, pearl onions and tiny noodles. Tuna did not receive such beneficial treatment. The seared fillet arrived dry, sitting in a mushroom broth with a good white-bean puree on the side. And poached lobster with basil ravioli came in a complex vegetable and lobster broth. One of the best seafood options is roasted swordfish is wrapped in bacon and accompanied by lentils and sauteed potatoes.
Game is always a good bet here. Sauteed squab is ruddy and full-flavored, its breast meat fanned over a duxelle and the legs perched on top like a garnish. Roasted barley and smoked shallots are harmonious accompaniments. And talk about homey, the braised lamb shank with white and fava beans, chicory and a roasted garlic sauce could bring tears to your eyes. By comparison, roast guinea hen was not so memorable. The bird was well cooked and only slightly seasoned and came with a gluey black-olive-and-thyme risotto.
After this high-impact palate workout, a sharp lemon tart is a nice cleanser, as is a lovely mixed fruit tart with layers of plums and orange sections. Creme brulee is lightweight and passable. Try instead the chewy hazelnut torte with banana ice cream or the intense cantaloupe bavaroise.
With gutsy cooking and professional hospitality like this, it's no wonder Alison on Dominick Street continues to be one of the more popular restaurants in SoHo.

HEADLINE: Denmark Needn't Derail Europe

 BODY:
Danish voters shocked the European Community by voting down ambitious plans for economic and political union. But the immediate crisis need not halt the lowering of barriers within Western Europe. And if Denmark's partners adapt to the vote imaginatively, they could make it easier for the Community to reach out to the formerly Communist East.
Denmark specifically rejected the Maastricht treaty, which provides, among other things, for the introduction of a common European currency by 1999. The referendum is the clearest sign yet that Europeans are uneasy about surrendering the attributes of sovereignty to a centralized authority. In several countries, this unease is heightened by suspicions that the new Europe may be dominated by Germany and other big states. 
 To Americans, those fears seem exaggerated. Washington rightly sees West European integration as a way to dampen old national conflicts and promote worldwide economic growth. But the U.S. also has an interest in extending integration further east, where newly capitalist countries struggle to overcome a demoralizing legacy.
Because the Maastricht treaty amended the Community's basic charter, it legally required unanimous approval by all 12 member states. That is no longer possible. Denmark's "no" vote may force the E.C. to establish different levels of membership. That, in turn, would make it much easier to embrace the East.
Some of the Community's integration plans do not directly depend on Maastricht. And others that do, like foreign policy coordination and joint citizenship, could still be agreed to by a subset of Community states. One group of Maastricht provisions, known as the social charter, already exempts Britain -- establishing a precedent for a Europe with two or more tracks.
France and Germany resist expanding Community membership at this time. Their concept of integration is premised on the existing 12 partners increasingly harmonizing their institutions. To start from scratch with outsiders, they say, particularly when they are as poor and different as the Eastern countries, threatens to dilute and delay the integration process.
But this French-German approach, formulated years ago and embodied last December in the Maastricht treaty, became obsolescent with the fall of the Berlin wall. Britain, never enthusiastic about harmonized institutions, sensibly presses for early expansion.
Now all European leaders are compelled to think anew. In accommodating Denmark and, on other issues, Britain, they may also find arrangements to accommodate the East. Denmark's "no" could yet contribute to wider European unity.

Silver Lining for Eurodoom

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
Very bad week for Europe, the troubadours of doom will sing for weeks. Perhaps the idea of a united Western Europe was buried in Denmark. Southeastern Europe is going up in flames. And the great Russian experiment in democracy and free enterprise is collapsing.
But these troubles could prove beneficial. European leaders have been marching along with dreams of their cohesiveness that belie reality. Reformist technicians in Russia have been out of touch with suffering workers. The leaders need wake-up calls to address tough questions about ends and means, questions that have become politically incorrect even to ask. Midcourse corrections are now in order. 
When the shock of Tuesday's Danish vote against currency union subsides, Western Europeans will find a way to continue toward greater unity. But it will be slower and with more attention to gaining popular support -- and holding on to the security connection with the U.S.
As the horror of Yugoslavia sets in and as it becomes apparent that Europe cannot respond to such crises, Europeans may look more constructively at preserving American leadership. NATO's decision yesterday to offer peacekeeping services to Europe is thus encouraging.
As Russia struggles with economic chaos, its leaders will have to pull back and strike a balance between market reforms and public backing. Free marketeers will scream, but President Yeltsin was wise this week not to sacrifice democracy on the altar of economic reform.
The end of the cold war caused Mr. Yeltsin, Chancellor Kohl and others to hurtle toward their dreams -- political unity or collective security or capitalism -- somewhat breathlessly and without people power.
Only a bare majority of Danes voted against the Maastricht treaty and the drive to a common West European currency. But their anxiety surely resonates beyond Denmark: of having national identity swallowed up by faceless bureaucrats of the European Community and big European powers.
Many Danes who voted for the treaty did so not out of conviction, but from fear of being left off the common economic bandwagon. Their leaders were far ahead of them in abandoning sovereignty. This feeling, too, may be widely felt elsewhere in West Europe.
It may also turn out that most Danes worried about the Maastricht commitment to a common foreign and defense policy. Perhaps they saw for the first time that this would mean greater reliance on French and German military power and less on the U.S. and NATO. And perhaps that gave many Europeans a sense of unease, and prematurity. Perhaps Bonn and Paris now will reconsider their plan for a joint army corps that seems to undercut ties to Washington and NATO.
To see the importance of these old ties, Europeans have only to flip on their television sets and gaze on the Bosnian massacres. European leaders could not deal with that situation on their own. Washington nonetheless stood back in the early days of the Yugoslav crisis and let the Europeans take the lead. Soon it became painfully clear that they could agree only on exhortations of peace.
Europeans could not even pull together on economic sanctions against Serbia. The Bush Administration had to step in last week to organize such a resolution at the U.N. The experience was not pleasant for European leaders. But it must have brought home to them the indispensability of American leadership. That could prove useful when and if they realize the need for further action to stop the fighting and keep it from spreading.
Lost in the Bosnian bloodshed and the Danish vote were decisions by Boris Yeltsin to recalibrate economic reforms. He ordered the printing of more money to pay off potential strikers, thus producing higher deficits and inflation. He also replaced some reform-minded ministers with conservatives.
International Monetary Fund bureaucrats will protest and threaten to deny pending loans. But Mr. Yeltsin's goals remain the right ones. And if he is to stay in power, he has to prevent mass unemployment and compromise with a conservative Parliament.
Setbacks and retrenchment for Russian and Western European leaders could turn out well. They needed a dose of political realism.

HEADLINE: Care for Environment Doesn't Hurt Economy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Environment Laws Are Eased by Bush as Election Nears" (front page, May 20) highlights a phenomenon that Americans have seen before.
George Bush and Jimmy Carter both entered the White House as declared environmentalists, and both took some noteworthy steps. It is troubling to see President Bush in a campaign year succumbing to the same temptation that befell President Carter some 12 years ago: blaming environmental protection for the country's economic problems. 
 Mr. Carter, facing rampant inflation, deputized Robert Strauss to lead a White House brigade against new regulations. As Mr. Bush responds in kind to recession, only the names have changed: the White House group is now the Council on Competitiveness; the deputy is Dan Quayle.
Time and again, Democrats and Republicans facing tough economic times have tried to set up the environment as a fall guy. According to this cartoon logic, anti-environment means pro-economy. Our leaders know better. For example, United States utilities have been making more profit from conservation than they would from building new power plants, avoiding giant amounts of pollution into the bargain for years.
Like economic regulations, environmental regulations can foster competition and creativity or stifle them. It depends on how the rules are written. No one wants silly or unnecessary regulations. Government must set strong, clear, enforceable goals to protect the environment, but industry must use its smartest and most innovative methods to reach those goals. A response to that challenge must take place in the real world.
The challenge this election year is for all candidates, Republicans, Demomcrats and independents, to recognize that a healthy environment and a strong economy depend on each other.

Where's the Evidence?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In your May 8 front-page article on the global warming negotiations at the United Nations in preparation for the Earth Summit meeting in Rio de Janeiro, you report: "Scientists who are advising the talks here say that if the heat-trapping greenhouse gases continue to build up in the atmosphere at present rates, the earth's climate will warm by 3 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the next century, with possibly catastrophic effects on the world's climate."
John B. Oakes (Op-Ed, May 8) writes of "a catastrophe in the making that, unless checked, will raise sea levels, drown coastal areas and change agricultural production before the end of the 21st century." 
 Those judgments cannot be supported by hard and consistent scientific evidence. Some of the country's leading scientists, working through the George C. Marshall Institute, recently concluded that "computer models have considerably exaggerated the size of the greenhouse effect" and that "the sun has been the controlling influence on climate in the last 100 years, with the greenhouse effect playing a smaller role . . . a few tenths of a degree."
According to Charles River Associates, an economics research organization also doing studies on this issue, a mandate to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions at or below current levels in the United States could require a new tax of $200 a ton of carbon burned. That would mean a new tax on oil of $26 a barrel, on natural gas of $3.20 per thousand cubic feet and on coal of $120 a ton -- more than doubling oil and natural gas prices and increasing the price of coal fivefold.
This could mean a 2 percent drop in our gross national product in the last half of the 1990's, resulting in a drastic impact on jobs, as well as on our standard of living. We are facing the equivalent of a $100 billion tax on Americans without solid scientific evidence.

Clean Is Profitable

 BODY:
To the Editor:
News coverage of the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro has focused on concerns that the treaty on global warming could harm the United States economy by raising the cost of electrical power.
Yes, the United States produces almost one-quarter of the greenhouse gases, and accepting the Rio terms would require it to make a larger investment to reduce these gases to 1990 levels than any other country. 
 However, there are also potential economic benefits. The Earth Summit is the first official step in creating a global, electric power industry with opportunities for United States electric utilities to move into the global export market.
If the United States complies with the treaty, developing countries will have a greater incentive to invest in more environmentally sound power operation practices and technologies. And these countries are likely to turn to United States utilities for counsel, design and construction, perhaps even facility management.
By the end of the century, utilities such as Consolidated Edison of New York, Public Service Enterprises, General Public Utilities, Long Island Lighting Company or Allegheny Power System could well have power production or management interests in far corners of the globe.
This is not a far-fetched economic benefit. Two large United States utilities are exploring international energy opportunities. And Electricite de France, once a domestic utility, has profitable contracts or investments in more than 50 countries. It is the world's largest electricity producer and exporter, with one of the world's lowest greenhouse gas emission rates.

Democracy Overridden

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The Bush Administration's use of appointed, unelected "Cabinet level" panels to eviscerate major environmental laws deserves more scrutiny. The stunning "override" of the Endangered Species Act by a panel of Bush appointees (front page, May 15) and the efforts of Vice President Quayle's Council on Competitiveness, another so-called Cabinet-level panel, to gut the Clean Air Act should prompt vigorous debate on whether or not the power exercised by these panels is legitimate or a flagrant abuse of the governmental process.
More is at stake than foul air and loss of old-growth forests. When people follow due process and work for a law, and it is enacted by their elected representatives, they have every right to expect it to remain intact. When laws are systematically dismantled by panels that are havens for industry lobbyists and party fund raisers who could not advance their agendas through the legislative process, fundamental questions arise. 
 Word has it that industry lobbyists no longer worry too much about what happens in Congress; they can get what they want elsewhere, outside of the pesky legislative arena.
The disturbing possibility that our air, water, old-growth forests and spotted owls are being sold to enrich Bush campaign coffers merits at least as much press attention as the Gennifer Flowers hoopla, and the latest quid pro quo was hard to miss: the day after the Republican $9 million fund-raising dinner, President Bush announced yet another three-month delay in implementing the Clean Air Act. The only question remaining here is how much the Clean Air Act sold for.
The Administration's latest accomplishment, weakening international global warming initiatives to be considered at the Rio Earth Summit, is a national disgrace.

HEADLINE: THE EARTH SUMMIT;
12 Sign the Climate Treaty As Political Clouds Gather

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, June 4

 BODY:
In the first substantive act of the Earth Summit, a dozen nations signed a climate treaty today to curb gas emissions, but three European countries considered taking much stronger action on their own.
The new declaration by the European nations would commit signers to stabilize the emission of gases that trap heat in the atmosphere at 1990 levels, and then to make further cuts. It would also set a deadline of 2000 to reach stabilization. 
 If the new declaration gains widespread support, it would embarrass the United States, which plans to sign the climate treaty but does not want to see it tightened.
Scientists fear that rising levels of carbon dioxide, methane and other heat-trapping gases could cause a potentially catastrophic warming of the Earth's climate.
Austria, Switzerland and the Netherlands presented the new proposal.
 
U.S. Still Opposed
 A United States delegate said Washington was strongly opposed to the proposal, seeing it as an attempt to rewrite a key provision of the climate treaty governing specific commitments to be made by industrial countries. The United States had persuaded the Europeans to accept far weaker treaty language by threatening that President Bush would not attend the Earth Summit.
For the nations that endorse it, the new declaration would be in addition to the climate treaty. Countries could sign both the treaty, which would commit them to a minimum course of action, and the declaration, which would commit them to go further.
Hugo Haider, the Austrian Minister of Environment, said a decision on whether to offer the proposal formally would be made this week.
President Fernando Collor de Mello of Brazil became the first head of government to sign the climate treaty, in a 20-minute ceremony at which Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali of the United Nations acknowledged that the agreement "falls short of the initial hopes of many negotiators."
 
What Treaty Demands
 But Mr. Boutros-Ghali said the treaty contains important commitments. "One may hope," he said, "that its very modesty will motivate governments and observers to maintain constructive pressure" to strengthen the treaty as the nature of the warming threat and its economic implications become clearer.
The treaty commits signatories to stabilize concentrations of heat-trapping gases at environmentally safe levels over the long term. Because concentrations are continuing to build up at present rates of emission, the objective could be achieved only by reducing emissions.
As a first step, the treaty requires industrial countries, which emit most of the gases, to cap emissions at 1990 levels, but it sets no timetable. Instead, the industrial nations would simply recognize that returning to "earlier levels" of emissions by the end of this decade would advance the treaty's overall objective.
The treaty also sets up a process for inspecting each nation's progress and for taking stronger action, if necessary, as more becomes known about the threat.
 
The 12 That Signed
 In addition to Brazil, the treaty was signed by Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, Belgium, Finland, Iceland, Israel, Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway and Uruguay.
Austria, Switzerland and the Netherlands, who offered the proposal to make the climate treaty more effective, were among the leaders in pushing for a stronger treaty in the first place.
The three countries "are very frustrated and are trying to put the limelight on the countries that have weakened the treaty," said Richard Mott, of the World Wildlife Fund. "They are trying to defeat lowest-common-denominator politics."
A separate agreement by the Europeans "would be very embarrassing to the United States," said Liz Barratt-Brown, of the Natural Resources Defense Council.
 
Why U.S. Objects
 The United States objects that the initiative seeks to return the treaty to the discussion stage rather than put its provisions into effect.
Washington maintains that energy-efficiency programs already under way will bring the United States very close to meeting a deadline of 2000, but that it does not want to be compelled to meet the deadline because it cannot be sure of doing so without cost to the nation's economy.
The climate treaty will go into effect when 50 countries ratify it. Backers said they were confident that many more than 50 nations would sign it, the first step toward ratification, before the Earth Summit ends on June 14. It will remain open for signing for a year.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Third-Party Candidate;
Perot's Vision: Consensus by Computer

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 5

 BODY:
Twenty-three years ago, Ross Perot had a simple idea.
The nation was splintered by the great and painful issues of the day. There had been years of disorder and disunity, and lately, terrible riots in Los Angeles and other cities. People talked of an America in crisis. The Government seemed to many to be ineffectual and out of touch. 
 What this country needed, Mr. Perot thought, was a good, long talk with itself.
The information age was dawning, and Mr. Perot, then building what would become one of the world's largest computer-processing companies, saw in its glow the answer to everything.
 
One Hour, One Issue
 Every week, Mr. Perot proposed, the television networks would broadcast an hourlong program in which one issue would be discussed. Viewers would record their opinions by marking computer cards, which they would mail to regional tabulating centers. Consensus would be reached, and the leaders would know what the people wanted.
Mr. Perot gave his idea a name that draped the old dream of pure democracy with the glossy promise of technology: "the electronic town hall."
Today, Mr. Perot's idea, essentially unchanged from 1969, is at the core of his "We the People" drive for the Presidency, and of his theory for governing.
It forms the basis of Mr. Perot's pitch, in which he presents himself, not as a politician running for President, but as a patriot willing to be drafted "as a servant of the people" to take on the "dirty, thankless" job of rescuing America from "the Establishment," and running it.
In set speeches and interviews, the Texas billionaire describes the electronic town hall as the principal tool of governance in a Perot Presidency, and he makes grand claims: "If we ever put the people back in charge of this country and make sure they understand the issues, you'll see the White House and Congress, like a ballet, pirouetting around the stage getting it done in unison."
Although Mr. Perot has repeatedly said he would not try to use the electronic town hall as a direct decision-making body, he has on other occasions suggested placing a startling degree of power in the hands of the television audience.
He has proposed at least twice -- in an interview with David Frost broadcast on April 24 and in a March 18 speech at the National Press Club -- passing a constitutional amendment that would strip Congress of its authority to levy taxes, and place that power directly in the hands of the people, in a debate and referendum orchestrated through an electronic town hall.
Once the danger of the nation's huge debt was explained properly, Mr. Perot theorized: "The people will say, 'All right, the responsible thing to do is to raise taxes on ourselves.' And that leads to the next question: What should the tax system be?" The answer to that, again, would rest in the hands of those quickest to reach for the telephone. The new Federal tax system, Mr. Perot said, "would be conceived, worked out, and agreed to by the American people through the town hall."
Mr. Perot has said he would be willing to resign the Presidency if enough people dialed in to tell him to do so, in a sort of 1-800-CAN-ROSS campaign. "I would just go through the town hall," he told Mr. Frost. "I'd say, 'Now, would you be happier if someone replaced me?' If the answer came back 'Yes,' then I would say 'That's fine.' "
 
The Magic of Technology
 To many who support Mr. Perot, and even to many who do not, the idea of an electronic town hall has a powerful appeal. It holds the promise of a magical, technological, answer to all they have come to hate about the ways of Washington -- the endless gridlocked repetition of arguments so old and tired they have been reduced to catch phrases and code words, the corruptive influence of lobbyists and interest groups, the insulation of the political elite from the rest of the population, the shallowness of a debate framed by the forces of journalism.
"The great story of 1992 is the degree to which voters feel disconnected from their political system by the insulation of a professional political class, comprising politicians, the press and the pressure elite," said Will Marshall, director of the centrist, Washington-based Progressive Policy Institute. "People are yearning to be part of a democratic conversation with their Government, their leaders, and they now feel they are isolated by the political class, which has arrogated the conversation to itself."
But Mr. Marshall, and many who study the relationship between the public and public policy -- demographers, poll takers and political scientists -- fear that Mr. Perot's idea would make worse the very ills it proposes to correct. It is, they say, an awkward, unworkable hybrid -- New England town hall meets Brave New World -- founded on a series of false assumptions, and likely to push a process already characterized by superficiality, special-interest biases and demagoguery further in that direction.
 
Ex-Astronaut Looks Back
 One who believes that strongly is the former astronaut Frank Borman, the man Mr. Perot hired to guide the concept in its first, failed go-around.
"I would not now be in favor of an electronic town hall," Mr. Borman said last week. "I don't think you can take an extremely complex issue and air it completely in a half-hour or hour of television so that people will gain an informed understanding. I don't think you can govern 250 million people with a TV set."
Mr. Borman said he had come to believe that an electronic town hall would become a "national platform" for demagoguery with "enormous potential for manipulating the emotions of people," and could intimidate Congress into abandoning itself utterly to satisfying whatever seemed the people's will that week. "I have come to see," he said, "that greatness in governing is not achieved by simply following the will of the masses."
The way Mr. Perot and his aides see it, all of this would make Government more responsive to the will of the people. "The whole point is to inform the people about what we believe is the best solution," Mr. Perot said. "I want everybody to get involved in the process, not just the elite."
But demographers and poll takers say it is not true that the response of the people choosing to telephone their sentiments would represent the real will of the people in that Congressman's district, or nationally.
"This would look like a scientific survey, but it would not be at all," said Norman Bradburn, director of the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago.
Given the American television public's often-demonstrated lack of interest in public affairs programming, Mr. Bradburn predicted that the electronic town hall would regularly attract responses from only 1 or 2 percent of America's 120 million households. Computer checks to screen against repeat-callers would necessarily limit each household to only one response, regardless of the number of people dwelling within.
The people in those households, Mr. Bradburn said, would almost certainly be what demographers call "the attentive public," those people who routinely pay attention to matters of politics and policy. "These people," he said, "are richer, more educated, the kind of people who are already well connected to the political dialogue." In fact, he said, they are the very elites from whom Mr. Perot wishes to wrest control.
Other people who would respond to an electronic town hall, he said, would be "people who are already sending mail to their Congressmen" -- causists and cranks of one stripe or another, and agents of advocacy groups. "The system will quickly become the tool of special interests: just another, more expensive way for advocacy groups to bombard Congress with their views. Ultimately, it will wither away."
Moreover, the self-selecting nature of the electronic town hall would necessarily result in a false picture of what the public wanted.
Because people who choose to participate in a survey tend to be those who feel most passionately, poll takers say, an electronic town hall would necessarily present a false picture of what the public wanted.
The closest thing ever tried to Mr. Perot's town hall was a CBS News program on Jan. 28 called "America on the Line." Viewers were invited to call a toll-free number to register their opinions on the President's handling of the economy. The program drew calls from about 3 million people, and more than 300,000 calls actually got through the overburdened switchboards.
Mr. Perot has cited the CBS program as an example of how his town hall would work. But those who produced the program say what happened illustrates why an electronic town hall could not result in a true plebiscite.
The opinions recorded by those who chose to call in their views were in significant ways different from those of the scientifically selected group that CBS surveyed at the same time, said Kathleen Frankovic, the director of surveys for CBS News.
"For instance," she said, "when we asked if George Bush cared about the needs and problems of middle-class people, 70 percent of the people who chose to call in said he did not, while only 57 percent of those surveyed in the national survey of 1,241 people said this."
One reason for this is that people responding to a question are powerfully affected by what they see and hear in the moments before the question is asked.
In the case of the CBS program, for example, the unrepresentatively harsh judgment of Mr. Bush may have reflected the fact that they had just watched an interview with a weeping unemployed man.
A television program on an any emotionally charged issue would inevitably affect the views of those watching it, producing a gathering of opinion distorted by the very act of gathering it.
Since Mr. Perot's Administration would be in charge of producing the program, it would be simple to choreograph it through the selection of speakers, the scripting of questions, and the use of television-appealing "real people" testimony.
"It just gives me the shudders, the potential for manipulation, the one-sidedness, that a thing like this could do," said Mr. Bradburn.
 
 
 
'ELECTRONIC TOWN HALL': HOW IT MIGHT OPERATE<He>
Much about the electronic town hall concept has not been fully described by Mr. Perot. But, in recent interviews, Mr. Perot and two of his top political aides, Thomas D. Barr, a lawyer, and James Squires, his press spokesman, sketched out a reasonably detailed outline of the idea:
The Meeting -- The events would be staged on an irregular basis, each one devoted to a single issue: -- gun control, for instance, or abortion, or taxes. Each would be scheduled at least several weeks in advance and the Administration would ask the television networks to broadcast them, as is now the case with major Presidential addresses and news conferences.
The Discussion -- Mr. Perot's Administration would arrange a television discussion between Administration officials, Congressional leaders and selected experts. Mr. Perot suggested the discussion would focus on the arguments for and against a single course of action, the one proposed by his Administration. But Mr. Barr said the Talks would be broader than that, encompassing as many as three or four options the Government might take.
The Choice -- After the program, viewers would be asked to choose among the options. Theoretically, they could do this through push-button interactive devices attached to their television sets, or by mailing in special postcards. But interactive television is still in the planning stages, and poll takerssters doubt many people would take the trouble to take part in a mail campaign.
The Taly -- At least in the beginning, most responses would come from people with touch-tone telephones punching in their choices to computers linked with toll-free "800" telephone numbers.
The responses would be tabulated, and grouped by telephone company computers according to Congressional district. Each member of Congress would then be given a written run-down of the opinions cast by respondents in his or her Congressional district (or districts, in the case of Senators).

HEADLINE: U.S. BEGINS TALKS ON OUTSIDE FORCE TO STABILIZE HAITI

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 5

 BODY:
Bush Administration officials said today that they have begun talks on a plan that, for the first time, would involve the dispatch of an international peacekeeping force to Haiti as part of a political settlement restoring the Government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
The initiative being discussed with Caribbean and Latin American leaders would require the opposing forces in Haiti to commit themselves to the return of Father Aristide, who was overthrown by the military last September. 
 In return, the army would be included in the selection by consensus of a prime minister to serve under President Aristide. Simultaneously, an international force would be sent to the Caribbean country under the authority of the Organization of American States or the United Nations, and the O.A.S. embargo against Haiti would be lifted.
 
No Word Yet on Whose Troops
 Officials said the discussions have not reached the stage where the makeup of an international force had been broached.
Although other agreements have stalled in the eight months since the coup, there is now a feeling that the deteriorating situation in Haiti has added a sense of urgency.
"We believe that time is running out," a senior Administration official said, noting that civil unrest is building there amid indications that the army leader, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, is no longer in control of all his forces.
The new moves come as Congress prepares legislation that would reverse an order by President Bush to return Haitian refugees picked up at sea without giving them the opportunity to seek asylum, and as reports mount that the embargo has been ineffective.
Today, a Federal judge in Brooklyn upheld the Administration's order on forced returns. But the judge, Sterling Johnson Jr. of the Eastern District of New York, called the policy "unconscionable" in light of American commitments to international refugee agreements. He was constrained in making his decision, he said, by previous rulings on refugee policy.
A political agreement on Haiti would strengthen the Administration's argument that fleeing Haitians are not politically oppressed. The Administration has been nagged by criticism that its tough refugee policy is at odds with its publicly professed commitment to protect the Haitians' rights.
"It's just two trains heading for each other on the same track," said Holly Burkhalter, Washington director of Human Rights Watch. "The policy of forcing Haitians to return also forces the Administration to cover up abuses in Haiti. It may be that we have competing goals."
The senior Administration official said the renewed talks with governments of the region are aimed at finding a prime ministerial nominee agreeable to the broadest range of Haitians.
In February, Father Aristide and the leaders of Parliament reached an agreement under which Rene Theodore, a Communist, would serve as prime minister in a reconstructed government under an Aristide presidency. But that accord was rejected by the military leadership; by Joseph Nerette, whom the army had installed as president, and by a Supreme Court packed with military appointees.
 
Next Move May Be Aristide's
 On Wednesday, the Government proposed another formula under which Marc Bazin, a conservative economist, would be prime minister and the presidency would be left open with the resignation of Mr. Nerette.
Administration officials believe that this was a step forward by those now in control in Port-au-Prince, and that further progress depends on Father Aristide's willingness to compromise.
But the exiled President has said that he cannot accept the nominee of an illegal leadership, and he is backed in that position by the Organization of American States.
In Congress, among analysts and in some offices of government, there is a growing view that the United States Administration may be getting ready to back away from support of Father Aristide if he does not agree to another prime minister and the introduction of an O.A.S. force.
Robert E. White, Ambassador to El Salvador under President Jimmy Carter and now an analyst at the Center for International Policy, said:
"In effect, United States policy has always been to try to return Aristide, but at the same time to put limitations on his power by strengthening the traditional Haitian elites. The man who was supposedly stubborn and unwilling to deal -- Aristide -- is the man who has made all the concessions. Our friends, the military, have proved utterly intransigent."
Mr. Bush's officials disagree and say that their policy on Haiti has to be studied with a longer perspective. They say the President made a significant commitment to guaranteeing the free elections of December 1990 that brought victory with two-thirds of the vote to Father Aristide, a novice politician with a following among the poor.
 
Initial U.S. Response Lauded
 Douglas W. Payne, director of hemispheric studies at Freedom House in New York, said in an interview that the Administration's initial responses to the coup were good ones.
American aid was suspended, and the economic embargo was achieved. Mr. Payne said these policies ran into trouble because of circumstances in Haiti, where political and economic institutions have been weak or nonexistent.
Trade there, he said, is dominated by smugglers working for well-connected families. These people have been able to continue dealing in contraband, including narcotics, almost without interruption under the embargo.
Europeans' failure to back economic sanctions assisted this trade and made above-board purchases possible. An American business executive in Haiti said in a recent interview that while she preferred using American suppliers for imports, she had no trouble switching to European companies after the embargo went into effect in November.
Mr. Payne said that any political agreement that might involve Mr. Bazin should include the stipulation that aid to Haiti would be resumed on American terms and under American supervision, preferably through international relief agencies with networks in the countryside.
"If indeed the United States feels compelled, for whatever reason, to do business with Mr. Bazin," he said, "any type of aid has to bypass government agencies -- which, as reconstructed under the Duvaliers, became private endowments for those who control them." He referred to the successive dictatorships of Francois Duvalier and his son, Jean-Claude Duvalier, who ruled the country from 1957 to 1986.
Like Father Aristide and a number of analysts, Mr. Payne says he believes that blocking oil shipments to Haiti would be the most effective measure the Administration could take. But this would presumably lead to some form of military action at sea, perhaps in time a blockade.
In fact, analysts say, if the new round of talks on a political solution collapse and violence rises significantly, more than a blockade may have to be considered.
 
Rights Advocate Is Outraged
 "Intervention is the last option left," said Arthur C. Helton, director of the refugee program for the Lawyers' Committee for Human Rights, who added that the continuing flow of refugees might ultimately force the use of arms to restore order in Haiti.
Progressively harsher policies against the refugees -- rather than against the conditions that produce them -- "have made us look like international outlaws abroad," he said. "The humanitarian issues have been completely overwhelmed."
Several policy analysts said that American or O.A.S. armed intervention in Haiti might cause less of a storm in the hemipshere than it would have several years ago, although there remain important O.A.S. countries, particularly Mexico, that oppose military intervention of any kind.
Yankee imperialism is less of a rallying cry when conservative, free-market Governments are concentrating on getting development assistance and trade agreements.
"There is still some of that around," said Carol Graham, a Peruvian-born scholar at the Brookings Institution. "But on the other side there is the counterbalancing view that a more positive role by the United States in these crises would be useful."

HEADLINE: JOBLESS RATE ROSE TO 7.5% FOR MAY, HIGHEST SINCE 1984

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 5

 BODY:
The nation's unemployment rate climbed to 7.5 percent in May from 7.2 percent in April, as young people and other job seekers flocked into a labor market with relatively few openings, Labor Department figures disclosed today. The report was the first broad indicator of business conditions last month.
The sizable increase, which puts the jobless rate at its highest point since 1984, was quickly seized on by Democrats to attack the Bush Administration and to press for a bill to overhaul the unemployment insurance system. The bill is expected to pass handily in a House vote scheduled for next week. 
 But the report was seen by most economists as likely to prove more a political setback to the President -- and a possible blow to consumer confidence -- than as evidence that the fledgling recovery was in jeopardy.
 
White House Is Optimistic
 "I don't think anyone questions the fact that the economy is improving in almost every sector," Marlin Fitzwater, the chief Presidential spokesman, said at the White House in response to questions about the figures. He pointed to the well-established tendency for the jobless rate to rise as recoveries take hold, as people begin looking seriously for jobs again. Those who have given up looking are not counted among the unemployed.
Michael J. Boskin, the President's chief economic adviser, declined to elaborate on Mr. Fitzwater's statement.
But the House majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, declared, "Unemployment is getting worse and the President doesn't realize it."
 
Many Face Loss of Benefits
 He said that high school and college graduates were failing to find work and added that he was also troubled by "the number of long-term unemployed workers -- now 3.5 million strong -- who could face an interruption in their benefits."
Among the changes in the largest states, New Jersey's jump to 9 percent from 7.8 percent was the biggest, while the rate for New York State edged up to 7.9 percent from 7.6 percent. [Page 44.]
The rate for California, which suffered an unspecified loss of jobs from the riots in Los Angeles, rose to 8.7 percent from 8 percent, while the rate for Michigan, benefiting from an automotive upturn, declined to 8.6 percent from 9.4 percent.
While the Administration could take some comfort in the reasons for the higher unemployment rate -- and in some other figures, like a further lengthening of the average workweek -- there were some clear negatives.
Among these were that sizable increases in the ranks of both the newly jobless and the hard-core jobless, a rise in the duration of spells of unemployment, a surge in the number of people who lost, rather than quit, their last jobs and a jump in number of people working part time who would have rather had full-time work.
And by both of the department's surveys, the one that samples 60,000 households and the one that samples more than 350,000 business establishments, jobs were decidedly scarce.
The household survey showed that the labor force rose 330,000 last month, continuing at the stepped-up pace that has prevailed since November, but that the number of jobs actually shrank, by 19,000. This swelled the jobless ranks by 349,000, to a total of 9,504,000, or about 40 percent more than when the latest recession began in July 1990.
Nearly half of the growth last month in the labor force, which had been anemic during most of the recession, was among those aged 16 to 24, the department noted.
Some private analysts questioned the adequacy of the department's seasonal-adjustment procedures in dealing with the end of the school year. They noted that the jobless rate rose two-tenths of a percentage point in May 1991, one of very few increases of that magnitude for the year.
 
Gain Entirely in Services
 The payroll survey, which is watched by economists, posted a gain of 68,000 jobs in May, somewhat less than expected. All of this gain was in services as opposed to goods-producing jobs. Factory jobs fell 10,000 following a 5,000 April gain.
"There's still an awful lot of caution on the part of businesses," said Robert V. Di Clemente, an economist at Salomon Brothers.
But Mr. Di Clemente and others said they were heartened by the longer workweek, which generally is taken to mean that employers will soon need to hire more workers as they exhaust their ability to squeeze more production from existing ones.
The private-sector workweek expanded by six minutes, to 34.5 hours last month, while for manufacturing alone the workweek grew 12 minutes, to 41.3 hours, the highest level since 1966. Factory overtime also rose.
Today's report also showed that the index of aggregate weekly hours, which eased slightly in March and April, rose to 121.5 last month and that the proportion of industries adding workers stood above 50 percent for the second straight month.
 
Short of Expectations
 And while the 68,000 rise in business payrolls fell short of the 100,000 or so that had been expected, analysts also noted that the gains for the two preceding months were revised upward. March now shows a 58,000 gain instead of 39,000 while April's gain is now 182,000 instead of 126,000.
"The economy is making headway, though at a painfully slow pace," said Walter M. Cadette, an economist at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company.
The 76,000 gain in payroll service jobs was the sixth in a row for this sector and included 39,000 in business services, 20,000 in health services, 13,000 in local government and 11,000 in finance. Retail trade, however, lost 44,000 after rising 83,000 in April, a swing that some analysts thought might not reflect reality.
Goods-producing jobs fell 8,000, with weakness continuing in the military-dependent industries producing transportation and electronic equipment. A rise for machinery was entirely the result of a return of strikers at Caterpillar Inc.
The household survey showed that joblessness among young people, those aged 16 to 24, was worse among men. Their rate climbed to 15.9 percent from 14.9 percent while the rate for women in this age group rose to 12.9 from 12.1 percent.
But unemployment for men 25 and older also rose, by nearly 200,000, a change whose significance cannot be determined without additional months of data, William G. Barron Jr., the deputy commissioner of labor statistics, told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress.
The jobless rate for adult men rose five-tenths of a point, to 7.3 percent, while that for adult women eased two-tenths of a point, to 6.1 percent.
Regionally, the jobless rate rose one-tenth of a point in the Northeast and South, to 8 percent and 7.1 percent, respectively. The increase was three-tenths of a point in the Midwest and West, to 7 percent and 7.7 percent.

HEADLINE: Britain and Japan Split With U.S. on Species Pact

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, June 5

 BODY:
Britain and Japan indicated today that they would sign a treaty to protect plants and animals, breaking with the United States and deepening American isolation on an accord that was to be one of the main achievements of the Earth Summit.
The British and Japanese actions left the United States as the last holdout among the major industrial nations on the treaty. American officials also said that the United States delegation was further embarrassed by the earlier disclosure that the White House had rebuffed a proposal by the chief delegate, William K. Reilly, to accept certain modifications in the treaty's language and sign it. 
 [But at a White House news conference, Mr. Bush defended Mr. Reilly and his environmental record, saying, "Mr. Reilly, a top environmentalist, has my full support." Page 6.]
Under the agreement to protect plants and animals, known as the biodiversity treaty, steps would be taken to protect endangered species and the areas they inhabit, but certain kinds of economic development activities would be allowed, including tourism, the gathering of food and the harvesting of resources for development of medicines.
The Bush Administration has argued that the treaty is flawed because it would limit biotechnology development in the United States and could infringe on American patent protection for biological inventions. The Administration is also concerned about how money for third-world countries with endangered species areas would be disbursed.
Britain and Japan have disagreed with the United States on several approaches to the environmental summit meeting, but earlier they had indicated that they would go along with American objections to the treaty.
Today in what some officials acknowledged was pressure from environmentalists in their own countries, leaders of the delegations from those countries said they would sign the accord in spite of their misgivings.
"We are carefully studying certain articles with a view to signing the convention," Shozaburo Nakamura, head of Japan's delegation, said in a speech today.
British diplomats said today that Prime Minister John Major would sign the treaty when he comes here next week. Today, the first day that the treaty was presented here for signing, 16 heads of state or government signed.
United States officials said there was a sense of political crisis surrounding deliberations involving the American delegation. In an unusual development, for example, representatives of the major industrialized nations, including the United States, held a special meeting today specifically to discuss ways to help the Washington delegation ease its isolation at the Rio conference.
One step adopted at that meeting was a decision to offer broad support for an initiative put forward last week by President Bush to put up additional funds and take other steps to protect forests.
Delegates from other nations at the Rio meetings said that the talk of the summit meeting today was what they described as the humiliation of Mr. Reilly, who is head of the Environmental Protection Agency, when it was disclosed that his appeal to change American policy on the biodiversity pact had been turned down.
"What is the White House trying to do to their man here?" said a high-ranking Brazilian diplomat. British, Japanese and Indian delegates said the disclosure of Mr. Reilly's rebuff had been the main subject of discussions in their morning meetings.
 
'Climate of Cynicism'
 As a result of the disclosure, in The New York Times, Mr. Reilly devoted much of his time today to assuring reporters that he would not resign and to defending his reputation as someone who had the confidence of his Government. In a statement issued by his office, Mr. Reilly said it was "most unfortunate that someone within our Government chose to leak information about these most important efforts -- efforts that demanded diplomatic discretion."
"I talked to the President this morning, and he is appalled and outraged by what has happened," Mr. Reilly said. "It's very unhelpful and disloyal to the President."
A senior American delegate, insisting that he not be identified by name, said the embarrassment of Mr. Reilly "contributes to a growing climate of cynicism about the U.S. in Rio." Reflecting the bitterness in Mr. Reilly's camp toward his critics in Washington, that official called the disclosure "a little hand grenade" thrown by middle-level White House officials who see "biodiversity as a disease."
 
Criticism Directed at Bush
 American environmental groups, in Rio as observers and to take part in various ancillary activities, saw the controversy surrounding Mr. Reilly as aggravating the criticism that is likely to be directed at Mr. Bush when he visits Rio next week.
"Coming on the eve of the President's visit here makes it all the more unfortunate," said Scott A. Hajost, a lawyer for the Environmental Defense Fund, a private American group that is critical of the Administration position. "He's about to swoop down here, and he has people in the White House trashing his own representative."
The criticism was echoed by Senator Albert Gore, Democrat of Tennessee, who has long assailed the Administration's environmental policies.
"Once again the principal official in charge of U.S. environmental policy has been overruled -- and this time the whole world is watching," said Senator Gore, who is leading a delegation from the United States Senate at the summit meeting.
The furor surrounding Mr. Reilly's actions, according to officials from various countries, was the culmination of an effort that began earlier this week to modify key provisions of the treaty to win the Administration's support.
 
'Bill Was Really Angry'
 Officials said that the idea of "fixing" the treaty arose on Monday during a meeting here between Mr. Reilly and Marcos Azambuja, Brazil's chief negotiator on the treaties. On Tuesday night, Mr. Reilly conveyed a proposal by telephone to Clayton K. Yeutter, President Bush's domestic policy chief at the White House. On Wednesday evening, he faxed to Mr. Yeutter a confidential draft of proposed language changes.
On Thursday afternoon, an official opposed to making the changes provided a copy of the memo to The New York Times.
"Bill was really angry that that memo had gotten out -- and Bill doesn't anger easily," said an official in the American delegation.

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT DEFENDS U.S. ENVOY IN RIO

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 5

 BODY:
President Bush today defended William K. Reilly, the head of the American delegation to the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, and attacked an unidentified member of his Administration who made public a confidential memorandum in an attempt to embarrass Mr. Reilly.
"Mr. Reilly, a top environmentalist, has my full support," Mr. Bush said at a White House news conference this morning. "He conducts himself the way he should, with great dignity and great decency. That a document that he prepared properly was leaked, I find terribly offensive." 
 But even as the President called the leak "an insidious practice," a struggle over the Administration's environmental policy grew sharper as Mr. Reilly fought back. In Rio, he and his aides blamed staff members of the President's Council on Competitiveness, a group led by Vice President Dan Quayle, for the leak.
Jeffrey Nesbit, a spokesman for the Vice President, denied the accusation, saying that "the assertion that the Competitiveness Council leaked a confidential memo is totally false."
 
Appeal to Bush Fails
 The newest conflict between Mr. Reilly, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Vice President began on Wednesday night when Mr. Reilly made a last-minute appeal to the White House to reverse its position and approve an international treaty to protect the earth's plants and animals. The appeal was rejected, but in Rio today the treaty was signed by delegates of 16 other countries.
Mr. Reilly's confidential memorandum was sent to Clayton K. Yeutter, the President's domestic policy chief, and included a passage that described how the Administration's refusal to sign the treaty was "the major subject of press and delegate concern here." The memorandum said that Brazil had offered to "fix" the treaty to gain the United States' approval. An Administration official, concerned that Mr. Reilly might persuade the White House to sign the treaty, gave a copy of the the memorandum to The New York Times.
The conflict between Mr. Reilly and Mr. Quayle was joined last summer when the Vice President overcame Mr. Reilly's strong opposition and issued a proposed policy that would open 50 million acres of wetlands to development. Since then, the Council on Competitiveness has become one of the Administration's most influential bodies in deciding environmental policy.
The council has been intimately involved in developing the regulatory moratorium and review that the President announced last January. It has also delayed new rules under the 1990 Clean Air Act, and last month gained the President's support for limiting public involvement in deciding how much air pollution a company can emit.
 
Treaty Is Opposed
 The influence of the council extends to international affairs. David M. McIntosh, its 33-year-old executive director, wrote a memorandum in April opposing United States' support for the treaty to protect plants, animals and other biological resources.
The memorandum, which Mr. McIntosh wrote with John Cohrssen, an associate director of the Competitiveness Council, argued that the treaty would harm the ability of biotechnology companies to protect biological inventions developed from resources collected in foreign countries.
Reducing restrictions on testing and marketing genetically engineered products has been one of the central projects undertaken by the Competitiveness Council over the last two years. The memorandum became the basis for the President's decision late last month not to sign the treaty.
"While we recognized the treaty was trying to protect habitats, some provisions were also limiting the ability for research and development of biotechnology products," Mr. McIntosh said in an interview this week. "It conflicted with the President's initiative to speed up biotechnology developments."
Mr. McIntosh said he and Mr. Cohrssen had not expected their memorandum "to stop a treaty."
"We thought people should be made aware of it and let them adjust it in negotiations," he said.
 
'Sound and Sensible'
 Mr. Quayle and his staff insist that the United States has no equal around the world in establishing comprehensive environmental laws. But they say that in many cases the laws are so restrictive and expensive that they are harming initiative and the performance of the American economy. Along with Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr., Mr. Quayle frames the debate as one that pits jobs against the environment.
During a nationally televised news conference on Thursday night, President Bush described the approach his Administration is now taking to environmental policies.
"We've got a sound and sensible record and we have a strong role on international leadership," the President said. "I wonder if the American taxpayer knows that we have spent something like $800 billion in the last 10 years on cleaning up things -- the atmosphere, the environment in many ways.
"I will not sign a treaty that in my view throws too many Americans out of work. I refuse to accept that kind of criticism from what I consider some of the extremes in the environmental movement, internationally or domestically."

HEADLINE: Your Money;
Should Children Collect Insurance?

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
MANY people who would not think of handing over hundreds of thousands of dollars, or a million or more, to their college-age children have inadvertently paved the way for doing just that. What's more, if it happens, they will not be in a position to correct it.
The issue is life insurance. It is quite common for people who have life insurance to name their spouse as primary beneficiary and their children as contingent beneficiaries. Stuart Kessler, a partner in Goldstein, Golub, Kessler & Company and head of personal financial planning for the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, said last week that that was the case with participants in seminars he has conducted for corporate and professional groups. 
 That means that should the insured die, his or her spouse should get the proceeds of the policy. But if husband and wife were killed in the same car or plane crash, for example, the proceeds would go to the children as contingent beneficiaries.
When people have wills written, care is taken not to give young children large amounts of money, Mr. Kessler said. "No one gives substantial amounts to children outright at age 18. But here the children would receive the funds without guardians, trusts or attachments at age 18. This is not what they want."
The simplest solution is to make one's estate the contingent beneficiary, he said, so that the executor can distribute the proceeds of insurance policies in accordance with the terms of the will, perhaps giving children half the assets at age 20 and half at age 30.
There is a potential drawback: If the estate exceeds $600,000, the insurance would be subject to estate tax, which is as high as 55 percent. But Mr. Kessler said this could be avoided by putting the insurance into a trust. "But if it is basically for a spouse, why have it encumbered?" he asked. "Why have a trustee doling it out to a widow?"
His recommendation for people whose estates will clearly be under $600,000 is to make the estate the contingent beneficiary. For those who have more -- or will be likely to after a few years' growth in assets -- more planning is needed.
Part of the insurance coverage will probably be for the spouse, and in that case making the estate the contingent beneficiary is probably preferable to encumbering the policy for the spouse. And part will be for the children, and it could be put into a trust to escape estate taxes.
Second-to-die insurance should always be in trust, Mr. Kessler said, because its purpose is to pay estate taxes when assets are not liquid, perhaps because they are in real estate or a family business. "The trust indenture has to be drawn before the policy is taken out," he said.
 
June 15 Estimates
 Tax professionals are howling that Congress is demanding an impossible-to-achieve pinpoint accuracy with estimated tax payments due June 15.
People whose income is not subject to withholding, or who would have too great a shortfall between withholding and taxes, must pay estimated taxes each quarter. In recent years, there have been two safe harbors for the estimates -- 90 percent of the current year's taxes or 100 percent of the previous year's, a readily available figure.
But in November, to provide money for extended unemployment benefits, Congress decided to deny certain upper-income taxpayers the second test. Those whose adjusted gross income exceeds $75,000, and whose income exceeds the previous year's by $40,000 or more and who owed estimated payments in each of the last three years are denied what Julian Block, a tax lawyer in Larchmont, N.Y., calls "the 100 percent escape hatch."
If they fail to pay 90 percent of this year's liability, they will be subject to a penalty linked to the interest rate on Treasury bills, which will be about 7 percent for 1992.
The problem, said Jack Porter, head of BDO Seidman's national tax office in Washington is that "the tax computation can be more complicated than doing an actual return because you have to annualize."
What's more, many small businesses and partnerships cannot do all their own calculations in time to make accurate estimates. If they underestimate their liability, they will have to pay the penalty. But if they overestimate, they are effectively extending to the Government an interest-free loan.
"It's outrageous," Mr. Porter said. But, since the penalty is often less than the accounting fees for calculating an accurate estimate, he advises making a best guess and paying the penalty if need be. "I tell clients who are having a hard time that it's a bona fide borrowing," he said.
Donald H. Skadden, vice president-taxation of the accountants' institute, said the institute had issued a 25-page practice guide to members and advised them to "try to calculate as accurately as you can."
The institute has asked Congress to create a second safe harbor, set at 115 percent of last year's liability. "But sadly it is not available for this period," Mr. Skadden said.

HEADLINE: Wet Shoes and Traffic Delays: A Most Blustery Day

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD

 BODY:
Last weekend ended with a daylong downpour. This weekend started with one, leaving the Friday evening rush a blustery, squishy, waterlogged mess that tied up traffic, triggered flood alerts and pushed area commuters to the edge of their endurance.
When a pair of subway delays conspired to fling several hundred commuters at the window of a transfer agent at the 59th Street station, he ignored the crush and yelled that as far as he was concerned the trains were running on time. "I can't give out transfers," he shouted. "I'll call the police and tell them to bring shotguns." A few people shouted back. Most just trudged up the stairs to face the elements. 
 Matters were far worse for those heading to homes outside Manhattan. An early-afternoon bus accident on the New Jersey Turnpike left 45 people with minor injuries and tied up traffic for 14 miles.
The accident occurred at 1:20 P.M. when a flatbed trailer jackknifed across three lanes of the turnpike near Newark International Airport, Trooper Lee Hendrickson said.
As it twisted, the rear of the trailer slammed into a tour bus carrying 43 senior citizens on a trip to the Pennsylvania Dutch country, forcing it off the road. The bus slid to the left shoulder and into a temporary bridge abutment. Another truck then hit the jackknifed trailer. The injured were taken to five area hospitals where they were treated and released.
The police cleared the accident just before 4 P.M., but the combined force of high winds, a driving rain and Friday night traffic left the route jammed until well after dark.
 
Complaints Via Car Phones
 A shorter but no less irksome traffic stalemate tied up commuters leaving Manhattan through the Lincoln Tunnel. Flooding on Route 3 between Broad Street and Bloomfield Avenue in Clifton, N.J., choked the traffic flow for a mile and a half along that six-lane highway, leaving hundreds of cars stuck in about three feet of water.
The highway was closed just before 6 P.M., at the height of the weekend exodus from New York. Police tried to back up each car to the closest exit, causing even more confusion. The roadway remained closed until 11 P.M., the Clifton police said.
"The people are not happy," said Lieut. Lon Parrella of the Clifton police. He added that he was fielding dozens of complaints from stranded motorists calling in on their car phones. "I have to just tell them to get comfortable," he said. "I don't know if it could get much worse."
It was the soggiest June 5 that the Weather Service has recorded. At 12:20 A.M. the Weather Service reported that 2.52 inches had fallen in Central Park, surpassing the previous record of 1.76 inches, set in 1920. In Atlantic City, 2.69 inches had fallen by 12:20 A.M., erasing the previous record of .42 inches, set in 1975, the Weather Service said.
In New York City, most people grumbled about wet shoes, the absence of taxis, the high price of umbrellas and their general, though largely inaccurate, sense that this has been an unusually rainy spring.
"Why does New York go crazy in the rain?" asked Joyce Kirkpatrick, 24, a librarian with Business Week, as she stood 25th in line for a taxi outside Penn Station. "You can't get a cab. The traffic is 20 times worse. Even the subways are crowded."
Marvin Fox, an umbrella vendor standing outside Penn Station, complained that business was bad. "There's a lot of people with no umbrellas walking with bags on their heads, books, coats, even nothing," he said. "It must be the economy."
 
Some Saw Silver Linings
 But some in the city responded with elan. "I like the rain," said Joanne Lee, 19, a Boston University student who was debating whether to take a train or stay the weekend. "I like the smell after the rain. I like it because you get to stay in. I don't like always having to be in action."
Despite the complaints, the weather experts were unfazed. "It hasn't actually been that rainy," said Daniel H. Graf, a meteorologist with the Penn State Weather Communications Group in University Park, Pa.
"Three years ago was the worst May on record," he said. "We had 10.24 inches in 1989. This May we only had 4.02, which wasn't far from normal. But, I guess if it's raining today, people just forget about three years ago."

HEADLINE: Dinkins Returning from Europe, Hoping Investment Will Follow

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAMBURG, Germany, June 5

 BODY:
Wrapping up a five-day European trip in which he sold New York City to business leaders as a once and future financial center, Mayor David N. Dinkins heads home Saturday with few firm commitments but encouraging signs that European businesses are willing to invest more money in New York.
In London, the Mayor spoke to Conrad M. Black, owner of The Daily Telegraph and the leading prospective buyer of The Daily News. In Paris, he was warmly greeted by Mayor Jacques Chirac, a conservative whose remarks were seen as blessing directed toward the business community. 
 In more than 20 meetings and seminars, he has told foreign executives about falling crime rates and falling real estate prices. He has trumpeted New York's tax incentives, its communications system and its cultural life. He has called the city "the richest marketplace on the planet" and "a key center of international trade, communications, finance and tourism."
Mr. Dinkins has often said similar things at home. But while New Yorkers often respond with skepticism, Europe's business elite, for the most part, has been eager to listen to Mr. Dinkins's sales pitch. In some cases, it has been clear that he was preaching to the converted. In others, European executives said they wanted to hear more about specific incentives for doing business in New York City.
 
Positive About Investment
 "I feel very good about the trip," Mr. Dinkins said last night after the last reception. "I'm satisfied it was wise to come. Everyone has said that."
Mr. Dinkins added that he believed his presence on the trip had underscored the credibility of the delegation.
Business leaders who met with the Mayor said that New York was still perceived here as the premier place in America to invest, especially in the financial services, entertainment and fashion industries. That holds true, they said, despite worries about crime, racial tensions and the city's fiscal stability.
"The Germans are more positive about New York than the Americans themselves," said Michael Dornemann, chairman of Bertelsmann Music Group, which just bought a building at 1541 Broadway.
And Mr. Dinkins's message has been helped by a widespread perception here that the United States' economy is recovering and New York's sagging real-estate market means bargain rents.
"It's a good time," said Richard Branson, the chief executive of Virgin Holding Company, after meeting the Mayor. "The pound's strong. America has all the indications of coming out of the recession, but real estate is unlikely to come much further down. It's time to get in there now."
 
Trip Paid for by Chamber
 Other executives tempered their enthusiasm with a warning that they needed fewer sales pitches and more specifics.
"I've heard a lot of encouraging noises but I have yet to see a greater endeavor," said Roger Saul, the director of the Mulberry Company of London, a clothing concern, after a breakfast meeting with the Mayor on Monday. "To go into New York is prohibitive unless we were to be offered a package of incentives that would make it worthwhile."
Another British fashion executive, Dick Polak, said, "It doesn't appear to me that they exactly know what they are targeting. It looks like a very early stage, a fact-finding mission."
Mr. Dinkins was leading a delegation of 15 business executives from the New York Chamber of Commerce, which had planned the trip to promote the city as a base for foreign headquarters and paid for the Mayor's expenses.
The delegation's strategy was to have Mr. Dinkins make his sales pitch at business seminars for middle-sized companies interested in expanding. He also spoke to local chambers of commerce in London, Paris and Frankfurt.
The Mayor and members of the delegation also met one-on-one with bankers and several corporate executives who have expressed interest in doing business in New York. Those meeting produced the seeds of future deals, participants said.
 
Investment Ideas Discussed
 In Britain, for instance, the Mayor and Mr. Black discussed some city-owned sites for a new printing plant for The Daily News, including the Brooklyn Navy Yard, people at the meeting said.
With Mr. Branson, the delegation tried to sell him the idea of locating one of the company's giant record stores in Times Square. Mr. Branson said later the meeting "persuaded us to take a look at it much quicker than we would have done."
Members of the delegation also discussed with Pearson P.L.C., the British communications company, the possibility of building a Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum in midtown.
The delegation also held talks with the Ladbroke Group, a British company that owns betting parlors. The company's managing director, Cyril Stein, expressed interest in buying the city's Off-Track Betting Corporation. The city budget calls for selling the agency for at least $50 million.
 
Some Doubts Dispelled
 Mr. Dinkins also spent much time paying courtesy calls on businesses that have already invested in New York, his aides said. Large private luncheons were held in Paris and London for companies with North American headquarters in New York. A meeting with the Frankfurt Chamber of Commerce today, for instance, was attended by only 25 businesses, most of them consulting firms or companies with significant branches in New York.
The previous day, in Paris, Mr. Dinkins visited Galeries Lafayette, the department store, which recently opened a branch in Trump Tower, and spoke to a group of about 20 designers, all of whom have New York businesses. At a cocktail reception in London on Tuesday, he addressed a crowd of entertainment industry executives, most of whom spend half their time in New York.
"We've all been there," said Dennis Johnson, a British publisher who has offices in New York. "This is not Singapore. But you've got to give him 10 out of 10 for standing up there and saying 'this is New York City' to people who know it."
Those meetings were aimed at retaining businesses that might consider leaving.
"That's a big part of it," said a member of the Mayor's delegation who asked not to be identified. "You go. You hold their hand. You say we love you. Everybody feels better."
At the seminars for smaller firms, many of which have no link to New York, yet, many business executives said they came away with a new impression of the city.
"On the tax side, I was surprised," said Charmaine McMillan, an executive with the British company, Computer People. "You have an automatic perception that taxes are going to be higher in New York."
An interior designer who attended the London seminar, Peter J. Hines, said he would love to move his small business to New York, but he worried about crime because he has two children. He said he was encouraged by the Mayor's speech.
"New York has become a stereotype image," Mr. Hines said. "Fast, brash, violent, exciting, chic, international, broke."

HEADLINE: $2 Billion Accord Reached On Emergency Aid to Cities

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 5

 BODY:
Unwilling to wait another day for White House consent, House and Senate negotiators today established a $2 billion emergency urban aid package intended to create summer jobs for inner-city youths, expand the Head Start preschool program and rebuild businesses destroyed last month in the Los Angeles riots.
The House-Senate conference committee action was meant to increase pressure on the White House either to agree to a plan to establish thousands of summer jobs for urban teen-agers or to risk losing $800 million in grants and loans that it wants to provide Los Angeles and Chicago. 
 Afterward, Republican members read a letter from the White House Office of Management and Budget saying that senior officials would advise Mr. Bush to veto the measure.
 
Possibility of Compromise
 But Judy Smith, a White House spokeswoman, left the door open for a compromise, saying, "We continue to hope that a reasonable bill might be developed."
White House and Congressional negotiators have appeared close to an agreement on an emergency package for the past three weeks, but the talks have stalled in recent days over issues like ways to finance the legislation and tax breaks to lure businesses into inner cities. They are expected to meet again early next week.
The Bush Administration has been badly split over how much to compromise with Congressional Democrats. Several Cabinet members, led by Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp, believe that Mr. Bush must take decisive action in the aftermath of the Los Angeles riots and work toward a compromise on long-term urban programs like changes in the welfare system in the coming months.
But another faction in the Administration, led by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, has argued that the Democrats are merely setting the President up for an embarrassing veto and have no intention of compromising on items that are dear to conservatives in an election year.
 
'Weed and Seed' Program
 The emergency bill could potentially bring as much as $70 million to cities in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, much of which would go to a program called "weed and seed," which the Administration strongly supports. Under such programs, detectives and specially trained police assault teams go into inner-city neighborhoods to clean out gangs and drug dealers before educational and other social welfare programs are installed.
Over all, the measure would provide $675 million for Federal summer jobs programs, $250 million for summer Head Start programs, $250 million for summer school programs for disadvantaged elementary and secondary schools and $250 million for "weed and seed."
The appropriations conference committee made its decision by voice vote, largely along party lines. But Senators Mark Hatfield of Oregon, the ranking Republican on the Senate Appropriations Committee, and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, another Republican, joined Democrats in supporting the legislation.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, a leading proponent of the legislation, said the legislation could "make a clear and present difference to cities across America this summer."
But Senator Thad Cochran, Republican of Mississippi, reflecting a sentiment heard from lawmakers from rural states, said, "I think it's unfair to have big cities raiding the Treasury at a time when we're hard-pressed to get money that we need for education, health care and many other important programs in our rural areas and towns." He added that the violence in Los Angeles "shouldn't be rewarded with a lot of new assistance programs for many other cities."
 
Charge of Playing Politics
 Conservative lawmakers should be able to muster enough votes to deprive Democrats of a veto-proof margin when a vote is taken on the final version of the agreement.
Jerry Lewis of California, a senior Republican on the House Appropriations Committee, accused Democrats of playing politics with the bill. "Senate Democrats decided they wanted to stick it to the President," he said in an interview. "They're breaking all the budget agreements."
The conference bill reconciled House and Senate versions of the legislation. The House version provided $822 million in emergency loans and grants to Los Angeles to rebuild after the disturbances and to Chicago to fix damages from a downtown flood in April. The Senate version added $1.5 billion more aid to 75 cities.
Mr. Bush came out in favor of the House version, but the conference committee product is far more similar to the Senate bill. The final version took about $25 million in employment aid out of the Senate measure.
The $1.5 billion extra aid in the Senate bill, a package of summer jobs, law enforcement and educational programs, was worked out by Senator Kennedy and Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah. Mr. Hatch has strenuously argued for the added aid to Republican colleagues and aides at the White House, and he made his pitch publicly to give the Congressional initiative some bipartisan impetus.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mostly Lower On Signs of Weak Economy

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished mostly lower on world currency markets yesterday, after the Government released data showing that the nation's unemployment rate surged in May.
Gold prices rose slightly. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $338.70 an ounce, up 10 cents from Thursday. Later, the Republic National Bank quoted a bid of $338.60, up 20 cents. 
 Heavy morning trading reflected the bad economic news, said Renato Strauss, a foreign exchange dealer with Bank Julius Baer & Company.
The Labor Department said unemployment jumped to 7.5 percent in May, the highest level in nearly eight years. Many economists had expected the jobless rate to hold steady at April's 7.2 percent.
"The dollar reflected the market's belief that because of the poor unemployment data, U.S. interest rates might go south," said Lloyd Atkinson, chief economist for the Bank of Montreal.
In recent weeks, the Government has released conflicting reports about the strength of the economic recovery. That has prompted speculation the Federal Reserve might step in to cut interest rates to stimulate the economy.
Lower rates tend to scare the dollar market because they would make dollar-denominated securities less valuable to investors, thereby decreasing need for the currency.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 127.55 Japanese yen from 127.70 yen Thursday. Later, in London, it fell to 126.70 yen. In New York, the dollar fell to 126.65 yen, from 127.40 yen late Thursday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.8350, from $1.8255 late Thursday. In New York, the pound fetched $1.8335, up from $1.8265.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday, were: 1.5900 German marks, down from 1.5980; 1.4525 Swiss francs, down from 1.4625; 5.3550 French francs, down from 5.3800; 1,203.00 Italian lire, down from 1,208.00, and 1.19225 Canadian dollars, down from 1.19605.

HEADLINE: Comes a Hunk of Junk, Goes a Chunk of Steel

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEDFORD, L.I., June 5

 BODY:
Sam Gershowitz warns visitors to his recycling center to park their cars outside the gates. Otherwise, their cars could end up in the shredder.
"Believe me, it's happened," said Mr. Gershowitz, who is 52 years old and has been recycling abandoned American dream machines for almost 30 years. He grinds them into metal chunks about the size of a coffee can and feeds them back into a growing world market that regards the United States as the Saudi Arabia of scrap. 
 "We've had people pull up to the office up in an old car looking for a used tire or headlight," he said. "And when they turn around, they see their car heading up the conveyor belt to the shredder. We had to buy one guy a new car."
 
A Long Idle Stretch
 For Mr. Gershowitz and others in the scrap-metal business, the recession has brought hard times, with the supply of junk cars down along with the demand for scrap metal.
"No one has to be a brain surgeon to know that car sales have been off for two and a half years," he said. "And people get rid of their old clunkers only when they buy new cars."
But Mr. Gershowitz believes the economy has bottomed out. He has seen a slight upturn in business in recent months and expects the autumn to bring a wave of junk cars as new-car sales continue to improve.
His optimism was echoed by Robert J. Garino, director of commodities for the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries in Washington. He said the recycling industry suffered along with the rest of the country during the recession but said recent indications showed that the economy "looks more and more positive."
Last year, United States automakers produced 8 million shiny new cars for American consumers, who discarded just as many and more. The discards average one ton and 6.7 years on the road. They did not just disappear, but were chewed up by some 200 giant shredders across the country.
The $7 million shredder at the Gershow Recycling yard here did its part last year by processing more than 100,000 cars; enough to fill the Long Island Expressway for 70 miles from the Riverhead exit to Manhattan, bumper to bumper, all six lanes, said Kevin Gershowitz.
Kevin, 24, who with his twin brother, Elliot, joined their father to help run the family business after graduation from college a year ago, has computerized the operations of the three Gershow Recycling Centers on Long Island. He said that junk cars accounted for 70 percent of all Gershow's scrap products.
Mr. Garino, of the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, said that nationwide, recycling operations divert approximately 100 million tons of metal, paper, plastic, glass and textiles from the nation's waste stream each year, with steel being the largest component.
He said that about 40 million tons of scrap steel was consumed by mills in the United States in 1991, providing 41 percent of the 96 million tons of steel demanded by the milling industry. Iron and steel exports in 1991 totaled 9.7 million tons, with Turkey the largest importer, followed by Korea, India and Malaysia.
He said the average price for a ton of steel scrap has fallen 13 percent because of the low demand during the recession, from $107.50 in 1990, to $93.50 in the spring 1992. "But we're pretty sure the worst is behind us," Mr. Garino said. "As the economy picks up, we won't be far behind."
Mr. Gershowitz prefers not to discuss prices or profits. "We operate on narrow margins, and we don't want to tip our hand to our competitors," he said. However, he did say he paid an average of $35 for old cars that roll into his lot.
 
Eviscerated Vehicles
 Mr. Gershowitz set up his first shop in a small auto-parts yard in Central Islip in 1964. "I was riding around one day looking for discards when I spotted an enormous number of abandoned automobiles in town landfills," he said.
"The towns didn't know what to do with them then," he said. "The Town of Brookhaven was burying the cars, the Town of Islip was dumping them in a sump that was filled with water and the Town of Smithtown was stacking them in highway department garages.
"When I offered them a dollar a car, they thought I was nuts. They were accustomed to paying $5 to $10 a car for people to come and take them and strip them.
"So I began mining cars out of these old dumps, flattening them and taking them off their hands."
His business has grown along with the population in Suffolk County, which has increased from 400,000 in 1962 to the current 1.3 million. He bought his 15-acre site here in Medford in 1973, with a permit to install an automobile shredder, the first on Long Island. At the time there were 40 such shredders across the country. Eight are in the New York metropolitan area.
He said the shredder has a vacuum cleaner that picks up whatever is nonmetallic -- material from the seats and interior, floor mats and carpeting -- and therefore not marketable. The material is taken to the town landfill. The metal scrap, about 80 percent of the car, is recycled into new products.
"A big percentage of our stuff now goes domestic," Mr. Gershowitz said. "Many of the new mills that are opening up only use scrap, and one of the scraps they love is shredded scrap.
"We ship to one mini-mill, Raritan River Steel, in New Jersey. Their wire-rod products include things like bedsprings, paper clips and chain-link fencing."
 
The Final Parking Spot
 The shredding process, although strictly mechanical, is not without emotion when it comes to parting with some automobiles.
"A couple of years ago some guy brought in an old Chevy, and he was very attached to it," Mr. Gershowitz said. "We don't usually do this, but we shredded the car and gave him a couple of pieces to remember it by.
"Another guy, whose mother still had her first car, a 1962 Buick, asked if he could bring her down and watch as the crane pick it up and put it into the shredder," he said. "It was almost like a funeral."

HEADLINE: Carbon Tax: Green Twist on Oil Price

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Preparing for the Earth Summit that opened in Rio de Janeiro this week, representatives of the European Community's 12 nations proposed a carbon tax -- a tax tied to the amount of carbon dioxide that burning the fuel creates.
That step reopened an old dispute over the pricing of oil: When the importing nations talk of raising prices to hold down consumption, exporting nations threaten to do the job for them and keep the revenue for themselves. 
 After the commissioners of the European Community conditionally approved a carbon tax that would amount to $3 a barrel on oil, and would rise to $10 a barrel by 2000, Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, quickly responded that it would simply freeze its level of production, which would force up the price of oil. And sure enough, as soon as the Saudis spoke, the price rose $1 a barrel.
 As it happens, the European tax is contingent upon the United States and Japan going along -- such a huge "if" that it will probably be a stopper. The tax would be based in part on carbon-dioxide creation and in part on fuel costs, covering coal, oil, natural gas and, oddly, nuclear energy, which produces no carbon dioxide.
From the Saudis' point of view, these latest events must be exasperating. For years the governments of countries that import oil pleaded with Riyadh to invest in new pumping capacity, to permit price stability and allow the importers' economies to grow. That request became urgent after Iraq invaded Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia quickly obliged by raising its production to 8.5 million barrels a day, from 5.5 million.
Now, suddenly, at least in the European Community, governments want to increase the price of oil, to cut consumption.
There is not much new in the struggle over who will grow rich on oil. Daniel Yergin, an energy historian, pointed out that oil producers sought higher prices in the 1960's and 1970's after European countries raised taxes on oil as a means of raising revenue. "It's deja vu, but seen through green-tinted sunglasses," he said, noting that consumers might feel good about a "green tax" meant to help the environment.
But even if the industrial world eventually agrees on a carbon tax, its effects are not so clear. It might not hurt exporters, at least not as badly as it looks at first glance. And the weapon chosen by Saudi Arabia, a pre-emptive price rise, may not be useful to the kingdom.
For one thing, Saudi Arabia's thinking for a decade has been to assure a future demand for oil, because it has a supply in the ground that would last for decades. Thus in every price move it tries to engineer, it will want to avoid making oil so costly that the alternatives are economically attractive.
 
Oil May Do Well
 Even if a carbon tax emerges from the Rio meeting, oil may not do so badly. If drafted the way scientists want, such a tax would hit hardest not at oil but at coal.
Roger Dower, a climate change expert at the World Resources Institute, suggested that the European Community might soon move to reorganize its taxes, keeping total revenue constant but gathering more from high-carbon fuels like coal and less from low-carbon ones like natural gas. If fuels are taxed on the basis of their carbon content, oil is in a strong position relative to coal. "Oil could hardly lose," he said.
The proposal the European Community has on the table in Rio is essentially hypothetical, given the unlikelihood that the United States and Japan will go along. Even some members of the community may balk.
Peter Beutel, an analyst at Pegasus Econometric Associates, described the sudden price run-up in the oil markets as "a series of emotional reactions to emotional reactions."
Even if the developed world eventually imposes such a tax, this alone does not imply lower oil sales, at least not for long, although it might mean a loss of income to oil-exporting nations.
Anthony E. Reinsch, vice president of the Canadian Energy Research Institute, in Calgary, Alberta, ran a computer simulation that assumed a tax of 10 percent on light-oil products, like gasoline and diesel oil, in the major industrial countries. The result, he said, was to depress demand and therefore the world price of oil, which stimulated demand in countries that did not impose a tax.
 
Undercutting the Logic
 "The net impact from a volume standpoint was zero," he said. "There was a dip and then a recovery."
If the world economy behaved like the model, that would undercut the logic of a carbon tax, because it would put the countries that imposed the tax at a competitive disadvantage.
Mr. Reinsch described Saudi Arabia's recent move as "a little bit of soap-boxing," and Mr. Beutel suggested that if the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries actually raised the price $2 or $3 a barrel, the higher price would coax forth new supplies that would bring the price back down anyway.
But all this gives more credence to the carbon tax proposal than it may deserve. Agreeing on the details of such a tax will always be difficult for the world, and even for Europe alone.
"Because of the difference in the fuel mix, different countries have quite distinct and different perceptions of where the balance should be set," said Irving Mintzer, the coordinator of the Stockholm Environmental Institute's Climate Change and Sustainable Development Program.
A tax based strictly on carbon content would be seen by some members of the European Community as too favorable to France and its policy of nuclear power, he said. Other countries, including the United States, have politically powerful coal interests. No country relishes seeing its energy prices rise higher than its neighbor's, handicapping its industries.
 
Fear of Saudi Action
 At present, the logic that prevails in the market is the Saudi threat, with about $1 of the current price of oil representing anticipation of constricted supply. "This has very definitely affected the psychology of the market," Mr. Yergin said.
The factors that contribute to the price increase, he pointed out, include expectations for a global economic recovery and rising demand, along with anticipation of the normal increase in demand in the third quarter of every year.
Separating the other factors from the fear of Saudi action is difficult. By the time the Earth Summit ends, the possibility of a carbon tax may have faded.

HEADLINE: Employment Data Weak In Region

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
In a persistent sign of economic weakness in New York and New Jersey, the Labor Department said yesterday that unemployment rates increased in both states in May, with New Jersey's rate rising to 9 percent from 7.8 percent in April.
Economists in the region, who were surprised by the jump in unemployment, said it clouded other evidence that the two states, which were among the first to enter recession, were approaching bottom. They said they were particularly surprised by -- and could not account for -- the increase in New Jersey. 
 Jesse Benjamin, the assistant regional commissioner of the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics in New York, said job losses earlier in the year were concentrated in wholesale and retail trade in both states, and construction in New Jersey. Although the report yesterday did not provide new data for separate industries for May, he said trade and construction might have continued to shed workers in the region.
But the increase in unemployment may have resulted largely from a seasonal increase in the number of people seeking work, particularly among high school and college students who have been looking for summer jobs.
"Young people have been pouring out of colleges and schools into what was already a pretty weak labor market," said Rosemary Scanlon, chief economist for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
She added that the increase in unemployment "shows that people think things are getting better, and are looking for work."
The Labor Department said the unemployment rate for New York State was 7.9 percent in May, compared with 7.6 percent in April and 7.2 percent in May of last year. It had reached a high of 8.9 percent in February.
The rate for New York City in May was 10.5 percent, compared with 9.5 percent in April and 8.9 percent in May a year earlier. The city's rate reached a high in February of 10.9 percent.
In New Jersey, the Labor Department said, the 9 percent rate in May compared with 6.6 percent a year earlier. It was the state's highest unemployment rate since December 1982, when it was 9.2 percent.
The Government did not report a May unemployment rate for Connecticut.

HEADLINE: Dow Off 1.04 in Reaction to Jobs Data

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The stock market ended with a small loss yesterday in an erratic session influenced greatly by unexpectedly weak news on employment.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which was down 25 points at midday, closed 1.04 points lower at 3,398.69. For the week, the average had a net gain of 1.81 points.
Big Board volume came to 201.4 million shares, slightly lower than the 204.4 million shares traded Thursday. Declining issues outnumbered advances, 868 to 780. 
 The broader markets were mostly flat, with the New York Stock Exchange composite index losing 0.02 point, to 227.88; the Nasdaq composite index falling 2.83 points, to 585.43; the Standard and Poor's 500 gaining 0.22 point, to 413.48, and the American Stock Exchange index dropping 0.02, to 397.16.
The Labor Department reported that the civilian unemployment rate jumped to 7.5 percent in May from 7.2 percent in April, reaching its highest level in almost eight years.
The department also said that nonfarm payroll employment increased by a smaller than expected 68,000 last month. Most analysts were expecting a rise of 100,000 jobs.
Analysts said the figures unsettled traders, who had been growing increasingly confident that a recovery from the recession was gathering momentum.
However, the jobs news seemingly enhanced the chances that the Federal Reserve might ease credit conditions further, which helped push interest rates lower in the credit markets.
That buoyed stock prices in the afternoon, because lower borrowing costs for corporations increase profit margins.
 
Active Issues
 Reebok International tumbled 2 1/2, to 23 1/2, in active trading. Late Thursday, the footwear company projected lower earnings for the second quarter, citing increased marketing expenses.
Walt Disney, also among the volume leaders, fell 3/4, to 36 1/2. Euro Disney said Thursday that it could not be certain of making a profit in the fiscal year that ends in September.
Other losers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, down 1 1/8 at 74 3/8; Merck, down 1/2 at 49 3/8; American Express, down 3/8 at 23 5/8; Procter & Gamble, down 2 3/8 at 100 5/8, and Exxon, down 1/4 at 62 3/4.
On the plus side, American President gained 2 1/2, to 46 3/8. The shipping company said it would pay $44 apiece for the 923,000 shares tendered under an offer that expired Thursday and would buy back another one million shares.
Intertan tumbled 4 7/8, to 15 1/2. The appliance retailer announced a restructuring plan involving the closing of some 200 stores, which it said would result in a larger loss than expected in its fiscal fourth quarter ending June 30.
Xoma dropped 1/2, to 14 3/4, on top of a 4 3/4 loss Thursday, when the company reported that the Food and Drug Administration said additional tests might be needed on its toxic shock drug.

HEADLINE: U.S. Bond Prices Rise on Mixed Jobs Data

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved higher and interest rates declined yesterday after the Government released May employment statistics that painted a mixed picture for the economy.
After looking at the data, traders and analysts said the report had elements of both strength and weakness. 
 "As a whole, the employment report was quite consistent with the sluggish but accelerating recovery we have predicted for so long," analysts at MMS International, an economic information and service company, said in their daily market commentary.
 
Some Surprising Numbers
 The increase of 68,000 reported in nonfarm payroll employment for May was well short of most Wall Street estimates, and the sharp rise in the unemployment rate, to 7.5 percent from 7.2 percent, was a surprise.
At the same time, economists noted that payroll gains recorded in March and April were revised upward.
And during May, the factory workweek rose by two-tenths of a percent, to its highest level since 1966. Rather than continue to expand hours, manufacturers at some point soon will probably start hiring more workers, the analysts said.
"When you have the length of the workweek at its highest level in 26 years and overtime at its highest level since April 1973, that has to be a precursor of more employment later on," said Norman Robertson, chief economist at the Mellon National Bank in Pittsburgh.
The big jump in the unemployment rate raised once again the question of whether the Federal Reserve Board would cut short-term interest rates.
 
No Fed Action
 The Fed did nothing to fuel such speculation yesterday, as it refrained from open market operations.
"The political pressures on the Fed are going to be intense," Mr. Robertson said. "But I don't think it will do much to help the economy if they cut the Fed funds rate again. We are in for a period of slow, erratic growth, which is not a prescription politicians like when they are running for office."
Prices of outstanding Treasury securities rose by as much as half a point early in the session, but later gave back some of the gains.
By late yesterday, the Treasury's 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 10125/32 , up 11/32 , to yield 7.84 percent, compared with 7.87 percent late Thursday and 7.83 percent the previous Friday.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 10113/32 in late trading, up 15/32 , to yield 7.29 percent. And the 5 1/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 1001/32 , up 1/8 point, to yield 5.10 percent.
 
Short-Terms Rates Fall
 Hopes of another Fed easing move helped to push down rates on short-term Treasury bills.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.67 percent late yesterday, down 2 basis points, or two one-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by a similar amount, to a late offered rate of 3.80 percent.
The decline in interest rates encouraged a number of corporations to price new debt securities, with offerings totaling almost $1 billion.

Rainbow Not Needed For Heart and Courage

BYLINE: By Douglas Martin

 BODY:
THIS old world spins so fast you're lucky if you catch the headlines, much less the stories. So we miss what's most interesting, the stories behind the stories.
Take the three-week-old strike at the fabled Rainbow Room. The facts are straightforward: 140 workers, a bit less than half the staff, are on strike for better wages, benefits and working conditions. 
 Each day on the picket line you can find one William Rodriguez, who, as a waiter at the Rockefeller Center restaurant for more than four years, suavely served monarchs, mayors, mavens and mavericks -- not to mention Barbra Streisand and Cher. His story goes to the core of what heart still beats in this city's sagging chest.
Mr. Rodriguez's mission in life for the last two years has been caring for a sister with AIDS. Her name is Elizabeth Carucci and she lives with him in his South Bronx apartment.
He was able to balance everything, until the Rainbow Room started putting him on double shifts. As a result, he began showing up late for work, something he says he repeatedly tried to explain in written memos. On the morning of March 19, he says, he arrived 45 minutes after the assigned starting time, because he had to pick up his sister's food stamps.
He was dismissed. The restaurant refused to pay him unemployment because he was fired for cause. Now, his reinstatement has become a demand of the union, Local 6 of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees International Union.
Jessica Miller, spokeswoman for the Rainbow Room, said that he was officially dismissed on March 20, but declined further comment. "We really kind of respect people's privacy," she said.
William Rodriguez was on the doorsteps of his dream, on 138th Street at an address he doesn't want publicized. It is called Mott Haven House, named for the struggling neighborhood surrounding it.
Mr. Rodriguez, dressed all in black and moving with a cat's grace, said that he had spent most of his savings on a $10,000 down payment and closing costs to buy the 110-year-old house. The deal on the $55,000 property closed on April 22, and a party was held last week to celebrate what lies ahead.
First will come a lot of cleaning, as the place has seen better days. Then the dream will begin to come true. Mr. Rodriguez, who is 41 years old, is driven by a vision that the house will be a residence for women with AIDS. He sees six women living there, including his sister.
They will go to a home that has been a woman's refuge for a long time, albeit unofficially. Several months ago, an 87-year-old woman who had lived here 67 years left to join younger family members. With her went her daughter and another, the last of a long chain of the women she preferred as boarders.
"You can feel the presence of women here," Mr. Rodriguez said, gazing at a scene that included plastic flowers and frayed lace, a faded picture of F.D.R. and another of Jesus with the lambs.
A battered upright piano already presides over the room Mr. Rodriguez sees as a library and recreation room. In the debilitated eating area, he sees a gleaming country kitchen. He sees washers and dryers, new beds and sofas, a cache of the popular videos his sister likes so much.
But the acquisition he wants first is more prosaic. A Dumpster for all the junk and rubble.
Why does a man do something like this? The first answer is Lizzie, Mr. Rodriguez's nickname for his 32-year-old sister. His life has become making her breakfasts of fresh fruit and oatmeal, massaging her back, helping her fight relatives to determine custody of her two young children.
"I'm the eldest and I love my sister," he said flatly.
Another has to do with his background. "I'm the son of a preacher man," Mr. Rodriguez said. Indeed, just down the street is the Evangelical Missionary Temple, the church his father founded and served as minister for 30 years. "It's in my blood," he declared.
There is also more than a little pride in Mr. Rodriguez, the sort that comes from achievement. He told of growing up in a tough neighborhood in East Harlem as one of eight children, escaping through brains and diligence. He is more than glad to show off his junior high medals, including one as class president.
He has worked at a dizzying array of jobs -- hairdresser, fashion coordinator, florist, window trimmer and party planner, among others. His goal at the Rainbow Room was to learn enough to start a restaurant of his own. "I'm very gifted," he volunteered.
Point taken. You could have seen this remarkable man on the picket line at Rockefeller Center yesterday from 6:30 P.M. to midnight.

HEADLINE: Finns Hope Technology Will Fill a Market Gap

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J., June 4

 BODY:
The Finnish Government, seeking new trading partners to replace those lost when the Soviet Union collapsed, sent its Ambassador to the heart of New Jersey's high technology strip today to drum up investment from New Jersey businesses.
About 100 technology concerns sent representatives from New Jersey, whose 7.5 million residents outnumber Finns by 2.5 million. The companies hoped to arrange joint ventures, subsidized by New Jersey or Finland, in part to help the state economy out of its slump and in part because they believe that in the long run Finland will be the gateway to doing business with the Russians. 
 By day's end, hundreds of business cards had traded hands and appointments been set up, but no deals had been made.
The Finns did not expect to sign agreements today in any case, their Ambassador, Jukka Valtasaari, said. Instead, he said, the event, the Finland-New Jersey Technology Partnership Symposium, was intended to open long-term relationships with American businesses. Since the collapse of the Soviet bloc, companies in the United States have become the second-largest trading partner with Finland, after Sweden.
 
'The Home of Technology'
 "America is the home of technology, and it is so huge that we have to be here," he said. He was seated in the auditorium of the David Sarnoff Research Center, the first of a dozen high-technology research and development companies to turn this stretch of Highway 1 in central New Jersey into an East Coast version of Silicon Valley.
A similar symposium was held for New York companies in Manhattan last fall. The Finnish Embassy plans to hold similar meetings in other high-technology manufacturing states in the coming months.
"I don't see anything yet," said Bill Whitney, marketing manager for the Otto H. York Company of Parsippany, a manufacturer of chemical-processing equipment, as he leafed through a thick binder listing Finnish companies looking for American money and technical skill. But he was glad to have paid the $35 fee, just to keep up with the evolving European market.
"We just opened an office in Europe," he said, "so it made sense for us to come here to find out who to contact in the Finnish Government and to see what kind of assistance they can offer, and maybe what kind of assistance the State of New Jersey can offer."
Harold K. Fletcher, president and chairman of Tel-Instrument Electronics of Carlstadt, N.J., and Williamsville, N.Y., a maker of airplane-instrument testing equipment, said his company had experienced its own version of the collapse of the Soviet threat.
 
Broadening the Base
 "The defense industry has cut back quite a bit, and so has civil aviation, so we need to broaden our product base," he said. "I think of this as a longshot, but for $35 and lunch I get the byproduct of being able to sit here and think without the phone ringing all the time."
Ambassador Valtasaari said Finland did not expect new business partners from the West to replace the Soviet Union entirely, partly because that country traded in low-tech steel and raw materials, while United States companies offer financial and technical ventures. Finland has also applied to join the European Community.
"But there is now excess capacity in several areas of our economy as a result partly of the collapse of the Soviet Union," the Ambassador said, "and this capacity has to be, to some extent, filled."
As for trading with the Russians, Mr. Valtasaari told the audience in the Sarnoff Center that Russia's resources were still there, and suggested that given time and the development of new lines of authority, markets for foreign investment would be there, too.
And the Finns would help with efforts to understand the Russians, he said.
"I can't say we know better than anyone else how the Russians work," he said, "but we have over the years had a lot of experience over there, and we hope that our knowledge is to some extent sellable."
For his part, George D. Grippo, a marketing consultant from Kinnelon, N.J., who has done business in Helsinki, offered to explain the Finns to the Americans.
"They're not big on flexibility," he said. "If they've got a particular design, that's it. They're very hierarchical, so every decision goes all the way to the top. Maybe it's from dealing with the Russians for so long. And the whole country closes down for a month in the summer."
Mr. Grippo said he had just approached a Finnish Embassy commercial attache for an appointment: "You know what he said? September!"

HEADLINE: Travel Bargains to Continue, As Half-Price Air-Fares End

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
Vacation travelers can count on price cuts when they shop for transportation and lodging in the months ahead. Even though the most recent domestic and foreign airline fare war ended yesterday, experts predict that travel companies will continue to offer discounts in an effort to stimulate summer leisure travel. 
 "I don't think there has been such a turnaround in the economy that it is going to be a seller's market," said Ed Perkins, the editor of the Consumer Reports Travel Letter. "Both airlines and hotels have excess capacity."
 
Plenty of Inducements
 James V. Camissa Jr., a travel industry analyst in Miami, said he expected a deluge of price inducements to stimulate demand. "Pleasure travel tends to lag in a recovery period, so there's going to be a of a lot of bargains out there," he said.
Many bargain hunters will travel in the United States this year, according to estimates by the United States Travel Data Center, an affiliate of the Travel Industry Association of America. It forecasts a 4 percent increase in so-called summer vacation person-trips, to 326 million, tying the record set in 1990. (A person-trip is one person traveling at least 100 miles from home.)
"Taking advantage of discounts requires people to plan more in advance," said Thomas R. Crosby, the managing director of national travel for the American Automobile Association, which joined the travel data center in presenting its 1992 summer forecast. "And when you plan ahead, you tend to enjoy your vacation more."
Travel by car or other road vehicles represents the overwhelming majority of all domestic vacation transportation -- and summer expectations for this segment of the industry are particularly optimistic. The National Campground Owners Association, a trade group, reports that its economic index stands at 4.2 out of a maximum of 5.
"Summer reservations are 8 to 18 percent ahead of last year," David Gorin, the executive vice president of the campground association, said. "For a lot of older folks who are retired, this is their life style and they are not about to change that."
The biggest travel deals of the year thus far have been offered by airlines, and many travel specialists anticipate further rounds of fare reductions even in the peak summer months. Take the most recent brouhaha: a nine-day fare war led by American Airlines, which reduced domestic fares by 50 percent off the lowest advance purchase fare for tickets for flights through Sept. 13. The resulting bargains, available until yesterday, included such rock-bottom, round-trip fares as $200 for flights between New York and Los Angeles and $145 for flights between Miami and Chicago.
"There is a whole new wave of lower fares coming in," said Jeanie M. Thompson-Smith, the president of Topaz Enterprises, a travel-management consulting company in Portland, Ore. "It is very advantageous for the leisure traveler."
Patricia Law, a travel agent at Squires / Carlson Travel in Philadelphia, pointed out that many of the discounted fares in 1992 are no lower than they were in the recent past. "People still remember that around three years ago, it cost $198 to go someplace or other," she said. "So they won't pay $400 for a round-trip transcontinental air fare."
When looking for domestic air-fare bargains, "don't get hooked on any one airline's deals," said Herbert J. Teison, the editor of Travel Smart, a newsletter published in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. "Regardless of what promotions you read about, a travel agent may be able to find deals that are just as good or even better."
Similarly, hotels are offering a variety of bargain rates to help increase their business in June, July and August. Michael Ashington-Pickett, a publisher of travel newsletters based in Orlando, Fla., had this advice for travelers in the United States: "Don't call the 800 number for a hotel chain. Call the hotels directly and ask them what's the best rate they can offer you. They're dealing."
 
<SC0>Below Official Rates

 
 Consumers can get hotel rooms for less than the rack -- or official posted -- rate in Europe, too. Even in cities where major events are scheduled during the summer, packages and other special arrangements are featured at many hotels. Such cities include Seville, Spain, the site of the World's Fair, and Genoa, Italy, the home of the Columbus exposition.
"A lot of hotels are coming out with dollar rates where they guarantee the rate, including breakfast, tax and service, before you leave," Barbara Gallay, the president of Linden Travel, a New York travel agency, said. "That way you don't have to worry if the exchange rate changes."
And Michel Bouquier, the United States chairman of the European Travel Commission, said that "more sophisticated and independent visitors are shopping around. They are staying in small countryside inns outside the big cities."

HEADLINE: Max Lerner, Writer, 89, Is Dead; Humanist on Political Barricades

BYLINE: By RICHARD SEVERO

 BODY:
Max Lerner, an educator, journalist and student of American civilization who was for many years a syndicated columnist for The New York Post, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Hospital. He was 89 years old and had homes in Manhattan and Southampton, L.I.
He died of a stroke, said his son Stephen, of Washington. 
 Mr. Lerner was one of the more conspicuous of the post-World War II nonfiction writers, a humanist whose unabashed liberal conscience led him to the political barricades for more than three decades. Many of his concerns now seem prescient.
In 1959, for example, in a speech at Douglass College in New Brunswick, N.J., Mr. Lerner called for the formation of an antiwar elite, making it clear that he was worried about what he saw as growing mediocrity among American students. "We should be less concerned about the missile gap than the intelligence gap," he said, "less worried about the missile race than the intelligence race."
 
Backed Jewish Emigration
 Mr. Lerner was also a longtime advocate of the right of Jews in the Soviet Union and elsewhere in Eastern Europe to immigrate to Israel. In a speech delivered in 1950 to the New Jersey section of the United Jewish Appeal, Mr. Lerner said that such emigration must continue, "no matter how politically impractical or economically unfeasible."
With all the turmoil of the mid- and late 20th century, Mr. Lerner insisted that he preferred the present "awful but magnificent" era to any other in history. But in a book he wrote in 1957, "America as a Civilization: Life and Thought in the United States Today," he talked of his age as a time in which there was a "fear of ideas and the tenacious cult of property."
His espousal of ideas regarded as liberal in the 1950's did not sit well with everyone. In the 50's and early 60's, he was regarded as a controversial speaker, and those who invited him to lecture were criticized by patriotic groups who regarded Mr. Lerner as rather subversive and perhaps even soft on the ideas expressed by Communists.
"Lerner's great distinction is the enemies he has made," wrote Gerald W. Johnson in 1960 in The New York Times in a review of Mr. Lerner's "Book of American Symbols." Mr. Johnson said that "few men in this country are so bitterly hated by so many of the right people."
Mr. Lerner had been struggling with serious health problems since 1981, when he was stricken with lymphatic cancer. In 1984, he had a heart attack. The prognosis was not promising but the ever-feisty and combative Mr. Lerner surprised his doctors and survived, and wrote a book entitled "Wrestling With the Angel." Published by W. W. Norton in 1990, it described his ordeal and how he overcame it.
"I would pay attention to doctors, tests and all the paraphernalia of medicine," he wrote, conceding that: "My doctors knew more than I did. But in a crisis of conflicting judgments I would never forget that the final, critical decisions were mine to take."
Mr. Lerner was born in Minsk, Russia, on Dec. 20, 1902, the son of Benjamin and Bessie Podel Lerner, who immigrated to the United States in 1907. The elder Lerner was an itinerant scholar, and his wife kept a general store in Russia. But when they came to the United States, they moved to Bayonne, N.J., where Benjamin Lerner bought some cows and sold milk door to door. Later he moved his business to the Catskill Mountains but was not successful, and the family ultimately pursued its fortunes in New Haven.
 
A Yale Undergraduate
 Max Lerner attended Hillhouse High School in New Haven, then went to Yale, where he concentrated on literature. He graduated in the Class of 1923. He studied law for a time at Yale after receiving his undergraduate degree but moved to graduate work at Washington University in St. Louis and at the Robert Brookings School of Economics and Government in Washington. After he earned his Ph.D. from Brookings in 1927, his first job was working as an assistant editor to Alvin Johnson, who was compiling an encyclopedia of social sciences.
Between 1932 and 1935, Mr. Lerner served on the faculty of both Sarah Lawrence College and the Wellesley Summer Institute. After a brief stint teaching at Harvard, he edited The Nation magazine for a time and then taught political science at Williams College from 1938 to 1943.
In 1943, he left Williams to become editorial director of PM, a New York newspaper without advertising, to eliminate the possibility of pressure from advertisers and special-interest groups. The left-of-center daily proved unprofitable and collapsed in April 1948. Before joining The Post in 1949, he also wrote columns for The New York Star, which tried to succeed PM but lasted only eight months, until January 1949. Mr. Lerner sustained his interest in education even after moving to The Post, and for a time was chairman of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at Brandeis.
Among his books were "Ideas Are Weapons" (1939), "Ideas for the Ice Age: Studies in a Revolutionary Era" (1941), "It Is Later Than You Think" (1938, revised 1943), "The Mind and Faith of Justice Holmes" (1943), "Actions and Passions: Notes of the Multiple Revolution of Our Time" (1949), "The Unfinished Country" (1959) and "The Age of Overkill" (1962).
 
'Love and Work'
 He also made many contributions to other books and wrote for many magazines, among them The Atlantic, Saturday Review, Vogue and The New Republic. He continued writing for The Post until two weeks ago.
Mr. Lerner married Anita Marburg in 1928. The couple divorced in 1940. He married Edna Albers in 1941.
He is survived by his wife; two other sons, Michael, of Bolinas, Calif., and Adam, of Medford, Mass.; two daughters, Constance Russell-Lerner, of San Diego, and Joanna Townsend, of Dallas; nine grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
In summing up his life for his entry in "Who's Who in America," Mr. Lerner wrote: "I have believed in love and work, and their linkage. I have believed that we are neither angels nor devils, but humans, with clusters of potentials in both directions. I am neither an optimist nor pessimist, but a possibilist."

HEADLINE: Yugoslav Denies Involvement Of Belgrade in War in Bosnia

BYLINE: By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, June 5

 BODY:
Portraying himself as the unjustly vilified leader of an unjustly besieged state, the President of Yugoslavia said today that he was eager to address the concerns of the United Nations to avert the effect of sanctions. But he insisted that his federal Yugoslav Government was neither involved in nor abetting the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
"We don't want to confront the United Nations, we want to cooperate," said the President, Slobodan Milosevic, in a nearly two-hour interview today in which he appeared to be reaching out beyond the isolation of sanctions to foreign leaders. While repeatedly saying his Government was willing to accommodate the United Nations, he also declared, "We cannot say we will agree to withdraw our army from Bosnia when we already did that."
 
Letters to U.N.
 The 50-year-old President who is both a former Communist and former international banker, said the only contact his Government had with the United Nations since sanctions were approved last Saturday was to send letters to Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali "clarifying our position and seeking to make the situation one of greater trust." 
 Though he peppered his remarks, offered in fluent but heavily accented English, with such conciliatory phrases as, "After all, we cannot confront all the world," he kept insisting that the condemnation and isolation of Yugoslavia and his Government was based on inaccuracies and biased accounts conveyed in what he described as "a media war against us."
Serbian leaders have repeatedly insisted that the Serbian irregular forces in Bosnia who have been leading the onslaught against Sarajevo were not under their control, a line taken by Mr. Milosevic, a Serb, in the interview. But Western nations have been just as insistent in asserting the opposite. Today, for instance, in Washington, the State Department said Bosnia and Herzegovina is "being ravaged by Serbian armed forces which were established and equipped by Belgrade and which continue to be materially and politically supported by Belgrade."
In the interview, Mr. Milosevic (his name is pronounced SLOH-boh-dahn mee-LOH-sheh-veetch) grew angry when he said there had been little or no foreign reporting about speeches he had made in the Yugoslav Parliament denouncing the bombardment of civilians or deploring the mortar attack on civilians who had lined up to buy bread in Sarajevo. "Not one article, no TV shot," he said, his voice rising. "We are just criminals, we are wild aggressive people, we are black devils, I don't know what."
When asked why such a wide variety of countries, including nations thought to be friendly to Yugoslavia like Greece and Russia, had apparently endorsed Belgrade's culpability by joining in the sanctions, Mr. Milosevic replied that they had been under pressure to do so. In an apparent effort to avoid roiling diplomatic waters too much he declined to identify those powers, but would not dispute a suggestion that he had Germany in mind.
Essentially, Mr. Milosevic clung to his basic argument that a civil war was raging between the Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina on one side and the Croats and Slavic Muslims of that republic on the other. He has maintained for some time that Belgrade had little influence in the war-torn republic and could not restrain the Serbian forces that were formed and grew from Bosnian soil.
 
Disputed Assertions
 During the fighting last year in Croatia, Mr. Milosevic and his Government had similarly asserted that they had no real authority to rein in the activities of a Serbian dentist who had proclaimed himself the leader of Serbian region of Croatia, though they did just that when it became a condition for a United Nations-monitored cease-fire that Belgrade had come to want.
On the present fighting, Mr. Milosevic's view is that though there is sympathy within what remains of federal Yugoslavia, which is now overwhelmingly Serbian, for their Serbian kin across the border, there has been no military involvement or support by his Government or the Yugoslav Army, which is also Serbian dominated.
Such assertions were disputed by United Nations observers, human rights workers and diplomats before they retreated from the area of fighting. They told of air strikes on villages, and there have been many reports that the irregular forces fighting for Bosnian Serbs could not have operated at the level that they did without aid and assistance.
Mr. Milosevic said he had never seen proof to support such allegations, adding that his Government had made it a crime to organize paramilitary units or bear heavy arms.
As the interview was being conducted, across the street from the presidential office, Serbia's Parliament heard a report from the Government asserting that an investigation had determined that there were indeed groups of paramilitary units from Serbia operating in Bosnia but that these were small bands. The Serbian Government, distinct from the Yugoslav federal Government but apparently as eager as Mr. Milosevic to deflect the United Nations sanctions, said it had requested that the irregular Bosnian Serbian forces disarm and disband these men.
On questions relating to the scale of sanctions and their possible consequences as they took hold, it was clear that Mr. Milosevic was hoping that they would not truly go into effect. "There is a time lag for that sort of thing," he said as motorists continued to encircle every gas station in this city.
Revealing the combined optimism of a politician and a junk bond promoter, he said that the sanctions might even bring some positive aspects. "Sanctions will help some in the cleaning of the economy in terms of raising productivity and using all available resources," he said.
He said contingency plans that were drawn up before the sanctions call for shifting energy dependence from oil to coal and electricity. "We produce more food than we need," he said. "We will be hurt with some exports of food but we will not be hungry."
The President, who began his rise to power through the old League of Communists, was asked what he thought of Tito, the wartime Partisan leader who molded Yugoslavia into a federation that pursued an independent Communist course and brought the Balkans one of the longest periods of peace in their stormy history.
In contrast to the growing contempt that is now often expressed for Tito, Mr. Milosevic was respectful in his assessment. "He was fighting fascism and nobody can oppose his role. In many things he was absolutely one of the leaders of a policy of peace."

HEADLINE: Where Markets Are Never Super;
Some Urban Neighborhoods Fight Absence of Major Chains

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

 BODY:
The names are nothing but nostalgia now -- A.& P., Pathmark, Food Pageant, Grand Union -- a roll-call of supermarkets filled with glistening vegetables and fresh cuts of meat that were once as much a fixture of suburban life in southeast Queens as the neat rows of wood-frame and Tudor houses.
But that was 20 years ago. 
 The brick buildings with the distinctive squat supermarket shape have become something else. One is an N.A.A.C.P. headquarters. Another is a shuttered fried chicken joint. A third is a used-furniture store. All along Linden Boulevard, as the surrounding neighborhoods changed from predominantly white to mostly black and Hispanic, the supermarket chains moved out.
"You're kind of powerless to do anything about it," said Herman Eastmond, a 66-year-old retired bank executive who raised nine children in Springfield Gardens. "They just close up shop and leave."
 
Right to Fresh Vegetables
 Southeast Queens, of course, is far from alone. From riot-torn South-Central Los Angeles to Queens, Brooklyn, Harlem and the Bronx, the departure of the supermarket from the nation's black and Hispanic city neighborhoods has consigned their citizens -- many of them poor, but many of them not -- to shopping in corner delis or small markets with higher prices and inferior merchandise, or traveling miles from home in search of food.
Now, though, neighborhood groups around New York City are beginning to assert their inalienable right to fresh vegetables, competitive prices and spanking clean markets near home. And with the Dinkins administration actively seeking to lure back supermarket chains, some of the companies are showing a renewed interest in urban locations.
In the largely middle-class neighborhoods of southeast Queens, people say they are only trying to reclaim one of the signature amenities of that middle-class life. They have decided they want a Pathmark, and they have gone out to woo the company.
"Anyway you're looking at it, you're talking about leaving Queens to get value," said Nola Southerland, 52, who drives from her home in St. Albans to a Waldbaum's in Nassau County to do her food shopping. "Let us have here in southeast Queens the same type of market."
The reasons for the supermarkets' flight are disputed. Some city officials and community groups say it was part of the general death of shopping strips and growth of suburban malls. Others see at least an element of racism, tying it to the urban disorders of the 1960's or to white flight.
"There are two racial stereotypes that I think are sending false signals to store owners," said Mark Green, the city's Consumer Affairs Commissioner. "First they may fear that they do not understand the minority market. But second is their knee-jerk premise that blacks are poor, and poor people are a poor market."
Supermarket executives deny racism was a factor and argue that many city stores became unprofitable as leases came up for renegotiation and as the small stores of the 1930's were supplanted by mega-markets of 30,000 square feet or more. The large stores include delicatessens, bakeries, florists, pharmacies and video sales, with high-ticket items that the executives say can offset the lower profit margin on food. Stores in the inner city also suffer from higher security costs and high rates of pilfering, the executives say.
 
Poor Pay More
 The exodus has not struck the rich and poor equally. In a study released last year, the city's Department of Consumer Affairs found that while the most affluent parts of Manhattan had a supermarket for every 6,580 people, Brooklyn's most impoverished neighborhoods had one supermarket for 17,232 people. The report said that tenants who lived in New York Housing Authority projects on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, as well as residents of the Williamsburg and Brownsville sections in Brooklyn, had virtually no access to a supermarket.
Food prices in poor neighborhoods throughout the city were found to be 8.8 percent higher on average than in middle-class neighborhoods because of small stores that could not afford bulk buying, and because of lack of competition. For a family of four that could mean an extra $350 a year in food bills. City officials found that while a fresh head of lettuce cost 59 cents in a Waldbaum's on Staten Island, wilted lettuce usually went for $1.19 in corner bodegas.
Armed with such statistics and recognizing that more than housing was needed to revitalize neighborhoods, the Dinkins administration convened a task force that has been working with a nonprofit group, the Community Food Resource Center, to develop a strategy for luring supermarkets into under-served parts of New York City. The group has been meeting for about 18 months.
In a pilot program begun last month in Brooklyn, the New York City Economic Development Corporation has also requested proposals from private developers to build supermarkets on city-owned property in Coney Island and Brownsville. As an incentive to development, the corporation is offering loan guarantees and financing at below-market rates to buy city land.
Such efforts are having results. With the Economic Development Corporation guiding it through the maze of city land use hearings, A.& P. recently broke ground on a 50,000-square-foot Waldbaum's in College Point, Queens. Michael J. Rourke, A.& P.'s vice president for communications and corporate affairs, said the city also smoothed the way for the company to open a Waldbaum's in the South Bronx a year ago. The Supermarkets General Corporation, meanwhile, is working in conjunction with a local development agency to build a Pathmark in Harlem.
In many ways, the southeastern Queens neighborhoods of Cambria Heights, St. Albans, Springfield Gardens, Laurelton and Rochdale Village are better off than the truly supermarket-starved areas of Brooklyn.
In much of the area near the Nassau County border a majority of residents have household incomes of at least $35,000, higher than the city average. They also have more choices in shopping for food. Besides the corner delis offering West Indian specialities, the area also has several of the independently owned markets that often moved in to the inner city after the large chains moved out -- a C-town, an Associated Supermarket and several Key Foods and Bravos.
But living on the border of Long Island, people like Mrs. Southerland can see the difference in cost and quality between what is available in the Five Towns area of Nassau County nearby and in their own neighborhood. And as people who invested their savings in their homes, they say they resent seeing their neighborhood lose the amenities -- like clean, well-stocked food stores -- that had made it suburbia in the city.
 
Inferior Food in Neighborhood
 "We got to see what was once a vibrant community dying," said Mrs. Southerland, a retired telephone company executive. "You're looking at slow death and you know this is going to impact economically on you."
For years, she has gone to Long Island to buy food, complaining that in her neighborhood stores she has found inferior -- and moldy -- cuts of meat, expired food, wilted vegetables and higher prices. On Long Island, she says she pays 49 cents for a can of evaporated milk that can cost 67 cents in Queens. Some local churches and centers for the elderly also run van pools and car pools to Long Island to help the elderly do their grocery shopping there.
But now, responding to such complaints, the Queens Citizens Organization, a coalition of 45 church groups, has stepped into high gear in a campaign to get the 146-store Pathmark supermarket chain to expand its empire into southeastern Queens.
The Rev. Edward Davis, the pastor of the Presbyterian Church of St. Albans, said the group chose Pathmark because it had already shown a commitment to the inner city, with stores in Bedford-Stuyvesant, the Red Hook section of Brooklyn, Newark and Camden.
 
Talk of a Mega-Store
 The Queens community group did not have a hard time making its case. A study of southeastern Queens by one major supermarket chain found that the area of 200,000 had a food buying potential of $5 million a week.
After several meetings with Pathmark executives, the Queens residents now speak rapturously of a 62,000-square-foot mega-store that would create 300 jobs and possibly include a medical clinic and a sports club on the roof.
At Supermarkets General, officials call the talks only preliminary, noting that they will need four to five acres of open land. "We're very interested in the southeast Queens area," said Harvey Gutman, the senior vice president of the retail department. "We feel confident that we can run a Pathmark to serve that community."
But so far, despite the good will -- and in an example of the problems faced by chains that want to duplicate their suburban markets in New York City -- land has remained a stumbling block.
One overgrown site near York College turned out to have a cemetery. Another parcel in an urban renewal zone along Merrick Boulevard is too small and would require demolition of nearby homes. A third plot suggested by the Queens Borough President, Claire Shulman, has been rejected by Pathmark officials who say the soil is too soft.
 
Showdown Over Park Land
 In a move that could lead to a neighborhood confrontation, Pathmark and the Queens residents have set their sights on a 4.5-acre parcel of the 54-acre Roy Wilkins Park, which was ceded by the Veterans Administration to the Southern Queens Park Association in the 1970's.
The Queens Borough President has called the supermarket "inappropriate" for the site. And the board of directors of the park association has so far been adamantly opposed.
"As of now the board remains unconvinced its a good idea," said Solomon Goodrich, executive director of the Southern Queens Park Association. "The board thinks we need all the open spaces we can have." He added, "Nobody's disputing the need for a supermarket."

HEADLINE: Why Cities?;
How to Rebuild Los Angeles

BYLINE: By Witold Rybczynski; Witold Rybczynski, author of the forthcoming "Looking Around: A Journey Through Architecture," teaches architecture at McGill University.

DATELINE: HEMMINGFORD, Quebec

 BODY:
Peter V. Ueberroth, head of Mayor Tom Bradley's panel to rebuild Los Angeles, has described his job as "the chance to dramatically impact a major inner city positively." Brave words. But while public discussion has focused on enterprise zones, tax incentives and community policing, one important question has received scant attention: How should South-Central Los Angeles be rebuilt?
The rioting that followed the Rodney King verdict destroyed or seriously damaged more than 5,000 buildings. These could be put back as they were: predominantly one-story commercial buildings backing onto large parking lots, situated on long, dreary blocks bounded by extremely wide, high-speed roads. Shopping strips over here, houses over there; it's the kind of planning that is the hallmark of most American cities, the kind of planning that only a traffic engineer could love. 
 City planning centered on the automobile is itself a part of the problem. A five-minute walk, the traditional measure of neighborhoods, represents only a quarter of a mile, but a five-minute drive is about three miles. When getting around means driving around, cities spread out and physical distances become social distances. In few cities are different income groups as isolated as in Los Angeles.
Walking in a city is much more than a question of reducing gas emissions or staying fit. Empty streets are dangerous streets. Moreover, when it's no longer convenient or pleasant to walk, one of the chief occasions for civilized mingling between neighbors and strangers has been lost. When car life replaces street life, human interaction is reduced to a primitive level: isolated drivers honking at each other, competing for parking spaces, racing for the next light.
What, then, should be done? It's no coincidence that most of the destruction took place in the commercial strips fronting the broad avenues. These mini-malls form a kind of no man's land, places to drive by, not walk through.
The exclusionary urban zoning that bans residential uses from commercial streets should be modified to produce the blend of shops, offices, and apartments we see in places like Venice, Calif., or Annapolis, Md. These are the virtues that once characterized most U.S. towns: a rich mixture of uses, lots of people and pleasant places to walk.
Walking is practical, however, only when the density of buildings allows these different uses to be close together. Modifying zoning and regulations to permit apartments and offices to be built over shops, for example, and allowing housing lots to be smaller, increases overall density and reduces sprawl. So does changing building regulations to allow garage apartments. (This also increases the supply of affordable housing.) Introducing short streets at mid-block also encourages people to walk rather than drive.
The mingling of different functions presupposes abandoning one of the worst inventions of well-meaning urban reformers: the public housing project. Warehousing the poor in quarantined districts of identical two-story apartment buildings, as is done in Los Angeles, is as destructive to the city as it is to the occupants.
If public housing must be built -- the present overcrowding in South-Central requires it -- it should only be as individual buildings, not as large-scale projects. Smaller-scale construction would also lend itself to the use of neighborhood contractors. If tenant ownership is to be encouraged, housing should consist of small rowhouses or bungalow courts, not large apartment blocks.
Another planning convention that needs re-evaluation is the separation of industry from housing. When new factories are built in South-Central, they should not be isolated in industrial parks but located within neighborhoods. If the factories are small, they can be on residential streets. Children can grow up seeing men and women at work. If some of the workers are from elsewhere, so much the better; the neighborhood becomes a place for us and them, not just for us against them.
More than 30 years ago, Jane Jacobs suggested many of these changes in "The Death and Life of Great American Cities." This landmark book was a reaction to the planning orthodoxy of the 1950's, when inner cities were devastated by urban renewal and highway construction. Unfortunately, the same policies prevailed when cities were rebuilt following the urban riots of 1965. We must do better this time.

BYLINE: By LAUREL GRAEBER

 BODY:
THE KITCHEN GOD'S WIFE, by Amy Tan. (Ivy, $5.99.) In Ms. Tan's second novel, a Chinese-American woman learns the history of her mother, who endured abandonment by her mother, a brutal first marriage and the loss of three children. "This is a chronicle not only of a woman's victimization, but of the unwitting conspiracy within society to ignore and therefore perpetuate the condition," Robb Forman Dew said here last year, calling the book "greatly satisfying."
MEMOIRS, by Andrei Sakharov. Translated by Richard Lourie. (Vintage, $16.) This book is itself testimony to the will of the author, a man who was largely responsible for the development of the Soviet hydrogen bomb and yet became one of the fiercest critics of the nuclear arms race and his country's repressive policies. Despite K.G.B. interference, Sakharov spent 11 years writing these memoirs, which chronicle his life until 1986, when he was allowed to return to Moscow from exile in Gorky. Two years ago our reviewer, Bernard Gwertzman, praised this as an "extraordinary work. . . . One learns, sometimes in embarrassing detail, about the stubbornness of this man, who went on hunger strikes to get his wife a visa to receive medical treatment abroad, who seemed utterly fearless and who never lost his sense of outrage at man's indecency to man." Vintage has also reissued Sakharov's MOSCOW AND BEYOND: 1986 to 1989, translated by Antonina Bouis ($11), which continues his history through the summer preceding his death. 
 THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, by Reynolds Price. (Ballantine, $5.99.) In what our reviewer, Patricia Hampl, called a "graceful collection," Mr. Price gives the stories of three men, each currently or formerly a soldier. "These people have stories because they have lives," Ms. Hampl said last year. "They must recount them in order to live on."
INSIDE CENTRAL AMERICA: Its People, Politics, and History, by Clifford Krauss. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $11.) Almost everyone agrees that much of Central America is an economic and political disaster; not everyone agrees on who is to blame. Mr. Krauss, a correspondent for The New York Times, holds the individual nations ultimately responsible, but argues that the United States has exacerbated the situation through capricious and deceitful policies, opting, for instance, to fund a war in Nicaragua rather then negotiate with that country's Government. Last year our reviewer, Wayne S. Smith, found this "one of the most useful books yet to appear on the region." Also new in paperback is BLOOD OF BROTHERS: Life and War in Nicaragua, by Stephen Kinzer. (Anchor/Doubleday, $14.) Mr. Kinzer, who established The New York Times's bureau in Managua, analyzes the Sandinistas, asking whether they might have moderated their policies if the United States had not become involved. "It is without doubt the best contemporary history of the Sandinista decade yet to appear," Linda Robinson said here last year.
MAXIMUM BOB, by Elmore Leonard. (Dell, $5.99.) The title character is a Florida judge who routinely gives criminals the maximum sentence. Two who have received this treatment are out to kill him. Last year our reviewer, Barry Gifford, said, "Nobody I've ever read sets up pace, mood and sound better than Elmore Leonard," whom he described as "the greatest living writer of crime fiction."
LEWIS MUMFORD: A Life, by Donald L. Miller. (University of Pittsburgh, $15.95.) An urban visionary, architectural scholar, historian, critic and writer, Lewis Mumford took on many inventive roles in his 94 years. But "as Mr. Miller shrewdly observes, Mr. Mumford's most impressive work of creation was himself," Ada Louise Huxtable said here in 1989, noting that this first full-length biography is "serious and substantial."
DAISY FAY AND THE MIRACLE MAN, by Fannie Flagg. (Warner, $7.99.) Originally published as "Coming Attractions," this novel by the author of "Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe" entertains readers with the journal of Daisy Fay Harper, a 1950's Southern girl who is the daughter of the local film projectionist. Daisy Fay "is just as sweet as her favorite movie-munchin' candy, Bit-O-Honey," our reviewer, Laura Cunningham, said in 1981.
EDUCATED IN ROMANCE: Women, Achievement, and College Culture, by Dorothy C. Holland and Margaret A. Eisenhart. (University of Chicago, $11.95.) Anthropologists who studied the lives of 23 women who graduated in the early 1980's from two Southern public universities -- one predominantly black, the other white -- conclude that for female students, the college climate usually encouraged romantic attachments over scholarship. Last year our reviewer, Joan Jacobs Brumberg, observed that this is a "powerful book," whose "most interesting portion" describes how these students "scaled down their ambitions."
WILDERNESS, by Dennis Danvers. (Pocket Star/Pocket Books, $5.50.) Alice White is both a werewolf and a Cassandra, painfully isolated from others as much by their refusal to believe in her lupine condition as she is by the phenomenon itself. Writing last year in The New York Times, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt admired this "audacious first novel," in which the reader follows the consequences of the heroine's transformation "rapt through the novel's final page."
DOGTOWN, by Mercedes Lambert. (Penguin, $4.95.) Resembling a female version of the movie "48 Hours," this novel features Whitney Logan, a lawyer, teaming up with Lupe, a Chicana prostitute, to solve a murder in East Los Angeles. "The cultural friction between Whitney and Lupe sustains this lively, if unlikely, adventure," Marilyn Stasio said here last year.

THE DEMOCRACY TRAP
The Perils of the Post-Cold War World.
By Graham E. Fuller.
285 pp. New York:
Dutton. $20. 
 LIKE Salman Rushdie's character Saleem Sinai, who was born at precisely the moment that India achieved its independence from Britain, the largest generation of Americans came into the world simultaneously with the start of the cold war. The generation that routinely ducked under its desks through air-raid drills, attended college during the war in Vietnam, married and started families amid the energy crisis, and prospered (or failed) in the go-go 80's now faces a serious challenge. Can it cohere without the cold war, which had, for so long, defined its existence?
Graham E. Fuller -- a former Foreign Service official who now is a senior political analyst at the RAND Corporation -- believes that Americans will long for the days of the cold war when they begin to face the problems raised by its end. And that is the more optimistic account of "The Democracy Trap," for he also argues that Americans may not be able to face those problems at all.
Mr. Fuller correctly understands that the cold war period was the exception, not the rule. (So, one could argue, were the postwar economic boom, the expansion to the suburbs, the Ozzie-and-Harriet nuclear family and the space race.) For all the angst of the 60's, the baby-boom generation has lived with remarkably little international conflict, in part because of the stability produced by stalemated superpowers possessing nuclear arms. The generation that came before knew a world war and a Great Depression. The generation that comes after, Mr. Fuller argues, is likely to face a world characterized by intense nationalist conflict, frequent civil wars, religious frenzy and hatred and, inevitably, greater violence. The paramount challenge we will face, Mr. Fuller maintains, is preparing ourselves for the return to a more "normal" world of war and instability.
The author does not believe we will be able to rise to the challenge. What stands in our way is what is most precious about us: our democratic system. For all its virtues, he believes, democracy is a trap. It encourages us to indulge in the politics of immediate gratification. It enables interest groups to put their parochial needs before the needs of the whole. It rewards leaders who emphasize good news, not hard work. It exalts individualism when what we need is to work together. Mr. Fuller writes: "The United States with its contemporary designer morality just might have something to gain from looking back to societies in which moral values are less subject to the tides of social preference or the interpretations and rationalizations of sociologists."
Walter Lippmann, Reinhold Niebuhr and Hans Morgenthau were only some of the influential American intellectuals who also perceived contradictions between the domestic needs of American democracy and the international demands of superpower status. Americans, it seems, are always in need of thinkers who can cut through the cycle of can-do optimism and total withdrawal that characterizes American attitudes toward the rest of the world.
But unlike Lippmann and other realists who were as clearsighted in talking about the United States as they were in understanding the world, Mr. Fuller -- who knows much about Islam, Africa and the Soviet Union -- is dyspeptic when he discusses his own country. It may well be that his many years of service outside this country have colored his views of what takes place inside. Appalled at nearly everything he sees, he delivers a jeremiad against everything he does not like: affirmative action, ethnic consciousness, television, the underclass, drugs and litigation -- without ever demonstrating the role that any of them play in our foreign policy.
Whereas most people around the world want to copy the United States, Mr. Fuller wants this country to copy what he has learned around the world. Intrigued by Muslim notions of determinism and the frailty of man, he suggests, with some seriousness, the virtues of an Islamic republic for America. (He believes that "Arabs are still fair game in American culture for any kind of gross ethnic caricature, racial slur or outrageous stereotype -- they are the only major ethnic group left that can be treated prejudiciously with total impunity.") Surely it is the Orientalist in him who can suggest, in a passage that would make Walter Lippmann blanch, that "we need to be more conscious of the Yin and Yang, the concept of complementarity and balance of virtues that seems somehow alien to our American culture."
"The Democracy Trap" is anything but a tightly argued, well-researched and historically grounded effort to predict the future by studying the past. It is, rather, an odd mixture of whatever is on Graham Fuller's mind, some of it interesting, some trivial. Mr. Fuller is on target when he says that Americans are ill prepared to deal with such issues as global poverty or the collapse of empire. We may indeed come to wish for the good old days of the cold war, when understanding the world was so much easier. We are surely not at the end of history but rather at the start of a historical era we can barely comprehend. But we will have to wait for books more rooted in a realistic view of the world and our place in it before we can understand the paths before us.
 
 
 
CULTURE SHOCKS
 Americans generally have little recognition of the extent to which the immigrant culture and society of America, and its deep-rooted Anglo-Saxon sense of rule of law, is absolutely unique in the world. We are therefore less intuitively equipped to understand foreign cultures than almost any other country on earth. Young Americans are generally shocked the first time they encounter in depth the attitudes, thinking and culture even of a European society, much less societies of the third world. The person who grows up in Zaire is better equipped to understand the political and cultural motivations of an Egyptian, a Brazilian or an Indian than is an American. -- From "The Democracy Trap."

HEADLINE: The MacArthur Truffle Hunt

BYLINE: By Anne Matthews; Anne Matthews, who teaches nonfiction at Princeton University, writes frequently on higher education.

 BODY:
Like sweeping the lottery or landing a movie contract in a Hollywood soda shop, winning a MacArthur fellowship has become an American fantasy: the ringing phone, the congratulations from foundation headquarters, the neighbors' awe, the colleagues' grinding envy, the lifetime of lonely creative struggle justified, the fat quarterly checks.
Those designated MacArthur fellows have learned of their no-strings grants while mowing a suburban New Jersey lawn, dining in a San Francisco artist's loft, climbing the Wind River Range in Wyoming, camping with Australian aborigines. First reactions are seldom inventive: 
 "Oh, my God."
"Oh, my God."
"Oh, my God."
"Whooahhaiiee!" (A Southern community organizer, leaping and yelling and knocking over furniture.)
"Yes, I've been waiting for your call," said one writer, coolly.
"Can I ring you back to confirm?" a political scientist pleaded. "I played this joke on a colleague of mine last year."
And once there was only a long silence, then a distant thump: the sound of a body hitting a laboratory floor in Cambridge, Mass., as a winner fainted.
Through its MacArthur fellows program, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation of Chicago has, since 1981, identified creative individuals and handed them aggregate sums (before tax) of $150,000 to $375,000, distributed over a five-year period, to be used however they please. Although people from all occupations are eligible, no one can apply for MacArthur fellowships -- often called, to the foundation's intense annoyance, "genius awards." Winners have ranged in age from 18 to 82; the older the recipient, the larger the sum awarded. According to a program spokesman, it was felt that older people required more money than younger people to allow them to do whatever they wished. This year's awards will be announced on June 16.
The program's romantic, supply-side view of creativity assumes that paying highly original people to do what they like will, in the long run, benefit society. "We mail the checks and get out of the way," says the program's director, Kenneth W. Hope. It's a very 1980's concept, ambitious and wildly self-confident, a public act of faith in mavericks and innovators -- and in human nature.
Fellows say a MacArthur allows them the luxury of saying no: to the lecture circuit, to second and third jobs, to the time-devouring demands of fund raising. For winners from the low-rent, high-anxiety worlds of arts and public service, MacArthur manna can be very welcome.
"When the phone call came, two years ago, I was sitting in a loft on New York's Lower East Side, broke, exhausted and depressed," says Michael Moschen, a 37-year-old juggler, as he stretches his hamstrings in the sunny front room of an 18th-century Hudson Valley farmhouse rented with MacArthur money. Behind him, a sofa is piled with the raw material of future performances: glass rods, tall wood and metal triangles, research folders bulging with photographs, sketches and movement charts.
"Without the MacArthur, I'd be playing Las Vegas to feed my family, hating every minute." Two crystal balls, then three, then four, sweep upward from his hands. "Now I can keep taking risks and stay truthful to the work. I'm up till midnight, the ideas are coming so fast. But I still wonder, 'Why me?' "
Ellen Stewart, director of La Mama Experimental Theater Club in New York, bought an ancient monastery in Umbria, in central Italy. She is restoring it as an international artists' residence. In a madcap gesture, John P. Gaventa, a community organizer and sociologist who lives in Appalachia, ordered a load of gravel for his driveway; he also used MacArthur checks to visit other organizers in Mexico and India. The novelist Leslie Marmon Silko says MacArthur money let her write the novel "Almanac of the Dead." Some fellows hire research assistants. Some pay off debts. Others spread their largesse.
Karen Uhlenbeck, 49, a professor of mathematics at the University of Texas at Austin, earmarked MacArthur money to help female mathematicians. "I was completely obscure when I won," she says. "No one had given me anything before. No one had ever believed in me this much. I feel an obligation to return their trust by living an unexpected life." The award money has allowed Uhlenbeck to retool professionally. "I finally, finally took time from my teaching to learn physics," she says.
Sam Maloof, a California woodworker, has set up youth scholarships at an Aspen, Colo., arts center, and Hipolito (Paul) Roldan, head of the Hispanic Housing Development Corporation in Chicago, established a $100,000 education fund for young Hispanic people planning careers in community development.
Some newly minted fellows, however, take to their beds, unable to handle the sudden fame and the intrusion from the outside world that comes with it. "I didn't get up for a week," recalls one social scientist. "Ate crackers under the sheets. Hid from reporters and camera crews. Cried a lot." About 1 winner in 20 seems to suffer extended creative block, or believes the prize damaged his or her career because of colleagues' jealousy, or claims that award-related stresses led to mental or physical illness. (The MacArthur fellows program thoughtfully offers winners and their families five-year insurance for medical, dental, vision and psychiatric care.)
"If you are a good person to begin with," observes William J. McGill, the former chairman of the MacArthur awards' selection committee, "a MacArthur makes you saintly and helps your work. If you have flaws, the absolute freedom of the award quickly magnifies them. If you have some deep personal weakness, some mean streak, a MacArthur will assuredly tear you apart."
So far, 350 MacArthurs have been awarded: 109 in the sciences, 81 in the arts, 70 in the humanities, 53 in public affairs, 37 in the social sciences. The tab for this experiment in encouraging creativity is now $103,833,322 and counting, a very modest slice of the foundation's asset base. With securities and real estate (the foundation is the largest owner of undeveloped land in Palm Beach County, Fla.) valued at $3.2 billion, MacArthur is the fifth-wealthiest foundation in the United States.
Inside the MacArthur foundation's South Dearborn Street headquarters -- an 1894 confection of Chicago School architecture, all Tiffany glass mosaics, bronze-gilt bas-reliefs and wrought-iron stairways -- the fellows program is only one of many financing schemes. The foundation sponsors programs on world population issues, tropical medicine, environmental conservation, peace and international cooperation, mass communications and mental-health research, as well as cultural and community aid in Illinois and Florida, the states where its founder lived and worked.
But outside the building, the fellows program stirs more controversy than all the foundation's other ventures combined. Asking for a list of major literary works, musical achievements, crusading policy reports or scientific breakthroughs achieved with MacArthur-bought freedom is a fast way to start many fellows hyperventilating. In fact, most winners simply hire a crack investment counselor.
To the question, "How did the prize alter your life and your work?" the answer, over and over, is: "It didn't, really." MacArthur demographics suggest why. Nearly three-fourths of MacArthur fellows are middle-aged and older men -- almost all of them white -- many affiliated with top research institutions on the East and West Coasts, notably Harvard, Princeton, Stanford and Berkeley.
For winners already equipped with healthy incomes as well as access to grant funds larger than any MacArthur, the MacArthur means status, not survival. "Oh, 20 years ago I might have gone to Paris to write," admits one scholar, wistfully, "but now I have a cat and a dog and kids in school and a wife who works. This windfall is going for college tuitions and high-return CD's." He thinks a moment. "All right, maybe a patio."
Overall, MacArthurs seem to favor creative people from the Northeast (of the 350 fellows, 121 live in the Northeast or New England). Questioned about this, Ken Hope, the program director, sighs. "We're trying for a redefinition of creativity here, a fracturing of national perceptions of value. It takes a while. But we've also been trying hard for nominators and selectors very definitely from nonelite institutions, or from outside the academic world altogether, representing the U.S. better in terms of race, place and gender."
Ah, gender. Why so few women (67, out of 350) receive MacArthurs has baffled the foundation from the start. A 1988 internal report reveals that more than a quarter of MacArthur nominators have been women, yet while females nominate equal numbers of men and women as candidates, males propose four men for every woman.
The foundation has tried several variations on MacArthur financing, from compensation for employers should fellows decide to go on leave or work part time, to the lifetime-income MacArthur laureate award, granted only three times (most notably to the feisty geneticist Barbara McClintock) before it was killed (after board members began to battle over who would get the money should some future laureate go mad or lapse into a coma).
Officials at other foundations note the MacArthur fellows program has never really decided if its job is to reward creativity or to stimulate it, if it wants to be an American Nobel Prize or a fairy godmother to talents unappreciated by mainstream society.
A FOUNDATION, THE cultural critic Dwight Macdonald once noted, is an island of money surrounded by people who want some. Protecting great fortunes from inheritance and estate taxes while performing public good has been the goal of private philanthropy for nearly a century. Except for a statutory requirement to give away 5 percent of investment income, American foundations, large and small, operate with few constraints.
MacArthur is the youngest of the country's top foundations -- the Rockefeller, Ford and Mellon foundations, the Getty Trust, the Pew Memorial Trust -- and, in its early days, the brashest.
John D. MacArthur (1897-1978), son of a Pennsylvania hellfire preacher, was an eighth-grade dropout who created the mail-order insurance firm of Bankers Life and Casualty during the Depression and built a Florida real estate empire. At the time of his death, he was one of two billionaires in the United States.
Puckish and aggressively eccentric, MacArthur lived for years in a Palm Beach Shores hotel, running his business from its coffee shop and reputedly saying, at the close of each deal, "Pay for your coffee on the way out." Largely to confound the Internal Revenue Service, he endowed his foundation with five million shares of Bankers Life stock but left the board of trustees no instructions. He had made the money; now they could figure out how to spend it -- thus making the MacArthur the only top-rank foundation to be created without a focused giving agenda.
Early MacArthur foundation trustees, mostly conservative Illinois businessmen and MacArthur cronies, had limited experience in world-class foundation work and limited patience with the Ivy League, Manhattan-centered world view of their Eastern peers. As the board felt its way into the alien universe of charitable donation, its early grants were a grab bag: here $25,000 to Save-a-Pet of Highland Park, Ill.; there $500,000, at the urging of Paul Harvey, the radio commentator and a board member, to buy bulletproof jackets for the Chicago police.
The foundation's first cohesive financing effort was the fellows program, with John D. MacArthur's only son, J. Roderick, as the force behind it. A lifelong liberal in politics and a social rebel, the younger MacArthur was an expatriate writer in postwar Europe until his father rejected his pleas for a larger allowance. By the 1970's, however, Rod MacArthur had amassed his own fortune by founding the Bradford Exchange, an international clearinghouse for commemorative china plates. In 1980, he acquired Hammacher Schlemmer, the specialty store and mail-order house of luxury gadgets.
"Rod MacArthur was the kind of guy who harangued total strangers in restaurants about PCB levels in whitefish," says Ken Hope, looking out his office window at the scarlet Calder stabile in Chicago's crowded civic plaza below. "But he also fiercely admired innovators and gadflies and mavericks, saw that a billion dollars of foundation money could back a program to help them, and he set off on a quest to do just that.
"Rod," Hope adds, "installed a testing lab at Hammacher Schlemmer to find the best consumer products. He was just as convinced that you could identify, evaluate and rate highly creative people."
The talent search was organized by F. Champion Ward, a former Ford Foundation vice president. Then it was staffed and directed for four years by Gerald Freund, formerly with the Rockefeller Foundation. Bitter rows over budgets and fellows nominations (especially in the arts) marked the program's early years. The foundation's fortunes proved more turbulent still; Rod MacArthur accused the board of mismanaging assets and paying themselves excessive fees. His suit to dissolve the foundation and appoint a new board was withdrawn only shortly before his death, in 1984, from pancreatic cancer, the disease that had claimed his father. Rod MacArthur's lieutenant, Ken Hope, took over the fellows program in 1982 and will leave this summer. No new director has been named.
TRUFFLE HUNTING, THE talent for recognizing talent, is crucial to the MacArthur fellows program. To become a fellow, you must first catch the attention of a rotating corps of 120 anonymous nominators (Box, page 26), who are allowed unlimited nominations during a one- to two-year term, paid $1,000 and sworn to secrecy. Impostors are a constant menace. To cause palpitations among America's gifted and talented, simply ask mysteriously for a resume "to send to Chicago."
Nominators, more than half of whom are academics, covertly gather preliminary data (publications, videotapes, names of references), some scouting for unsung originals in their own professions, others gleaning names at parties or through magazines, newspapers and television. One M.I.T. economist would nominate only short-story writers.
A staff of nine processes more than 300 nominations yearly, dodging the pitfalls and blood feuds that are inevitably a part of the file-building process. "You soon learn to spot special pleading or orchestrated campaigns by friends and enemies," explains a researcher. Staff members also check out candidates by attending lectures or performances incognito.
Candidate folders then move to the selection committee, a revolving cast of 10 to 15 scientific, academic or literary heavyweights, like Saul Bellow and Jonas Salk. Selectors meet eight times a year in Chicago hotels or at foundation headquarters. Three criteria currently govern the granting of a MacArthur: Is the person's work important for society? Is the candidate truly creative and promising? Will the award make a difference at this point in his or her career?
"Discussion of nominees becomes intellectual combat so intense it leaves you elevated and drained," recalls William McGill, president emeritus of Columbia University, who was chairman of the program's selection committee in the mid-1980's and is the first selector to speak publicly on the process of choosing MacArthur fellows. "Salk used to say we should make a bouquet of potentials and achievements. This didn't always work. One incensed board member told me that we picked so many humanists it was like an all-shortstop baseball team."
Winnowing starts in September, as selectors reject hundreds of candidates as too eccentric, too unformed, too marginal. By May, about 40 finalists remain, and the real battles begin. A farmer who has developed a blight-resistant potato? Thumbs down: not sufficiently showy. Four theoretical physicists specializing in string theory (and known henceforth in foundation circles as the String Quartet)? Yes, despite concern over giving multiple awards in the same field. A lobbyist for fireproof fabrics, a nautical archeologist from Texas, an expert in Sherpa Buddhism? All approved.
ON A WINTER MORNING IN central Wisconsin, the ornithologist George Archibald is dancing with cranes. A 1984 MacArthur fellow, Archibald is a globe-trotting expert on wildlife conservation -- at a crane-studies conference in Pakistan one day and in the Mekong Delta exploring wintering grounds for the threatened Sarus crane on another. Now, puffy-eyed and jet-lagged, he trots from enclosure to wire-mesh enclosure at the International Crane Foundation in Baraboo, Wis., greeting old friends.
"Butch!" he shouts. "Hey, Susie, how's it going?" Suddenly, Archibald leaps straight up in the air, arms waving, throws back his head and looses a raucous cry: "Broo-OO! Broo-OO!"
Four feet away, a pair of White-naped cranes point their slender bills at the pale winter sun and match Archibald's wavering note. All three leap and flap, hooting in concert. Man and cranes are much of a height, and their long blue shadows move and tangle on the snow.
"Looking good, Suze," says Archibald, panting. His crane-rescue program has raised 400 birds in the last 15 years and helped an international team save the whooping crane from extinction. Besides helping build a study center for crane research, Archibald's MacArthur money pays his way to scientific conferences and assists wildlife biologists in need.
Like many MacArthur fellows, Archibald notes that meeting other winners, like the reclusive novelist Cormac McCarthy, is one of the award's great pleasures. Official fellows reunions (attendance optional) have been held in Chicago every 18 months, with all expenses paid for fellows still receiving foundation checks. Half slumber party and half symposium, meetings feature mass forays to Rush Street in search of blues clubs and lectures by fellows on their current interests, which range from homeopathy and Nostradamus to the medical implications of applied molecular evolution to the sex life of yeast. Children and pets often attend. So do spouses.
Some fellows, wary of typecasting, avoid these get-togethers. Others -- notably Joan Abrahamson -- are pressing for professional interaction. A 1985 fellow, Abrahamson, 41 and a member of Yale's first coed class (majoring in philosophy, psychology and fine arts), has an M.A. (in education) from Stanford, a law degree from Berkeley and a Ph.D. (in learning environments) from Harvard. She was assistant chief of staff to George Bush when he was Vice President. MacArthur money, she says, let her build a new painting studio; leave corporate law to found and head a think tank, in Los Angeles, for applications of creativity to public policy, and to have two children.
Abrahamson is also an inveterate organizer of expeditions and informal gatherings of MacArthur fellows. "We hope to form working groups of fellows to think on policy issues like disabilities, environment and public education," she says. "We want to interact, evolve, explore, experiment, pool our abilities."
Seated in the dining room of the Hay-Adams Hotel in Washington after a hard day of heated arguments at a meeting of the Commission of Fine Arts -- a panel that rules on the commissioning and placement of public art in the capital -- she flips open a photo album of a 1990 expedition to Hawaii. Swimsuited policy analysts lounge at a torchlit poolside on Maui as a theoretical physicist lectures on infinity and galactic spirals. A historian of the Ottoman Empire and a biophysicist on a whale-watching cruise lean perilously over a boat rail, discussing whale song. A marine biologist scrambles up an active volcano's rocky slope.
"Not coordinating all this amazing talent seems a terrible waste," says Abrahamson, flipping tactfully past a shot of an astrophysicist balancing a lava cone on his head. "We're trying to get MacArthur scientists and artists together to improve America's science education -- maybe a film where Michael Moschen and Jacques d'Amboise illustrate physics through juggling and dance, with help from MacArthur chemists, mathematicians, educators and computer-graphics experts. It's all a way to answer the question that concerns many of us: You were handed this gift; how are you going to give something back?"
ASKED TO ANALYZE THE MacArthur roster of talented individuals, some observers of the nonprofit realm leap to praise. "Thrilling." "Enormously important." "Lots more diverse and progressive lately." "Finally getting away from academics."
Others savage. "Constipated." "Safe." "Revoltingly chichi." "Survival of the blandest." "Kafkaesque." "A godlike search for geniuses under rocks." "The usual suspects, plus the very famous and the very weird."
There are those who say that subsidized mavericks are a contradiction in terms. Or they note the fields consistently underrepresented on MacArthur lists: engineering, business, secondary education, state government, agronomy, computing, fine arts. Privately, many fellows and nominators worry that the selection committee seems to have a persistent weak spot for self-promoters. "MacArthur fellows talk beautifully," says one academic. "I'm just not sure how bright they actually are." And many nominators, former and current, complain that their most interesting talent finds rarely win awards.
Pablo Eisenberg, for example, who is executive director of the Center for Community Change in Washington, would have liked a MacArthur for Khoa Le Xuan, executive director of the Indochina Resource Action Center and former vice president of the University of Saigon. Mark Smith, a novelist teaching at the University of New Hampshire, proposed the writer and historian Shelby Foote a decade before he acquired fame as a commentator on the public-television series "The Civil War." Again, no result.
Looking for self-evaluation, the foundation sought feedback four years ago from nominators, selectors and referees in the fellows program. A sampling of their comments:
 "I view this program as an outstanding and unique American analogy to the 'national treasure' concept that exists in Denmark, Japan and presumably elsewhere."
 "I am afraid there is too much evidence that this is just a kind of payoff either to young smart alecks or old has-beens. Sorry, but someone should tell you."
 "I salute the MacArthur foundation for being bold and courageous. There are, unfortunately, too few risk takers in our times, or institutions that value romance -- romance of knowledge, of things uncertain, of things beyond measurement. . . . All society benefits when the exceptionally talented are enabled to perform, to create, to devote more time to what they do."
 "The selections made in fields I know . . . are idiosyncratic when they don't smack of patronage and cronyism. In attempting to short-circuit the long-established ways of scholarship, the foundation does nothing but mischief."
 "Almost everyone I know would like to have a MacArthur fellowship. Those that say they wouldn't are kidding themselves. . . . It would seem fairer to have some accountability built in, to ask for some productivity from the fellows."
There is talk of an independent selection panel, the names made public, as with the Pulitzer and Guggenheim boards. Ken Hope is dubious about this: "Selectors need to be perfectly frank in discussing candidates and free from any pressure." Pablo Eisenberg, a former nominator, disagrees. "There's a big unspoken class issue here. Where are the neighborhood organizers, the labor people, the social workers, the consumer advocates? The whole process badly needs sunshine."
Others would like to see a shift away from awarding MacArthurs to scientists. Stanley N. Katz, head of the American Council of Learned Societies, argues that the scientific world is already skilled at nurturing its creative, while arts and humanities talent suffers from obscurity and neglect.
"Since 1983," Katz says, "funds from private philanthropy for humanities have declined by 20 percent, as has their dollar value, just when the ratio of grant applications to acceptances is soaring. If the MacArthur foundation really cares about unsung endangered talent, they should do a grant program for young humanists."
Says Gerald Freund, first director of the fellows program: "When the program began, all manner of techniques were essayed to find and aid creative women and men. That adventurous beginning has given way, as so often happens, to entrenched routines and easy answers. Only a searching program review will determine why."
Whether the fellows program stays the same or undergoes a transformation is up to the president and the board of the MacArthur foundation to decide. Since 1989, the head of the foundation has been Adele Simmons, a former president of Hampshire College with three generations of ties to Chicago society and business. Simmons, 51, has increasingly given the foundation an activist cast, with grants going to such projects as women's health networks, Chicago school reform, energy research and rain-forest preservation.
Queried about the future of the fellows program, Simmons deftly sidesteps the question. "We are a very young foundation entering a necessary period of assessment and awareness," she says. "We will be focusing on several programs and approaches that have become outmoded. The foundation is much more than the fellows."
In the meantime, reforming the MacArthur fellows program remains a favorite parlor game in nonprofit circles. As is listing those who should get MacArthurs but haven't. Perennial favorites are the writer Eudora Welty, the consumer activist Ralph Nader, the Kansas plant geneticist Wes Jackson and the painter Richard Diebenkorn. But even the harshest critic, after hurling denunciations, will quickly add: "Of course, I wouldn't mind getting one myself."
Asked if anyone has ever turned down a MacArthur award or refused to cash the checks, Ken Hope leans back, smiling slightly. "Oh, no one refuses us," he says. "No one. Never ever."

Vive la Difference (If There Were One)

BYLINE: By Walter Goodman

 BODY:
Why an all-female political talk show? A perfectly good answer is, why not? Yet one presumes that the originators of "To the Contrary," the weekly half-hour public broadcasting series that began in April, had something grander in mind, something like bringing female perspective, insight and sensibility to a line of work dominated by men.
A recent sampling leaves some doubt that such a perspective exists. Anyone reading a transcript of the discussions would be hard put to say wherein they differ from all-male or mixed offerings like NBC's "McLaughlin Group," on which "To the Contrary" seems to have been modeled. 
 The programs are taped on Thursday and offered to public stations in time for Friday evening showing. (Channel 13 expresses its enthusiasm by carrying them at 6:30 A.M. on Tuesdays. They are also on Channel 31 at 11 A.M. on Wednesdays.) The format is straightforward. Mini-documentaries are sometimes used to lead into the discussion, but the talk is the thing.
Bonnie Erbe, a legal affairs correspondent for the Mutual/NBC Radio network, presides over a changing panel that last month included two conservatives, Linda Chavez of the American Enterprise Institute and Kate O'Beirne of the Heritage Foundation. They were joined at each outing by two women more or less to their left, like Dorothy Butler Gilliam, a Washington Post columnist; Julianne Malveaux, an economist and contributor to various publications, and Linda Wertheimer of National Public Radio. The syndicated columnist Ellen Goodman and the Democratic consultant Ann Lewis have also appeared, and Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, the former United States Ambassador to the United Nations, is promised.
The subjects are up to the minute, the pace brisk, the opinions unsurprising. Although Ms. Erbe tries to allow her guests equal time, the forceful combination of Chavez-O'Beirne gave a conservative edge to the programs I watched, as they attacked big government and the welfare system, extolled the benefits of a reduction in the capital gains tax and celebrated "family values."
At least one of the liberals can be counted on to take a diametrically opposing view, and the usual positions are staked out. Where Ms. Chavez and Ms. O'Beirne traced the sources of inner-city malaise to the welfare programs of the 1960's, Ms. Malveaux and Ms. Gilliam blamed the Reagan-Bush Administrations. Ms. Malveaux attributed the Los Angeles riots to unemployment, and Ms. Gilliam said Mr. Bush is "President only of the rich."
Since only five or six minutes are allowed to an issue and Ms. Erbe has no compunction about cutting discussions off -- her role model in this regard seems to be John McLaughlin, though she cannot quite match his authoritarian style -- guests are under pressure to sloganize. Ms. Malveaux called for an "urban Marshall Plan." Ms. Gilliam said the Los Angeles riots evidenced the "alienation" of young black men. Ms. O'Beirne, quick on the draw, spoke of "the poverty lobby" and "the politics of victimization" and of inner- city people "living on a liberal plantation."
If there is such a thing as a special female sensibility regarding certain public issues, it made itself felt in a hot argument over Murphy Brown's famous decision to bear a child without benefit of husband. At times you couldn't make out what anyone was saying, just like the squalling on "The McLaughlin Group."
Chavez-O'Beirne paralleled the Dan Quayle school of criticism in decrying the decline in values exemplified by Ms. Brown, which they blamed on what Ms. O'Beirne called "the liberal media elite." Ms. Malveaux called Ms. Chavez and Ms. O'Beirne puritans and said the only problem for single mothers is jobs. Ms. Wertheimer observed mildly that Murphy Brown could hardly serve as a role model for inner-city women. "Television doesn't lead, it follows," she said. But nothing could stop the others from blasting away at their accustomed targets in the customary lingo.
Now and then, what in less enlightened times might have been interpreted as an inimitably female approach emerged in the form of stories of personal experiences. After Ms. Chavez delivered a standard lament about the breakdown in inner cities of social institutions like the family, Barbara Reynolds, of USA Today, who is black, announced that she is a single mother who was once mugged by a white man.
No one was discourteous enough to point out that she was about as typical an inner-city single mother as Murphy Brown, but Chavez-O'Beirne did hasten to the defense of the two-parent family, and Ms. Chavez provided figures on the disproportionate amount of violent crime committed by black men.
An occasional guest seems to be chosen for multicultural considerations. On the subject of racism, the main contribution of Dinah Eng, an editor for Gannett News Service, was that people ought to be nicer to one another. "We are all responsible for ourselves," she disclosed and recommended that children be raised with love. The prescription was received with polite nods.
The program's pace and spirit makes things difficult for a journalist like Ms. Wertheimer, who although of a liberal bent tended to be less doctrinaire and more measured than her accomplices. Taking the role that Jack Germond occupies on "The McLaughlin Group," she raised sensible questions about the notion of urban enterprise zones without coming down for or against. And you can't imagine her declaring, as Ms. Gilliam did about the Rodney G. King case, "With this jury, nothing would have made a difference."
Anyway, before you know it, Ms. Erbe is announcing "the wrap question," a piece of jargon she must have picked up around the studio and, with luck, will lose in time. "That's it!" she declares, and it's on to another brief give-and-take.
So that's it. The wrap question is, why an all-female talk show? Well, to repeat, why not? At the very least, or most, "To the Contrary" demonstrates that despite the stereotype about some people's penchant for changing their minds, women can be just as wearyingly predictable as men.

HEADLINE: ROMANCING THE POOR

 BODY:
Jessica Hagedorn's article "Romancing the Poor" (May 10) opens with a description of Smokey Mountain, a garbage dump on the outskirts of Metro Manila, and goes on to describe the newest megamalls in the city.
May I point out that Smokey Mountain is like any other dump site in a large city, and that megamalls are also part of a growing metropolis? But neither are representative of Metro Manila or the entire Philippines. 
 It is true that we have our share of slums, poverty and homeless people, but our Government and people are doing their best to solve these social and economic problems. And we are trying to manage our affairs through the democratic process. The national elections are part of that process.
What is important is the process of getting and respecting the popular will.

HEADLINE: Perspectives: Condominiums in TriBeCa;
Shedding the Landlord Role, Gradually

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
HER specialty is design and marketing. His is construction and finance. There was financial backing in the family.
That amalgam made developers of not a few young couples in New York City in the 80's. Among them were Virginia Alexander Millhiser and Timothy M. Millhiser. They never foresaw a joint career when they were married in 1981, but three years later they bought a vacant six-story building at at 542 La Guardia Place, between Bleecker and West Third Streets in Greenwich Village. They rebuilt it into 10 fully finished apartments and sold them all within six months at an average price of $358 a square foot. 
 "We did very well," said Mr. Millhiser.
Onward they went to other projects, but downward spun the sales market in the late 80's. It reached a nadir, Mr. Millhiser said, toward the end of 1990 during the crisis over Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. So they stopped trying to sell the lavishly finished apartments in their project of the time -- the conversion of 55 White Street in TriBeCa -- and rented them out instead.
Now, with the prices down and the market marginally improved, Millhiser & Company is at a crossroads that is familiar to sponsors and other owners of new or rehabilitated, but unsold, renter-occupied condominiums,
They are starting again to market their apartments. But there are varying degrees of eagerness to sell. For some, a firmer rental market and the decline in interest rates has lessened the pressure to sell, espeicially after a substantial fraction of their apartments have already been sold. While some developers last year were so eager to sell empty apartments that they resorted to auctions, others are more inclined to bide their time. In any event, rentals in condominium buildings are likely to remain a fixture of the residential market for some time.
"We're trying to achieve a balance," Mr. Millhiser said. "We would like to sell a couple of units but we're not in a rush because some of the apartments make money for us. We can take our time."
The White Street project had adjustable-rate financing, so it has benefited in the last three years by the decline in interest rates, Mr. Millhiser said.
Tenants are often at a crossroads as well. Many of them made housing decisions in the late 80's and early 90's that they considered short-term at the time. Among the renters at 55 White Street, for example, are Michael Connolly and his wife, Jamie Stern, lawyers with two young sons who sold their apartment on lower Broadway two years ago because they outgrew it and have rented a 1,900-square-foot condominium for $3,400 a month while trying to decide on their next step.
"We are discussing buying apartments, and looking in Brooklyn Heights -- our older son is in school there -- and we're also looking at houses in the suburbs, but then we would be commuters," Mr. Connolly said. "For the life of us we can't decide what to do."
Another renter is Gerry Kagan and his wife, Kristina Boden, who moved from the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn into a 2,300-square-foot apartment renting for $3,500 a month. Now they and a friend are rebuilding two vacant four-story buildings on Harrison Street for their own use. "The prices now are down to the point where they make sense," said Mr. Kagan, an investor who has rebuilt small brownstones in Brooklyn himself.
In some cases, developers say they always intended to hold some of the units they built as long-term investments. Douglas Gardner,partner in the group that built Reade House, an 80-unit condominium at 311 Greenwich Street in TriBeCa, where the developers had successful sales, held 25 apartments as rentals. The same pattern was followed at the same developer's 52-unit new building at 108 Fifth Avenue, at 16th Street.
FIGURES on condominium sales in Manhattan compiled by Yale Robbins, the real estate publishing and consulting firm, show that the total dollar volume last year was $732 million on 2,006 sales. That compares with $918 million for 2,586 sales in 1990. The high for the 80's was $1.9 billion on 4,858 sales in 1989.
The figures are based on closings, not contract signings, so the 1992 numbers so far don't reflect spring sales, said Henry Robbins, a principal at Yale Robbins. But closings in the first quarter of this year were running well ahead of last year's first quarter. The figures are 453 closings this year against 327 last year. The total dollar volume rose to $140 million, against $127 million last year.
Throughout the 80's the total inventory of condominiums itself was rising sharply, as condominiums replaced rentals and co-ops as the main form of new multifamily housing. Ten years ago there were 4,100 condominium apartments in Manhattan, Yale Robbins said. This year there are 50,400.
Riding out sales cycles isn't easy for small development companies, and it requires changes in direction. The Millhisers now work, for example, for co-op owners who are enlarging their apartments, and they provide construction services to co-op corporations. They also plan to bid for work on vacant city-owned buildings.
They started out with the purchase 542 LaGuardia Place in partnership with family members, including Mr. Millhiser's father, Ross, the retired vice chairman of the Philip Morris Inc. They developed the taste for reconstruction from buying and restoring a family summer home with sisters and brothers in Long Branch, N.J.
They sold 10 luxuriously appointed apart ments at an average of $350 a square foot on La Guardia Place, Mr. Millhiser said, and went on to convert two floors of former doctors' offices in a postwar co-op at 111 East 85th Street. These sold for an average of $310 a square foot.
Then they took on a floor in the mixed-use building at 105 Fifth Avenue, near 18th Street, which Barnes & Noble was vacating. Finally they bought 55 White Street. The cast-iron building was built in 1860 and used as a saddlery. The Millhisers intended to preserve the facade but demolish the rear portion and building and construct a 23-story tower.
They had been led to expect support from Community Board 1, Mrs. Millhiser said, but instead they faced an ultimately successful neighborhood campaign to landmark the property. Ultimately, the Landmarks Preservation Commission approved the facade restoration as part of a conversion to 16 apartments and 4,000 square feet of ground-floor commercial space, which was sold to a company that installs telephone systems, Whitcom Communications.
Twelve of the apartments have about 2,000 square feet of space, and came on the market in 1989 at about $285 a square foot, or roughly $570,000. But after nine sales, the Millhisers began to rent at an average rent of $3,400 a month for the 2,000-square-foot units, with one-year leases and renewal options. Apartments have woodburning fireplaces in living-dining rooms 24 feet by 40 feet, two baths, walk-in closets, ceiling heights of 13 to 17 feet and large arched windows. The Liebman Melting Partnership, a Manhattan firm, was the architect.
Sales prices are down substantially from the late 80's. One 2,000-square-foot unit on White Street, for example, was priced at $705,000 in 1989 and is listed at $625,000 now. Mrs. Millhiser, who is handling sales through a brokerage firm, Robert Eychner Associates, said she was looking for average prices of $250 to $275 a square foot in her sales effort, depending on the location of the unit in the building.
The building gets the benefit of the J-51 tax abatement, which is modest. To unit owners, it is worth an average of $1,300 a year in forgone taxes over a six-year period. These owners are nevertheless paying about $4,800 a year in taxes, because the abatement is limited to "50 percent of certified eligible costs" in most of Manhattan.
The eligible costs amounted to $256,000 in a building that cost about $3 million to rebuild. The apartments may use up to 8 1/3 percent of that amount a year -- $21,400 -- as a credit to reduce annual taxes until 50 percent of the total is reached. That will take about six years.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Mount Olive Child Care;
Kids in the Corporate Scene

 BODY:
As many as 16 infants, 40 toddlers (16 months to 3 years old) and 60 preschoolers (up to 6 years old) could liven up the corporate landscape of the 670-acre International Trade Center (ITC) in Mount Olive, N.J., next spring.
Bright Horizons, a five-year-old Cambridge, Mass., child-care company, will open its 46th center there in a 6,200-square-foot, one-story building at 450 International Drive. 
 "As the owner of a very large mixed-use business park we saw the need for this amenity," said Leslie R. Smith Jr., executive director of ITC. The Rockefeller Group, which is still developing the complex that includes the New Jersey Foreign Trade Zone, is financing construction of the $1.2 million project.
The day-care center's exterior "will be sympathetic to other buildings," said Richard C. Ashcroft of Cooper, Robertson + Partners, Manhattan architects. Inside, there will be an infants' room with a food preparation counter, refrigerator, changing tables and two sleep areas; a toddlers' area with changing tables and bathroom and playspace; and a preschoolers area adjoining a kitchen with low countertops for snacks. There will also be outdoor play areas.
The design also calls for a nursing nook and a reception-resource area where parents -- who will pay tuition not yet set up -- can stop by for coffee or parenting tips.
"We strive for a home-like environment," said Heather Samson, field manager for Bright Horizons.

HEADLINE: An Uptick for Home Sales in the Region

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
SPURRED by low interest rates and lower prices, the residential real estate market in the New York metropolitan region, which has been dramatically deflated by a three-year recession and rapidly changing demographics, appears, for the most part, to be taking a slight upward turn.
Few real estate analysts, however, expect a sharp rise in sales volume for one-family homes, co-op apartments or condominiums anytime soon. Nor do they expect sale prices in the foreseeable future to return to the heights of the middle to late 80's. 
 "Modest priced housing is moving because interest rates are down, and prices are down, and in many cases it is affordable for people when it wasn't before," said Marc A. Weiss, director of the real estate development research center at Columbia University's Graduate School of Architecture Planning and Preservation. "And I think that will continue."
The degree of recovery in the New York area will vary depending on location and the type of housing. The market, for example, seems to be improving the most for moderately priced one-family homes in New Jersey, Westchester County and Long Island and the least in Connecticut.
"The recovery is stronger and the market is better than it has been at any time in the past 24 months," said Alan Yassky, former regional vice president of the National Association of Realtors and the president of Rockland Realty-Better Homes and Gardens in Spring Valley, N.Y. "And some areas are seeing it sooner than others. Connecticut is really plagued by some heavy fear of unemployment. People there are just paralyzed."
The outlook remains even bleaker for those selling condominiums in suburban areas throughout the region or studios and small one-bedroom co-ops in Manhattan. "The prices of the smaller co-ops were so inflated, and there is now a huge oversupply that has to be absorbed," said Edward J. Howe 3d, vice president of the National Cooperative Bank in Washington. The organization is one of the largest providers of co-op financing in the New York area, having originated more than $500 million in underlying mortgages since 1986.
Measuring the movements of the region's real estate market can be dicey, as disparities often develop not only between micromarkets, but over analysts' assessments and brokers' sales figures. These deviations often result from differing survey samples or methodologies as well as from efforts to paint the best possible statistical picture to help increase business.
Drawing conclusions from these movements can be even more difficult, particularly when comparing the first quarter of 1992 with the same period in 1991, when the onset of the Persian Gulf War sparked a steep drop and the war's end a short-lived resurgence in sales and prices.
For example, the 99,000 one-family homes sold during the first quarter of 1992 in the Northeast -- which according to the National Association of Realtors survey consists of New England, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania -- marked a 16.4 percent increase over the first quarter 1991 level. The 1992 figure, however, falls far short of the number of homes sold during the first quarters of 1986, 1987, 1988 or 1989.
And the $142,900 median sale price of a one-family home in the Northeast for the first quarter of 1992 was 3.7 percent higher than the $137,700 in the first quarter of 1991. The 1992 figure, however, was still lower than the median sale prices prices for the first quarters of 1990 and 1989, which were $144,900 and $143,400, respectively.
MOREOVER, virtually all of the sales taking place these days are resales because of the dearth of new construction. This factor could help stimulate the resale market for the next couple of years. But at the same time there are many rental units -- condominiums and co-ops, as well as houses -- that have been pulled off the "for sale" market and are awaiting re-entry. And when they re-enter, it could depress the market further.
"Prices certainly have not kept up with inflation," said Harvard economist N. Gregory Mankiw, the co-author of a controversial 1989 study that forecast an annual decline in residential real estate values of about 3 percent through the 1990's, chiefly because of the aging of the baby boom generation and the smaller number of new home-buying families behind them.
Co-ops in New York City have seen some of the largest declines in value. Mr. Howe said that preliminary figures of a study to be released in late June show that the overall resale price of about 900 co-ops dropped about 10 percent from the first quarter of 1991 to the first quarter of 1992, and, in some parts of the city, such as the Upper East Side and the Upper West Side, the declines may be greater. The bank's survey was based on appraisals of properties it financed as well as other comparable co-ops.
"It is dropping the most in areas where it appreciated the most," he said. "And, in a free-fall, it is scary to buy something."
"My personal belief is we're at bottom," he added.
But such an assessment offers little solace to Richard C. Hirschl. He has been hearing the same "we're at the bottom" song annually since 1989, when he put his 500-square-foot, one-bedroom co-op at 160 West 77th Street on the market for $200,000.
After receiving a few initial inquiries but no offers, he lowered his asking price in 1990 to $165,000. Then he lowered it again in 1991 to $120,000. And this year, he lowered it to $90,000, which is what he paid for the apartment in 1984.
"I am amazed at the situation," said Mr. Hirschl, a stockbroker living in Washington, Mo., who originally bought the unit for his son and daughter, who were attending the Juilliard School of Music.
"What I'm hearing is that only the larger ones are selling."
A brighter picture, though, is painted by many of the city's real estate brokers. For example, Clark Halstead, owner and manager of the Halstead Property Company, a real estate brokerage firm in Manhattan, said his company's sales for the first quarter of 1992 were close to 50 percent higher than for the comparable period in 1991.
Mr. Halstead also said that the average sale price per room rose to $88,863 for the first quarter of 1992 from $81,301 for the first quarter of last year. "In general, prices have edged up slightly, particularly on the West Side," he said. "The market is not weak at all. New York-bashing seems to be a thing of the past."
As for Manhattan condominium prices, Yale Robbins, a Manhattan real estate publishing and consulting firm named for its founder, reported that 453 units were sold in the first quarter of 1992 in the borough against 327 for the first quarter of 1991. Mr. Robbins said, though, that the average sale price was $310,000 this year, down from $390,000 for the first quarter of last year. "In general, prices this year are less than prices last year," he said.
"Short-term, things are pretty much going to stay the same," Mr. Robbins added. "Long-term, it all depends on the economy. And no one is making strong predictions on the economy for the next year, and no one is making accurate predictions for the next two or three years."
Some condominium brokers, however, believe that prices have already started to rebound. Louise M. Sunshine, president of the Sunshine Group, a real estate brokerage and consulting firm in Manhattan, noted that 30 percent of the units at the 123-unit condominium at 2250 Broadway at 81st Street have been sold since it opened six months ago. She said most buyers of the units, which cost from $295,000 to $500,000, were Americans, a change from past years, when foreign buyers dominated the condominium market.
Ms. Sunshine said that sales have been increasing for high-end condominiums, such as the 283-unit Trump Palace at 200 East 69th Street, where she said an average of 14 units a month have been sold since January. The condominium has been offering a 20 percent discount off original asking prices, but that will be reduced to 10 percent next month, she said. The average condominium costs about $800,000.
"The condo market is really revived," she said.
IN some suburban regions, however, the condominium market is still troubled. In Stamford, Conn., for example, there were 72 condominium sales for the first quarter of 1992 against 43 for the first quarter of 1991 and 69 for the first quarter of 1990. The average sale price for the first quarter of 1992, though, has plummeted to $123,016 from $136,279 in 1991 and $164,168 in 1990.
Thomas I. Purcell, the executive director of the Stamford Board of Realtors, said that condominium prices in the area have been dropping 10 percent a year for for the last four years, as opposed to 5 percent annual drops for one-family homes. "They are just so hard to get rid of," he said.
No one believes that the housing market will recover completely until the region's job losses are stemmed. For example, for New York City alone, 167,000 jobs disappeared between November 1990 and November 1991, the United States Labor Department said. The figure is close to a quarter million since the winter of 1988, when the recession started in New York City, long before it did in most of the rest of the nation.
Suburban single-family homes, however, have shown some recent improvement in price as well as volume. In Stamford, for example, the number of one-family-home sales rose to 118 in the first quarter of 1992, compared with 105 in the first quarter of 1991 and 125 in the first quarter of 1990. The average sale price also rose -- to $342,875 from $332,995 during the first quarter of 1991, but it still fell short of the $358,143 first quarter average for 1990.
"Things are better than they have been the past couple of years," Mr. Purcell said. "Prices are down about as low as they are going to get. People are not reducing them as much as they were before. And I think it all has to do with the interest rates, and the banks giving people the opportunity to buy.
"But I don't think you are ever going to see prices like those of 1985," he said. "It would take a miracle to get prices up that high again."
IN Westchester County, there were 645 sales in the first quarter of 1992, against 521 in the first quarter of 1991 and 659 in the first quarter of 1990, according to the Westchester County Board of Realtors. Average first-quarter sale prices for the county rose to $270,000 in 1992 from $265,000 in 1991 but still fell short of the $290,000 recorded in 1990.
Statistics compiled by the New York Association of Realtors for Nassau County, Suffolk County and Queens showed that the number of one-family homes sold during the first-quarter of 1992 rose 16.8 percent to 2,963 compared to the 2,537 in the first quarter of 1991, but still remained 4.4 percent lower than the 3,098 sold in the first quarter of 1990.
Average sale prices of one-family homes for Long Island and Queens rose 1.7 percent to $174,532 in the first quarter of 1992 over the $171,683 for the first quarter of 1991 but still remained 4.8 percent lower than the $183,390 reported in the first quarter of 1990.
On Staten Island, the pattern continued, as the number of one-family homes sold rose by 6.7 percent to 144 during the first quarter of 1992 over the 135 for same period in 1991, but the figure was 0.7 percent lower than the 145 sales in the first quarter of 1990.
Average sale prices for the borough, however, showed no signs of improvement, as they fell 5 percent to $178,807 in the first quarter of 1992 compared to $188,163 for the first quarter of 1991 and were down 11.4 percent compared to average first quarter price of $201,855 in 1990.
In Northern New Jersey, the median sale price of a one-family home rose 1.3 percent in the first quarter of 1992 versus the first quarter of 1991, from $177,300 to $179,600. Prices, however, remained 5 percent below the $189,100 average for the first quarter of 1990.
THE volume of sales in Northern New Jersey was up 16.3 percent to 56,300 for the first quarter of 1992 over the 48,400 for the first quarter of 1991 and up 1.6 percent against the 55,400 for the first quarter of 1990. "What you are going to see over the next few years are 3-to-5 percent per year increases," said Ron De Piro, president of De Piro Realtors in Nutley, N.J., and the executive director of the Bloomfield, Glen Ridge, Nutley and Belleville Board of Realtors. "People are buying now as shelter, not as investment. They are going to end up making money but not that big killing."
Sellers who accept reductions in their offering prices can also expect to benefit when they buy their next home at a price that is probably lower than they would have paid two or three years ago.
Indeed, that was the result for Steven Tannenbaum when he bought an $825,000 home in Muttontown, L.I., after selling his condominium in Roslyn Heights, L.I., for $395,000 -- $130,000 less than he paid for it in 1989.
"Even though we took a bath in Roslyn," said Mr. Tannenbaum, who owns a lumber home center in Brooklyn, "we could afford the house in Muttontown only because prices were down a third from what they originally offered."

Mortgage Adjustment
 
Question: I have a mortgage on a condominium in New Jersey that I rent out and I have been unemployed for more than a year. My mortgage is held by Chase Mortgage Corporation. When I called to discuss a way of reducing my monthly payments to avoid foreclosure, I was told such assistance is available only after a mortgage holder becomes delinquent. Apparently the mortgage had been sold to Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and Chase must follow its rules when it comes to changes. It seems to me that since I would not qualify for a regular re-financing, the lender would be willing to do something to help me stay out of foreclosure. Is there anything I can do? . . . Terence Wall, Hillsdale, N.J.
 
Answer: Probably not. Ken Mills, a spokesman for Chase Manhattan Bank, of which Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corporation is a subsidiary, said that it is not a Chase policy to wait until a mortgage holder has fallen behind in payments to assist with a loan payment adjustment. But it is true that any adjustments on loans sold to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac, would have to be made with its approval. 
 But Mr. Mills said that the main reason an adjustment in your payments has not been offered to you is that the mortgage is on a home that no longer serves as your prime residence.
 
Maintenance Rebate
 
Question: In June 1988, I bought the one-bedroom apartment I had rented for more than 8 years. When the building was converted to a co-op the sponsor agreed to a rebate of 15 percent of the maintenance to all "insiders" for a period of five years. The rebate was paid in 1989 and was months late in 1990. Last July, the sponsor declared bankruptcy.
My understanding was that money to cover the rebate was to be held in escrow account and managed by a trustee. Do my rights in this matter include include withholding 15 percent from our monthly maintenance? . . . Anna Shuster, Manhattan
 
Answer: No. Withholding a portion of your maintenance would be risky. According to Bruce Friedberg, an attorney who specializes in real estate matters, there are no provisions of the co-op and condominium laws that obligate the co-op to honor your sponsor's maintenance rebate program.
Moreover, by reducing your maintenance payments you could risk being in violation of the proprietary lease thus jeopardizing your right to occupy your apartment.
"Assuming that other inside buyers took advantage of the maintenance rebate offer," said Mr. Friedberg, "the loss of income when those buyers cut their payments, could make the co-op vulnerable if it resulted in a shortfall."
Mr. Friedberg said that if the maintenance rebate is a provision of the conversion plan or any of its amendments, its language would tell you if the sponsor was required to post any form of security like an escrow fund or letter of credit. There may also be a provision requiring any entity taking over the sponsor's position in case of default to assume the maintenance rebate obligation.
Mr. Friedberg suggested that you check your conversion documents. If it appears that any of its terms have been violated, you should file a complaint with the Attorney General's Real Estate Financing Bureau. The address is 120 Broadway, New York, N.Y. 10271.
 
Rights of Spouse
 
Question: I have been living in my rent-controlled apartment for 28 years, moving in with my husband in 1963. We were divorced in 1967. I have continued to live in the apartment since then, paying the rent myself. I recently remarried and now my husband and I live in the apartment together. Will I jeopardize my right to the apartment by informing the landlord of my new status? . . . Rhoda Cooperman, Queens.
 
Answer: No. There are laws or rules governing rent-controlled tenants that would reduce or alter your status after you remarry. But your landlord has the right to know of any new permanent occupants.

Empty Banks: Imposing, but Hard to Use

BYLINE: By DAVID J. WALLACE

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
Darkened bank branches in huge and inefficient but architecturally magnificent buildings in this city's former financial district pose a challenge to real estate brokers.
The question is how to reutilize the space. 
 The buildings are concentrated just south and west of City Hall, at Broad and Market Streets, the center of Philadelphia.
Walnut Street, for example, gained luster with the arrival in the last two years of prestige shops such as Louis Vuitton and Tiffany near Broad Street and of the Bombay Company and Talbots a few blocks farther west, close to Rittenhouse Square. But retailing has not been the answer for all the available space.
At least six bank branches stand vacant within three blocks of the former First Pennsylvania Bank at 15th and Chestnut Streets, which closed March 25. Four of those banks no longer exist. First Pennsylvania is still in business, and the branch's accounts were moved to other offices of the CoreStates Financial Corporation, its parent, according to a bank spokeswoman, Linda Stryker.
The closed branch, with black iron gates 40 feet high, was in the historic 1924 Packard Building, one of the neighborhood's prestige addresses.
Nearby were the city's grandest hotels and private clubs and banks, all within a block or two of the Broad Street Station.
Inside the Packard Building, the architects Ritter & Shay created two cavernous vault basements for the Pennsylvania Company, predecessor of First Pennsylvania. Two rows of structural Ionic columns, which dominate the banking floor, once set off banking counters to the left and accounts desks on the right.
CoreStates controls the property until its lease expires in July, said Jeffrey R. Seligsohn, a vice president with The Binswanger Company, which manages the building for its owner, Investcorp of New York.
"We tried to keep them, but they have three other branches within a stone's throw and price wasn't a factor," Mr. Seligsohn said. "The average new bank branch is about 4,000 square feet and this one has 12,000 square feet."
Much of the interior space is unusable, inefficient and -- since the building is on the National Register of Historic Places -- untouchable. For example, said Mr. Seligsohn, the interior bank floor might span three stories in current construction if not for the columns, which would stymie renovation efforts even if such work were allowed.
Richard Tyler, historic preservation officer of the Philadelphia Historical Commission, said the National Register has several historic districts in the downtown area, covering most buildings that are more than 50 years old, among them the Drexel & Company, Butcher & Singer and Packard buildings.
The Drexel building also was certified by the city's historical commission in 1971, and any renovation work requiring a building permit or masonry cleaning must be reviewed by Mr. Tyler's office.
National Register buildings may qualify for Federal tax credits for substantial renovation, but approval of the state's historic preservation officer and the Federal Department of the Interior is needed.
The city's commodity/financial market goes back to Colonial days but its center has been moving westward -- at near-glacial speed -- since then, and is now around 20th and Market. The First Bank of the United States, created by Alexander Hamilton, still stands in the imposing Federal-style building built in the 1790's and used until 1926. It and other venerable buildings are part of the Independence Park Historic District.
The Stock Exchange also dates to 1790 in the historic district and has had two more modern homes in the financial center, first in a 1911 building at 1411 Walnut Street designed by Horace Trumbauer and from 1964 to 1981 in a newer building at 17th and Sansom streets, according to the Philadelphia Historical Commission.
By the late 80's, as new names such as Fidelity Investments replaced Drexel & Company, Butcher & Singer or Hopper Soliday, prominent retailers opened stores from fashionable Rittenhouse Square east to Broad Street. A block north, at 15th and Walnut Streets, Dimensions, a men's clothier, in the mid-80's occupied the first floor of what had been Drexel's building.
On March 1, 1991, Dimensions filed for bankruptcy. Now that site and others are available, but both tenants and owners are leery of making long-term deals for large properties.
Built between 1925 and 1927, the space yielded some surprises when its broker, CB Commercial, prepared to market it last year. For example, a shooting gallery had been built in the basement below the 15th Street sidewalk and beautiful marble slabs were found cracked from earlier renovations, said Bill Deasey, a senior associate of CB.
"You wait for the phone to ring with good news, but it requires a real destination store because those windows aren't great for merchandise displays," Mr. Deasey said. "They're very high up off the street."
Many properties have similar design drawbacks for today's tenants, he said -- large, high windows unsuitable for merchandise display, multiple levels that deter some customers and much higher heating, cooling and lighting costs.
Several large retailers considered leasing big blocks on Walnut Street. Among them were Staples, the office-supply retailer; a British bookstore, Waterstone's Booksellers, and a British record store, HMV. But none signed a lease.
After months of fruitless negotiations, Waterstone's chose to open stores elsewhere rather than lease space in Philadelphia. And Staples, which had been developing a downtown prototype store in New York City, chose to wait until 1993 to open its Staples Express stores, said Beth Stone, a company spokeswoman.
Retailers have shifted also, said Thomas Anastasi, managing director of the Galbreath Company. Walnut Street has maintained its reputation as a Fifth Avenue, but the Shops at Liberty Place has drawn some retail luster only a few blocks north to its stores between Chestnut and Market, 16th and 17th Streets, Mr. Anastasi said.
And the uncertain retail environment has made all the parties to a lease more circumspect about committing to as large a site as the 23,000-square-foot Butcher & Singer facility, said Mr. Anastasi, who represents the property.
"It's a lot of space for someone to use because it can't be subdivided," he said. "And it's scary for a tenant or owner to put out a couple of million dollars for a retail retrofit in this economy."
Carriage House Clothiers agreed to lease 2,700 square feet in the Butcher & Singer space for a store, Mr. Anastasi said, after a separate entrance was built next to the main banking floor.
Nightclubs have been successful for several years at two buildings distinguished by their designers as well as by their current occupants. An 1837 Greek Revival bank by the architect William Strickland now houses a nightclub appropriately named Revival. And, just as appropriately, an 1872 building by Furness and Hewitt is now The Bank.
The phenomenon is not unique to downtown areas, said Ms. Stryker of CoreStates. A suburban branch in an Ardmore strip shopping center 20 minutes away required additional safe deposit boxes to accommodate some of the customers displaced when a branch closed in October 1990 at the former Merion Title & Trust Company building. The four-story building is the tallest in Ardmore's commercial district and is for sale, she said.
Across the Delaware River in Camden, N.J., preservationists identified 19 significant structures from the city's once-vibrant banking, insurance and legal economy. The buildings date from 1873 and many are in use as banks, churches, community centers and stores, said Edward Fox, president of the Camden Preservation Trust.

And the uncertain retail environment has made all the parties to a lease more circumspect about committing to as large a site as the 23,000-square-foot Butcher & Singer facility, said Mr. Anastasi, who represents the property.
"It's a lot of space for someone to use because it can't be subdivided," he said. "And it's scary for a tenant or owner to put out a couple of million dollars for a retail retrofit in this economy."
Carriage House Clothiers agreed to lease 2,700 square feet in the Butcher & Singer space for a store, Mr. Anastasi said, after a separate entrance was built next to the main banking floor.
NIGHTCLUBS have been successful at two buildings distinguished by their designers as well as by their current occupants. An 1837 Greek Revival bank by the architect William Strickland now houses a nightclub appropriately named Revival. And, just as appropriately, an 1872 building by Furness and Hewitt is now The Bank.
The phenomenon is not unique to downtown areas, said Ms. Stryker of CoreStates. A suburban branch in an Ardmore strip shopping center 20 minutes away required additional safe deposit boxes to accommodate some of the customers displaced when a branch closed in October 1990 at the former Merion Title & Trust Company building. The four-story building is the tallest in Ardmore's commercial district and is for sale, she said.
Across the Delaware River in Camden, N.J., preservationists identified 19 significant structures from the city's once-vibrant banking, insurance and legal economy. The buildings date from 1873 and many are in use as banks, churches, community centers and stores, said Edward Fox, president of the Camden Preservation Trust.

Grappling With the Revaluation Problem

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
IN the final week of the Connecticut legislative session last month, a bill was passed giving municipalities a one-time extension to Oct. 1, 1993, for revising property revaluations made in the later-80's boom market.
The measure will give towns that rejected their mandatory 10-year revaluations -- made by companies they hired -- more time to re-examine lower market prices. 
 Revaluations are the basis for assessments and, subsequently, taxes. In towns revalued from 1986 to 1990 -- when real estate prices peaked or remained relatively high, particularly in Fairfield County -- many householders now find their assessments larger than the market value of their homes. In some communities the precipitous drop in commercial property values shifted more of the tax burden to residences.
As a result, a deluge of protests from irate taxpayers caused delays in approving revaluations and setting new tax rates. By last spring more than 40 of the state's 169 communities had rejected revaluations, for which the towns had paid from $500,000 to more than $1 million.
Now, a year later, some 90 towns are seeking redress, says Walter A. Lawrence, president of the Connecticut Assessors Association and the assessor for Tolland. "The 10-year cycle of revaluations was set when property didn't appreciate as fast as it has since the 1970's," he said. "Most of the country is on a two- to five-year revaluation schedule. Fewer than 10 states require revaluations as infrequently as Connecticut."
His association has proposed bills backing five-year revaluations, but the Legislature has not responded. "Revaluation usually means an upward adjustment of taxes and a large expenditure by the town to hire a revaluation company," he said, something that legislators are not likely to impose on their constituents.
In Stamford, where the grand list, or value of all taxable property, declined this year by almost $20 million, to $6 billion, a 1991 revaluation was rejected and the city received permission from the state to set its tax rate on a 10-year-old revaluation until a new one is done in 1993.
The average property-tax rate for the fiscal year beginning July 1 is $37.80 for every $1,000 in assessed value, 1.9 percent more than the current fiscal year. Rural residences without sewers are assessed lower than heavily serviced downtowns with the most commercial development.
"From now on we are going to have an adjustment every five years," said Edward Faski, Stamford's acting tax assessor. Sales will be tracked and analyzed by computer and property values will be adjusted accordingly after five years. At the end of 10 years a complete revaluation, with on-site inspections, will be done as usual.
Greenwich and Norwalk are among other towns preparing computerized five-year systems. "The technology now permits data bases to be set up in-house," said State Senator George Jepsen, a Stamford Democrat whose Planning and Development Committee proposed the revaluation extension bill.
After causing such upheavals, will real estate take another roller-coaster ride in the foreseeable future? "Maybe not to the same degree, but yes, the wheel goes around," said Peter Helie, vice president of William Pitt, Stamford realtors. "The mid-80's boom was the largest I've seen in my lifetime in the business, but when inventories are low, prices are driven up. It's the old economics of supply and demand."
However, he predicts only 3 to 4 percent appreciation starting in 1993 instead of the 25 to 30 percent that prevailed in the 80's. He also predicts that commercial properties will lag behind residential properties until 1995.
SHARING that view is James Fagan, vice president of the CB Commercial brokerage in Stamford. The sale of 595 Summer Street by the First Constitution Bank for $3.4 million a year ago, he said, "is considered a premium deal now; it was sold before people realized how much more prices would go down." The asking price had been up to $8 million.
Mr. Fagan suggests that taxing systems in smaller towns like Westport, where one rate is set for the entire town, can be unfair to commercial property owners. "Homes are not in the same kind of trouble as commercial property," he said, "because there is still a lot of mortgage money for dwellings. Banks bundle up residential mortgages and sell them. There is no money for commercial mortgages. For example, a 30,000-square-foot-building on Charles Street sold for $4.6 million in 1984, but it is now marketed at $1.7 million. The owner couldn't protest his assessment in 1985 when the last revaluation was done, but in 1995 he will have a good argument."
Kenneth C. Carvell, Westport's assessor, said, "We had a drastic run-up of real estate values on all fronts." A revaluation in 1980 "was not satisfactory," he said, "and the town decided to do another one in 1985, which is now our base year."
Westport's property-tax rate went up by only .2 percent, to $21.50 for eached $1,000 of assessed value, and the town not encouraging more commercial development or seeking tenants for its vacant business buildings to keep taxes down. "I wouldn't want to project out to the 1995 revaluation," Mr. Carvell said, "but current trends indicate that a shift to higher residential taxes will occur."
Greenwich's rejected 1989 revaluation brought its grand list up to $10 billion from $3 billion a decade earlier. The town was given an extension to submit another revaluation by Oct. 1 of this year. William J. Bliss, the town comptroller, said it should total around $8 billion. "The market has gone down," he said, "and it will definitely lower the tax rate."
At $33.20 per $1,000, or 5.4 percent over last year, Greenwich no longer holds the record for the lowest property-tax rate in the state. "Lately it's been going up 4 to 5 percent a year," Mr. Bliss said.
New Canaan, Darien and Ridgefield had revaluations in 1988 but their mostly residential grand lists were not as sharply skewed and there were fewer complaints. The assessors do not favor more frequent revaluations because of of their cost.
"Twenty-five years after the development of a new central business district began here," said Jon Smith, Stamford's city planner, "everyone is taking a hard look at economic planning. They are not looking for an end result with no forethought, as they did then in a market that seemed endlessly beneficent."

Story of Portugal Unfolds Through A Varied Collection

BYLINE: By VIVIEN RAYNOR

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
THE Newark Public Library is widely known for its holding in prints as well as books and for the expertise of its supervising librarian of special collections, William Dane.
There being neither the space nor the money for costly installations in these marble halls, at 5 Washington Street, the library shows are not glamorous. But they can be counted on for items rare, beautiful, instructive or entertaining -- or all three -- and they are always well documented. 
 Sad to say, "Portugal, a Romantic Journey" is none of the above. Integral to the festival of the same name, being held in Newark, the show is billed as a joint effort by the library and the Portuguese Heritage Foundation, but it is emphatically not a Dane production. Indeed, it seems less an exhibition than a package left on the library's doorstep. The politest way of summing it up would be to say that it depends on what you mean by "romantic."
All the same, the era so named is considered by some historians to have begun in Portugal by way of the unprecedented earthquake of 1755, which demolished much of Lisbon and left its mark on the European psyche. Without the guidance of labels, however, visitors have no way of telling if the earthquake is mentioned, much less the catastrophic fire that hit the capital a few years ago.
In other words, this is a chamber of commerce-style miscellany of posters, photographs aimed at tourists, reproductions, a few books and prints, medals, ceramics, flags, dolls, lace and souvenirs like the filigree silver caravel shown on this page. Since the reviewer's visit, the label problem has been rectified, but clearly there is nothing to be done about the lack of focus.
Visitors from Newark's Portuguese community will doubtless take pleasure in familiar craft items like the tall crowns of paper flowers worn in festivals and in the pictures of their homeland. It seems unlikely that they will be overjoyed to see pictures of a TAP Air Portugal building and a Portuguese sports club, both in Newark, but you never know.
As for those ignorant of the country, some may pick up scraps of knowledge along the way, but most will leave no wiser than they were on entering and rather more confused. Still, given the current interest in things Brazilian, it may be that a few will consult the library's reference section and discover that, for example, Brazil was the largest of the many colonies established by Portugal. To be fair, though, the posters do cover the empire.
In view of the price still being paid for colonialism, it is hard to contemplate its beginnings with equanimity but just as hard not to be impressed by them. The Portuguese honor roll begins with the prince known as Henry the Navigator (even though he never went to sea), who masterminded the exploration of coastal Africa and began the European slave trade by bringing Africans to Portugal, the better to Christianize them.
After that comes Vasco da Gama, whose first voyage to India netted booty that was worth 60 times the cost of the trip, including the loss of two ships and two-thirds of the explorer's crew. Other pioneers include Magellan, whose fleet circumnavigated the globe, albeit in the pay of Spain; Pedro Cabral, whose discovery of Brazil was accidental, and Bartolomeo Diaz, the first to round the Cape of Good Hope.
It was thanks to these extraordinary men (and to the scientific legacy bequeathed by the Moors) that Portugal, by the end of the 16th century, controlled the sea lanes all the way to China and the East Indies, occupying key sites in countries along the way. All this from a kingdom roughly the same size as Maine.
Evidence of Portugal's golden age (and its Moorish influence) can be glimpsed in the photographs, one of a window grille, others of the Batalha Monastery and all resembling masterpieces in pastry. The outside of the monastery is all flying buttresses, "spirelets" and crocketing, with the door set in a dramatic ogee arch. Inside, the ornament on walls and piers recalls Max Ernst's experiments in decalcomania.
When Spain occupied the country from 1580 to 1640, the golden age began to subside, but the country recovered economically when the Duke of Braganza led a successful rebellion and founded the last of its dynasties, whose present representative presides over the festival.
Apparently Portugal's glittering past does not include massive industrialization. As a result, the country remains rural and evidently very beautiful. Somewhere in this jumble of objects there may be the germ of the show that it deserves.
This one will be on view through July 30. Currently, the library is open Monday, Friday and Saturday from 9 A.M. to 5:30 P.M. and Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday from 9 A.M. to 8:30 P.M. Starting June 29, the summer hours are Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday from 9 A.M. to 5:30 P.M., Wednesday from 9 A.M. to 8:30 P.M. and Saturday from 10 A.M. to 1 P.M.

MAKING KOCHINA DOLLS
 Marlon Huma, a member of the Hopi tribe, will demonstrate the making of Kochina dolls in Yonkers Thursday through Saturday from 11 A.M. to 6 P.M. Kochina is the religion of the Hopi Indians. The dolls and dances represent various elements of the cycle of life and their interconnection.
The demonstrations will take place at Steve's Trading Post, 471 Tuckahoe Road, where Steve Katz, the owner, sells jewelry, pottery, basketry, rugs, sculpture, headdresses, drums and other crafts from more than 30 tribes he visits nationwide.
The dolls are carved from cottonwood roots and can be 1 to 18 inches tall. They can be male or female, shaped and painted to depict clowns, spirits, the seasons, maidens and braves. They sometimes have eagle feather headdresses, leather boots and jewelry that has been handed down from previous generations. They are a common sight hanging on the walls in Hopi households.
Mr. Huma is from the village of First Mesa on the 40,000-acre Navajo Reservation near Flagstaff, Ariz. "Marlon has become a special friend," Mr. Katz said, "and I am returning his hospitality to me by inviting him here for awhile to see how I live." Mr. Huma, 30 years old, is married and has three children. He has traveled outside Arizona only once, to a powwow in Oklahoma.
"There are only 9,000 Hopis left," Mr. Katz said, "and they survive by making and selling their handiwork." The dolls take about two weeks to complete, not because the work is so time consuming but because Hopis have a different perception of time.
The dolls sell for $250 to $1,400. A few will be for sale, and others can be ordered from Mr. Huma. The number to call for more information is 779-9613.
 
BOOK AND AUTHOR LUNCH
 Four noted authors will speak at the Westchester Library Association's Book and Author Luncheon tomorrow at noon at the Tarrytown Hilton. This is to be the first of a series of yearly luncheons featuring speakers and giving the libraries an opportunity to promote themselves in a time of economic constraint.
George J. Delaney, vice president of Consolidated Edison, which helped underwrite the event, will serve as chairman.
The authors will talk about their most recent books, all published within the last year. They are Robert Stone, author of "Outerbridge Reach," published by Ticknor & Fields; Belva Plain, whose "Treasures" was published by Delacorte; Gary Sick, author of "October Surprise," published by Times Books, and Robert Kotlowitz, whose "His Master's Voice" is from Knopf.
Packages containing information and souvenirs from the county's 38 libraries will be placed on each chair, and tickets at $30 may be purchased at the hotel or at the Getty Square, Grinton I. Will and Crestwood library branches in Yonkers.
 
RUSSIAN ART SHOW
 The Russians are coming to the Somerstown Gallery today, depicted in paintings and photographs, which will remain on exhibition through July 5.
Oils by Sergei Polyakov, now living in Moscow but originally from Belarus (formerly Byelorussia), are exuberant, bold and colorful, evoking the myths and fairy tales of Old Russia with humor and style.
Marjorie Michael has produced a series of paintings of Russia's massive and elaborate medieval churches, restored during the last few decades by the Soviet Government. She followed the route of the so- called Golden Ring of churches from Moscow through the Yaroslavi, Kostroma and Vladimir regions of northeastern Russia.
Two Russians, Anatoly Loshmanov and Sergei Kuzmin, and one American, Lisa Toto, contributed the photographic images in the show, capitalizing on the increased freedom of photojournalists to record what they wish on film.
Mr. Kuzmin has been a photographer for Pravda and the Free Trade Union Journal, while Mr. Loshmanov was director of photography for the Kiev Movie Studio before branching out on his own to maintain a freelance photography studio.
Ms. Toto left her job at the Bridgeport Post to make three trips to Russia, where she photographed the wasteland created by the Chernobyl nuclear accident and former President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, among other subjects.
During the opening reception today from 2 to 5 P.M. a slide presentation of Russian landmarks, sculpture and art will be given by Leonid Hushmatov. The gallery, on Route 100 in Somers, is open Tuesdays through Sundays from 1 to 5 P.M. More information is available by calling 277-3461.
 
VASSAR BOOK SALE
 More than 300 Westchester students have obtained scholarships to Vassar through a book sale that the college has held each year since 1959. In the process, more than 1.25 million books and related items have been sold. The 1992 sale will be held at the County Center in White Plains Friday through Sunday from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M.
A collector's corner will feature first editions, unusual illustrated books, autographed and rare books and books noted mainly for their tiny size and great age. In addition there will be a collection of books on the archeology of the South Pacific and pre-Columbian regions, books on antiques, Japanese dolls and fine art, cookbooks, children's books, records, mysteries and languages, including Spanish, French, German, Swedish, Russian, Hungarian and Japanese.
Paperbacks will cost 50 cents, and 40,000 hardcovers, $1 and more. At unscheduled times, instant bargain sales, a Vassar tradition, will occur, giving patrons a half-hour to buy all they can carry for half price or purchase any book with a red cover for 25 cents for 10 minutes or take advantage of other quick-sale incentives. The phone number for more information is 948-4115 or 761-8376.
 
NEW SUNNYSIDE WALK
 A walk in the woods that Washington Irving himself used to stroll has been reopened at Sunnyside, his home in Tarrytown. Historic Hudson Valley, with a grant of $50,000, expanded the half-mile trail and installed a wooden bridge and benches at scenic overlooks along the Hudson River.
Using as reference material drawings from 1856 that show a path and benches near the stream, the project, which took more than a year, afforded an opportunity to open up eight acres of formerly inaccessible property and create a picnic area.
Guided walks and discussions of the Romantic Landscape tradition will be held every Saturday from 11 A.M. to 4 P.M. on the hour through the end of August. The trail is open to visitors on their own daily except Tuesdays from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. From July 4 through Labor Day, the trail will be open until 8 P.M. Saturdays and Sundays, offering views of sunsets across the river.
Sunnyside is just off Route 9, one mile south of the Tappan Zee Bridge. Admission to the grounds is $3 and includes the guided and unguided walks. Those who wish to take guided tours of Irving's house will be charged $3 in addition to the grounds admission. The number to call for more information is 631-8200.

HEADLINE: The Collaboration In the Night Kitchen

BYLINE: By ROBERTA HERSHENSON

DATELINE: PURCHASE

 BODY:
CHRISTOPHER BEACH, director of the Performing Arts Center here on the campus of the State University of New York, did more than name-drop when he announced the center's impressive lineup of artists for next season. He also introduced a literary figure as beloved to parents as to the children who happily snuggle up with his books.
Maurice Sendak, the author and illustrator of such books as "Where the Wild Things Are" and "In the Night Kitchen," took the podium on the stage of Theater B to describe to an invited audience his new venture, the Night Kitchen: A National Children's Theater. 
 With him at the announcement, which was made in March, was Arthur Yorinks, a prize-winning author of children's books himself, who is the associate artistic director of the new theater company. Both men expressed their excitement at being able to present sophisticated plays, operas and musical comedies to children in productions developed especially for the Night Kitchen.
The company will be in residence here and perform in Theater B as part of the Performing Arts Center's next Familyfare series, beginning in October. Mr. Yorinks, a North Salem resident who has also written for the stage, screen and opera, said that the plays would be presented in workshop form before their formal premieres as co-productions of such other theaters as the Houston Grand Opera and the Kennedy Center.
 
Chamber Opera Planned
 The company's first work, to be presented here next January, is "Really Rosie," a musical written by Mr. Sendak and the songwriter Carole King and designed and directed by Mr. Sendak. The character of Rosie comes from several earlier books by Mr. Sendak, and the play itself was expanded from an animated television special presented by CBS in 1975.
Next March, the company will present an as-yet-unnamed short comedy, written and directed by Mr. Yorinks and Bill Irwin, a movement artist. Future works, planned for late next year and early 1994, include "Hey, Al," a chamber opera based on an award-winning book of the same name by Mr. Yorinks, and a new dramatic version of "Peter Pan."
The opera "Hey, Al," which was written by Mr. Yorinks and the composer Peter Schickele -- who is known for such musical antics as P.D.Q. Bach -- will feature designs based on the book's illustrations by Richard Egielski.
"Peter Pan" was adapted by Mr. Sendak and Mr. Yorinks and written by Mr. Yorinks; Mr. Sendak, who has designed costumes and stage sets for many operas, also designed "Peter Pan."
 
Mickey Picked for the Logo
 After making his remarks on the stage where his own "wild rumpus" will begin next year, the man who created Max, the king of all wild things, was besieged by autograph seekers. But it is not Max, the young hero of "Where the Wild Things Are," who adorns the new company's logo. Rather, it is Mickey, the pajamaless pilot of the bread-dough airplane that flew through the pages of "In the Night Kitchen," who smiles out from a starry sky.
It seemed fitting to name the company for that book, the two men said, because they began the theater project on the 20th anniversary of the publication of "In the Night Kitchen" in 1970. In addition, the partners met while Mr. Sendak was completing the book; Mr. Yorinks, then 17 years old, rang the already famous author's doorbell in Greenwich Village, hoping to show him some of his own writings, and the two have been friends ever since.
The uninhibited character of Mickey, the little boy who swam nude in a giant bottle of milk, upset some people when "In the Night Kitchen" was published. But Mr. Sendak, in a recent conversation, said he "didn't set out to do anything controversial" in any of his books.
Instead, he said, he was inspired by his editor, the late Ursula Nordstrom, at what was then Harper and Row Publishers and is now HarperCollins, to be as "bold, honest and fierce" as she was in her belief in children's literature.
 
Avoiding Condescension
 Guided by "her imagination and instinct," Mr. Sendak said, he grew as an artist "by doing her bidding, turning in on myself for her approval."
This meant, he added, not thinking of works meant for children in a condescending way. The notion of "a children's book," Mr. Sendak said, in itself can be "a sloppy idea."
Although the author has no children, he said that "in an instinctual sense, I'm living with them all the time." Like Max, the "wild thing" who wore his wolf suit and threatened to eat his mother up, children can be "barbaric, cannibalistic and ruthless," Mr. Sendak said. "These are the weapons by which they get through childhood, to defend themselves against us."
He gave an example of how well-meaning parents can unwittingly terrify their children. One time, he said, a mother forcibly took one of Mr. Sendak's books out of her child's hand so that the author could autograph it. "Here she had taught him never to write in his books, and she is giving his favorite book to a strange man -- me -- to write in!" Mr. Sendak recalled. The boy shouted at him not to mess up his book; the mother slapped the boy, and the author himself "was horrified," he said. The incident summed up, he added, "the entirety of childhood."
 
Film Company Started
 He will turn 64 on Wednesday, but Mr. Sendak, who lives and works in Ridgefield, Conn., is hardly slowing down. Besides working for the last two years to start the Night Kitchen, he began what he calls "a little film company in California" about six weeks ago. The company doesn't have a name yet, but the artist said he would like to call it Wild Things Productions.
"I'm extending myself in all directions, quadrupling my efforts and happy about it," Mr. Sendak said, adding that he would still write books that were "worth doing." He said the vulnerability of children in today's world had made him "a foot soldier again," unable to settle back comfortably "in this beautiful nook" of the state in which he lives.
"It's a mission; we have a job to do," he said. "With air going out of a hole in the sky, AIDS, L.A. burning, a Government terrifying and useless, how can you live the smug life anymore?"
The 38-year-old Mr. Yorinks said raising money for the Night Kitchen's $1.5 million budget was "a hard sell," not only because of the tight economy but because of "an implicit condescension."
 
Seed Money From HarperCollins
 "When it really comes down to people putting their hands in their pockets, there is a slight hypocrisy," Mr. Yorinks said. "They say, 'Why does it cost so much? It's only for children.' But we're trying to bring kids into the theater for a real experience. It's a very ambitious project, and it needs a lot of support."
Seed money for the Night Kitchen came from HarperCollins, now the publishing company of both authors, and enabled the fledgling company to rent office space in Manhattan and hire an administrative staff.
The directors consider the Performing Arts Center home, however. "Purchase has wonderful facilities, and they are interested in the kinds of things we're doing," Mr. Yorinks said of the college. "We're making a marriage of this."

Life Styles of the Rich, Famous Insider Traders 

The seven investors charged last week with insider trading by the Securities and Exchange Commission were part of the celebrity set. Among them: Edward R. Downe Jr., husband of the automobile heiress Charlotte Ford and a major collector of American art. Martin E. Revson was co-founder of Revlon cosmetics. Steven A. Greenberg is a flashy public relations executive. The S.E.C. charged that from 1987 to 1989 Mr. Downe and Mr. Greenberg exploited their access to inside information to generate at least $23 million in illegal gains. One instance involved contracts for call options for the Bally Manufacturing Corporation, whose shares soared 45 percent. The S.E.C. says Mr. Greenberg slipped Mr. Downe information on his yacht in the Caribbean and at his Southampton house. "This is a classic -- very significant -- insider trading case," said Richard Walker, the New York regional S.E.C. administrator.

Travelmania
 
By all accounts, the airline industry's half-price summer sale, which ended last week, was an overwhelming success. During the 10-day sale, American Airlines sold out almost its entire allotment of discounted seats. Delta Airlines sold more than five million tickets during the sale. Telephone traffic to ticket agents was so overwhelming some customers were put on hold for hours. Altogether, the airlines sold 25 million tickets worth $2.6 billion. And since passengers need somewhere to stay once they reach their destinations, hotel reservations are up. For the nation's ailing airlines -- they lost $4.5 billion last year -- the sales could be a boon since other fares have actually risen. They "could even end up making a few bucks," said Richard P. Firese, publisher of Travel Agent magazine.
 
Elvis, the Thin Version
 
It was a question only an organization like the Postal Service could pose to the nation: Which image of Elvis Presley do you prefer? A paunchy, middle-aged king, wearing glasses and a too-tight spandex suit, or the young, hip-swiveling Elvis clutching the mike. The Postal Service asked people to send in post cards to register their votes. Last week, at a ceremony at Graceland, Elvis's palatial home in Memphis, the winning image was revealed. Not surprisingly, the svelte Elvis won. That image will be the first in a series called Legends in American Music. The Postal Service makes about $200 million a year from commemorative stamp sales.

Perot Campaign Goes Pro
 
In the political consulting business, they may be the dream ticket: spin-doctor Edward J. Rollins, who managed Ronald Reagan's 1984 re-election campaign, and Hamilton Jordan, the strategist who managed Jimmy Carter's successful 1976 Presidential race. Though Mr. Jordan is a Democrat and Mr. Rollins a Republican, last week they signed on as co-managers of billionaire Ross Perot's still-undeclared Presidential campaign. Mr. Jordan will handle strategy; Mr. Rollins will take over day-to-day tactics. The two consultants will be rewarded handsomely. Rumors have been circulating that Mr. Perot would pay them each $5 million, but Mr. Perot said, "When you're spending your own money, you don't do things like that."

The Inscrutable Buffett
 
For weeks Wall Street was speculating over who would replace Warren E. Buffett, the Omaha investor who took over as interim chairman of Salomon Brothers Inc., after the firm admitted manipulating the Treasury-bill market. Mr. Buffett worked tirelessly to change Solly's kamikaze corporate culture and rehabilitate its name. Last week, he stunned the street by appointing Robert E. Denham, Salomon's general counsel, as chairman. Mr. Denham has guided Salomon through investigations, which ended in a settlement for $290 million. "It was a classic Warren Buffett move," said Deryck C. Maughan, chairman Salomon's investment banking subsidiary. "Everybody's predicting one thing and he thinks in a new way."

Punishing G.E.
 
For the General Electric Company, the nation's third-largest military contractor, justice was swift. At the beginning of the week, G.E., which sold the Pentagon $2.7 billion of jet engines last year, was barred from renewing engine contracts with the Pentagon and from negotiating new ones. The ban resulted from charges that G.E. executives bribed Gen. Rami Dotan of Israel to help the company sell its engines there. The Pentagon asked G.E. to tighten up internal controls and discipline its employees. But after only five days, the Pentagon lifted its ban. A Justice Department criminal investigation is under way.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
The Villain of Rio
 
Last week, William K. Reilly, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said the United States "will have one of the less desirable jobs of the Earth Summit, that of party pooper." That's because the White House said it would boycott the global warming treaty unless the carbon dioxide emissions cap was removed (it was) and that it would not sign the biodiversity treaty -- which Mr. Reilly supported. Just before the summit meeting opened President Bush offered a plan to save forests. He said the White House would increase aid to other nations' forestry programs by $150 million to $270 million. But environmentalists were not impressed. They pointed out that the White House recently agreed to clear-cutting of the nation's old-growth forests.
 
If President Bush is the Earth Summit's villain -- "Uncle Grubby," the Brazilian press calls him -- the Europeans and Japanese are its heroes. Europe announced a "carbon tax" on oil last week and Japan pledged $773 million to Brazil to help clean up Guanabara Bay off Rio de Janeiro.
 
From Bread Line to Ruble Line
 
The latest shortage in Russia is not bread but money. The Government has run out of 5,000-ruble notes and other forms of cash. The shortage is so bad that on a recent trip to Siberia, Russia's President, Boris N. Yeltsin, had to load his plane with 500 million rubles to pay workers' salaries there. The Government -- Russia's main employer -- owes workers a trillion rubles. Yegor T. Gaidar, Moscow's top economist, went on TV last week to tell the nation that relief was on the way: Russia's presses would turn out new notes worth 142 billion rubles by July, 2.5 times the amount printed last month, and they would keep running until 270 billion rubles were printed. When the ink is dry, Russian workers will get their pay, he said, plus an 80 percent annual interest rate on the money past due. Western economists blanched. With prices rising at a 300 percent rate, they fear hyperinflation.
 
The former Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, warned that economic reforms had put Russia on "the verge of an explosion."

Are Japan's Banks Too Big?
 
Japanese banks, like many Japanese companies, have favored market share over profits. Their share of international lending rose to 40 percent in 1989. But now they are hitting the brakes. Japan's biggest banks have a record number of corporate bankruptcies to contend with. Their share of international lending is now about 30 percent. "We may need to think more about profits than expansion," said Hisao Kobayahi, a managing director of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank

An Uncertain Community
 
Until last week, the European Community's march toward political and monetary union seemed like a certainty. Then the Danes went to the polls and voted down the Maastricht treaty, which provides a timetable for creating a single currency. That's a problem for Europe's leaders since the treaty, which was signed last December, requires approval by all 12 E.C. members. "It's a bad blow at a sensitive time," said Dominique Moisi, of the French Institute for International Relations.

Slimmer Trade Gap
 
The nation's first-quarter trade gap declined by 4.48 percent to $14.9 billion, the Commerce Department said.

 
 
THE ECONOMY

 
Bad Economic News for Bush
 
When the Labor Department reported last week that unemployment moved up to 7.5 percent in May from 7.2 in April, it was bad news, but not just for the economy. It "will also create some flak for President Bush," said Richard D. Rippe, chief economist at Prudential Securities Inc. According to the Labor Department, although the economy is recovering, job growth has been sluggish.

Jobs in the Works
 
According to a quarterly survey by Dun & Bradstreet of 3,000 companies, businesses may soon start hiring. The survey reported that 60 percent of the chief executives polled were optimistic about business conditions this summer and about hiring. But there are jobs and there are jobs. "The larger the firm, the higher the wages and benefits," said Charles McMillion, president of MBG, a business information firm in Washington. "One mass layoff can overwhelm the hiring plans of many smaller companies."

When Not to Balance the Budget
 
At his news conference last week, President Bush urged passage of the balanced budget amendment. But last week a petition against that amendment was delivered to Congress by the Economic Policy Institute; it was signed by 447 economists, including seven Nobel Prize winners. The statement said: "When the private economy is in recession, a constitutional requirement that would force cuts in public spending or tax increases could worsen the economic downturn causing greater loss of jobs, production and income."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
A Danish Earthquake Shakes Europe

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
Statesmanship is not a characteristic widely associated with the current crop of politicians, on this or any other continent. But there is one area where the politicians clearly have been trying to do what they are convinced is the right thing.
That area is international economic integration. Whether in Europe or the Americas, national leaders have been willing to push for freer trade despite the possibility that such moves will damage local interests. And few national political parties have chosen to seek cheap gains by inflaming local emotions. 
 Then came Denmark. In a vote that stunned politicians throughout Europe, the Danes narrowly voted against the Maastricht Treaty last week. When that treaty for European monetary union was negotiated, it seems to never have occurred to the politicians that ratification might be a problem.
The vote roiled European markets, generally strengthening the German mark while pushing interest rates up throughout the continent. Share prices were especially weak in France, where the CAC 40 index fell 2.5 percent for the week, and where the Government hurriedly decided that French ratification would be put to the voters rather than left up to Parliament. Now it is remembered that, as Lehman Brothers strategist Steven Nagourney noted, there was no real debate on Maastricht in any country except Britain before the deal was struck.
For many, it is unthinkable that anything will derail the move to (Western) European monetary union, which has proceeded even as central Europe has been torn apart by old ethnic and religious hatreds. "It has to succeed," said Olivier Lacoin of Banque Nationale de Paris. "There is a momentum for Europe."
If he proves wrong, there is a fair chance that Europe, beset by weak economies at the moment, could see a round of competitive currency devaluations. Already the threat of higher interest rates in much of Europe is making economic recovery in Britain a bit less likely. And rising nationalism could derail the tender compromise on farm subsidies that has renewed hopes for a world trade deal. French farmers are furious about that deal, and might just vote against Europe to demonstrate their fury.
In this hemisphere, the leaders of Mexico, Canada and the United States have been moving toward a free trade agreement. It is nowhere near as comprehensive as Maastricht, but the spirit is the same. The belief is that freer trade raises living standards for all.
It is not clear if voting majorities are willing to endorse such long-range thinking. The rise of right-wing splinter parties in France and Germany, and the groundswell of support for Ross Perot, may reflect frustration at the unwillingness of political establishments to let the public be heard on one of the most important economic issues of the era. To advocates of free trade, keeping the issue above the political fray is evidence of statesmanship. To others it just appears undemocratic.

HEADLINE: The Coming Crisis of the American Work Force

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In the wake of the Los Angeles riots, many public officials are pointing out that minority workers will represent more than half of the growth in the labor force in the next decade. They worry that these workers are badly equipped for the demanding jobs of the 21st century, prompting politicians to propose several measures to deal with the problem.
Economists are increasingly concerned that the American economy will pay the price through lower growth in productivity if something is not done soon to address the problem of inadequate education and training. 
 These experts say the prosperity of all Americans, even those with advanced degrees, could be hurt if new workers -- whether in factories, offices or hospitals -- do not have the required skills for tomorrow's workplace. They also say the profound changes in the work force expected in the next decade point to an increased interdependence between America's whites and nonwhites.
"Since we're doing such a lousy job providing these young people with education and training now, it simply implies a lower standard of living for all Americans, not just blacks and Hispanics," said Bill Brock, the former Secretary of Labor who is chairman of a high-level commission on the skills needed for the workplace of tomorrow.
Economists and a growing number of politicians say an increasingly diverse work force that lacks the proper skills will make it harder for American companies to survive against German and Japanese competition. And by failing to produce sufficient economic growth, the Government will have a harder time maintaining Social Security and Medicare benefits at current levels for Americans who retire early next century.
Economists and educators say vastly increased efforts are needed to improve schooling and training for the minority workers entering the labor force, many of whom are dropouts or attended inferior schools. While noting that American youths in general are less well educated and less prepared for work than German or Japanese youths, these experts say special efforts need to be made for minority youths, who often grow up in a climate of poverty, violence and despair.
"The level of poverty among kids in this country is more than twice that of any industrial country with which we compete," said Marc S. Tucker, president of the National Center on Education and the Economy, a nonprofit group based in Rochester. "It's not reasonable to expect those who grow up in poverty to achieve world-class levels in school and in the workplace."
As part of a post-Los Angeles urban package, some members of Congress are pushing for several hundred million dollars more annually for education and training for inner-city youths, but many experts say these efforts are far too small considering the scope of the problem.
One idea that has picked up steam on Capitol Hill since the riots is to set up a program like the 1930's Civilian Conservation Corps, in which some ghetto youths would be placed in residential work programs in the country to receive training and job experience. These workers might repair roads and renovate public buildings, for instance.
To increase opportunities for all Americans, Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, is sponsoring a separate bill to make up to $30,000 in college loans available to 18-year-olds fresh out of high school or to 28-year-olds who have worked in factories for 10 years.
Mr. Bradley has repeatedly argued that if America's whites seek to shun the needs of the nation's black and Hispanic children, including their need for better education and training, everyone, including whites, will suffer.
"Children of white America and their future will depend increasingly on the talents of nonwhite America," he said in an interview. "If we have fewer people with sufficient skill levels, we won't compete as well against other national economies. Children of white America will have a future where their economic prospects will be less than they might otherwise be. This is a matter of real enlightened self-interest."
Economists and educators say all American youths -- not just nonwhites -- are less prepared for the workplace than youths from other industrial countries. On tests of math and science, American students often perform significantly worse than not only Japanese and German students but even those of some developing nations.
"Our larger problem is we don't stack up very well generally against our competitors," said Billy J. Tidwell, chief economist for the National Urban League. "Then, our minority population, which is growing faster than the population at large, doesn't even stack up by our own standards."
The Labor Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills found that 60 percent of Americans between the ages of 21 and 25 lack the basic reading and writing skills needed in the modern workplace. And a recent Urban League report notes that while 68 percent of white adults read at the 11th grade level, only 31 percent of African-Americans do.
Executives at many companies complain that job applicants are woefully unprepared, and they say the skills required for the jobs of tomorrow will be far greater than those of today. Not only will future workers be expected to understand more about computers and mathematics, but as management removes layers of bureaucracy and passes on more responsibility to lower levels, workers will have to be more adept at solving problems and communicating.
At Motorola, the electronics company based in Schaumburg, Ill., 50 percent of job applicants fail to satisfy seventh-grade reading levels and fifth-grade math levels. Motorola says it plans to spend $30 million in the next five years just to bring many of its workers up to those basic levels.
"The business community needs to do a better job communicating to schools the dramatic changes going on in the workplace," said James D. Burge, a Motorola vice president for personnel affairs.
According to Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates, the work force will increase from 124.7 million workers in 1990 to 150.7 million in 2005, an increase of 26 million workers. Because a disproportionate number of people leaving the work force to retire will be white and because minority members represent a growing percentage of new people entering the labor force, minority workers will represent 54 percent of the net increase in the labor force.
Hispanic workers will represent 27.8 percentage points of the increased labor force, blacks will account for 15.8 points and Asian Americans, 10.1 points.
"It's not just the fact that a disproportionate number of people entering the work force are black, Hispanic and poor," said Mr. Tucker, head of the center on education and the economy. "It's also that there are fewer people available coming into the work force. Companies have to reach further down into the queue of qualified people."
Economists and educators agree that the 30 percent of Americans who receive degrees from colleges or community colleges are among the best educated people the world. The problem, they say, is the 70 percent of young Americans who do not receive college degrees, most of whom receive little training for the occupations they enter.
"This country cannot survive in a competitive world on the basis of a highly trained and skilled 30 percent of its work force," said Mr. Brock, the former Labor Secretary.
Many labor experts say that the United States does less than any other leading industrial country to help youths make the transition from school to the workplace. This, they say, especially hurts those who do not go to college because they obtain little guidance in finding jobs and little training for specific occupations.
School systems spend about $5,000 a year for high school students, but often nothing is spent to educate or train dropouts. This hurts not just the dropouts but also the quality of the labor force.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, is sponsoring a bill aimed at helping those who do not go to college to make the transition to the work force. The bill follows recommendations of the Commission on the Skills of the American Work Force, which calls for setting up a tough new basic education performance standard for all students -- a move intended to push students and schools to work harder. This standard, which most students would be expected to meet by age 16, would be established nationally and pegged to the highest standard in the world.
The report calls on states to insure that all students, even ones who drop out, meet the basic performance standards on reading, writing, math and other areas. For instance, the states might finance job-training programs for dropouts that would also provide remedial education in the basics.
Borrowing an idea from Germany's apprenticeship programs, the report also calls for establishing a wide range of technical and professional certificates. These would go to youths who do not pursue bachelor's degrees, but instead complete multiyear programs of work and study. These certificates would signal that students have the entry-level skills for specific occupations. The certificates should thus help raise skill levels, and when certificate holders are hired, they will be rewarded for their training.
"If we continue with the same proportion of unskilled workers that we used to have, the situation for American competitiveness and improving the American standard of living is rather bleak," said Arnold H. Packer, a labor expert at Johns Hopkins University.
In a report advocating a Marshall Plan to help America's economy, the Urban League calls for vastly expanding the Jobs Corps, a residential program, mainly in cities, that provides intensive job training, remedial education and counseling. The report notes that the corps enrolls 70,000 youths a year, or 5 percent of eligible dropouts. The Urban League says the Job Corps should be expanded to 400,000 spots annually.
Senator Bradley says the work force's increased diversity can be a plus for the economy for numerous reasons, including greater knowledge of languages and greater cultural affinities with markets overseas.
The increased diversity "could be an enormous opportunity," he said. "On the other hand, it means that to the extent the nonwhite work force is unskilled, we're not going to be as competitive in the world market."
 
 
 
A LACK OF PROBLEM-SOLVERS
 Recent studies show that the failure of minority workers to develop advanced skills is cutting into their earning power as a more sophisticated economy demands higher skill levels.
Citing a study by Sheldon Danziger, an economics professor at the University of Michigan, the commission headed by Mr. Brock noted that the percentage of minority men with high school degrees who do not earn enough to support a family of four above the poverty line has soared.
According to that study, the proportion of all African-American men with 12 years of education, aged 25 to 54, who had low earnings rose to 42.7 percent in 1989 from 20 percent in 1969. The percentage among Hispanic men jumped to 35.9 percent from 16.4 percent. There was also a jump for white men: to 22.6 percent from 8.3 percent.
The commission said that sufficient data were not available to make similar comparisons for working women.
"I don't think we do a very good job educating children beyond the requirements of the industrial agrarian society that we are leaving behind," said Robert F. Peterkin, a former superintendent of Milwaukee's schools, who now directs the urban superintendents' program at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. "We're not preparing them for the information-technology society that is being created."
Mr. Peterkin complained that American schools are "continuing to do the drill-and-kill exercises" around basic information that do not prepare youngsters to be agile-minded, problem-solving workers. Nor, he added, are schools preparing American workers to be leaders in the economy of tomorrow.
Mr. Peterkin said these problems are far more severe in urban public schools, not only because of violence, poverty and broken families but also because the money spent on each pupil is generally far lower than in wealthier suburbs.

BYLINE: By Nancy Kassebaum; Nancy Landon Kassebaum, Republican, is Senator from Kansas.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The cliche of the 1992 election is that this campaign is about "the future" and will be won by the candidate who is "for change." The driving force is not the desire for change but the fear of it. The old world order is gone. The restructuring of our economy threatens even the most secure worker. Government appears gridlocked by indecision, and voters wonder whom to hold accountable.
While some seek to make this an indictment of George Bush, the problem is a crisis of confidence in our entire political system. Thus, the popularity of "outsider" Ross Perot. Whatever his personal attributes, he, and his style of buccaneer politics, is not the cure for what ails America. 
 But competition is healthy. Mixing it up may add some needed vitality. The President should reach out and fight for all Perot supporters anxious about jobs, health care, crime and the general breakdown of everything that has given them a sense of security, stability and purpose.
George Bush is widely viewed, even among nonsupporters, as a decent, sincere man of integrity. This is not a bad place to start a campaign. But there must be more.
I would suggest that when he goes to Camp David next weekend with Barbara and Millie he take no advisers, briefing books or poll results. He shouldn't take any calls. Instead, he should think in peace and quiet about his three most important objectives for the next four years, and then state plainly how he will accomplish them.

HEADLINE: Warnings About More Than Ecology

 BODY:
Re "Builders Rally to Free Up Pine Barrens Development" [May 17], the Nobel Prize-winning author Octavio Paz asked not long ago whether our economic system would be changed by human wisdom or destroyed by its own excesses and contradictions. In the latter case, he worried that it could drag our democratic institutions with it.
The proposal by Long Island developers and their allies to "modify" laws protecting the pine barrens because it interfered with business interests mirrors the efforts by the Bush Administration to weaken national environmental legislation for the same reasons. One gets the impression that economic interests establish the rules of the political game to favor themselves, and when citizens manage to achieve some degree of success such as the Long Island Pine Barrens Society, those with economic power simply go outside the rules or change them. 
 If that analysis is correct, then our political structures have become welded to the interests of business itself and our democratic values in more trouble than we realize. Environmentalists may be inadvertently sounding the alarm for more than ecology.

HEADLINE: In China, Capitalism and Friendship for West Grow Side by Side

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I was stunned by "Roots of Hostility" (letter, May 19), in which Ted Pritikin argues that the next generation of Chinese will be more imbued with nationalism and therefore more hostile to Western capitalist countries, particularly the United States. Even more outrageous, he tries to lend credence to this assertion by referring to his two years in China. 
 I'm not sure if there is a root of hostility in China to the United States. Even if there is one, it is largely caused by the cold war environment in the aftermath of the Korean War, which forced Mao Zedong to woo Stalin, whom Mao never liked, and Chinese Communist Party attempts to create outside enemies to maintain political control.
I am surprised Mr. Pritikin did not observe how little effect Communist Party propaganda had on the Chinese. The Chinese are still the same Chinese, even after years of being told that capitalist countries are trying to exploit China or contaminate China's moral standard. I am even more surprised that Mr. Pritikin did not experience hospitality during his stay in China. The Chinese are very friendly to foreigners. Oftentimes indeed they treat foreigners better than they treat their own people.
The Chinese are born capitalists. We all know what a successful capitalist wants: freedom, rather than oppression; internationalism, rather than protectionism. The success of China's economic reform and the unbalanced growth between China's state and nonstate sectors reflect nothing but the spirit of capitalism unleashed.
As the new generation of Chinese more bravely embrace a capitalist market system, political liberalization will be an inevitable consequence of economic reform. So one can hardly imagine that the new generation of Chinese who are yearning for a social system with economic and political freedom -- the two essential characteristics of democratic capitalism -- will be the enemy of the United States.

HEADLINE: Down The Middle;
Perot's Appeal to the Mainstream Keeps Two-Party Politics Off Stride

BYLINE: By HOWELL RAINES

 BODY:
All week, the candidacy of Ross Perot was like a tidal wave roaring across the big island called Two-Party-Politics-as-Usual. For the moment, the Republicans, the Democrats and their newly minted nominees are following a strategy dictated by the situation. That is, they are lashing themselves to the palm trees and hoping that something can be salvaged from the backwash.
What is driving the Perot wave? For weeks, President Bush and his advisers have believed it was pushed by a freshet of discontent that would blow itself out once the economic barometer rose a bit. Bill Clinton and the Democrats have been hoping that this was another of those hot blasts from Dixie that would raise a lot of dust but do little real damage, as was the case with Huey P. Long, Strom Thurmond and George C. Wallace. 
 But many strategists and political scientists believe that the Perot storm surge is being pushed by a big typhoon that could keep ripping until November. And worse luck for the two established political parties, its energy source may not be the standard, anti-politician apathy that consultants in both parties know how to manipulate on election eve with feel-good commercials or racial scare tactics. "This is not apathy. This is antipathy," said Theodore J. Lowi, a political science professor at Cornell University who is president of the American Political Science Association. "We've had antipathy before, but what makes this close to being unprecedented is the positive side of it," he added, referring to a poll conducted last week for USA Today. "Very few polls have given respondents an opportunity to talk about a third party," Mr. Lowi said, adding that 55 to 60 percent like the idea. "What's unusual is that the spread is large, but it's also in the middle. I refer to it as the radicalization of the middle."
A protest candidacy arising from a radicalized center rather than from some fragment of regional, economic or racial discontent would represent a unique threat to what Mr. Bush calls "the fantastic historical stability" provided by -- and depended upon by -- the Republicans and the Democrats.
So far, the Perot phenomenon seems to have one central feature in common with the 100 third-party efforts that have arisen since 1840. "Third party voting occurs when citizens feel the major parties have failed to live up to their implicit contractual obligations," according to "Third Parties in America," by Steven J. Rosenstone, Roy L. Behr and Edward H. Lazarus (Princeton University Press, 1984). The authors conclude that "only the most egregious violations" of this implied contract can cause Americans to turn against their two traditional parties.
Belatedly, Bush and Clinton strategists seem to be realizing that this is what makes Mr. Perot such a danger to the major party candidates. He is trying to corral them both in "egregious violation" territory, and for weeks, both candidates and their parties have been clip-clopping blindly along while the pesky Mr. Perot cracked his whip over their heads.
Indeed, both the Clinton and Bush camps last week emanated a deep sense of puzzlement that none of the old tricks seems to work. It is the uniquely devilish gift of the little man from Texas that he can make Mr. Clinton and Mr. Bush look like vacuous hacks every time they reach for the Standard Manual of Political Response.
As a case in point, take Mr. Bush's floundering performance on television Thursday night when he tried the time-honored trick of tickling the polls with a nationally televised news conference. For several days, his surrogates, Vice President Dan Quayle and White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, had been test-marketing various attack lines. But the emotional high point of the conference was Mr. Bush's announcement that he was going to keep hiding behind his seconds. "I'm glad they're putting their focus on these problems," he said when asked about their criticism of Mr. Perot's lack of experience and authoritarian streak. "But I'm not going to do it myself."
Not-going-to-do-it pretty well sums up Mr. Clinton's fumbling response to his best recent opportunity to assert himself as a major force in this three-cornered contest. That chance, of course, was the Los Angeles riots. The White House has only a skeletal urban policy. Mr. Perot's plan to jump on a plane and fly toward smoking cities was earnest but hardly impressive as an intellectual response to urban blight.
With a passionate speech and a detailed urban plan, Mr. Clinton might have dominated the campaign debate, proven his superiority to Mr. Perot as an architect of detailed responses and underscored the brain-dead state of the Administration policy apparatus. But as late as Thursday night, Mr. Clinton was in Mr. Perot's favorite venue -- "Larry King Live," a call-in show -- gamely and lamely pledging to oppose lawlessness in riot areas.
Mr. Clinton got one thing he needed to soothe his worried party, and that was a victory over California's native son, Jerry Brown, in the primary there last week. Once again, Mr. Bush beat Patrick J. Buchanan. But the exit polls showed that Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton would have been hard put to defeat Mr. Perot had he been on their primary ballots.
 
'Sic 'Em'
 From both the White House and the Clinton research bunker in Little Rock come assurances that the best minds in both camps are pondering the Perot problem. But the depth of their bewilderment is demonstrated by both teams, which share a hearty dislike of journalists, counting on them to knock the top off the Perot appeal. "I can understand that appeal: 'I'm from outside. I'll solve all the problems'," Mr. Bush said at his news conference before adding hopefully: "And then some day you guys are going to start: 'How are you going to do it?' "
This was the President saying "sic 'em" to the press. His statement reflects the bipartisan faith that sustains both camps right now: that this heretic candidacy will crumble once Mr. Perot is forced to reveal his personality more fully and to "get specific." But Jimmy Carter in 1976 and Ronald Reagan in 1980 were hounded to get specific, and each won in large measure because he spoke in generalities that embodied the spirit of the moment. Jody Powell, the Carter aide who was a central player in 1976 and 1980, said that in both those contests there was still an undergirding sense that the political system worked. "Boy, you don't get that now," he said. "There's a sense out there that we've got all these things wrong and we're not doing anything about it, that both Bush and Clinton are so entangled with their parties' interests that they're not going to be able to do anything."
Mr. Rosenstone, the historian of third parties, said protest candidates usually weaken when the major parties "dig in" with their critical attacks. But he added quickly, "The caveat on all of this is money." No recent third-party candidate has matched the two parties' spending nor reached as deeply into their ranks as Mr. Perot did in hiring Hamilton Jordan, a former Carter aide, and Ed Rollins, a former Republican Party official, to run his campaign. No third-party candidate has ever been able to match the two parties' spending as Mr. Perot says he will.
The Democratic convention July 13 and the Republican convention Aug. 17 will provide the two major parties with their best chances to refute their images as joint stockholders in a national gridlock. If Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton do not do more with the opportunities of summer than they did with those of the spring, it may be time for them to look toward the tidal wave and start humming the old Johnny Cash number, "How High's the Water, Momma?"

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Japan's Slowed Economy Offers A New Chance for Wishful Thinking

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
With the Tokyo stock market at half its 1990 value, Japan's once-invincible banks reeling from billions of dollars in bad loans, and signs that the American economy is slowly rebounding, the new common wisdom in the United States seems to be that maybe the Japanese are not so tough, after all.
"Americans who want to see America outperform Japan ought now to be humming the 'Hallelujah' Chorus -- not in glee at Japan's difficulties, but in confidence that America need not fear Japan," wrote Karen Elliott House on the opinion page of The Wall Street Journal, in one of many such recent articles that struck similar themes. The Japanese, she concluded, "were never the economic terminators of America's imaginings." 
 Maybe not, but much of what is being written these days seems more rooted in wishful thinking than economic reality. Though Japan's financial world is reeling, very little seems to have changed in Tokyo's factories and laboratories.
Time and again in recent years, predictions have abounded that the Japanese economy was about to be brought to its knees. And every one has proven wrong. The "oil shock" in 1973 was supposed to hit Japanese manufacturers especially hard; instead Japan became one of the most energy-efficient industrialized nations on earth. The Plaza Accord in 1985, an agreement by the major industrial nations to increase the value of the yen to make Japanese exports less competitive on world markets, was supposed to end Japan's giant trade surpluses. It led to a revolution in Japanese manufacturing strategy, and the world's trade gap with Japan is now higher than ever. What reason is there to believe that the current Japanese financial crisis -- severe as it is -- will accomplish what the Arabs and trade negotiators could not?
"Americans always tend to overestimate Japan, and then underestimate Japan," said Naohiro Amaya, a former vice minister of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry and an architect of the country's industrial policy. Indeed, American perceptions of Japan have vacillated wildly in the 125 years since Admiral Perry sailed into Tokyo Bay. Japan seemed quaint until it defeated the Russian fleet in 1904. Thirty years later, many American Japan experts averted their eyes when evidence indicated that militarism was driving the country. In the 1970's, Detroit ignored equally clear signals of the rising power of Japanese industry.
Richard Samuels, a political scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies Japan's industrial policy, says that such shifts tend to say more about Americans than about the Japanese: "We change our perceptions of competitors and institutions on a dime." Such shifts make it even harder for the United States to fashion a consistent strategic plan for competing with Japan in the long term, no matter who is in office. The subtle message that's been conveyed to American manufacturers in recent months is just the opposite: The Japanese are in trouble, so you can afford to roll over and catch that extra hour of sleep.
No one is suggesting that Japan isn't facing serious problems. The fallout from the financial crises will slow the Japanese down for years to come. They will be lucky if their economy grows by 2.5 percent this year, which is down from the heady 6 or 8 percent growth of the late 1980's. The days of cheap, easy credit, which fueled Japan's investment boom in the 1980's, are over. Japanese companies are already announcing cutbacks in research and development and capital spending -- though they are generally relatively minor declines from stratospheric levels.
 
Squeezing Profits
 The number of bankruptcies is suddenly surging, mostly among smaller companies that live at the bottom of the food chain of Japan's industrial structure. Their profits are being squeezed by the giant corporations they supply, the downside of the feudal "keiretsu" -- families of interlinked companies -- that are supposedly one of Japan's secret weapons. Japan's once-feared Fifth Generation project in advanced computing ended a 10-year run last week with few useful results, and many wonder whether the country's industrial planners are losing their touch. They may prove to be better at catching up than at leading the way.
Few Japanese would trade their economic problems for America's, and anyone who lives here need only walk through the streets to see why. Unemployment rates still linger at about 2 percent, though that figure does not include part-time workers, particularly women who have been laid off recently from the jobs they took in the boom times. Mercedes sales are down, and so is lavish entertainment at restaurants in the Ginza, home of the $1,000 business dinner. Land prices have fallen 20 to 30 percent, though they are still among the world's highest. But neither does this add up to a portrait of urban decay: Public works projects abound, and cities like Tokyo spend enormous sums building trains and replacing bridges that by New York standards are brand new.
A decline in wealth should not be mistaken for a decline in industrial competitiveness. "There is still a well-educated, highly skilled, massively deployed, overemployed workforce," said Mr. Samuels. "It is sort of hard to understand why we don't see it as the economic challenge we once did." Squeezed profits have made Japanese firms look at reducing the fat that built up in headier days.
More important, every downturn in recent Japanese history has been turned to some advantage by Japan, with top executives using the arrival of a "crisis" as a goad to achieve some goal they have long sought. This moment in time seems no exception.
 
Raising Prices
 Companies from Matsushita to Toyota are reducing the number of products they make by upward of 20 percent. The car makers are all raising their prices, betting that Detroit -- as it did in the 1980's -- will be unable to resist the temptation to follow suit rather than use the opportunity to retake market share. Akio Morita, the founder of Sony Corporation, has been calling on Japanese companies to abandon what he described as their mindless pursuit of market share over profits. The result, as he admitted to journalists recently, will probably be higher prices.
"The economy will not only be cleaned, and go through another cycle of cost reduction, but it will probably emerge more concentrated as the fat of the 1980's is being melted off," said Kenneth L. Courtis, the chief economist for Deutsche Bank in Tokyo. "In the end it will come out tougher, harder, with a base of more powerful, big companies." By that time, the American perception will most likely have shifted again.
The question is whether the United States will have used Tokyo's era of troubles to good advantage, or wasted another chance to regain ground it has lost.

When Social Services Have a Bottom Line

BYLINE: By KAREN DeWITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Corporate America has increasingly found itself in recent years plugging some holes in the nation's social welfare system. As various levels of government have scaled back or declined to increase their roles in meeting both old and emerging social needs, corporations have stepped forward into areas they didn't anticipate entering even a decade ago. And as they supply services ranging from prenatal care to job training, the lines between the traditional roles of business and government sometimes blur, raising questions of accountability and responsiveness.
Employers like A.T.& T., I.B.M., Kraft, Corning, Texas Instruments, Primerica, Johnson & Johnson, Honeywell and Stride Rite have steadily moved into providing social services, primarily for employees but also, on occasion, the wider community. For example, the Prudential Insurance Company finances a program to pay doctors and nurses for the Head Start program at community health clinics in Newark and Patterson, N.J., and Cessna Aircraft built a training factory in a depressed area of Wichita, Kan. 
 While corporate involvement in such programs is clearly growing, there are no accurate figures on how much money businesses are spending or how many people are affected. "No one catalogs it and there is no standard definition of what social service is across companies," said Sandra Hamburg, director of education programs for the Committee for Economic Development, a 50-year-old nonprofit organization of 250 business leaders and university presidents. Tracking only education programs from kindergarten through high school, the Council for Aid to Education, a New York-based non-profit organization, reported that companies spent $400 million in 1989, the latest figure available.
Though some American businesses have long had socially conscious policies -- providing employees' children with scholarships, for example -- a rising realization in recent years of the importance of education to the availability of a qualified work force has caused many companies to expand their traditional roles. One influential factor was "A Nation at Risk," the Federal government's 1983 report on the state of the U.S. education system.
"Certainly the education movement has been mostly responsible for getting corporations to understand the connections between early childhood learning and health,"Ms. Hamburg said.
The Prudential is a good example of corporate involvement. In 1991, the company spent $41 million on social welfare programs. It distributes money in three ways. Its foundation emphasizes children and early childhood projects such as the health care facilities for Head Start. A social investment program provides loans and investments of up to $1 million for economic revitalization, helping, for example, to build a Pathmark supermarket for downtown Newark, the first major supermarket there since the 1967 riots. The Prudential also has a program through which employees and executives provide leadership and expertise to groups like the New Jersey Food Bank.
"Business is providing these services because they want a productive work force," said Dr. Mary Jane England, president of the Washington Business Group, a coalition of businesses interested in keeping health insurance rates down. "It's not entirely altruistic."
Corporate largess to social welfare programs also raises unanswered questions about equity and access. Will corporate benevolence exacerbate a decline in public services by draining away the most skilled professionals? What if a company pays doctors and nurses more to work in its program than the public coffers can provide? Does giving stipends and enhancing one or two local child care facilities skew the market for workers whose companies either can't afford or don't offer similar benefits? And will the more sophisticated, highly paid professionals either negotiate for or work for companies willing to provide them with social services while needier, unskilled workers at less benevolent companies go wanting?
Ellen Galinsky, a co-founder of the Families and Work Institute, a non-profit New York-based organization, encourages companies to consider their impact. Otherwise, she said, "There is the danger of creating a larger wedge between the haves and the have-nots.'
Making it possible for have-nots to become haves is the goal at Cessna Aircraft. Russell W. Meyer, chairman and chief executive officer, said 85 percent of the people who have been accepted at their two-year old training factory have gone on to jobs at the main Cessna plant.
 
Teaching the Basics
 "We didn't realize at first how many problems these people have," Mr. Meyer said, citing drug addiction, lack of support and sometimes jealousy from relatives and acquaintances who were not in the program.
"We always assume that everybody is as independent as we are," Mr. Meyer said. "We discovered that a lot of people needed a kind of buddy support system because they were a little bit intimidated when they graduated to the big plant." Trainees, who get paid from their first day in the program, had to be shown, for example, how to open a checking account and manage their money from paycheck to paycheck.
Cessna's success has convinced Mr. Meyer that businesses should become more involved in job training programs. "I think this is absolutely not a job for government," he said. "I think business has to do it. We have to have a basic welfare system as a safety net, but in order to take the next step, it's a business and community resonsibility to train and meaningfully employ people."

After a Fresh Look, U.S. Decides to Still Steer Clear of Iran

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In the course of three and a half years, Bush Administration officials have made it a habit, when asked about the state of relations between the United States and Iran, to respond in the same kind of shorthand President Bush used in his inaugural address in January, 1989. "Good will begets good will," said the President, who in 1990 seemed so open to improving ties to Teheran that he took what he thought was a phone call from Iran's President, Hashemi Rafsanjani, only to discover well into the conversation that he was talking to an impostor.
So it seemed natural that Washington might reward Teheran after it stayed neutral in the Persian Gulf war in early 1991 and used its influence -- and its money -- to persuade Iranian-backed groups in Lebanon to free the last American hostage last December. Indeed, earlier this year, Richard N. Haass, the chief White House aide on the Middle East, launched the first formal review of American policy toward Iran since the first months of the Bush Administration. He floated the idea that the Administration consider a strategy of "constructive engagement" by lifting some economic sanctions, according to participants in the review process. 
 The review was motivated less by benevolence than by conditions that were changing the geopolitical balance: the weakening of Iraq, instability in the formerly Soviet republics of Central Asia, nervousness in the Gulf Arab states and, in Iran, the combination of political consolidation, economic reconstruction and a military buildup. "People recognized that Iran is in a position -- and over time will increasingly be in a position -- to affect U.S. interests in this part of the world," said one official who sought to explain the reasons for the review.
But when the review was completed in April, the policy team concluded that this was not the moment for good will.
Iran, after all, had been the foreign policy Bermuda Triangle for both Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, and there was no compelling reason why George Bush should sail into those dangerous waters so close to the election. The review concluded that any gesture that might be politically meaningful in Teheran -- lifting the ban on oil sales to America, for example -- would have been politically impossible at home. On the other hand, a reward small enough to be painless in American political terms, such as lifting the ban on exports of carpets and pistachios, would have seemed too paltry to Teheran.
A second factor was that Iran suffers from the Saddam syndrome. Constructive engagement clearly failed in Iraq in the months before Saddam Hussein's forces invaded Kuwait, and the Administration was not eager to open itself to accusations that it was repeating a flawed policy strategy by making conciliatory gestures toward Teheran.
A third element is Washington's elevation of weapons proliferation to the status of a major security threat, where it used to end up at the bottom of the foreign policy agenda along with drugs and human rights. The fear that Iran will follow the lead of Iraq and try to develop nuclear weapons has figured prominently in the discussions on this issue. No matter that the late Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi also harbored a secret desire to turn his country into a nuclear power, in the days when Iran was on the side of the United States. The policy review's conclusion was, in the words of one Administration official, that "we missed once in Iraq and we won't do it twice."
Finally, Iran is its own worst enemy when it comes to breaking the impasse in relations with the United States. While Iranian officials, such as Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, have expressed disappointment that their intervention in winning the release of American hostages was not rewarded, Washington can tick off numerous examples of Iran's unacceptable behavior. Despite his courting of the West, for example, Mr. Rafsanjani urged Palestinians in May 1989 to "kill and execute -- and not just inside Palestine -- five Americans, or Britons or French" for every martyr of their own. His attacks on the American-sponsored peace process that is fitfully under way between Israel and the Arabs, and his sponsorship of an alternate conference in Iran last year -- at which some of the most distasteful Middle Eastern terrorists were guests -- were most unwelcome in Washington.
Administration officials cite Iran's continued involvement in terrorism, its poor human rights record, and its support for Islamic fundamentalist movements in Algeria and the Sudan as continued obstacles to improving relations. Most serious, they say, is Iran's transfer of substantial amounts of new aid to Shiite Muslim groups in Lebanon since the release of the American hostages. In the last two weeks, some officials believe, Iran through its surrogates in Lebanon has tried to engineer a war between Syria and Israel to sabotage the Middle East peace talks.
 
Bewilderment
 The Administration's policy decision essentially leaves it to the next Administration to decide whether to constructively engage with Iran. Small wonder: Even those analysts who defend the use of incentives to moderate behavior are bewildered about how to treat Iran. Morton I. Abramowitz, president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, argues that Iran under President Rafsanjani may well be far more susceptible to change than Iraq has been under Mr. Hussein. "Still," Mr. Abramowitz said, "I am not necessarily advocating change."
What confuses the picture is that there is no answer to a fundamental question about Mr. Rafsanjani's moves to curb radical elements in his regime and expand ties with Western industrialized countries. Do his actions represent a strategic shift in the course of Iran's 13-year revolution, or are they only a tactical maneuver that could be reversed once Iran succeeds in reconstructing its economy? Mr. Rafsanjani himself may not know the answer to the question, proving that making policy even with the best of intentions is anything but foolproof.

HEADLINE: Conversations/Two Families in Tajikistan;
An Empire's Retreat Strands Exiles In a Place They Had Called Home

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: DUSHANBE, Tajikistan

 BODY:
Valery B. Akhadov, a film maker who is half-Tajik but speaks only Russian, is charming, impish, cosmopolitan and increasingly at sea in the country of Tajikistan, a fragment of the broken Soviet Union that is defining itself by its Persian and Islamic roots. He tells a lot of silly and extremely funny jokes over a long and lavish dinner, and then, suddenly, one full of poignancy. A Georgian walking on a beach hears someone out at sea, crying for help, but in Russian. He walks on as the cries continue, and then finally turns and yells out toward the water: "Better than learning Russian you should have learned how to swim!"
Mr. Akhadov's wife, Zulfiya Mirshakar, an ethnic Pamir and professor of Russian, has no doubt heard this joke before, but still averts her face. 
 Are you crying for help, a visitor asks Mr. Akhadov. "Not yet," he says, laughing through his thick mustache. "But soon, and it will be in Russian."
In another home, Vladimir V. Chekan and his wife, Tamara, who have built their lives here for the last 31 years and have no Tajik blood, are crying for help now. They've sent their daughter, Natasha, a pianist, to stay with friends in Moscow, but they have no apartment or residence permission there. Their son, Andrei, 16 years old, is in America on an exchange program, and they think about how they can go to join him.
Their lives and nationalities are a wrenching example of the mess the death of the Soviet Union has left behind. Most empires, when they retreat, go back across an ocean. Russia can hardly absorb all its colonists, and some of them aren't even officially Russian. National distinctions that once meant nothing now mean everything, or seem to, particularly as newly independent nations, like Tajikistan, try to create a sense of nationhood out of a long-held sense of nationality suppressed by Soviet power.
Mr. Chekan, who moved here from Georgia, is half-Russian and half-Ukrainian but his nationality, on his passport, is Ukrainian, since that is what his father was. But he speaks only Russian and Georgian. His wife is half-Russian and half-Armenian, but her nationality is Armenian, even though she speaks only Russian and was born and has lived her whole life in Dushanbe. Their children, with a Ukrainian father, are Ukrainian. "Even when I go to Russia," says Mrs. Chekan, crying, "I feel like a white crow."
 
'Where Will We Go?'
 "In one family, we have four nations," said Mr. Chekan, clenching his fists. "I think there will be more blood here, I tell you. But now where will we go? I tell you frankly, for me, the end of the union is a catastrophe."
Its deep blue sky etched by the icy peaks of mountains that stretch toward Afghanistan, Tajikistan is among the most beautiful, and poorest, remnants of the old Russian empire. Even before the Soviet deformation, Russians regarded their sway over Central Asia as in large part a civilizing mission; later, a great deal of money and sweat went to turn what was a feudal, imperial backwater into a model of Soviet socialism -- modern, collective, denationalized, atheistic.
Unsurprisingly, the collapse of Communism and the empire itself has revealed the absurdity of this attempted transformation of poor, Muslim nationalists into a new, Russian-speaking Homo Sovieticus.
But as the Russian tide recedes, there are 25 million ethnic Russians stranded outside Russia proper, uncertain about their national loyalties and the future of themselves and their families. Like Vladimir and Tamara Chekan. "We feel more and more unwelcome here, and as Russians, we have no future in the new Tajikistan, which will without doubt become more narrow and more Islamic," he says. "But we have nowhere to go."
Also stranded are a kind of half-species, a Russified national elite who bought into the imperial culture, and who have their own deep anxieties about a future increasingly Tajik and Islamic. Like Valery Akhadov, whose father was Tajik and whose mother was a German Jew, the daughter of revolutionaries who came to build Communism and then got sent to Stalin's gulag for their pains. "By tongue I'm Russian," he said. "My education is pan-European. But in the end, I consider myself Tajik. But what matters is if the Tajiks consider me to be one of them." And do they? He laughed. "Many don't."
But there is also a sense of being subsumed in a smaller and alien culture, and there is a strong desire that their three daughters inhabit the larger world of Russian language, literature and relative sexual equality. "If Islam comes here, I'll never cover my head," said Mrs. Mirshakar. "I'll leave."
Mr. Akhadov cradled the head of his youngest daughter, 10-year-old Negina. Takhmina, 23, and Jamila, 19, came quietly into the room. "I can't imagine a future anywhere but here," Takhmina said. "In Moscow you are not theirs and here you aren't theirs. I feel a foreigner among foreigners."
"Where did Soviet power bring us?" Jamila asked. "Was it necessary to go through 70 years of all this pain and then find yourself back at the beginning? In school they taught us that there is only progress, and no regression. But here we are back at the beginning of the beginning."
 
The Family Tomb
 At the Chekans, Tamara, now a schoolteacher, considered how it felt to go from being a citizen of a superpower to being a citizen of impoverished Tajikistan. "I'm lonely," she said. "Some of our best friends have moved away, some to Germany. And Moscow? But here is my family tomb, with my father and my young daughter, who died at 8. I was born 49 years ago, and here I've lived all my life.
"As for the union," she said, working her hands into a tight ball, "I worked as an economist for 20 years, under Brezhnev and Gorbachev, and I've seen it all, and I believed in all this" -- gesturing to the city beyond. "And it's a tragedy when a person loses all his beliefs."
Mr. Chekan, a city engineer, helped build Dushanbe: roads, bridges, housing. And he loves to fish for trout in Tajikistan. "I love this nature and this life here. And if it comes to leave, I think I must leave the old union altogether. I think of going to Andrei, my son, in America, and then I think of all the problems, and finding a sponsor and everything. Really, I just don't know."
Here Tamara stood behind him and touched his shoulders. "Do you understand? Do you understand? Two years ago we thought of getting a container to move all these things away, in which we've invested our lives. I hate it. What we need is to feel calmer inside, and not feel all these tensions. This is not a cry from the heart. It's a shout -- a cry of the heart."
They talked of America and their son, to an American who might be able to help; but they found it hard to ask, as he would find it hard to answer. To telephone Andrei, they book a call two days ahead, for three minutes at 54 rubles (about 54 cents) a minute. Why not reserve more time, asks the American, unthinking, and she laughs bitterly: "Ten minutes is half my monthly salary."
Four days later, in Moscow, Vladimir was on the phone. How could they get to America? Who would sponsor them? The American, unsurprised by the call, which he had dreaded, had no answer, as he knew he would not.

HEADLINE: Good News, Then Bad News, but Good Spin

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
A wave of upbeat numbers early last week depicting a broad, if hardly booming, recovery ended on a decidedly downbeat note with Friday's report that unemployment had risen in May. Early in the week, the Dow Jones industrial average broke 3,400 for the first time, corporate purchasing reached a level not seen since 1988, consumer spending rose and the Federal Reserve Board's chairman said inflation was not likely to threaten the economy in the next couple of years. But on Friday, the Labor Department said the unemployment rate had jumped to 7.5 percent, its highest in almost eight years.
While the jobless report was widely taken as rotten news -- both for the economy and, at the White House, for George Bush's re-election prospects -- it actually contained more than a little evidence that the modest recovery remains alive and well. 
 To wit: a surge in the number of people who were actively looking for jobs -- a precondition for being counted as unemployed -- accounted for most of the rise in the jobless rate.
"People are a good deal more positive about current and future job prospects than they were three or four months ago," said Fabian Linden, who conducts monthly consumer confidence polls.
More important, business is hiring again. About 250,000 jobs sprouted in the last two months, the Labor Department said. More than half of the businesses surveyed said their payrolls had grown over the last month.
To keep up with rising sales, companies are also making those who have jobs work more overtime. The factory work week is the longest it's been since 1966 and the demand for temporary help is up sharply.
Business executives, more confident than a year ago that the recovery will last, plan to do more hiring, according to several polls. "We will increase employment this year," said F. Kenneth Iverson, chief executive of Nucor, the Charlotte, N.C., steelmaker. But even if business merely keeps up its modest pace, there will be at least one million new jobs by year's end.
New jobs and more overtime, economists say, are lifting consumers' incomes just enough to keep the slow recovery from relapsing.
What's not in the cards, though, is a repeat of the Reagan recovery of 1983, which drove the unemployment rate -- which reached 10.8 percent in the 1982 recession -- down 2 full percentage points in the first 12 months. Even optimists in the forecasting fraternity say that President Bush will be lucky if the unemployment rate dips below 7 percent by Election Day.
Most economists expect new jobs to be created at just half the rate of the Reagan boom. The service sector -- source of 21 million new jobs back then -- is now struggling to streamline. Some big manufacturers -- makers of computers, cars, military hardware -- are shrinking. And the glut in commercial real estate all but guarantees that there won't be as many construction jobs as there were in the 1980's for a long time.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Environmental Policy: It's a Jungle in There

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Is President Bush a brave and lonely voice of reason against a tide of environmental protection that could be disastrous to the economy?
Or is he managing environmental policy to gain support from conservative interests who use warnings of economic harm and loss of liberty to weaken environmental regulation? Those questions were at the center of a week of conflict over environmental policy that engulfed the White House and then tumbled out before the world in the opening days of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Brazil. 
 The strain opened to public view the Administration's deep internal divisions over ecological safeguards and raised questions about the United States role in a world in which national security may be as affected by global environmental threats as by military ones.
It began on Wednesday when the chief of the United States delegation in Rio, William K. Reilly, came under international attack for the Administration's refusal to sign a treaty to protect wild plants and animals.
This biodiversity treaty is a centerpiece of the summit. Mr. Reilly, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency and a professional environmentalist, supported it. But before he arrived in Rio, the State Department announced that the President would not sign it because American biotechnology companies might be hurt by its requirement that they share profits and technologies with any countries whose biological resources they used.
The White House felt comfortable with that decision until Germany, England, Canada, India and Japan announced they would join virtually every other nation in approving the plan.
Suddenly, the American delegation and its chief were defending themselves against accusations that the United States had replaced the Soviet Union as an international outlaw. Late on Wednesday, Mr. Reilly made a last-minute appeal that the White House consider changes in the treaty that might go far enough to allow the President to sign it.
But in the White House and elsewhere in the Government, Mr. Reilly's critics became so concerned that he might succeed that they leaked to The New York Times a copy of the confidential memorandum he sent to Clayton K. Yeutter, the President's domestic policy chief. The disclosure, meant to embarrass Mr. Reilly, rattled him and embarrassed the President, who later told reporters that the leak was "terribly offensive" and that Mr. Reilly had his "full support."
 
Confusion
The week's furor showed just how much confusion the Administration's environmental policy is in. On Monday, during a speech at the Goddard Space Flight Center outside Washington, Mr. Bush proposed spending $150 million annually to save world forests. Two days later, the chief of the United States Forest Service announced plans to largely end clear-cutting on 191 million acres of national forests. But only three weeks ago, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. proposed legislation approved by the President that would open four million acres of ancient forests in the Pacific Northwest to clear-cutting.
Many such contradictions have appeared in Mr. Bush's environmental policy. In 1990, he lobbied for and signed a powerful Clean Air Act. But this year, critics say, he allowed budget officials and Vice President Dan Quayle's Council on Competitiveness to weaken it. Two weeks ago, for example, he sided with the Vice President and directed Mr. Reilly to let companies exceed their permitted air pollution levels without public notice or comment.
Three years ago, Mr. Bush sought to separate himself from the angry anti-environmentalist policies of his predecessor, Ronald Reagan. He broke a 13-year stalemate in Congress to pass a new Clean Air Act and halted much offshore oil drilling.
White House officials say the President's philosophy of balancing ecological and economic goals hasn't changed but that the emphasis, driven by concern over the economy, has.
The Administration sees exploitable weaknesses in the national environmental movement and in Congress. Environmental groups have laid off employees in the recession and Democratic leaders, damaged by the House bank and post office scandals, are avoiding attacks on the President.
Encouraging the White House is a network of timber industry executives, coal miners, farmers and big landowners who have formed a coalition they call the "Wise Use" movement. The President's political advisers hope it will help protect the conservative Republican constituency in the West that the President needs to win any three-way race.
 
Quayle's Voice
 It is also clear that Mr. Quayle has become, for the moment, a distinctive and influential voice on domestic issues. Two weeks ago he grabbed headlines by attacking Murphy Brown. He has won a string of environmental victories over Mr. Reilly, including his proposal last summer to open 50 million acres of wetlands to development.
Mr. Quayle frames the debate as one that pits environmental extremists against hard-working Americans in danger of losing their jobs. In Thursday night's news conference, Mr. Bush took the same tack when asked about the biodiversity treaty. "I will not sign a treaty that in my view throws too many Americans out of work," he said. "I refuse to accept that kind of criticism from what I consider some of the extremes in the environmental movement, internationally and domestically."
Mr. Reilly and some other White House officials grimace at such statements. They believe the regulations create jobs. According to Environmental Economics, a research company in Philadelphia, strict rules have forced companies to cut waste and become more efficient, and have spurred the development of up to 70,000 environmental companies with $130 billion in sales. Roughly two million Americans earn a living doing some kind of environmental cleanup work.
Last week, conservationists expressed dismay at the country's isolation at the summit and the Administration's line. Thirty years ago this month, the modern environmental movement was born with serialized publication in The New Yorker of Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring," a devastating critique of the damage that pesticides were doing to wildlife.
"It's painful to a person like me," said Stewart L. Udall, the Secretary of the Interior under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson and author of the Wilderness Act of 1964. "We are the cradle of the environmental movement. We spawned this new way of looking at the world. And now we're the laggard."

HEADLINE: Dreams Deferred: A Class of '85, 7 Years Later/A special report.;
Certain Only of Uncertainty, Ex-Classmates Seek a Future

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SISTERSVILLE, W. Va.

 BODY:
The smokestacks along the Ohio River Valley still make the nighttime mists glow red, but they barely warm the economies of old river communities like Marietta, Ohio; Parkersburg, W. Va., and the once-prosperous town of Sistersville.
If these towering cylinders are already an icon of America's past, the young men and women of Sistersville are an emblem of its uncertain present. Seven years after graduation, two-thirds of the Sistersville High School Class of 1985 is still here, 25-year-old men and women depending on dead-end jobs or part-time work, or scrambling for one of the dwindling number of lucrative factory jobs.
 
Like Many Towns
 Some who have good jobs are upbeat about their futures. Others, though flush with annual incomes of $35,000 or $40,000, have little confidence that the good times will last or that they can find something better elsewhere. 
 Though perched at the northwest edge of the state whose name is synonymous with rural poverty, the largely Republican populace of Sistersville seems closer in income and outlook to residents of the industrial towns and farm market centers of the Midwest. Like many of these towns, it has a historical society and carefully preserved landmarks. And like many of these, it is watching its high school, its link between past and future, close.
The loss of this touchstone only underlines the uncertainty facing the young people of Sistersville, which had its origins in the decline of the country's heavy industries. But they are by no means unique. In some ways, having been a little bit poorer a little bit longer, their last seven years may offer other young people in this recession-ridden country a preview of their near-term future.
"A lot of the jobs I was trained for don't exist any more," said Michael Malone, who completed an M.B.A. program at West Virginia University in 1991 hoping to work in one of the industries near his hometown. Smiling ruefully, he scanned the patchwork vista of Sistersville, where turn-of-the-century brick coexists with 1950's aluminum siding. His new plan, he said, is to work as an insurance salesman and eventually start a business.
"I'm getting used to not having security," he said.
About one-third of the 29 women and 34 men in the 1985 class are seeking their futures elsewhere in places where the computer and health care industries are flourishing or in the shipyards of Virginia or on military bases from Hawaii to Georgia.
Some,like a warehouse manager in Florida and a computer programmer in North Carolina, have found the coveted security and opportunity. Others thought they had, only to find military spending cuts or recession threatening their plans. One just returned home from the shipbuilding yards of Newport News, Va., leaving before the cutbacks he expects.
"The rest of the nation is catching up with West Virginia," said Kelley Lucas Stewart, who lives in Sistersville and is planning to get a degree in education. "Things are starting to crumble around them." Although her husband, Richard, 26 years old, makes $45,000 at a PPG Industries plant, she says: "Security isn't there, no matter what you're doing, no matter where. If you make it today, that's great. But what about tomorrow?"
 
Few Are Surprised
 Few of the 20 classmates interviewed for this article have found a future they can trust. They are not surprised. Back in junior high school, when many of their fathers were laid off in an earlier round of industrial cuts, they became accustomed to the disappearance of jobs.
Right after graduation, about half of the 63 class members left to look for better things in the booming Sun Belt or the military. Of those, at least eight have come back frustrated. If they must shiver in a chilly economy, they say it is better to shiver among friends and family.
Their successes and failures have resonance far beyond their own small industrial enclave 75 miles southwest of Pittsburgh where men mix chemicals and bend metal between the dark brown river and the dark green hills.
"This is true up the Ohio River Valley and industrial areas up to southern Michigan," said Calvin Beale, a demographer with the United States Department of Agriculture. "This same thing is going on all through the farm belt."
 
Very Few Young Adults
 "A large number of the young people will not stick close to home," he added.
The 1990 census found that the population of West Virginia, like that of South Dakota, Maine and Wyoming ranked near the bottom in the proportion of residents between the ages of 18 and 24. In each of those states, young adults made up barely 10 percent of the population.
While many young people are leaving, not everyone from a small town like Sistersville, whose population dropped to 1,797 in 1990, is comfortable in larger places. "I had a job in Virginia, in Alexandria, as an apprentice to an electrician," said Kenneth Barker Jr. "The cost of living was too high, and I couldn't make it." After another move to Columbus, Ohio, he came home to a job at American Cyanamid's plant 25 miles to the south in Waverly.
"There were 5,000 applications," he said. "Twenty-three of us got hired."
Others found the fear of crime and the loneliness of bigger places pushed them home. But whether they stayed at home, left or came back, most of those interviewed said their options were very different from those available when their parents were young. A few said the options were better. Most said that although they were more comfortable than their parents had been, they had fewer options.
 
Staying
Waiting for Work Is the Watchword
 "I knew what to expect," said Daron Palmer. "I saw all my brothers and my friends going through it. But I wanted to be near my family. Better to live in a place you grew up in and like than a place where you don't know anybody."
In 1989, after four years in the Navy, Mr. Palmer came home to Sistersville. "I had unemployment for 26 weeks. I had some savings. Then I worked for a carpenter. Then I laid brick walks. If you wait around long enough, you have a chance at a halfway decent job."
In 1991, he got a job at the Ormet Corporation's plant in Hannibal, Ohio, a 25-minute drive from Sistersville. For $12.98 an hour, he regulates the temperature in huge vats of molten metal. A few months after he was hired, he was laid off for five months. Ormet took him back in April.
"Materially, I have pretty much everything I need," he said. "But it's hard to get a job around here and hard to keep it. People just take things day to day."
Mr. Palmer's old classmate Joseph Wilson is more upbeat. Star fullback on the 1984 state championship high school team, he enrolled in Ball State University in Indiana, but left to follow his high school coach to Glenville State College in West Virginia, where he majored in biology and education.
He graduated from Glenville a year ago and was hired as the football coach at the Parkersburg high school. He also teaches biology at a junior high school but expects that position to be eliminated in upcoming job cuts. But he isn't worried because he is securing a place as a permanent substitute.
"I don't feel insecurity," he said "You have to think ahead and pick what's going to be open for you."
 
Leaving
Seeking the Future Amid Uncertainty
 "For a long time, probably since high school, I knew I was going away," said John Orr. "It was just a question of where.
"It was really the guidance counselor at the time who got me thinking toward college. If I had been on my own, I wouldn't have considered going. I didn't come from a very wealthy family and wasn't aware of the financial aid and everything."
Mr. Orr was speaking from his seat in front of a computer at Computer Sciences Corporation at Research Triangle Park near Raleigh, N.C., where he began work late last year.
While in high school, he had applied to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but backed off, awed by the size and foreignness of the campus in Cambridge, Mass. With classmates David Worth, now an assistant supermarket manager, and Douglas Reed, now a Marine in South Korea, Mr. Orr enrolled at West Virginia University.
After a lackadaisical academic performance, he said, he transferred to Marietta College within a year. With breaks to earn tuition money, he finished college last summer.
"The whole time I was going to school I knew I was going to have to go somewhere else to get a job in the field I'm in," he said.
Sabrina Brothers didn't know where she would end up, but went to beauty college for a year after school to train for a portable career. After that year, she married John Hunter, who had been a year ahead of her in school.
Now living in Mountain Home, Idaho, Mrs. Hunter, like at least 10 of the other women in her class, has small children. Unlike most others, she also has a job, running a beauty parlor near her husband's Air Force base. She handled both the job and the two children alone last year, while her husband served in the Persian Gulf war.
But the military career they had envisioned did not seem so sure when he came back. "We thought we were going to stay in the military for 20 years," she said. "Right now, if he could find any kind of good job at home, with good medical benefits and good pay, we'd think of going back.
"I'm not really worried. We're both young enough to go somewhere and start over."
 
Returning
Uncertainty Seems Less So at Home
 Victoria Evans Barnhart is determined to bring up her two boys in Sistersville, where they can wander by any house and find someone they know. Fiercely attached to her hometown, Mrs. Barnhardt tried to live elsewhere, but could not.
"Someone came by after school and told the guy I was dating they were hiring in Georgia. So we went down there and he worked. They were doing outriggers for an oil company near Savannah. It was a nice little place. But the crime there! You couldn't go down to the laundromat and wash your clothes without being afraid.
"I've seen what other places are like. My roots are here.
"There's not a lot to keep people here," she admitted, as she spoke of the old days, when her grandparents came here. At the turn of the century, Sistersville was bristling with oil derricks and had more millionaires per capita than any other town in the country, said the high school principal, Charles Heinlein. The oil is a distant memory now. "We don't have a clothing store any more. If you want to buy a piece of underwear, you can't buy it in this town."
Mrs. Barnhart's husband, Brian, earns $35,000 a year as an operator at Monongahela Power. "It's a secure job," she said. "Everyone needs electricity."
Michelle Smith has no job, secure or otherwise. But she is happier here than in Norcross, Ga., where she worked as a file clerk in an insurance office.
"There's always something that you'll make more money at than you do here," Ms. Smith said. "I thought I wanted to get away from this little town to a big city." Her classmate Lisa Lovely, she said, "kept calling and writing me letters and saying, 'It's great down here.' "
She joined her friend, met a man, had a little girl and then broke up with the man and brought her daughter home. They live with her parents. She once thought of training to be an X-ray technician, but now is not sure. In any case, she wants to stay home until her 2-year-old daughter is in school.
"You can't look into the future and plan any more," she said. "Taking things day to day makes me mad."
Mr. Malone, whose M.B.A. had thus far done little for him, said: "Being mad is the tough part. It's a logical point of view to be angry, but you can't blame it on anyone. That's frustrating. The person you wind up looking at is the person in the mirror."
