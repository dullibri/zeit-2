HEADLINE: New York Can't Ask if It's Art Before Letting a Film Crew Shoot

 BODY:
To the Editor:
We understand the concern of Brent Staples in "New York, the Movie" (Editorial Notebook, June 15) that New York City might be wasting its precious resources on fool's errands and unprofitable ventures. But then Mr. Staples reminds us that "Hudson Hawk," the clunker whose shooting tied up Brooklyn several nights last summer, cost $51 million to make. 
 Part of that was disbursed in New York City, at $400,000 a day, for 16 days. Ten percent of those expenditures flowed directly into the city's tax coffers, and eventually some of it benefited every block in New York. The multiplier for feature films is 2.3, which means that for every dollar of that $6.4 million, $1.30 was spent in the community ($8.32 million).
That is not our only justification for permitting film crews to inconvenience our citizens briefly. This activity also provides jobs for a freelance production work force of 75,000 union members, which we want to see as close to full employment as possible.
Mr. Staples might find some satisfaction in the fact that New York got the better of the bargain on "Hudson Hawk." Metropolitan New York film consumption is usually the highest in the country: box office returns for the first three weeks in New York amounted to $1,039,444, a very favorable balance of payments.
In any case, the remedies Mr. Staples proposes cannot be acted upon. Under the First Amendment, a governmental body such as the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting cannot evaluate the contents of a film before determining to assist it or not. We have assisted many a low-budget project, like the well-received "Hangin' With the Homeboys," with as much vigor as a studio-backed film because our mandate is the city's economic development, not film promotion or criticism.
In any case, trying to evaluate in advance a show-business project's chances of success is as risky as picking the winning triple at Belmont. So the best bet is to help every production as if it were "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn."

HEADLINE: Changes Set At World Bank

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30

 BODY:
The World Bank says its 22- member board has agreed to organizational changes sought by the United States to try to make the international lending agency more aware of private- sector needs in the third world.
The growing emphasis on helping the private sector is viewed as a means to further the bank's goal of alleviating poverty and promoting economic development, and not as an end in itself, Barber B. Conable Jr., the World Bank's president, said on Friday. 
 The board of the bank's private-sector lending arm, which has the same 22 directors, also recommended on Friday that its capital be increased to $2.3 billion, from $1.3 billion. The United States would contribute $250 million of the increase over five years.
The capital increase is subject to the approval of the World Bank's member countries, but Mr. Conable said he did not anticipate any difficulty in obtaining that.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Banking Gloom Clouds Outlook

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Just as the recession is ending, doubts about the health of the financial system seem to have re-emerged in the credit markets, raising questions about the viability of a recovery.
Most bankers and economists contend that corporate balance sheets are in much better shape than they were a year or even six months ago. But problems remain, particularly at big commercial banks. Those difficulties are probably not serious enough to abort an upturn, they said, but they can act as a restraint on the recovery. 
Moreover, the bankers and economists say concern about the financial system is yet another reason for the Federal Reserve to be slow to respond to renewed economic growth by raising short-term interest rates.
 
Banking Worry and Rumors
 Adding to the worries: reports that second-quarter earnings at the Wells Fargo Bank would be sharply lower because of a big increase in nonperforming commercial loans, and big upward revisions in estimates of how much money will be needed to bail out the savings and loan industry and replenish the commercial bank insurance fund.
Rumors that problems at the Chase Manhattan Bank and Citicorp's Citibank were deepening, speculation that has not been heard in the financial markets for months, seem to be regaining currency, even though the rumors have been denied.
Such concerns will probably heighten during the next few weeks, as banks report second-quarter results. But banks are in much better shape to cope with problems than they have been in the past year.
 
Signs of Healing
 "Bank liquidity is a lot better now, and six months or a year ago many banks simply didn't realize the magnitude of the credit problems they were about to face," said Norman Robertson, chief economist at the Mellon National Bank in Pittsburgh. "Now they do, and that's healthy. But it takes time to work out of these difficulties."
S. Waite Rawls, vice chairman of the Continental Bank of Chicago said that "with the exception of real estate, things are beginning to heal."
"But we are not out of the woods yet," he added, "because a lot of the credit crunch was induced by real estate, and the real estate problems won't go away quickly."
 
Record Level of Debt Is Issued
 Over the last six months, as banks have chosen to build liquidity rather than book new loans, corporations have taken advantage of rising stock prices and lower interest rates to improve their own balance sheets.
To pay down short-term bank loans and commercial-paper obligations, as well as finance new projects, investment-grade corporations issued a record $92.4 billion worth of new debt during the first half of 1991, according to the Securities Data Corporation.
"It is surprising that bond issuance has happened to the extent that it has," Mr. Rawls said, "because the very positive yield curve, with short rates so much lower than long rates, provides a strong argument to wait. Fear of ratings downgrades on instruments like commercial paper may have caused a lot of people to seek longer maturities."
 
Equity Up, Too
 In addition, nearly $26 billion worth of new equity was raised in the first half, more than 35 percent above the total for all of 1990. Analysts at Securities Data said more than 22 percent of the money raised from the issuance of new stock was used to reduce outstanding debt.
"The huge volume of corporate debt and equity issuance is extremely constructive," said Neil M. Soss, chief economist at the First Boston Corporation. "Those are the sorts of things that help the economy recover."
The process is a long way from over, though.
Mr. Soss noted that between 1983 and 1990 nonfinancial corporations retired $640 billion in equity, replacing much of it with debt.
"Deleveraging will be with us for a very long time," he said.
 
June Job Data Due This Week
 Worries about the credit crunch may well persist, but employment data for June will be a more immediate concern for the credit markets during this holiday-shortened week.
To the annoyance of many who wished to stretch the Fourth of July holiday into a very long weekend, the Labor Department is expected to adhere to its policy of releasing the job report on the first Friday of the month.
As usual, estimates on the figures vary, but most economists seem to be expecting to hear that the surprising rise in payroll employment reported for May was reversed in June.
Brian Jones, an economist at Salomon Brothers, is forecasting that non-farm payroll employment fell by 50,000 in June, and that the unemployment rate rose to 7.1 percent, from 6.9 percent in May.
"If our relatively pessimistic payroll estimate proves accurate, it undoubtedly would call into question the strength of the nascent revival," Mr. Jones wrote in Salomon's weekly Comments on Credit.
"But," he added, "it would not change our view that the seeds of recovery are firmly planted."

HEADLINE: Domestic Stock Markets Retreated Slightly in the 2d Quarter

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
After a strong performance in the first quarter, the stock market caught its breath in the second.
"It was a boring quarter," said Laslzo Birinyi Jr., president of the Wall Street research firm Birinyi Associates. "Given what happened in the first quarter, some sort of setback was not unexpected." 
 In the quarter ended Friday, the stock market retreated slightly. Despite the excitement over the Dow Jones industrial average's closing above 3,000 for the first time (on April 17), the Dow closed down 7.11 points for the quarter, at 2,906.75.
 
Other Indexes Off Slightly, Too
 Other indexes also posted small declines, Mr. Birinyi said. The New York Stock Exchange composite index was down nine-tenths of 1 percent, while the American Stock Exchange composite index fell three-tenths of 1 percent. The over-the-counter index was off 1.3 percent.
Of the 3,999 stocks tracked by Media General Financial Services, 1,891 were up in the second quarter, 1,951 were down and 157 were unchanged.
On the New York Stock Exchange, Media General said 740 stocks finished higher, 776 were down and 45 were unchanged. On the American Exchange, 198 stocks rose, 275 were down and 17 were unchanged.
 
Edge for Over-the-Counter Stocks
 Advancing issues outnumbered those declining only in the over-the-counter market. Media General said 953 over-the-counter stocks rose, 900 declined and 95 were unchanged.
The relatively strong performance of the over-the-counter exchange was one noteworthy aspect of the second quarter, Mr. Birinyi said, given that the over-the-counter market did better than the other exchanges in the first quarter. "The fact that it did not consolidate or correct more was pretty significant," he said. "It would suggest that there really is a long-term positive outlook for the over-the-counter stocks."
Technology stocks took a beating during the most recent three months. "They did well in the first quarter and fell apart in the second," said Byron Wien, United States investment strategist for Morgan Stanley.
Hard-hit technology issues on the Big Board included Compaq Computer, down 50.3 percent, to $31.125; Commodore International, 36.7 percent, $11.625, Conner Peripherals, 35.5 percent, $16.125; Silicon Graphics, 28.8 percent, $28.375; Western Digital, 25.7 percent, $4, and Applied Magnetics, 24.8 percent, $9.50.
Another trend to emerge, Mr. Wien said, was the growing importance of cyclical stocks like paper, machinery and chemical stocks, compared with the consumer-goods stocks that have led the market for much of the last 10 years.
"It looks like there is the beginning of a leadership change taking place, from the consumer nondurable growth stocks to the more economically sensitive issues," Mr. Wien said. "It could create a dynamic shift in institutional portfolios. A change in leadership creates new heroes in the market."
 
Orion the Big Loser
 The top performer on the New York Exchange was the Best Buy Company, a consumer electronics retailer based in Minneapolis. Best Buy benefited when a financially troubled competitor, Highland Superstores, withdrew from several markets. Best Buy also gained market share as its new warehouse-style electronics stores attracted customers.
"People are getting a sense that they are long-term survivors in this business," said Richard Pyle, an analyst with Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood Inc. in Minneapolis.
On the Big Board, the Orion Pictures Corporation was the big loser, despite the success of "Dances With Wolves" and "The Silence of the Lambs." Orion stock collapsed after the studio posted a loss for the year and investors reacted negatively to a debt-restructuring plan that the company recently announced. The company said it planned to restructure about $285 million of debt, with the goal of eliminating about $400 million in interest payments by 1998.
Details in documents related to the restructuring caused some investors to worry about the small studio's aggressive accounting practices in estimating future revenues from its movies. Orion was also sued by investors who said it misled shareholders about its financial condition by overstating the value of its film library.
 
Hair and Beauty Products Winner
 American Medical Holdings Inc., based in Dallas, was the big gainer on the American Stock Exchange. The health-care company announced a plan that could save it more than $45 million in annual interest payments by selling stock to refinance a large portion of its high-interest debt.
A health-care company was also the biggest loser. Health Concepts IV Inc. in Tulsa, Okla., was distracted by a proxy fight begun by a top officer after he left the company. The company operates drug and alcohol rehabilitation centers. The Stephan Company, which is based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and makes hair and beauty products, was the top gainer in the over-the-counter markets. The company posted its best first quarter ever, the result of cost-cutting and increased sales of private-label salves.
Peter Ferola, Stephan's administrative manager, said he was aware of no particular reason for the increase in the company's stock price.
"We've got a good story and people are finally hearing it," he said.
Sprouse-Reitz Stores Inc., a troubled retailer based in Portland, Ore., posted the largest decline in the over-the-counter markets. Investors soured on the company's prospects after a takeover bid was withdrawn. The Transaction Financial Corporation withdrew its bid in April and said in a statement, "We have no confidence in management and are unwilling to leave our offer on the table indefinitely while the company's financial condition deteriorates rapidly."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
New York Woman Opens Its Gold-Card Mine

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY

 BODY:
Here she comes, the New York Woman! Street smart. Ambitious. Sexy. A young urban survivor, who never, never leaves home without her American Express gold card.
Or so New York Woman magazine, which is published by the American Express Publishing Corporation, would have its advertisers believe. 
 In an unusual attempt to revive its sagging advertising, the 110,000-circulation magazine will guarantee advertisers in its December issue a circulation of 300,000 women. The additional 190,000, who will get the December issue in the mail at no cost, are American Express gold card holders who charge at least $3,000 a year in retail sales to their cards.
 
Access to Millions of Names
 Like its sister publications within the American Express family, the five-year-old-magazine, which publishes 10 issues a year, has access to the millions of names in the parent company's formidable data base. These data tell how many times a card was used and the amounts paid and have enough verified information about how the woman shops to make any media director drool. Holders of gold cards are the biggest spenders in the data base.
"No one can profile a woman's spending the way we can," the magazine's publisher, Amy Rappeport, said. "In publishing New York Woman, our single greatest advantage is our connection to our parent, American Express."
Most magazines pay a lot for lists of names of people who fit the demographics that advertisers are seeking. American Express publications have all these data in house.
Like most city publications, New York Woman is heavily dependent on local retail advertisers. These advertisers include department stores, restaurants and small boutiques, which are often among the hardest hit in a recession. New York Woman saw its advertising pages decline 28 percent for the first six months of this year.
Ad pages in two other American Express city magazines are also down this year -- L.A. Style by 35 percent and D., a Dallas-based magazine, by 16 percent. The company's other city publication, Atlanta, is even with the first six months of 1990.
The typical New York Woman reader is 36 years old and has a household income of $90,000. Ninety-five percent of the readers live in the New York metropolitan area. Half are married. And -- this is, after all, New York -- 40 percent say they have at least one facial a year.
The magazine's founder and editor in chief, Betsy Carter, who had been with Esquire and Newsweek, said she started the magazine because she felt there was a singular sensibility among women in New York.
"I realized I could connect with almost every woman I met in New York," she said. "New York women are smart, quirky and funny. It's part of a kind of urban survival."
 
Remaking the Magazine
 Still, the magazine may have an image problem. Some readers have said they feel the magazine cannot quite seem to make up its mind whether it is a consumer magazine or a feature magazine. Others criticize it as being "too neurotic."
With the September issue, the magazine will have a new tag line, calling itself New York Woman, the Life of the City. It will undergo a total redesign to broaden its appeal, in Ms. Carter's words, "to make it intimate, to make it fun, to make it loose."
New sections will include information on looking for a job and reviews of books, art, dance, music, theater, movies, television and food.
Ms. Rappeport said New York Woman was close to being profitable; it has not yet posted its first profit.
For two or three months last fall, rumors swept the industry that the magazine was about to cease publication. Ms. Rappeport and Ms. Carter said the rumors were unfounded.
The move to increase December's circulation is mainly intended to attract advertisers at higher rates during the Christmas holidays, said Ron Prince, vice president and group publisher for American Express's City Magazine Group. It is not part of a subscription drive.
In fact, since American Express conducts many magazine subscription drives by pulling names from its data base, the chances are that some women who will receive the magazine free in December already passed up a were a subscription offer.
Mr. Prince said that even if permanent subscriptions expanded substantially as a result of the December circulation increase, it was unlikely that advertisers would be willing to pay higher rates during the less-active retail months in the winter.
Rates for the December issue will be increased by 75 or 80 percent. This increase will not cover the full cost of printing and mailing; Mr. Prince and Ms. Rappeport declined to say how much the effort would cost over all.
A number of advertisers responded positively to the planned increase in December's circulation.
"I think fishing when the fish are biting is the best thing to do," said Matt Rubel, president of the specialty-store division at Revlon Inc.
And Stacy Demeo, vice president for merchandising at Bloomingdale's department store, concurred. "The more people you can get your hands on, the better," he said.
Mr. Rubel said of New York Woman: "It's probably the most effective vehicle in a major metropolitan area that can bring a customer to a counter in a very immediate manner. We've found that through advertising services with gift certificates in the magazine, we get a very high response rate of people bringing them back to our counters."

HEADLINE: Ethiopians to Discuss a New Regime

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, June 30

 BODY:
The new rulers of Ethiopia are convening a conference in Addis Ababa on Monday to form a more broadly based provisional government -- a step viewed as vital to healing the ethnically divided, financially strapped country after years of civil war and famine.
But the meeting of Ethiopian factions, including the three rebel fronts that worked together to overthrow the Soviet-backed regime of the past 14 years, is expected to put off for the time being an issue critical to the country's long-term unity. That is the question of whether the province of Eritrea in the north of the country should become independent, an outcome favored by the rebel organization now in control there. 
 The meeting is taking place largely at the urging of the United States, the main foreign mediator in the Ethiopian conflict. Washington won a pledge that such a conference would be held from the front led by rebels from Tigre Province. In return, Washington gave political support to that group's takeover of Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, last month.
 
Possibility of Economic Help
 A senior American diplomat said that if the Tigrean-led front can form an ethnically diverse government, then Western governments and the World Bank may show more interest in economic support for Ethiopia. Under the Marxist-Leninist rule of Lieut. Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam, Washington gave large amounts of humanitarian assistance to Ethiopia, but because of the Mengistu Government's poor human rights record there was no economic assistance.
Diplomats said the question of the future of Eritrea was being put aside at this conference to allow the rebel group in Addis Ababa to broaden its base without the interference of such a contentious issue. An independent Eritrea would leave the rest of the country landlocked, depriving it of ports on the Red Sea.
At a meeting on June 16 between Isaias Afewerki, the leader of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front, and Meles Zenawi, the leader of the Tigrean-dominated Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front, the two men agreed that Mr. Isaias would attend as an "interested observer" with no participation in the planned new transitional government, Mr. Isaias said.
 
Referendum on Independence
 The Tigrean-dominated front has agreed, as part of its tactical alliance with the Eritrean rebels, that Eritrea be allowed a United Nations-sponsored referendum on the question of independence. The Eritreans have said they are willing to delay the referendum for up to two years to give Ethiopia time to stabilize politically.
The Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Herman J. Cohen, is attending the meeting as an observer, he said, in contrast to the role he played as mediator at talks on the future of Ethiopia in London last month.
The United States played a key role in the Ethiopian conflict last month by encouraging the Tigrean-led fighters, who were at the outskirts of Addis Ababa as the Ethiopian Army of Col. Mengistu crumbled, to enter the city and fill the power vacuum. Mr. Cohen made clear at the time that United States economic assistance and political support was contingent on the rebels calling a conference by July 1 to form a provisional government.
Despite his insistence that the United States is only an "observer" at Monday's meeting -- along with European countries and perhaps the Soviet Union -- Washington officials appear to be playing an active role in the pre-conference proceedings.
 
U.S. Official in Addis Ababa
 Another State Department official, Irwin Hicks, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, is already in Addis Ababa talking with officials of the Tigrean-led front and its leader, Mr. Meles. The front started out in the early 1970's as an extreme Marxist-Leninist group but asserts that in the last few years it has shed its Communist program.
Mr. Cohen said he hoped that the conference would, as the front had outlined, establish a provisional government "representing all facets of Ethiopian society." It would work out election procedures for a constituent assembly which in turn would write a constitution, he said. The elections for the assembly would probably be held within six to nine months.
The front had also expressed the intention for the new provisional government to sign a charter on such principles as human rights and freedom of the press, Mr. Cohen said.
Both Ethiopians and Western diplomats said that two developments augured well for the conference to be held in Africa Hall, the headquarters of the Organization of African Unity.
 
Independence Demand Dropped
 The first was the pledge by the Oromo Liberation Front, one of the three partners in the loose coalition that fought the old government, to drop its demand for a separate state of Oromia. In an interview last week, Yohannis Lette, the deputy secretary general of the Oromo group, said the front would attend the conference with the hope of taking part in a multi-ethnic Ethiopia organized as a federation.
The Oromos are the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia, making up almost 50 percent of the population. They are predominantly Muslim and live mostly in the southern part of Ethiopia stretching from the Sudan border in the west to the Somali border in the east.
The second promising factor, officials said, was the decision of an exile group dominated by the Amhara ethnic group, the rulers of Ethiopia for the last century, to attend the conference. The Coalition of Ethiopian Democratic Forces, based in Washington, which has been extremely critical of the Tigrean group, said it would go to Addis Ababa in a "spirit of compromise to initiate a process of national reconciliation and lasting peace."

HEADLINE: A Period of Retrenchment for the World's Stock Markets

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The second quarter was one of retrenchment for most of the world's major stock markets.
After first-quarter rallies fueled by the allied victory in the Persian Gulf war and the anticipation of economic recovery in the United States, many markets experienced consolidations and disappointments in the last three months. And with the absence of a hoped-for decline in interest rates in Europe, most of the Continent's markets suffered.
 
Mexico Still on Top
 According to an index compiled by The Financial Times of the performances of the stock markets in 24 countries, 18 declined in dollar terms in the second quarter, compared with 3 in the first, and half declined when measured in their own currencies, compared with none in the first quarter. 
 Mexico held its position as the top performer. Investors continued to bet that the country would benefit from an economic reform program and a free-trade agreement with the United States and Canada that is now being negotiated.
Mexico's market grew by 25.9 percent in the second quarter measured in pesos, and 24.9 percent in dollar terms. For the first six months of the year, it grew by 72.4 percent in pesos and 68.8 percent in dollars. But the rate of appreciation slowed by 10 percentage points in the second quarter from the first.
Reflecting the problems in Europe, the French stock market fell 3.6 percent measured in francs in the second quarter, compared with an 18.3 percent rise in the first quarter. For the first six months, the market rose 14 percent in francs but lost 5.6 percent in dollars.
The British market fell 2.5 percent in pounds in the second quarter after a 15.4 percent rise in the first quarter. In the first six months, it rose 12.5 percent measured in pounds, but slipped 5.6 percent in dollars.
The Swiss market inched up 83-hundredths of 1 percent in the second quarter in local currency after a 19.1 percent rally in the first. It grew 20.1 percent in local currency in the first six months, but dropped 1.7 percent in dollars.
The United States stock market declined 1.3 percent in the second quarter, compared with a rise of 14.1 percent in the first quarter and 12.6 percent in the six months.
 
Weakness in Tokyo
 The Tokyo stock market suffered from continued high interest rates and a scandal involving two of the nation's biggest brokerage houses. For the second quarter, the Tokyo market fell 7.4 percent in yen terms after a 13.1 percent rise in the first quarter. It rose by 4.6 percent measured in yen in the six months.
One surprise was the German stock market. In the first quarter, it was the worst performer in dollar terms, down 5.2 percent, and 21st measured in marks, with a rise of 7.7 percent. In the second quarter, the market kept the same pace, as confidence grew in the assimilation of eastern Germany, and some major foreign investors returned to the market.
Through Thursday, The Financial Times index for Germany was up 7.7 percent in the second quarter in local terms. But the market, worried about the imposition of new taxes, dropped sharply on Friday, ending the quarter with only a 4.7 percent rise in mark terms and a 2 percent decline in dollar terms. For the six months, the German market rose 12.8 percent measured in marks but fell 7.1 percent in dollar terms.
South Africa was another surprise, as local indexes exceeded or neared all-time highs. The market gained 16.3 percent in local currency and 15 percent in dollars in the second quarter, the second-best performance after Mexico's. The market had grown only 4.2 percent in terms of the rand and 8.3 percent in dollars in the first quarter. It grew 21.2 percent in rands and 24.5 percent in dollars in the first half.

HEADLINE: In Walkout at a G.M. Plant, Pay and Benefits Are Beside the Point

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BALTIMORE, June 28

 BODY:
Randy Yates walked the picket line outside the General Motors minivan plant under a punishing sun, his shirt dark with sweat, and talked about why his co-workers were striking for reasons that have nothing to do with wages or benefits.
Since 400 workers were laid off in February at the plant on the Baltimore waterfront, Mr. Yates and his colleagues said, the remaining workers have had to work faster to keep up with the assembly line. They said the pace had led to numerous injuries. 
 "It's really a safety issue for us," said Mr. Yates, a 20-year veteran who works in the body shop. He said the body shop was "like an amusement park -- jobs come flying in and stop in front of you."
Tony Maraschillo, a 26-year veteran who works on the line, agreed that the company was, in effect, demanding that employees work faster, and that workers were being injured as a result. "When you don't have enough time to pay attention to what you're doing, you're going to get hurt," he said.
General Motors executives declined to discuss the strike, and the company's public relations department referred all inquiries to Terry Youngerman, the personnel director at the plant. "We haven't publicly discussed the issue at all," Mr. Youngerman said in a brief telephone interview, adding that the company intended to maintain its silence.
An estimated 3,200 members of Local 239 of the United Automobile Workers walked off the job on Monday, contending that there were not enough employees to keep up with the pace of the assembly line.
At the time of the layoffs in February, the company reduced the number of Chevrolet Astros and GMC Safaris required to be completed each hour. But the union contends that despite the reduction, to 42 from 47, the assembly line is still too fast to assure the safety of the reduced work force. It says there have been 300 injuries since February, 10 times the rate before the layoffs.
 
'Thumb Cut to the Bone'
 "One guy got his thumb cut to the bone," Mr. Yates said. "One guy got his tendons cut, and one guy got cut right through his glove."
The union also complains that the company has unfairly restricted employees' vacations because of a shortage of workers.
General Motors has sustained major financial losses this year, and has lost more than $2 billion in the past three quarters. Industry experts say reduced sales and profits have forced the company to cut costs wherever possible to maximize profits on lines of vehicles like the minivans, which have sold well even in the recession.
Negotiations on the production and safety issues began March 25. But the two sides failed to resolve the dispute before a union-imposed deadline of June 24. The union said 94 percent of its members had voted to strike.
 
New Talks Are Scheduled
 Union officials said negotiators had made some progress in talks since the strike began. Talks are scheduled to resume on July 1.
The union contends that its contract allows workers to strike over "production work standards."
"The bottom line is human rights," said Rodney A. Trump, president of the local.
Of the 400 workers who were laid off last winter, 200 were placed in programs to train them for other jobs at the plant and in education programs to obtain a high school equivalency diploma. These programs are jointly administered by General Motors and the union, and the employees receive their full salaries.
The remaining 200 workers received 95 percent of their net wages, less taxes and the cost of traveling to work. This comes to about 80 percent of what they earned on the job, Mr. Trump said. But these benefits expire after 36 weeks.
Union officials at the 56-year-old plant said that the base pay averaged $28,000 a year and that union members earn up to $40,000 with overtime.
Strikers receive $100 a week from the union, their full medical benefits, but no dental or optical benefits.
"We're not out over money," said Milt Slowikowsky, a union health and safety representative. "We're out because they're abusing our people."

HEADLINE: Kemp's Proposals on Poverty Given Sympathy, Not Action

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30

 BODY:
A year ago, White House aides drafted a 10-page memorandum to provide President Bush with a vision for a war on poverty. They ran it past Jack F. Kemp, the Administration's Housing Secretary and anti-poverty czar.
"That's not a vision," Mr. Kemp complained in a letter to the White House. He was particularly annoyed by the document's call for two technical studies of how anti-poverty programs are financed and managed. 
 In a White House already criticized for "studying the problem to death," he wrote, the studies would drag on for another year. "Meanwhile, what's going on in our neighborhoods and on the streets?"
It is now a year later, and many Administration officials say Mr. Kemp's prophecy of endless study is close to coming true. When the President convened a Cabinet meeting this month for an anti-poverty report, the discussion swirled around one unenacted -- and some say tepidly endorsed -- legislative proposal, and the same two studies that had made Mr. Kemp cringe. The meeting then adjourned, pending further study.
In the Bush Administration, the fight against poverty has been a slow go. Its pace illustrates the difficulties that arise when a conservative like Mr. Kemp tries to rally a Republican Administration around what have historically been Democratic concerns.
Mr. Kemp's anti-poverty platform sails under the banner of "empowerment," a market-driven strategy that seeks to give the poor more power by letting them bypass Government bureaucracy. Arguing that such bureaucracies have ruined public housing and education, he calls for programs to help the poor buy their own homes and choose their children's schools. In addition, he wants tax breaks for businesses that locate near poor neighborhoods.
Inside the Administration, officials are quick to voice their sympathies for Mr. Kemp's plans but slow to provide the financial or political capital needed to make them a widespread reality. Mr. Kemp's anti-poverty plan may even be at peak political utility in its current, unrealized form -- costing nothing but giving the Administration an answer to those who say it lacks domestic vision.
 
Seeking to Help Republicans
 Mr. Kemp has argued that a fight against poverty is both morally right and politically profitable for the Republican Party. But his rivals note that it would also be politically profitable for Mr. Kemp, giving increased prominence to the former Presidential contender who is likely to be one again in the future.
And Mr. Kemp's critics say his oratorical onslaughts often outpace his ability to produce new proposals. "If you try to corner him, there's nothing more he wants to propose," said one White House aide, noting that the President has already backed Mr. Kemp's main ideas.
Mr. Kemp's admirers say the President should emulate his passion; his distractors call Mr. Kemp bombastic.
Visibly frustrated, the Secretary continues to seek a fuller commitment from Mr. Bush, urging him, at the June 20 Cabinet meeting, to put pressure on Congress by appealing directly to the American people.
 
Like to See 'High-Profile'
 "I don't want to be quoted saying I'm urging him to go public, but it's no secret I'd like to see a high-profile, anti-poverty, pro-growth and opportunity agenda," Mr. Kemp said in an interview shortly after the meeting. "The Cabinet needs to do a better job of highlighting it and so does the White House."
White House memorandums and copies of Mr. Kemp's correspondence were provided, on the condition of anonymity, by someone outside his office who is dissatisfied with the Administration's domestic policy. Asked about them this week, Mr. Kemp worried that other officials would suspect him as the source and accuse him of disloyalty.
But he made few efforts to disguise his dissatisfaction. "I don't think the prophecy has come true, but it's in danger of coming true if we don't convert our legislative agenda," he said.
In making the transition from Mr. Bush's Presidential rival to his Housing Secretary, Mr. Kemp has faced political perils. As a free-wheeling, high-profile Congressman, he had managed to keep himself in view with pronouncements on issues from Russian history to the gold standard. Now he is parked atop an obscure bureaucracy, with fewer opportunities to round out a Presidential resume.
 
Other Events Take Stage
 He played virtually no role in the two biggest events of the past year: a budget deal he disliked and a war that pushed him and his anti-poverty plan further from public view.
Until last September, the Administration's anti-poverty planning was controlled by a junior White House group called the Low Income Opportunity Board, whose cautious efforts provoked Mr. Kemp's exasperation.
In May 1990, Mr. Kemp voiced his frustrations in a letter to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, who coordinates the Cabinet's domestic planning. "It is past time for the Administration to aggressively highlight a new comprehensive anti-poverty agenda," Mr. Kemp said.
And his agitation grew last June, when White House planners circulated their 10-page memorandum, cautioning against major new intiatives and recommending two studies. "The Administration has already been criticized in the press for studying the problem to death and throwing up its hands," Mr. Kemp wrote to Mr. Thornburgh in July.
By September, Mr. Kemp had persuaded the President to replace the board with a new planning group, the Economic Empowerment Task Force, headed by Mr. Kemp. But White House officials treated the change with what Mr. Kemp's admirers regard as a characteristic lack of enthusiasm, avoiding any public announcement.
The inclusion of the word "empowerment" marked a subtle but important change. It is a favorite phrase of Mr. Kemp and like-minded young conservatives who argue that its market-driven principles are radically new and can be widely applied.
But the term gained a new enemy last fall when the budget director, Richard G. Darman, set off a minor fury in a speech mocking what he called sloganeering. Instead he called for better "resource allocation" and improved management.
Mr. Kemp fumed. "Solving poverty does not mean green-eyeshade thinking about 'resource allocation' and 'better administration,' " he wrote last fall to the White House.
Mr. Kemp was additionally hemmed in by last fall's budget deal, which required that any expansion of domestic spending in one area be accompanied by cuts in another.
Despite the impediments, Mr. Kemp managed to get Mr. Bush to endorse an eight-point legislative agenda.
It included the items central to the empowerment proposals, like those involving homes and schools. It also included other Administration causes, like an expansion of the Federal death penalty.
Some officials point to this agenda as evidence that Mr. Bush has a distinctive domestic program and they blame Congress for failing to enact it.
But some Kemp allies complain that the program has received little more than Presidential lip service.
"It's a repackaging job, a way of describing a few things without any strong intellectual or political commitment to it," said Stuart Butler of the Heritage Foundation, who is an intellectual godfather to the empowerment movement. "What's lacking is Presidential leadership."
Asked about Mr. Butler's view, Mr. Kemp hedged, "I would say all of us need to do more."
 
Going It Alone
 Mr. Kemp's supporters say the Congressional fight over the proposal on home ownership reveals the tepid White House support. After Mr. Kemp's request for $855 million was cut to $200 million by the House Appropriations Committee, he lobbied the full House and squeezed out an extra $150 million.
But he did so alone, with none of the White House push that accompanies top priority items. "Kemp's off getting his head dented trying to push Congress into things that are broader, deeper, larger," said one White House aide involved in the anti-poverty plans.
Some of what makes Mr. Kemp different from others in the Administration is his political calculus. He sees his proposals as an opportunity to win over new voting blocs and talks about restoring Republicans as the party of Lincoln and black liberation. But others see political peril. Last summer's White House memorandum warned that giving poverty "greater visibility" could lead to measures that are "too expensive" and that create a need "to demonstrate concrete success by 1992."
Mr. Kemp greets such arguments with impatience. "Poverty already has a high public visibility," he wrote Mr. Thornburgh last spring.
 
Back at Planning Stages
 As its legislative proposals languish, empowerment is back at the planning stages, as was clear at this month's Cabinet meeting.
Mr. Kemp himself had nothing new to lay on the table, except his familiar calls for a firmer White House embrace of his current program. Once again, he received a polite Presidential reception, but no commitments.
As the meeting adjourned, Marlin Fitzwater, the President's press secretary, turned to an associate and remarked on Mr. Kemp's value as an oratorical asset. Mr. Kemp sounds good, he said, noting the benefits in keeping him talking.

Gadflies of Today Parcel the Blame Among Old Allies

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
A decade ago, a Harlem community organizer was instrumental in mobilizing an emotional protest against New York City's plan to close Sydenham Hospital.
The protesters ultimately lost. But the city's decision to shut the hospital generated enduring distrust of the Koch administration by many black New Yorkers. Years later, that animus helped elect Mayor David N. Dinkins. Now, with poor people again bearing the brunt of many city economies, the organizer from Harlem is back -- this time as Mr. Dinkins's deputy mayor. 
 "In the Sydenham days, it was very easy to criticize and make judgments about what should be," Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch recalled the other day. "I might have come to the same conclusion, but having the information and the responsibility makes a big difference."
That Mr. Lynch and so many other gadflies came in from the cold to join city government has, in effect, inhibited the latest crop of community organizers. Otherwise, they might have been more vigorously protesting the threatened reduction of hospital services and the closing of health clinics planned now not only in Harlem but, perhaps more equitably, all over the city.
 Last week, the individual who was most instrumental in goading Mr. Dinkins and the City Council to restore more than $50 million in vital medical services was no radical street organizer, but a Fifth Avenue physician. Dr. Kevin M. Cahill, a Koch appointee to the city's Board of Health, had threatened to invoke the board's broad powers and declare a health emergency unless the cuts were restored.
No newcomer to public service, Dr. Cahill was a key adviser to Gov. Hugh L. Carey, who, with the financier Felix G. Rohatyn, helped rescue the city from bankruptcy in 1975.
Yet New York today is a very different city from the one that survived the fiscal crisis in 1975. It is difficult to quantify that difference. And surely some benchmarks are for the better. But officials say a city that sheltered 2,400 homeless adults then now houses about 7,500 adults and 7,900 children. Nearly twice as many one-parent families with children are living in poverty. The AIDS virus, unreported in 1975, now afflicts more than 32,000 New Yorkers. The number of children living in foster care has climbed from 29,000 to more than 49,000.
The social and economic ramifications of these crises have inspired Mr. Lynch's fresh perspective. They provoked Nancy G. Wackstein, an exasperated former private advocate who now directs the Mayor's Office of Homelessness, to express concern about encampments by homeless people and declare: "Maybe if you turn down the comfort level in public places they will come inside." And they prompted Barbara J. Sabol, the Human Resources Commissioner, to appeal to homeless men living in a Brooklyn armory to recognize their responsibilities -- a word applied infrequently -- to their temporary home and neighborhood.
The political implications of the new social and economic realities inherited by Mr. Dinkins are also compelling, considering that many of his constituents are, understandably, less interested in shrinking the pie than in belatedly getting a bigger slice.
"There's a trust factor -- that David Dinkins really does care and that if he could do something different he would," Mr. Lynch says. But when Dennis Rivera, head of the hospital workers union, dined with Mr. Lynch and the Mayor last month, he put his cards on the table: "Today, we would not be able to get the kind of enthusiasm to get 8,000 members to come out to elect a mayor who won by 43,000 votes out of 1.8 million."
Mr. Rivera is leading a new coalition to elect more independent Council members -- more independent of the current leadership, that is. And, depending on whether the Mayor and Mr. Lynch embrace the coalition's platform, perhaps more independent of Mr. Dinkins, too.
"My appeal to the Mayor was to rebuild his coalition, to re-energize the people who elected him," Mr. Rivera said, "not for the objective of getting re-elected, but for governing."
Many people who voted for Mr. Dinkins the first time may have been more confident that he was the right candidate at the right time in New York's political evolution than, necessarily, the right Mayor. "The primary was between a healer and a divider, the general election between a Democrat and a Republican," Mr. Rivera recalled. "But there was not a clear vision of what we get once we elect him."
What they have gotten after 18 months is a Mayor who expanded the police force and slashed the rest of the budget, including social services, while largely keeping his core constituency quiet, which may have been one of the unspoken reasons some people supported him.
Mr. Dinkins, says Mr. Rivera, "has de-mobilized the coalition that elected him."

HEADLINE: Bank of Japan Cuts Its Rate To 5.5 Percent

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Monday, July 1

 BODY:
Japan today lowered its benchmark interest rate by a half percentage point, to 5.5 percent, ending its two-year-old policy of keeping interest rates high to wring inflation out of the economy.
The announcement by the Bank of Japan, which came at 12:15 P.M. here, appeared intended to spur Japan's economy from a recent slowdown in growth. The country is headed toward its longest-running economic expansion in post-war history -- it is two months short of the record of 57 months, set more than 20 years ago -- and the bank has reccently come under increasing pressure to lower its rates to spur capital spending and revive the lagging stock market.
 
Tokyo Stocks Surge
 The announcement came after widespread speculation that an increase was imminent. The speculation sent the Nikkei index of 250 issues up 370.71 points, or 1.59 percent, to 23,661.67, in active morning trading, reversing a steady decline last week. And the yen strengthened somewhat against the dollar. At noon, the American currency was quoted at 137.80 yen, down from its close of 138.15 on Friday. 
 Today's reduction in the discount rate, the rate the central bank charges banks for short-term loans, was the first since February 1987, when the Bank of Japan cut the discount rate to just 2.5 percent. But in May 1989, the bank began to push up interest rates in an effort to stem what the central bank's governor, Yasushi Mieno, said were dangerous signs of inflation. Mr. Mieno has consistently viewed inflation as a bigger threat to the country's health than a slowdown in growth.
 
Urged by Washington
 The reduction seems likely to be welcomed by the United States, which has been pushing Japan and Germany for months to ease interest rates. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady had urged rate cuts to quicken economic growth around the world at a time of recession in the United States.
Lower Japanese interest rates would also tend to free more Japanese capital to flow abroad to areas with shortages of capital, like Eastern Europe and the United States. Washington's big budget deficits require the sale of tens of billions of dollars of Treasury bonds to foreigners each year.
Politically, a rate cut now seems excellently timed.
The leaders of the seven leading industrial democracies plan to meet in London in two weeks. The cut may ease American pressures on Japan at the meeting and give more weight to Japan's views -- in particular, its staunch opposition to providing financial support to the Soviet Union.
Over the weekend, Japan's Prime Minister, Toshiki Kaifu, said that Japan would not extend massive help to the Soviet Union until it made significant progress on resolving the longstanding territorial debate over the Northern Islands, a cluster of four islands that the Soviets have occupied since the last days of World War II.
The announcement capped several weeks of conflicting signals about whether the Bank of Japan would acceed to pressures for a reduction. Several newspapers, including the Nihon Keizei Shimbun, Japan's leading financial daily, have predicted in recent weeks that the cut was imminent, only to be contradicted by Mr. Mieno.
 
A Cooling Economy
 After the Japanese economy blazed ahead at a rate of more than 5 percent last year, economists are predicting that it will grow about 3 percent to 3.5 percent this year. That rate is still considered a healthy pace, particularly compared with growth in the United States.
Paul Summerville, an economist at Jardine Fleming Securities here, said there were clearer signs now that the economy was cooling. Housing construction and industrial production have been declining, according to figures released last week.
Consumer inflation appears to have diminished to about 3.5 percent, from its high of about 4.5 percent in January. There are also indications that Japan's labor shortage, while still severe, is easing somewhat. Overheated property prices -- one of Mr. Mieno's special targets -- have also shown some signs of slowing.
Not least, the stock market has been sluggish for more than a year, and it has fallen sharply in recent weeks. Analysts have attributed part of the recent drop to a scandal involving Japan's Big Four securities houses. But they have also said it stemmed from disappointment that the central bank had not moved to cut interest rates at a time when the economy was clearly expanding at a slower pace.

HEADLINE: New York Area Military Sites Spared

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
On Staten Island, where jobs for 4,200 civilians and about as many military personnel were at stake, sailors voiced relief. So did officials in New Jersey, who had worried that Fort Dix would be closed.
Both military installations were recommended for reprieves yesterday by a seven-member commission that had been considering closing them along with other forts, shipyards and naval bases the Pentagon had said it no longer needed. 
 "Anchors aweigh," said the Staten Island Borough President, Guy V. Molinari, after the Base Closure and Realignment Commission voted to keep open the naval port there.
 
Glee and Gloom
 Dozens of other communities from Massachusetts to California that are home to military bases got a glimpse of the future yesterday -- bright or bleak, depending on what the seven-member decided.
Military bases mean big money for cities and towns; soldiers and their families pump billions of dollars into local economies.
For towns facing base closings, which still have to go the President and Congress, the panel's decisions may mean big problems. Landlords began worrying about how to fill apartments now rented to soldiers. Owners of shoe stores worried about not outfitting military families with fast-growing children. Managers of movie theaters worried about empty seats at their sixplexes.
 
Concern From Dinkins
 But on Staten Island, the mood was upbeat.
"This was definitely the right decision," said Lieut. Roxie Thompson, who is stationed at the Staten Island installation. "I would have hated to leave New York, as it has treated us wonderfully."
The Staten Island port came off the drawing boards in the Reagan Administration days of big military budgets and dreams of a 600-ship fleet. Now the Navy appears headed for 500-ship strength, and there is less of a threat of nuclear war.
The Staten Island port had been the target of protests because the Navy wanted to it to be the home base for warships with nuclear weapons. Mayor David N. Dinkins, who announced his opposition to the project during his 1989 campaign, said yesterday that keeping the port open could endanger the city.
"While I fully recognize that our nation must always keep a strong defense in place, I continue to have great concern over the establishment of a base with nuclear-capable weapons in New York Harbor," he said.
 
Reprieve for Fort Dix
 The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, which is led by a former Congressman from New Jersey, Jim Courter, also gave Fort Dix a reprieve by rejecting the Pentagon's plan to close the base and leave only a skeleton crew to train Army reservists. Gov. Jim Florio took time out from budget deliberations in Trenton to applaud the action.
"Losing Fort Dix would have been a mistake that would have hurt the people who work there and live in the area," the Governor said, "and it would have compromised our nation's ability to respond to a crisis as swiftly and surely as we did in the Persian Gulf."
Officials in Philadelphia were glum after the commission voted to close the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and the Philadelphia Naval Station, which employ more than 9,000 people in Philadephia and southern New Jersey.
"This is penny-wise, dollar-foolish bureaucratic nonsense and we've got to fight it to the end," said Senator Harris Wofford, a Pennsylvania Democrat.
Representative Thomas M. Foglietta, a Democrat, accused the Bush Administration of telling Pennsylvania and Philadelphia "to drop dead." But he said that a Congressional directive sending the U.S.S. Kennedy to the Navy yard for repairs would keep that installation going until mid-1996.
That would save some but not all of the military jobs in Philadelphia. Robert C. Wonderling, president of the Penjerdel Council, an non-profit association of businesses in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware, said that closing the base would put 23,000 Pennsylvanians and 8,700 New Jersey residents out of work.
He estimated that the shutdown would mean a loss of $24 million in annual tax revenues to Pennsylvania and another $43.2 million in annual tax revenues to the city. He also estimated that between 13 and 17 percent of the laid-off workers would leave the Delaware Valley region.
In California, local officials tried to calculate what the panel's split decision on installations in Long Beach would mean. The commission voted to close the Long Beach Naval Station, but spared the Long Beach Naval Shipyard, which the Navy said was vital to its mission.
The local Chamber of Commerce estimated that Navy families spend about $1.5 billion a year. "You can reduce that figure by about half and that's what we'll be losing," said John Higginson, a retired admiral who is the president of the Long Beach Area Chamber of Commerce.
Mr. Higginson breezed through the calculations: There are 35 ships based at the Long Beach Naval Station, with 200 to 400 sailors each. That means that the community will be losing 7,000 to 14,000 military people, not including spouses or children.
"It's a large number and it will make a significant impact on Long Beach," he said. "Fortunately, we saved half a loaf" by keeping the shipyard open.
 
'Everyone Is Upset'
 Fort Ord, near Seaside, Calif, was not so lucky. The commission went along with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's recommendation that it be shut down.
"Everyone is upset about it," said Sharon Green, a manager of a grocery store in nearby Marina, Calif. "Almost all of the businesses in Marina rely on military families."
The manager of a Denny's restaurant in Marina speculated that the base closing would mean laying off a third of the restaurant's 93 workers.
But for some business people, the only certainty was uncertainty. Joseph Anastasi, the owner of a seafood restaurant on Fisherman's Wharf in Monterey, said the shutdown would "hurt the whole community, but I really don't know how much."

HEADLINE: King's Dream Lives Again at Site of His Death

BYLINE: By MARY B. W. TABOR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEMPHIS, June 30

 BODY:
For years, the motel where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968 stood amid dilapidated warehouses, a crumbling memorial to the civil rights leader.
But this week, the Lorraine Motel celebrates its rebirth as the National Civil Rights Museum. 
 The motel, once one of the few lodging houses in the city where blacks could stay, has been gutted and rebuilt to hold what museum officials say will be the first comprehensive exhibit documenting the civil rights movement in this country. Only the facade resembles the original Lorraine.
Civic leaders hope that the museum will both revitalize the forlorn Mulberry Street neighborhood, long overrun by prostitutes and drug dealers, and sweeten racial relations. Businesses and foundations managed by whites donated $1.3 million for the $9.7 million museum, with the rest of the money coming from city, state, Shelby County and other private donations.
Construction delays have postponed the museum's opening, scheduled for July 4, until Aug. 31. But keeping with the original schedule, celebrations honoring the museum began today, and several of the museum's exhibits are already in place.
Focusing on the civil rights movement during the 1950's and 1960's, the museum's 10,000 square feet of exhibition space will include an auditorium and extensive audio, video, and photographic diplays of civil rights protests in cities and towns across the country.
Visitors, to be charged $5 for admission, will be able to sit at a lunch counter alongside statues of black students defying the ban against their presence and two jeering white men. Film footage of actual demonstrations will play on a screen behind.
Museum-goers may also board a city bus from Montgomery, Ala., like the one Rosa Parks rode in 1955 when she refused to give up her seat to a white passenger, setting off a 381-day bus boycott by blacks.
Those who sit in the front seats of the bus will trigger a recording of a southern male voice, like that of the bus driver Mrs. Parks encountered, asking them to give up their seats. The message becomes progressively harsher until the driver explains that in the 1950's such defiance from a black passenger would have resulted in an arrest.
 
Bloodstained Slab Is Reset
 Two of the motel rooms, those Dr. King rented so he could lead a march in support of striking city workers, have been restored and preserved. One, which motel residents had turned into a shrine, now displays original furniture set up as it was the night of April 4, 1968, when Dr. King stepped out on his balcony before leaving to visit a local minister. It was there that James Earl Ray, aiming from a building across the street, shot him.
The bloodstained concrete slab where Dr. King fell has been reset on the balcony walkway. His body lies entombed at the Martin Luther King Center for Nonviolent Social Change in Atlanta.
More than 100 celebrities and civil rights advocates, including Mrs. Parks, Coretta Scott King, the actor Morgan Freeman and the folk singer Pete Seeger, are taking part in events that began today and will continue through Thursday in honor of the museum.

 
Easter Site of King Story
 The festivities opened with a citywide worship service with the Rev. Jesse Jackson and the Rev. Joseph E. Lowery at Mason Temple, where Dr. King, on the eve of his death, said God had "allowed me to go up to the mountain and I've looked over and I've seen the Promised Land," adding, "I may not get there with you."
At the service, Mr. Jackson, who witnessed the assassination, called Memphis the Easter site of the King story. "To not have this museum in Memphis would be like the Christians celebrating Christmas and never celebrating Easter," Mr. Jackson called out to a congregation of 1,000 people, who sat fanning themselves in the steamy heat.
"Memphis, his last sermon. Memphis, the vision of the mountaintop. Memphis, the last march. Memphis, the last interruption. Memphis, the last breath," he said.
Most Memphis residents welcome the civil rights museum as an asset to the city, which has long relied on Elvis Presley's Graceland mansion as its major tourist attraction.
 
'A Blessing for Generations'
 "The museum will serve as an anchor for growth and revitalization for an otherwise deteriorating section of downtown Memphis," D'Army Bailey, a state circuit court judge and president of the not-for-profit foundation responsible for the museum, said in an interview. "It also serves as a signal to the world that Memphis has come to grip with the tragedy of Dr. King's death here, and has drawn from it the tools to mold a unique educational tool."
Calvin C. Brown, who lived at the motel for 16 years and used to show Dr. King's room to interested visitors, agreed. "It isn't going to draw like Elvis Presley, but it should attract people from all parts of the world and will be a blessing for generations to come," he said.
But others have protested that Dr. King would have wanted the museum money used to help the destitute. One woman, a former motel employee and resident who was evicted in 1988, has defiantly camped across the street outside the project for three years.
 
'A Waste of Money'
 "These people are playing with history in order to make a buck," said Jacqueline Smith, who lived at the Lorraine for 16 years before her eviction. "It should have been converted into housing for the poor, the homeless or the elderly. That's what we need in this neighborhood." The $5 admission charge will be too expensive for many of the poor people who live there, she added.
Arun Gandhi, the grandson of Mohandas K. Gandhi, and a journalist who is starting up The Gandhi Institute for the Study of Nonviolence at Christian Brothers University in Memphis, has also criticized the project.
"I think my grandfather and Martin Luther King had the same dream," Mr. Gandhi said. "And they didn't want people to erect statues and museums in their memory. It's a waste of money."
Still, the museum is expected to serve as an important bridge for a city where blacks and whites have often been slow to join hands.
Although blacks make up 55 percent of Memphis's more than 900,000 residents, whites have kept a tight grip on the city's social, political and economic institutions. The Mayor, Richard C. Hackett, is white, as are 10 of the 13 City Council members. A majority of blacks work in low-paying jobs, and many live at or below the poverty line.
 
Cause for Hope
 Tensions worsened in recent months when black leaders trying to find a black mayoral candidate held community meetings and made it clear whites were not welcome. In addition, a pending Justice Department lawsuit charges that the city's election system has undermined black voting strength.
But on Tuesday, in an effort to defuse some of the tension, the City Council approved a redistricting plan that creates another city council district with a black majority.
Many here see the opening of the museum as another bright spot.
"I cannot think of anything in my experience in Memphis that has had a more unifying impact for blacks and whites here," said Mr. Bailey. "They are really proud of this."
Sitting alone in his downtown tailoring shop, just a few blocks from the new museum, Ellis Rivers grows solemn when asked what effect the project has had on him.
"It makes me think," said Mr. Rivers, who attended Dr. King's mountaintop sermon and his funeral. "If all of us could love each other as God's children, not looking at color," he said, his voice trailing off into silence.

HEADLINE: AT THE BUDGET WALL;
ACCORD REACHED FOR GRIM BUDGET IN NEW YORK CITY

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
With Mayor David N. Dinkins and the City Council splitting much of their difference on tax increases and service cuts, New York City officials reached an agreement last night on the outlines of a grim, recession-dominated budget that will raise the cost of living and lower the quality of services in the city.
The agreement came after months of wrangling that culminated in tense negotiations that ended only as the deadline for adopting a budget loomed. In the hours before the agreement, the Council, operating under new powers granted under the new City Charter, had renewed a threat to adopt its own version of the budget without input from the Mayor. 
 Under the agreement, taxes in the $29 billion budget would rise by $735 million, including a $335 million income tax increase pending in Albany and a property tax increase of $400 million, about half the property tax rise proposed by Mr. Dinkins. Council approval is needed for the property-tax increase, which would mean an average rise of 10.7 percent for homeowners and 8 percent for owners of cooperative apartments.
 
Layoffs Are Not Reversed
 Most of the $1.5 billion in service cuts proposed by the Mayor would go forward under the agreement, along with the layoffs of 10,000 workers, including 6,000 who were dismissed on Friday.
But at least $117 million of the most damaging reductions in city services -- from the closing of prenatal clinics to the padlocking of libraries -- will be restored. The Council had sought to restore about $220 million in proposed service cuts but seemed to split the difference with the Mayor.
"This budget contains a lot more pain, and a lot less gain than any of us would like," Mr. Dinkins said at a news conference last night he held jointly with Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone.
"This is an example of what we can do in the worst of times," Mr. Vallone said.
The changes from the Mayor's budget would be paid for in part by at least $200 million in other cuts, including $10 million from an across-the-board cut in managers at city agencies, $20 million in supplies and $50 million from cuts in the Police Department that would result in the postponement of the hiring of civilian workers who were supposed to free deskbound police officers for patrol duty.
The rest would come out of nooks and crannies in the city's complex budget, including $125 million through bond refinancing and other one time revenues and $150 million from higher forecasts of tax estimates.
Philip R. Michael, the city's Budget Director, attributed the higher tax revenues to higher estimates of real-estate, corporate and business tax collections made in the last week as new tax collection data became available. Though fiscal analysts often criticize the use of nonrecurring revenue in city budget balancing, Mr. Michael said he expected little concern over the revenues found by his office to clinch the budget agreement.
 
Seeking Concessions
 Mr. Dinkins is seeking concessions from city unions in an effort to avert some or all of the layoffs, and late last night city officials were considering a proposal from union leaders that would avert many layoffs through a wage deferral, an early-retirement program and stepped up attrition.
City officials discounted the possiblity of an imminent agreement. Asked if he was optimistic, Barry Feinstein, the teamsters union leader, said: "It depends on what they come back with. All the elements for a solution are on the table."
In reaching an agreement, Mr. Dinkins was forced to give way on tax increases that he had fought vigorously for over many weeks, and to embrace a budget that included service cuts he considered unthinkable only a few months ago.
But at the same time, succeeding in putting together any kind of budget at all under such adverse circumstances could serve the Mayor well in the face of relentless questioning of his administration's ability to manage the city's affairs. And it also makes calls for a takeover of the city's finances by the state's Financial Control Board seem a far more distant possibility.
 
Sweet Compromise for Some
 For the often maligned Council, the compromise was sweet. By fighting both for lower taxes and fewer service cuts, Council members gained political capital to use in the November elections. And by dropping plans to pass their own budget -- after establishing it as a credible threat -- they avoided the risks of a prolonged fight with the Mayor.
The budget agreement came so late, that negotiators said it would take most of the night to fill in all the details and most of today to print the budget, delaying the adoption until tonight at the earliest. Some Council aides said the delay was the longest in at least several decades.
But with the city's fiscal problems so severe, many officials were predicting that whatever budget was put into place now would soon change to take into account concessions from municipal unions or the further decline in the city's fiscal picture forecast by the City Comptroller, Elizabeth Holtzman.
In addition, the budget could be further altered if Mayor Dinkins succeeded in his quest to get up to $350 million from the state's Municipal Assistance Corporation, through bond refinancing, to reduce or postpone the impact of the worst of the service cuts. Felix G. Rohatyn, the corporation's chairman, said he would consider the move later in the year after the city can show that it has a long-term plan to solve its fiscal problems that is acceptable to the city's bond rating agencies.
The financial crisis and the ensuing negotiations with the state, the City Council and the unions have been a crucial test for Mr. Dinkins as he struggles with the most difficult political and fiscal challenge of his career.
For weeks he has agonized publicly, over the possibility that the Financial Control Board, a state oversight body, could step in and usurp much of his governing authority, a move that the Mayor has abhorred as what could be a devastating personal and institutional symbol.
Mr. Dinkins remained closeted in his office and did not directly pariticpate in any negotiations with the council in the last few days. He first appeared in public at a 10 P.M. news conference, five hours after the agreement was reached by his aides yesterday. In staff talks that began at 1:30 A.M. yesterday and broke off near dawn, negotiators for the Mayor and the Council had all but agreed on the outlines of a new budget, divided by as little as $40 million, or a little more than one-tenth of 1 percent of the budget.
But when negotiators returned to City Hall later yesterday, the talks faltered -- a breakdown the Mayor's aides attributed to a misunderstanding but the Council said stemmed from disarray and disagreement among the Mayor's aides.
Late last night, negotiators continued to work out a list of programs that would be restored, at least in part. Few details were available, but officials confirmed that the Central Park Zoo would not be closed, libraries and musuems would get more funds, while many social service programs targetted for elimination would be saved.
The income-tax rate increase has been help up by the State Senate out of concern that the overall tax burden in the city was going too high while the government was not being trimmed enough.
But yesterday, after meeting with state legislative leaders over the weekend on a new state budget, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said the city would get the $663 million in help from the state that it was counting on as part of its current budget. "They can now feel secure that they will get the entire $663 million they needed in revenues, mandates and cash, either in exactly the form they asked for it, or in some alternate form," he said.

HEADLINE: AT THE BUDGET WALL;
Budget Package For New Jersey Signed Into Law

BYLINE: By PETER KERR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 30

 BODY:
The state adopted a new budget tonight for the fiscal year that begins on Monday, and the plan's Democratic sponsors said it would result in the layoffs of 2,000 to 3,000 state employees.
The $14.7 billion budget, which was signed by Gov. Jim Florio at 11:54 P.M., also includes the $400 million sale of a section of highway in Bergen County to the New Jersey Turnpike Authority. 
 Although its sponsors said the budget included no new taxes, it was immediately assailed by Republicans in the Senate and General Assembly as fiscally irresponsible and bound to bring higher taxes in future years.
The plan was passed by both houses this evening in votes that divided generally along party lines.
Days of legislative wrangling came to a dramatic denouement shortly after the 43-to-37 vote in the Assembly, when a bomb threat sent members scurrying into the summer night.
A state trooper rushed the budget documents out of the State House, as Democrats and Republicans who had recently been attacking one another on the Assembly floor mingled on the sidewalk exchanging jokes about exactly who was the intended target. No bomb was found, and the members returned to the chamber a few minutes later. Mr. Florio then signed the budget documents at the Governor's Mansion in Princeton.
"I'm pleased to be able to sign a budget that keeps opportunity very much alive for the people of New Jersey," Mr Florio said, "even as a national recession threatens other states' ability to provide basic services."
The budget, agreed to by legislative leaders late Saturday night in closed-door negotiations, appeared to strike a balance between Senate and Assembly Democrats who had argued bitterly over the number of layoffs necessary to balance the budget and protect the state's bond rating.
Facing a deadline of 12:01 A.M. Monday to have a balanced budget in place, the Senate approved the budget plan earlier this evening by a vote of 22 to 18, mostly along party lines.
Earlier in the evening, the Democratic leaders of both houses also agreed to repeal a sales tax on household paper products -- a tax that had become a rallying cry to anti-tax protesters, who often went to Trenton in the last year waving rolls of toilet paper.
"The full mosaic of this budget makes the best of difficult economic conditions," said Senator Laurence S. Weiss, the chairman of the State Senate Revenue, Finance and Appropriations Committee. "This is a responsible budget that will withstand the pressure of an uncertain economy."
Even though the budget plan included layoffs, the package won the support of leaders of the state's largest public employees union, the Communications Workers of America. In recent weeks the union had voiced fiery opposition to cutting costs at the expense of their members' jobs.
The union's national vice president, Jan D. Pierce, praised the package today for not affecting the raises and other benefits promised in the union's current contract.
 
'No Layoffs,' T-Shirts Say
 "A militant and aggressive posture on the part of a union pays off," Mr. Pierce said, standing in a State House lobby amid a crowd of union members wearing red T-shirts that said "Fund the contract, no layoffs."
Under the plan, the state would fill a $1.5 billion budget shortfall with a combination of measures, including the $400 million sale of four miles of Interstate 95 in Bergen County to the New Jersey Turnpike Authority. The state would also add $620 million in revenues by speeding up the collection of utility taxes. In addition, officials said an accounting change would enable the state to receive $220 million in increased Federal reimbursement for Medicaid.
The new budget plan would give colleges and universities $48 million more in aid than originally proposed by Mr. Florio in January. A total of $4 million would be restored to the New Jersey Network, the state-run public television system. The plan also provides an increase of $5.5 million for social-services programs for people with AIDS.
But Republican legislators said they were far from sanguine about the compromise package, especially the highway sale, which they described as fiscally irresponsible.
"Instead of downsizing government, you chose instead to resort to a series of one-shot gimmicks that build in deficits for every budget year well into the 1990's," the Assembly minority leader, Garabed Haytaian, said as he faced Democratic legislators in the Assembly chamber this evening.

HEADLINE: AT THE BUDGET WALL;
Weicker Vetoes a Sales-Tax Plan, But Delays Budget Deadline a Day

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Monday, July 1

 BODY:
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. vetoed a plan by the Legislature early this morning to solve Connecticut's budget crisis without an income tax, but he postponed for 24 hours his threat to shut down a large part of the state government.
Mr. Weicker had threatened to furlough thousands of state employees and suspend all nonessential services beginning today if no budget was approved by 12:01 this morning, the start of the new fiscal year. But shortly after the midnight deadline passed, he said that progress was being made and that one more day could bring forth a budget he would sign. 
 The Governor said, however, that the no-income-tax budget passed by the Legislature Sunday night would harm the state's economy. "It was a shocking display of ignoring reality in favor of personal philosophy," he said.
Lawmakers said they were uncertain that Mr. Weicker's executive order to postpone the shutdown was enough of a legal stopgap until a full budget was in place. The Senate unanimously approved a resolution to pay the state's bills for the next two weeks, and the House adjourned at 2 A.M., with its leaders saying the resolution would probably be taken up later today.
Mr. Weicker declined to say what specific progress he saw in the negotiations. But one alternative income-tax plan, sponsored by Senator William H. Nickerson, a Republican from Greenwich, was thought to be gaining in support among lawmakers even as the non-income-tax plan -- a proposal to greatly expand the state's sales tax, applying it to many more kinds of transactions -- was being passed and vetoed.
The Nickerson plan would impose a 4.7 percent flat income tax on $25,000 for a couple filing jointly, or $12,500 for an individual, and would lower the sales tax from 8 percent to 6 percent. It was portrayed as a compromise: a lower income tax and a higher sales tax than in Mr. Weicker's proposal, which had been definitively rejected by the House of Representatives late Saturday.
Mr. Nickerson said this morning that no count had been taken as to how many votes the plan might have in either chamber.
But sponsors of the sales-tax plan vetoed by the Governor said that it might not be dead either. Deputy minority leader Richard O. Belden, a Republican from Shelton, said that if a Nickerson-type plan came up for a vote and failed, a move might be made to override the Governor's veto. The Senate, with a 24 to 12 vote on the non-income-tax plan, already apparently has the two-thirds needed to override.
The actions came on a harrowing day as officials struggled to resolve the crisis caused by a $2.8 billion gap in the $8.1 billion budget. With tempers frayed and time running short, Mr. Weicker's threats hung like a sword over every decision and closeted party caucus.
Late Sunday, after hours of wavering back and forth about what to do, legislators apparently decided to push back, announcing that they would bring up for vote the sales-tax expansion that Mr. Weicker said he hates
The Senate approved the sales-tax plan at about 11 P.M. The House had just passed the measure on an 83-to-66 vote.
But many legislators said that they knew this effort was little more than a symbolic action: in May Mr. Weicker vetoed an almost identical non-income tax plan, calling it anti-business and harmful to the poor. That veto forced the Legislature into special session and on the road that led to the frantic search for a solution at the capitol tonight.
"I don't think I knew what 'Nero fiddled while Rome burned' meant until this evening," said Representative Doreen Del Bianco, a Democrat from Waterbury who voted against the bill.
 
Gubernatorial Threats
 Mr. Weicker, a third-party independent Governor, proposed a sweeping budget overhaul and income-tax plan in February, which lawmakers grumbled about for months, finally killing it Saturday night by an 88-to-61.
The lawmakers picked up their discussion today against a backdrop of gubernatorial threats: Governor Weicker repeated his promises to veto any continuing resolution that extends negotiations into the week without a budget, and to treat the failure to pass a budget as a state emergency roughly equivalent to a natural disaster. All but essential services would be shut down.
Former House Speaker Irving J. Stolberg, a Democrat from New Haven, warned his colleages that the reputation of the entire legislative branch was at stake, and the General Assembly could live through a "generation of disdain if we end up looking like clowns."
The night-into-day-into-night bargaining sessions that began on Saturday, in the final two days of the fiscal year, were held in corridors and offices and even between offices as enthusiasts for one plan or another bent ears and gripped elbows. There were moments that revealed the stress -- House Speaker Richard J. Balducci, for example, turning from the dais to gulp Pepto-Bismal straight from the bottle.
And there were moments that showed the stifling boredom of waiting on the edge of an abyss -- as lobbyists filed into a makeshift screening room in the legislative office building to watch a rented copy of a movie, "A Fish Called Wanda," on videocassette.
Heightening the crisis atmosphere, workers out of a total of about 48,000 by Tuesday.
All state parks and beaches would be closed, for example, along with Off-Track Betting parlors and many other smaller agencies such as the Board of Parole, the Department of Housing and the Civil Air Patrol.
 
Weicker Defends a Shutdown
 Lawmakers, labor leaders and other state elected officials including the State Comptroller, William E. Curry Jr., all expressed doubts about the wisdom and savings from the shutdown, but Mr. Weicker defended it as an important measure to insure that essential state services are continued. All those employees furloughed were deemed "non-essential," according to the administration, but no estimates were available as to how much money might be saved.
The so-called conventional tax plan that lawmakers pushed forward today would extend the state's 8 percent sales tax -- already the highest statewide rate in the nation -- across a broad new spectrum of transactions, from taxi rides to parking garage fees to haircuts to boat slip rentals. It would also increase business tax collections, which Mr. Weicker had identified in May as another reason for vetoing the plan's earlier incarnation.

HEADLINE: How to Make OPEC Obsolete

BYLINE: Edward L. Morse; Edward L. Morse is publisher of Petroleum Intelligence Weekly.

 BODY:
A two-day conference between oil exporting and importing countries to find ways to stabilize the world's oil market, talked about for nearly two decades, is finally being convened in Paris today.
But with 24 countries and half a dozen international organizations invited to participate, it's likely that the meeting, dominated by conflicting individual agendas concerning oil prices, production levels and income distribution, will be a bust. 
 This is a shame. Since 1973, the oil sector has been the largest segment of international trade without any clear rules. The result has been imbalance, disruption and price shocks. Holding a large international gathering cannot change this.
What should be done instead is simple: the world's largest oil consumer and importer, the U.S., and the largest exporter, Saudi Arabia, can build a new oil regime by taking painless actions that serve both their own and global interests. And in the aftermath of the gulf war they have a remarkable opportunity to do so.
They can start by negotiating a bilateral agreement based on a concept the Saudis have already proposed by urging that "reciprocal security" should be the cornerstone of oil relations between the two countries. In return for even modest demonstrations of good will, the Saudis promised that consumer nations could gain access to a "fairly priced ocean of oil." After a war that demonstrated our good will, we should not wait any longer to pursue this.
The agreement could begin with plans for energy crisis management, building on an agreement to store Saudi oil in the U.S., both under Saudi control and also leased cheaply to the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. For the Saudis, this would be a safe and inexpensive way to store oil. It would also demonstrate the kingdom's commitment to U.S. energy security and provide a steady outlet for production.
The agreement should also guarantee the Saudis' unfettered access to the U.S. economy through exports of crude oil and refined products and capital for further investment in refining, marketing, storage and even production.
In return, the accord should grant U.S. oil companies long-term access to Saudi oil, with contracts offering American companies the equivalent of equity ownership of that oil.
Why would the Saudis reopen their oil sector? It would provide the money they need for postwar reconstruction in the region. Moreover, it would symbolize a commitment to supply oil over the long term. Though these arrangements would lead to more diversity in the Saudi industry, it need not reduce Government control. Norway, for example, has maintained such control while allowing foreign investment.
The key problem of oil instability stems from the large-scale nationalization of oil reserves in the 1970's. Since then, oil companies have lost access to long-term supplies, and need to invest and rely upon high cost oil outside of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. For their part, the big monopoly producers like Saudi Arabia, with insecure outlets, disrupt the market with their search for buyers.
Eventually, the bilateral agreement could be opened to others, with the Saudis signing similar agreements with Japan and the European Community, and the U.S. negotiating with other large exporters.
Building new international institutions would not require the dismantling of OPEC or of the International Energy Agency. Yet, it could eventually supercede both, providing the basis for a General Agreement on Petroleum and Petroleum Products, much as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade emerged from bilateral trade agreements built on reciprocity and the extension of most-favored-nation treatment to many countries.
This agreement would address short-term energy insecurity and crisis management. It would subject oil to a free market regime needed for long-term stability, providing predictable prices to the Saudis and reasonable prices to American consumers. Over time it would create a more sensible way for the world to manage its oil relationships without forcing oil exporters to give up control over their own resources.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
Mr. Justice Marshall

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

 BODY:
The year Thurgood Marshall was born, 1908, 89 black men were lynched in the United States. When he went to law school, in 1930, he could not go to the University of Maryland, in his home state, because it did not admit blacks. In the 1940's, when he traveled through the South trying cases against segregation, his life was at risk.
All that is history. Young Americans must find it hard to imagine a time when lynchings were commonplace in this country, when even border-state universities were segregated, when it was physically dangerous to challenge segregation. 
 It is history, in good part, because of Thurgood Marshall. As lawyer and judge, he did more than any other American to lift the burden of racism from our society.
To know the record is to know what courage it took, what daring. Just two years into law practice, in 1935, he sued the University of Maryland for admission of a black student to the law school. Everyone thought it was a hopeless case, but he won in the Maryland Court of Appeals. It was the first time any American court had ordered an educational institution to admit a black.
For more than 20 years, as chief counsel to the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense Fund, he went into the courtrooms of the South to fight white supremacy. He tried the issue of segregated schools in Columbia, S.C. He challenged racial zoning in Alabama, all-white Democratic Party primaries in Texas.
In all those places he had to undergo the humiliation of segregation, and the fear. Many times he was threatened. Jack Greenberg, his longtime associate and successor at the Legal Defense Fund, said: "You never knew what was going to happen. You had no security. Danger was in the atmosphere."
Justice Marshall told me, as he told others over the years, of the time he had to change trains in Mississippi. As he stood on the platform, a white man with a pistol sticking out of his pocket came up to him and said, "What are you doing here, boy?"
"I'm waiting for the next train," Justice Marshall said he replied. "The man said, 'What did you say, boy?' Then I remembered. I said, 'I'm waiting for the next train, sir.' And he said, 'You'd better be on it, because the sun's not going down on a live nigger in this town.' "
That was the reality of life in the Deep South not so long ago. It changed beyond expectation, beyond hope. There has been what amounted to a revolution, one of an extraordinary kind: a revolution under law.
Thurgood Marshall stands for the possibility of change by law. He gave those without power, white as well as black, reason to hope that the system could care for them. In a country still riven by antagonisms of race and economic inequality, that is not a small thing.
An N.A.A.C.P. member who was there when he won his first legal victory in desegregating the University of Maryland Law School, Juanita Jackson Mitchell, told Juan Williams of The Washington Post:
"We didn't know about the Constitution. He brought us the Constitution as a document like Moses brought his people the Ten Commandments."
One of Justice Marshall's burdens on the Supreme Court has been to remember the bitter past of black Americans when others seemed to want to forget. In the Bakke case in 1978 he wrote:
"The position of the Negro today in America is the tragic but inevitable consequence of centuries of unequal treatment. . . . In light of the sorry history of discrimination and its devastating impact on the lives of Negroes, bringing the Negro into the mainstream of American life should be a state interest of the highest order. To fail to do so is to ensure that America will forever remain a divided society."
Justice Marshall's retirement deprives the Supreme Court of that link with history and with reality. More than any other justice he fought comfortable abstractions. He tried to make his colleagues understand what it is like to be poor, to be weak.
He is a man without pretension, a mixture of earthiness and dignity, gruffness and tenderness. But he cannot escape being a symbol of possibility. I heard him speak years ago at the University of California in San Diego, and afterward black students came up to say a word, to touch his hand. Where will they look now?

HEADLINE: Gains at Large Law Firms Slowed Sharply Last Year

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
The nation's largest law firms suffered an unmistakable glancing blow from the economic recession last year, according to the annual financial survey by American Lawyer magazine. The survey will be published today.
Revenues for the top 100 firms totaled $13.5 billion last year, up 9 percent from 1989. That gain outstripped most segments of the economy but was a sharp decline from the 17 percent increase in 1989. The slower growth stemmed from a decline in merger and acquisition activity, the real estate slump and client resistance to fee increases. 
 "You've still got a majority of firms doing better than a year ago, which you can't say about other parts of the economy," said Steven Brill, publisher of American Lawyer.
Another survey suggests that the American Lawyer report probably errs on the rosy side. Altman Weil Pensa Inc., a consulting firm that focuses on law firms and corporate legal departments, found revenue for law firms in general grew 6 percent last year and the income of the average lawyer in private practice rose by 2 percent.
Altman, based in Newton Square, Pa., used data from 750 law firms that responded to a 22-page survey sent to more than 8,000 firms. Only a handful of them are also part of the American Lawyer survey, Altman says.
Large law firms are among the most profitable but were also hardest hit by last year's slowdown, said Thomas S. Clay, a partner at Altman. "It isn't completely linked to the economy," he added. "The bigger firms are bloated. They staffed up to maintain a growth rate that is impossible to sustain. The heyday is over."
Mr. Brill said big firms would continue to grow at a healthy clip despite the pressures to restrain fee increases. "The world -- especially the world of big business -- is getting steadily more complicated," he added.
American Lawyer's survey includes estimates to cover the performance of firms that did not respond, and the magazine will not say how many estimates are used. It said "the vast majority" of the firms ended up providing data but cautioned that some firms may have "fudged the numbers upward."
Mr. Clay said the American Lawyer figures in previous years had been off by 20 percent or more for the key financial figures at large firms that retained Altman as a consultant.
Of those on the top 100 list last year, 97 firms are still there. The top 100 range in size from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, a New York firm with revenues last year of about $503 million, to Arent, Fox, Kintner, Plotkin & Kahn in Washington, which had revenues of $67 million.
 
Most Lucrative Location
 New York, home to one-third of the top 100 firms, continues to be the most lucrative location to practice law by most measures. The city's law firms include 23 of the top 30 firms when ranked by revenue per lawyer, which is a reflection of how active they are and how much they charge.
Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, the smallest of the top 100 by size, with just 99 partners and 54 associates, led the way in revenues per lawyer, at more than $1.1 million. The firm expanded more slowly than a number of others during the 1980's and was able to find enough deal-making activity last year to stay busy, Mr. Brill said. "They simply turned away less business," he said.
New York was also home to 98 of the top 100 firms in profits per partner. Cravath, Swaine & Moore, with 284 partners and 66 associates, had a net income of $102 million on revenues of $205 million, producing operating profits per partner of more than $1.5 million. Cravath also ranked as the most profitable firm on an index American Lawyer created to measure the performance of an entire firm, including associates.
The magazine cited the firm's contingent-rate deal to represent the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in a lawsuit against Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. as a strategy more firms should pursue when faced with resistance by clients to rate increases. Under the agreement, Cravath is charging low rates initially but getting paid a handsome premium if it recovers more than $200 million in the suit against Drexel, which is defunct.
New York also reflected the impact of the recession more vividly than most cities. The city was home to 13 of the 17 firms that had stagnant or declining revenues. Cahill, Gordon & Reindel, which once counted on Drexel for as much as 25 percent of its business, saw revenues decline 11 percent, to $130 million, last year, dropping it from 26th to 37th on the top 100 list. Profits per partner dropped 28 percent.
But Cahill's experience underscored how rich many of the top 100 are. Profits per partner remained at more than $1 million, fourth on the list. Dykema Gossett, the Detroit firm that ranked lowest in profitability, still produced operating profits of $195,000 per partner.
 
Healthiest Legal Markets
 Chicago and San Francisco were the healthiest legal markets for big firms last year, the survey found. Gross revenue rose 15 percent at the 13 Chicago firms that made the list and 13 percent for the 9 San Francisco firms.
Chicago firms benefited from an increase in litigation and their heavy involvement in the activities of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Government agency charged with sorting out the affairs of savings and loans. San Francisco firms saw continuing demand for their services in the Pacific Rim countries and were more successful in raising their rates, which had been substantially lower than those in Los Angeles and New York.
The rankings provide only an approximation of the activity in any region because many firms derive substantial portions of their revenue and income from offices in other regions. For example, Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld ranked as the biggest firm in Washington by revenue, with a total of $133 million, but many of its lawyers are in Dallas.
The least specific portion of the survey tried to grade the top 100 on how much legal work they contribute to nonprofit groups and the poor, and on how many lawyers in the firm do such work. Fourteen received an A for such pro bono work, but only one of the 14, Cravath, came from the list of 10 firms with most profits per partner.
Wachtell was the only one of the most profitable firms to refuse to discuss such activity, and it received a D. The firm did not return calls from The New York Times.
"The most common reason firms give for not responding to these questions is that they don't track such activity," Mr. Brill said. "Our experience is that the only way to have an active pro bono program is to keep track of it."

Answers to Almost Any Question, for a Price

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, June 30

 BODY:
It is every Trivial Pursuit player's dream come true. How do you make a horse walk downstairs? What is the deepest point of the Mississippi River? How many movies did Alfred Hitchcock make? Call SVP for the answer.
It is also every research department's secret weapon. What is the market share of a competitor? How do debt-for-nature swaps work in Costa Rica? Has wine consumption in Japan fallen? Again, a quick call to SVP should bring the answer. 
 Started in 1935 as a service that deals rapidly with any kind of question, the Paris-based company is flourishing in a world in which instant information is more than ever a valued resource. The company says it is the leader in management consultancy by telephone. Its name derives from "s'il vous plait," meaning "please" in French.
 
More Than 1,500 Clients in U.S.
 The company says it has about 11,000 subscribers in France alone. Through its subsidiaries and affiliates abroad, it now claims an additional 11,000 clients in 23 other countries, including more than 1,500 in the United States. And keeping up with the times, its researchers now work with computers instead of depending on just memory and encylopedias.
The "trivial" questions are, of course, part of SVP's folklore. "A local newspaper once wrote that all the French needed was a little elbow grease to succeed," recalled Brigitte de Gastines, who owns and runs the company. "The next day, we were swamped with calls asking where it could be bought."
But an overwhelming majority of the million questions that SVP handles each year deal with more serious economic, business, political and cultural issues, for the simple reason that the service is only available to clients who pay $120 to $6,600 a month, depending on their needs. SVP's clients include the oil and gas company Elf Aquitaine, the auto maker Renault and the chemical producer Rhone-Poulenc, as well as the Paris newspaper Le Figaro.
Recently, offering what it calls "a global strategy of communications," SVP has diversified into direct marketing, market analysis and publishing. "We are not only interested in reinforcing our original service but also in seizing shares of other available markets," Mrs. de Gastines said.
 
26,000 Calls an Hour
 For example, with a switchboard that can handle 26,000 calls an hour, SVP often contracts out its telephone operators to radio and television programs that take calls from the public.
The expansion of SVP to a company that in 1990 made a 15 percent profit on revenues of $65 million has mainly been the work of Mrs. de Gastines, 47 years old, who became managing director after Maurice de Turkheim, her father and the company's founder, retired in 1976.
"SVP was his idea and his vocation," she said. "We have just developed it naturally, but it is still young. I have my life ahead of me. SVP has its life ahead of it."
When she took over 15 years ago, the company was only breaking even, so she introduced the new services and began looking for partners abroad. Today, Mrs. de Gastines owns all the SVP subsidiaries in Europe and Asia, although she still works with an independent American partner, Andrew Garvin, who operates the company's United States affiliate, Find/SVP Inc.
SVP owns approximately 20 percent of Find/SVP, which is based in New York and operates under a licensing agreement. The American company's revenues rose 12 percent last year, to $16 million, although it posted a $123,000 loss. Find/SVP was founded in 1969 by Mr. Garvin, who had been a reporter in Paris for Newsweek and a client of SVP. Find/ SVP says its clients include Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola and National Geographic.
Indeed, Mrs. de Gastines is turning her attention to expanding in the United States. "For me, it's a model of sorts," she said. "If I don't succeed there, I will lose all my credibility."
In France, though, SVP's credibility depends not only on providing fast and accurate responses to questions, but also on its discretion. "If a client asks for very precise information on another client, we refuse to give it," Mrs. de Gastines said. "And for that we are respected."
 
Privileged Information
 The questions, though, often give SVP privileged information. "If a textile company asks us for information on the food sector, we know there is a diversification in the air," she said. "If a big company repeatedly asks us for information about a smaller company, we know there is the possibility of an acquisition."
Beyond its 1,050 employees worldwide, including 265 researchers trained to delve into 1,800 computer information banks, the company can also tap an international network of more than 900 freelance consultants.
Yet, despite these resources, SVP acknowledges that it does not have all the answers. One client urgently needed to know the number of virgins in Patagonia, New Guinea, Argentina and Brazil. But in this case, Mrs. de Gastines recounted, he was told he would have to find out for himself.

HEADLINE: Careers;
Creating Jobs By Building Export Trade

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
THE Xport Port Authority Trading Company has a job-related mission. Operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, it helps small- and medium-sized companies to export products, with the aim not only of improving United States trade figures, but also of creating more jobs.
For example, the jobs created may be export manager and assistant at a company that never had such a department, nor could afford it, until the Xport staff helped the company get started in export markets and bolstered its sales. 
 Herbert Ouida, a lawyer and director of Xport since its inception eight years ago, has a permanent staff of 23.
"Our clients are able to establish partnerships overseas," he said last week. "We negotiate sales for the companies and finance them. In essence, we become their export managers. So far, we have generated about $150 million in sales for small companies. I estimate that we have been responsible for creating at least 3,000 manufacturing and related support jobs."
The parent, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, specializes in operating bridges and tunnels, airports, seaports, the PATH commuter railroad, and the World Trade Center, many of whose tenants are exporters. In addition, the agency has many smaller operations, including a language institute and courses in the intricacies of exports and imports.
In 1982 Congress approved a law that empowered banks, corporations and agencies like the port authority to set up world trading companies to help small- and medium-sized companies. Sears, Roebuck & Company and the General Electric Company were among those that organized trading companies.
"Xport actually started in 1984 with a staff of two, me and an assistant," Mr. Ouida said. "Many, like the Sears and General Electric trade companies, have gone out of the business," he added, explaining their failures mainly to the fact that they were not willing to make a long-term commitment.
Mr. Ouida attributes Xport's staying power not just to the money that the port authority put up but also to its approach -- no fees charged until a sale is made by the company wanting to export. "We could use our clout to open doors for small companies," he said.
Xport's staff does market research for its clients. It walks the clients through a myriad of often confusing details of export selling. "That includes building relationships overseas, handling transportation, doing documentation, arranging financing, obtaining government approvals and advising the clients on tax aspects," he said. "We also do translations."
When a sale is made, Mr. Ouida said the trading company collected a fee of 5 to 15 percent of the sales made during the basic three-year contract. "On average our fee is 7.5 percent." he said, explaining that helped to defray costs.
In addition, to his regular staff, Mr. Ouida has an intern program. The foreign interns, usually in their final years of advanced trade studies, make contacts and help handle the details.
"One young woman just arrived from Paris," Mr. Ouida said. "She is in her third year of a business program at the Ecole des Praticiens du Commerce International, and the school partly financed her."
The student, Katja Meixner, said she had already begun to work on preparations for a trade show in Toulouse. Xport hopes the show will attract the interest of companies in New York and New Jersey.
The largest source of Xport's interns is a German foundation called CDS International, which sponsors worldwide internships.
Currently Mr. Ouida has eight young business school students from western Germany working in his office for a year. They receive about $925 a month from CDS and supplement this from their own savings, since many held jobs before they went to business school.
One student, Reiner Wichman, said: "I am engaged in doing research for an apparel company named H. W. Carter & Sons that wants to sell abroad. It is a difficult market now for the apparel business."
Another intern, Thomas Weiss, is doing market research for a small company named Firesafe, which makes fire-retardant fabrics. Both are New York City companies.
"They spend about a year and I think they find it enriching," Mr. Ouida said. "It helps them make meaningful career decisions." The German interns also give Xport an ever-widening group of contacts in Europe, where Germany ranks as one of the largest trading partners with the United States.
"I was a skeptic at first," Mr. Ouida said last week about the intern program. "It works. and I am astonished."
This year Xport received a $100,000 grant from the Ford Foundation and Harvard University. "We have sent four Americans abroad as interns this summer," Mr. Ouida said. "It costs about $7,000 to send one to Japan for six to eight weeks, which is expensive, but we have three there now, one in India and a young woman in Milan." He said he wished he had the money to send more.

HEADLINE: Caterpillar Inc. Expects Losses

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PEORIA, Ill., July 1

 BODY:
Caterpillar Inc. said today that it would likely post a loss this fiscal year, its first since 1984, as a weak economy continues to cut into demand for earth- moving machines.
Caterpillar, based in Peoria, said that a loss for the year was probable and that a second- quarter loss was a virtual certainty. The company said it would release second-quarter results on July 18. 
 The world's leading maker of earth-moving equipment, Caterpillar lost $32 million in the first quarter. It made a profit of $210 million last year on sales of $11.4 billion.
Gil Nolde, a spokesman, said Caterpillar had no plans to cut its worldwide work force of 56,400.
Caterpillar said the continuing recession and economic conditions remained very weak in Brazil, a large market for Caterpillar products.
Mr. Nolde said Caterpillar's economists generally agreed with Government experts that the recession appeared to have bottomed out.
Nevertheless, "we have seen absolutely no impact on our sales," he said.

HEADLINE: Retirees' Plight in Bankruptcies

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
Connie Patterson, who worked 35 years for Eastern Airlines as a flight attendant, has Parkinson's disease and spends $95 a month on medicine, in addition to the costs of visits to the doctor.
Miss Patterson can handle those costs for now because of the group health insurance provided through Eastern. But with the bankrupt airline undergoing liquidation, those benefits may not last much longer. And the disease will become more debilitating. "This condition can only get worse," she said. 
 She and 10,000 other Eastern retirees are at the center of an increasingly common situation as more and bigger companies file for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code. Many companies are seeking to end or cut back benefits because they have not put away money to finance the plans in case of a business failure. Another company that has reduced benefits is the Bicoastal Corporation, formerly the Singer Company.
 
Issue Raised by LTV Case
 So far the courts have avoided defining legally how long bankrupt companies should be financially responsible for providing medical benefits and have instead pushed for out-of-court compromises. Cutting back on health benefits did not become a major issue until the LTV Corporation sought protection in bankruptcy court in 1986 and requested reductions in the benefits of 78,000 employees.
Many of the former employees of these companies cannot afford the cost of private insurance plans and many plans will not accept retirees with serious illnesses.
Thus the bankruptcy courts have become a major battleground between retirees and those in charge of companies seeking to liquidate or re organize under the bankruptcy codes.
Many like Miss Patterson face having their health insurance cut off before they reach 65 and become eligible for Medicare. She is single, 60 years old and earns about $2,000 a month from a part-time job and Social Security.
For the next six months most of her benefits will probably continue but she and the other Eastern retirees worry about what will happen after that.
Judge Burton R. Lifland, chief judge of the Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, put pressure on both sides to work out a compromise last month that will guarantee the benefits for another six months, although Eastern workers will have to pay part of the cost of $75 a month.
But the two sides in the dispute are arguing whether Eastern is complying with the court order. Some of the lawyers representing the retirees charge that the carrier is reneging on its agreement and that benefits could be cut.
Eastern's lawyers said that they were seeking a workable plan but had been blocked by the retirees' lawyers.
The judge was moved by the retirees' argument that unlike other creditors in the case their health and possibly their lives were at stake if their health benefits were suspended.
One of those who testified in an affidavit, Jean E. Rae, who was the chief agent in baggage service for the airline for 28 years, has had open-heart surgery and a kidney transplant.
Her medicine to counter her body's rejection mechanisms costs about $350 a month. She has been able to offset some of her bills by working part time but such jobs do not provide medical insurance.
 
Can't Buy Insurance
 Attempts to get insurance herself have been fruitless. "Most insurance companies don't take people with pre-existing conditions," she said. "That's all there is to it."
One of the central issues in the case is whether her plight is graver than that of thousands of workers who lost their jobs at Eastern, some of whom are still struggling financially while some have become homeless.
The retirees' lawyers are pressing their argument that retirees who face the loss of medical benefits should be placed above other groups in a bankruptcy case.
Cessation of health insurance, they argue, could leave them without proper treatment for illness and in some cases increase their risk of death.
Robert S. Clayman of the Washington law firm of Guerrieri, Edmond & James, who represented the machinists' union in the Eastern case, said at a hearing before Judge Lifland in May that such large and financially strong creditors as Boeing, Airbus Industrie, United Technologies and General Electric could better absorb the losses from the Chapter 11 filing than people like Miss Patterson.
Mr. Clayman maintains that the needs of these people are greater than other creditors. "Equity has to be tempered by mercy," he said.
What will happen in six months is uncertain since the amount left in the airline may be enough just to pay for its liquidation.
The company is continuing to pay salaries for a skeleton staff and is maintaining airplanes and other facilities that it is trying to sell. The cost of liquidation is expected to run in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
The retirees' lawyers have also argued that employers have generally assured workers that their benefits would be for life, although most employers have retained the right to modify medical plans.
In the case of the reorganization of Bicoastal, Alexander Paskay, chief judge of the United States Bankruptcy Court in Tampa, Fla., refused to allow severe cuts in the medical benefits for 15,000 retirees. Instead he pushed the two sides to come up with a settlement.
 
Retirees Pay $50 a Month
 After months of bargaining, a plan was worked out under which retirees under 65 contribute $50 a month to keep most of their benefits.
Jerome Tauber, a lawyer representing the retirees, said that the $50 monthly fee would be a burden on some retirees but "considering the current climate it was a pretty good deal."
Those like Martin R. Shugrue Jr. of Eastern who find themselves having to defend the cuts in benefits argue that they are caught in the middle.
Mr. Shugrue, the trustee appointed by the court to run Eastern, and whose job is to liquidate the company, must try to satisfy creditors' claims. He said he sympathized with the retirees, but that the issue was complex.
Of the $2.4 billion in claims on Eastern, Mr. Shugrue said, more than $1 billion come from other Eastern employees for severance and back pay and the like. Many of the same employees are also individual bondholders who face losses.
Even the larger unsecured creditors like airplane, engine manufacturers and banks will probably end up with nothing.
Bruce Zirinsky, an Eastern lawyer, said that 30,000 workers had lost their jobs since Eastern filed for Chapter 11 in March 1989. Some are still without jobs and have run out of unemployment insurance.
Thus, he said, it was not simply the retirees versus large creditors but the retirees versus other employees, some of whom are also undergoing hardship.
By agreeing on a short-term solution both sides did not have to tackle the implications of a law passed by Congress in June 1988 called the Retiree Benefits Bankruptcy Protection Act. The law was enacted after LTV filed for bankruptcy protection and sought to cut off medical benefits involving a large number of employees.
The law provides that benefits can be cut only after a judge has determined that "the affected parties are treated fairly and equitably."
Judge Lifland, who decided to seek a compromise not using that law as a guide, succeeded in getting lawyers for 60 percent of the retirees to accept the six-month accord. The judge ordered the other 40 percent, who declined to join the compromise, to be put under the same plan.
Judge Lifland will hear new arguments at the end of the six months. The task facing him then will be to define what is equitable.

New President Named At Bell Laboratories

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
John S. Mayo, a veteran designer of advanced communications and computer systems, was chosen yesterday as the seventh president of A.T.& T. Bell Laboratories since the research center was founded in 1925 as part of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company.
Dr. Mayo, who is currently senior vice president for Network Systems and Network Services at Bell Laboratories, will replace Ian M. Ross, who has been president since 1979. 
Dr. Ross, 63, had been planning to retire in mid-1992. He has been appointed to a new position to help develop A.T.& T.'s global businesses. He will work with A.T.& T.'s vice chairman, Randall Tobias, who last week was put in charge of the company's global business initiatives. Dr. Ross will be president emeritus of Bell Labs, in Murray Hill, N.J.
Dr. Mayo, who is 61, will become a member of A.T.& T.'s Management Executive Committee. He said he would pursue two goals in his new posts: to strengthen the ability of Bell Labs to deliver basic scientific innovations and to shorten the time it takes to get these innovations to market.
"My passion is that we do something for our customers and society that allows them to prosper and improves the quality of life," he said.
Bell Laboratories has been strengthened in terms of both resources and number of employees since the divestiture by A.T. &T. of the regional Bell operating companies in 1984, Dr. Mayo said. Financial support for the laboratories has risen from $2 billion in 1982 to $3 billion now, and employment has increased from 16,000, to 30,000.
Dr. Mayo began his career with Bell Labs in 1955, working on the design of the first transistorized digital computer, a military development project named Tradic. Later, he worked on another early experimental programmable computer named Leprechaun.
His research included contributions to the digitization of national and global telecommunications networks. He also contributed to the Telstar communications satellite program, the development of electronic systems for ocean sonar and the development of the world's first long-distance digital switching system.
At Bell Labs, he has been director of the Ocean Systems Laboratory, executive director of the Ocean Systems division, executive director of the Toll Electronic Switching division and vice president of Electronics Technology.
Dr. Mayo holds B.S., M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from North Carolina State University. Last year, he received the National Medal of Technology award from President Bush.

HEADLINE: Ethiopian Factions Seek Broad Coalition

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia, July 1

 BODY:
Ethiopian political factions gathered here today to try to form a provisional government that would represent the country's first step toward democracy after 30 years of civil war and a century of imperial-style rule.
Meles Zenawi, the rebel leader whose group took control in the capital after the fall of the Marxist-Leninist Government of Lieut. Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam inMay, said efforts had been made to include "most sectors of society" at the meeting. But he conceded that not everyone would be happy with the representation. 
 At the opening of the conference in Africa Hall, the usual forum of the Organization of African Unity, some of the groups in attendance voiced early reservations at what they said were prearranged quotas for representation in the provisional government.
 
A Destitute Nation
 But Mr. Meles who leads the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front, urged the meeting to resolve its differences quickly so that a provisional government could get on with resolving the problems of a country left destitute by war, drought and a Communist-run economy.
The conference was called as part of an agreement reached with the United States at talks in London in May. Washington blessed the coming to power of Mr. Meles's group, which is dominated by forces from Tigre Province, but insisted the group move to organize a broad-based provisional government by July 1. The United States said it would not offer any economic aid unless the new government was made more representative of Ethiopia's varied ethnic groups.
The conference is supposed to form a provisional government that will pave the way for elections within 12 months. The United States has said that it also expects the conference to embrace a charter committing the government to uphold human rights and allow freedom of the press.
The American Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Herman J. Cohen, attended the conference today as an observer, along with representatives from the Soviet Union and the European Community.
 
Eritrean Leader an Observer
 Also present was Isaias Afwerki, the leader of the separatist guerrilla organization now in control of Eritrea Province. Apparently to emphasize that Eritrea was not part of Ethiopia. Mr. Isaias sat in the gallery reserved for observers rather than on the conference floor with participants.
His group, Eritrean People's Liberation Front, fought against the Mengistu Government in a loose alliance with Mr. Meles's group, and has won an agreement for a referendum on independence for the province. Mr. Isaias has said he will seek a United Nations referendum on the independence of Eritrea within two years, a position that the United States said last month it supported.
Many of the people on the conference floor were rebel leaders who, because of their armed opposition to the Mengistu regime, had been banned from Addis Ababa for more than a decade.

Dollar Soars on Expectation U.S. Rates Will Hold Firm

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose sharply yesterday as the outlook for firm United States interest rates brightened and the Bank of Japan lowered that country's discount rate.
Analysts said the dollar was also helped by a report from the National Association of Purchasing Management that the June survey of its members showed the United States manufacturing sector had ended a yearlong decline. 
 With such signs that economic growth is resuming, interest rates are likely to remain stable or rise. Higher interest rates support the dollar by raising foreign demand for American investments.
The drop in the Japanese discount rate, to 5.5 percent from 6 percent, helped the dollar by making American interest rates more competitive.
Walter Simon, a vice president at Bank Julius Baer & Company in New York, said a big rally on Wall Street also drove the dollar higher. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 51.66, to 2,958.41, also advancing on the purchasing managers' report and the Japanese rate decline.
Mr. Simon said the Japanese move was a signal that the Group of Seven industrialized nations "aren't as concerned with the levels of the dollar; they're concerned with their own individual domestic situation."
Finance ministers of the Group of Seven met last month but did not take a strong stand against the dollar's surge in recent months. The seven nations are the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Canada and Italy.
Overseas dealers said the dollar also gained on worries about political turmoil in Yugoslavia and fears that tighter German tax policies could hurt the mark.
The dollar rose 1.65 pfennigs against the mark in New York, closing at 1.8280 marks, up from 1.8115 late Friday. In earlier European trading, the dollar rose to 1.8220 marks, from 1.8135.
The dollar also gained nearly 1 yen in New York, rising to 138.42 yen, from 137.525 yen late Friday. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar fell to a closing 137.14 Japanese yen, from 138.15 yen at Friday's close. It was higher in London, at 138.40 yen.
The British pound fell to $1.6095 in New York, from $1.62175. In London earlier, sterling fell to $1.6135, from $1.6185 late Friday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's, included: 1.5652 Swiss francs, up from 1.5525; 6.1920 French francs, up from 6.1380; 1,358.00 Italian lire, up from 1,346.25, and 1.14285 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1418.
Gold prices inched higher in New York after falling overseas. On the Commodity Exchange, gold rose 10 cents, to $368.20 an ounce. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid of $368, unchanged from Friday.
Gold fell in London to a late bid of $369, from $369.25 late Friday. In Zurich, gold's closing bid was $368.25, down from $368.40 Friday.

HEADLINE: Fed Clears Deal for Bank of New England

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 1

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve Board today dismissed objections by the Justice Department, Maine and community organizers, and approved without any conditions the proposed acquisition of the Bank of New England and two affiliated banks by the Fleet/Norstar Financial Group Inc.
By a 3-to-2 vote, the governors found that the merger would not create antitrust problems in several markets in Maine and Connecticut. The board also unanimously rejected arguments by community-improvement groups that had sought a hearing to determine whether Fleet/Norstar had complied with Federal laws requiring banks to make loans to low-income communities. 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation picked Fleet in April as the winning bidder to buy the Bank of New England and two affiliated banks -- the Maine National Bank and the Connecticut Bank and Trust Company. The three banks were seized by regulators in January after being declared insolvent and are expected to be among the most expensive bank failures in history, costing taxpayers more than $2.5 billion.
 
Antitrust Concerns Raised
 Lawyers at the Justice Department and the Maine Attorney General's office had challenged the deal on antitrust grounds because the banks involved have such a large presence in several cities in Connecticut and Maine.
Fleet is already the largest bank in Maine, holding about 21.8 percent, or $2.9 billion, in deposits. The Maine National Bank is the sixth largest in the state, controlling 7.2 percent, or about $1 billion, in deposits.
In Connecticut, Fleet is the eighth-largest bank, holding $1.8 billion, or 2.8 percent, in deposits in the state. Connecticut Bank and Trust is the second-largest bank, holding $6.9 billion, or 10.5 percent, in deposits.
Two board governors, Wayne D. Angell and Edward W. Kelley Jr., dissented in today's decision, saying the acquisition would have "serious anticompetitive effects" in three sections of Maine and Connecticut. They said they would have required Fleet/Norstar to sell branches in Bangor and Pittsfield, Me., and Willimantic, Conn., to avoid what they said would be "a significantly adverse effect on competition."
Officials at the Justice Department and the Maine Attorney General's office said today that they had not decided whether to appeal the decision by seeking an injunction to delay the proposed acquisition.
In dismissing the arguments by the Justice Department and the Maine Attorney General, two members of the Fed, the chairman, Alan Greenspan, and John P. LaWare, said the Government lawyers had failed to include the competition afforded by "thrift institutions." David W. Mullins Jr. was the third board governor to vote with the majority.
 
Abusive Practices Charged
 Community groups said Fleet had not made enough loans in lower-income areas. They also asserted that a mortgage subsidiary, Fleet Finance Inc., had engaged in abusive practices by charging borrowers inflated interest rates and high loan fees, even though the borrowers did not have enough income to repay the loans.
Those charges are being examined by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and the Federal Trade Commission. The Fed said it had decided not to await the outcome of that study.
With much fanfare, Fleet announced last week what it said would be an $11 million plan to aid low-income and minority homeowners. That plan was cited today by the Fed as evidence of the bank's commitment to low-income customers.

HEADLINE: British Steel Profit Off 66%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LONDON, July 1

 BODY:
British Steel P.L.C. said today that its profit sank 66 percent in the year ended March 30 because of the British recession and intense competition in Europe.
British Steel reported net profit of 193 million, or about $311 million, for the year, compared with 564 million, or $907 million, in the previous year. Sales fell 1.4 percent, to $8.1 billion. 
 The company said it took a one-time charge to carry out cost-cutting measures. British Steel, which employs 51,500 people, trimmed 2,000 jobs in the latest year and plans to continue to reduce its costs, a spokesman said.
The company said an oversupply of steel in Europe, along with the recession in the United States, led to lower prices and increased competition in the European Community.
Sir Robert Scholey, British Steel's chairman, said any upturn would be steady rather than dramatic and "the prudent view is to assume that the current depressed conditions will persist for a longer rather than a shorter period."

HEADLINE: Close of Canada Paper Mill By End of Year Is Planned

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Most of a Canadian paper mill owned by a joint venture of the Kimberly-Clark Corporation and The New York Times Company will be shut down by the end of the year. The decision follows the failure last week of the companies, the province of Ontario and an employee-led group to agree on a way to keep the enterprise going with more modest cuts.
The joint venture, the Spruce Falls Power and Paper Company, was formed more than 60 years ago by the two American companies and is the major employer in the remote Kapuskasing region, some 500 miles north of Toronto. It employs 1,450 people, of whom all but 250 will be laid off. 
 "We are facing utter devastation," said Theodore K. Jewell, Kapuskasing's mayor and spokesman for the employee-led group.
 
Dividend of Over $100 Million
 An agreement would have involved selling the Spruce Falls power plant at Smoky Falls to state-owned Ontario Hydro and then giving the mill, which is 50 miles to the south in Kapuskasing, to the employee group. The sale of the power plant would have paid a dividend of more than $100 million after taxes and guaranteed the mill 80 years of power, valued at $300 million.
Kimberly-Clark and the Times Company had also agreed to put some of their dividend from the sale into a $40 million loan at low interest rates as part of a business plan that was to have included millions of dollars in contributions from the employees and Kapuskasing, changes in union rules, and various benefits from the province.
The sticking point was the requirement by Kimberly-Clark that the deal be completed by Sunday, many years before Ontario expected to complete a proposed environmental review of how the power plant could be enlarged and made part of a plan involving numerous other hydroelectric sites in the vast wilderness south of Hudson Bay.
 
Deadline Set in March
 Darwin Smith, the chairman and chief executive of Kimberly-Clark, set the deadline in March, saying the precarious competitive position of Spruce Falls would weaken rapidly if its future was left unsettled beyond this year. Kimberly-Clark owns 50.1 percent of the joint venture and represented the American companies throughout the negotiations.
Provincial officials pushed Kimberly-Clark and the Times Company to agree to accept a smaller dividend from the sale of the power plant in the event that the environmental review eventually concluded that Ontario Hydro was barred from enlarging the dam and power plant. The officials characterized their proposal as sharing the environmental risk.
Mr. Smith, with the backing of the Times Company, refused, saying the proposal amounted to taking on risks the companies did not have because Spruce Falls had no plans to enlarge the power plant.
"We thought our offer was more than generous," Mr. Smith said yesterday.
 
Sale of Company Planned
 The employee takeover of the mill would have led to a gradual elimination of about one-third of the 1,450 employees of Spruce Falls. Instead, the company will lay off 1,200 of the employees over the next few months and eliminate about 240,000 tons of its 350,000-ton capacity. Once the cuts are complete and profitability has been restored, Kimberly-Clark and the Times Company plan to sell the company.
Both Kimberly-Clark and the Times Company have already taken write-offs to cover the costs of disposing of Spruce Falls. Kimberly-Clark took a $44 million after-tax charge against earnings last year. And the Times Company took a $27 million charge against earnings in 1989 to cover a number of one-time costs in its forest products division, including plans to dispose of Spruce Falls.
Mayor Jewell said he hoped to persuade Ontario's Premier, Bob Rae, to pursue an earlier offer from Mr. Smith to sell all of the assets of Spruce Falls for $150 million. Mr. Smith said yesterday that he had no intention of pursuing further negotiations until the downsizing was completed. Yesterday was a national holiday in Canada and province officials could not be reached for comment.

Interest Rates, The Real Ones

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
SINCE the spring of 1989, the American economy has grown either weakly or not at all. And all through this period, what economists call real interest rates -- the difference between interest rates on borrowed money and the inflation rate -- have remained high. High real rates are usually seen as a threat to economic activity and an obstacle to a strong recovery after recession.
Such concerns are justified, most economists say. The real test of the impact of interest rates is their level in relation to the inflation rate. The closer the two rates are to each other, the greater the likelihood that salaries and prices will rise sufficiently to offset the cost of a loan. Sometimes interest rates on loans can be falling, but if the inflation rate is falling even faster, the real cost of the loan rises. 
 Economists typically arrive at real rates by looking at the rates on such things as car loans, mortgages, and Treasury bills and notes, and then subtracting the expected inflation rate. But like so many generalizations in economics, the broad rules about real interest rates fail to adequately reflect their actual impact on individuals. As Albert Wojnilower, a senior economist at First Boston Asset Management, puts it, "People have to look at their own personal rate of inflation in income and expenses to know what real rates mean to them."
A home buyer who takes a $100,000 mortgage at a cost of 9 percent annually, for example, is hurt if his $100,000 income rises by only 3 percent in the first year of the mortgage. The salary increase is the home buyer's personal rate of inflation in determining the mortgage's real cost. In this case, the rise in salary covers only $3,000 of the $9,000 interest payment. The buyer's initial real interest rate, then, is 6 percent, and he has to draw from savings, or reduce other expenditures, to cover the cost.
Many Americans are in this fix, which helps to explain why home sales are not booming. Similarly, real rates are high on most auto loans and on credit-card debt.
Or take a clothing store owner who borrows $100,000 at 8.5 percent to stock shirts and pants for the coming year. If he can mark up this merchandise by at least 8.5 percent, or $8,500, then the real interst rate on his loan is zero. But if, like many retailers today, he is forced by weak demand to discount his wares, selling them finally for only the $100,000 purchase price, then the real interest rate on the money he borrowed is high: 8.5 percent.
Such high real costs help to explain why many businessmen are not yet rushing to build up inventories as the recession appears to be ending. High real rates also help to explain why the construction boom of the 1980's collapsed. The rents from all the new hotels, offices and shopping centers were not growing fast enough to pay the interest on the loans borrowed to build them.
"The Donald Trump story is the story of a financial genius done in by high real rates," said Nicholas Sargen, a Salomon Brothers economist.
There are, of course, many winners. Americans who invest their savings in, say, one-year Treasury bills at the current 6.3 percent rate are ahead of the game. That's because the inflation rate is expected to be about 4.5 percent over the next 12 months, according to various surveys, including those conducted by the University of Michigan's Survey Research Center. So the real rate of return for bill holders is 1.8 percent, representing the earnings from interest after deducting the impact of inflation. Inflation, in effect, reduces savings by 4.5 percent while they are tied up in Treasury bills.
David W. Mullins Jr., vice chairman-designate of the Federal Reserve, says that the 10-year Treasury note is commonly used as a guide to rates. For inflation expectations, he and others cite various estimates, including a poll of portfolio managers conducted periodically by Richard B. Hoey, a Wall Street economist. The nominal rate on 10-year notes is about 8.25 percent. The expected inflation over that period is roughly 4.25 percent, according to the Hoey poll, so the real rate is about 4 percent.
Two things are striking about real rates on the one-year Treasury bill and the 10-year note, both representative of incomes from savings and outlays for loans. One is that the real rates are nearly as high today as they were in July 1990, when the recession started, suggesting that the Federal Reserve's efforts to lower nominal interest rates have barely reduced the true cost of borrowing.
The other is that these real rates, although affected by changing tax laws, have been much higher on average over the past decade than in any decade since the 1920's. Various explanations are offered for this phenomenon, each of them subject to much dispute. But one thing is clear: the nation's creditors, the people wealthy enough to lend out more than they borrow, are doing far better than the net borrowers. High real interest rates in the past decade have widened this gap.
"When you talk about a declining standard of living for many Americans, this is one of the dimensions of it," Mr. Wojnilower said.

Treasury Prices Fall After Report

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
A survey indicating that the nation's manufacturing sector expanded during June, the first such rise in a year, helped to push down prices of Treasury notes and bonds yesterday.
The report came as a surprise to most credit market participants and analysts, who had expected that the survey of the nation's purchasing managers would show that activity remained weak to sluggish, at best. 
 Those expectations were not borne out, as the survey's business activity index jumped to 50.9 percent, from 45.4 percent in May.
The increase in the index carried it past the point at which the National Association of Purchasing Management, the group that compiles the monthly reading, says the nation's manufacturing economy begins to expand. It was the highest level since April 1989, when the index stood at 52.1 percent.
 
'Strongest Confirmation Yet'
 "The numbers were the strongest confirmation yet that recovery is under way, and may be spreading into the manufacturing sector," said Stuart G. Hoffman, a senior vice president and chief economist at the PNC Financial Corporation in Pittsburgh. "And I would imagine that autos and auto-related industries are an important contributor to this recovery in manufacturing."
Prices of Treasury securities dipped immediately after the purchasing managers' report was released. But a further drop in the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 leading spot commodity prices, an inflation indicator that has been attempting to break a five-year low recently, helped to limit the price slide.
"With commodity prices down it is hard for the market to totally collapse," one trader in government bonds said. "But the purchasing managers' news was not good. It is the fourth straight month that the index has gone up. It has really changed the way people had been thinking about the economy."
 
Japanese Move Was Expected
 Traders and analysts said a decision by the Bank of Japan to lower its discount rate had been expected for weeks, if not months. Therefore yeterday's rate cut, to 5.5 percent from 6 percent, had no impact on activity in American financial markets.
"After a very strong first quarter, the Japanese economy is slowing down fast, and money supply growth has been very weak," said Joseph Liro, a senior vice president and money market economist at S.G. Warburg & Company. "Our market has been looking for a Japanese rate cut since the spring."
A rise in stock prices and the contents of the purchasing managers' report helped to push up interest rates on outstanding short-term Treasury bills. But the day's developments had little impact on bids for new three-month and six-month bills sold at the Treasury's weekly auction.
At the auction, three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 5.59 percent, compared with an average rate of 5.58 percent at last week's sale.
 
Six-Month Rate Down
 Meanwhile, bids on the new six-month securities produced an average discount rate of 5.71 percent, down from an average rate of 5.76 percent at the auction a week ago.
In the secondary market for Treasury issues, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered in late trading at a price of 96 21/32, down by 6/32, to yield 8.43 percent, compared with 8.40 percent late Friday.
Among note issues, the 8 percent 10-year notes were offered at a price of 98 11/32, down 5/32, to yield 8.24 percent. And the 7 percent two-year notes were offerd at 100 3/32, down by 3/32, to yield 6.94 percent.
In the Treasury bill market, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.56 percent, up two basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by a similar amount, to a late offered rate of 5.69 percent.
 
US West Notes Priced
 In the investment-grade corporate bond market, U S West Financial Systems priced $100 million worth of two-year notes through an underwriting group led by Salomon Brothers.
The 7.5 percent securities, which mature July 15, 1993, were priced at $100, or par, 58 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 percent two-year notes at the time of pricing.
The issue is rated A-2 by Moody's Investors Service and A+ by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Participants in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds said that prices of most issues were unchanged on the day.
 
New York Bids Improve
 The apparent resolution of New York City's budget crisis was only barely visible in the tax-exempt municipal bond market yesterday. Traders said that bids on some outstanding New York City bonds improved by about three-eighths of a point, but that few securities changed hands.
Traders said that prices of most tax-exempt issues were unchanged to up about an eighth of a point in very light trading.
Signs of an economic recovery may be building, but the recession took its toll on corporate and municipal debt ratings in the first half of 1991. In a report released yesterday, Standard & Poor's said that corporate and muincipal credit quality continued to deteriorate in the first six months of the year.
From January through June Standard & Poor's downgraded a record $408 billion worth of outstanding corporate debt, only $100 billion less than the agency downgraded for all of 1990. During the first six months, S.& P. downgraded almost five times as many corporate issues as it upgraded.
 
More Downgrading Expected
 Leo C. O'Neill, president and chief rating officer at Standard & Poor's, said the number of rating downgrades was likely to exceed the number of upgrades through the balance of the year and "probably" well into 1992.
Total dollar volume of municipal bond downgrades was $11.6 billion during the first half of the year, roughly unchanged for the same period a year ago, Standard & Poor's said.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: Fed Feels Left Out;
2 Vacancies and Chief's Term Is Up, But Washington Pays Little Attention

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 1

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers will hold one of their most important meetings of the year here Tuesday with two seats on its board vacant and Alan Greenspan's future as chairman at least officially in limbo.
 Fed officials say that the vacancies and the uncertainty over whether Mr. Greenspan will be given another four-year term are no more than inconveniences and that they will have no problem on Tuesday agreeing on a target range for the growth of money supply over the next six months. 
 Maybe so. But when pressed, the officials concede that they wish the White House and Congress would pay a bit more attention to the Fed, the agency of the Government with the most influence over the economy.
"I don't know whether it's that they're not interested in us or that they just don't want to have anything to do with monetary policy," said one staff assistant.
The decisions on monetary policy made in secret Tuesday will be announced July 16 when Mr. Greenspan testifies before a subcommittee of the House Banking Committee. If the Fed lowers the target range for growth in money supply, currently 2 1/2 percent to 6 1/2 percent, that will be seen as a renewed commitment to fight inflation. If, on the other hand, the target is raised or even left as is, the markets will probably take that as a signal that the Fed is encouraging a strong recovery from the recession.
Mr. Greenspan's term expires Aug. 11. It is widely assumed throughout the capital and on Wall Street that he will be reappointed, but no word has come from the White House.
 
Awaiting Better Times
 Why not? One theory is that President Bush wants to give the economy as much time as possible to improve before renominating Mr. Greenspan. If the recession is unequivocally over when the Senate holds confirmation hearings, according to this line of thought, the Government's economic policy will not be subject to such intense scrutiny.
Another view is that the decision cannot be made without the participation of John H. Sununu, but the President's chief of staff has been distracted by ethical questions.
Only four or five people know for sure what is going on -- Mr. Bush, Mr. Sununu, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and probably Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and Richard G. Darman, the budget director -- and they will not say.
Mr. Boskin and Mr. Brady have maintained publicly that Mr. Greenspan has kept interest rates too high. But they are known to think highly of the Fed chairman and are believed to want him reappointed. Still, a top official at the Treasury said last week that Mr. Brady had not even discussed the matter with his staff.
Mr. Sununu's position is less clear, but White House officials say that if Mr. Brady and Mr. Sununu are at odds on this issue, the President will almost certainly side with his Treasury Secretary.
Rumors travel fast in Washington and on Wall Street, and when Vernon A. Walters announced last week that he was resigning as Ambassador to Germany, word spread that the Administration was creating a graceful way for Mr. Greenspan to be eased out of the Fed. After all, the reasoning went, Germany is a plum assignment, and Arthur F. Burns was given that post in the Carter Administration after he left the Fed chairmanship.
But Administration officials now say Robert M. Kimmitt, the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, will get the post.
Despite the Fed's importance to the economy and despite politicians' occasional statements about interest rates, the simple truth may be that people in political circles pay little attention to the Fed. Mr. Bush prefers focusing on foreign affairs. Mr. Sununu has been preoccupied with his traveling travails. Mr. Brady has been busy promoting the Administration's banking legislation.
 
Two Empty Seats
 If they were going to select someone else to be chairman of the Fed, the White House would have had to act by now. Otherwise, after Aug. 11, the agency would be without a chairman or Mr. Greenspan would be in the awkward position of being a lame duck. But if Mr. Greenspan is going to get another term, it makes no difference if he has not been officially confirmed when this term expires.
The politicians' lack of attention to the Fed is clearly the main reason the two vacancies remain on the seven-member board. Manuel H. Johnson resigned last August. He had been vice chairman of the board.
In January, more than five months later, Mr. Bush nominated David W. Mullins Jr., already on the board, to the vice chairmanship, and named Lawrence B. Lindsey, a White House economist, to the vacant seat. The Senate Banking Committee did not hold hearings on Mr. Lindsey's nomination until May and on Mr. Mullins's until last month. And while their confirmation is assured, the panel has not held a meeting to vote.
Asked last week why the long process, Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan, the Democrat who heads the committee, said, "We've just been absolutely swamped."
In January, Martha R. Seger announced that she planned to leave the board, and she resigned in March. By early May, the Administration had settled on Susan M. Phillips, a former chairwoman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to fill the vacancy. But the nomination still has not been announced.
 
An Increased Workload
 The Fed has functioned quite well short-handed, its officials say, but the remaining five governors have had to double up on some assignments. For example, no governor has been concentrating on international finance for the last year. That had been Mr. Johnson's specialty.
None of this should, however, put a damper on Mr. Greenspan's annual Fourth of July party for political and financial figures and Fed reporters. He holds it in the penthouse ballroom of one of the Fed's office buildings, with one of the city's best views of the fireworks. All this gossip is sure to be hashed out there.

HEADLINE: Our Towns

BYLINE: By Andrew H. Malcolm

DATELINE: RIDGEFIELD PARK, N.J.

 BODY:
When Rick DePollo touches a sizzling flare to the first fuse out in the dark end of Veterans Park here at dusk Thursday, he will have one second to duck. Then will come that familiar "THUNK" as a four-pound packet of powder vaults into the holiday sky. Two seconds later, 600 feet overhead, the sudden explosion will ignite the crowd's excitement.
In good times and bad times, blowing up colorful gunpowder in the Fourth of July sky and "oohing" and
"aahing" together in a chorus of strangers united for a few thrilling minutes have become a familiar, comforting ritual across the land. Economically, this is not one of the good times in older blue-collar communities like Ridgefield Park. So the Town Council voted to chop the $23,000 fireworks expense from the municipal budget. 
 What happened then, as it has in many towns this year, illustrates how important seemingly silly civic rituals can be to a community's sense of routine and identity.
Explosive extravaganzas are not new in American history. So important were fireworks on both sides of the War of 1812, for instance, that the British stopped the fighting to lend gunpowder to the enemy Americans clustered in Calais, Me., so they could have a proper Fourth of July celebration.
Like many suburban residents in these days of budget stringencies, the 12,500 citizens of Ridgefield Park must survive with fewer pickups of garbage and recyclables, among other things. But so important is the summer rite of sitting on blankets while startled babies cry and famished mosquitoes dine that this year, Ridgefield Park residents will buy tickets for this privilege. As might be expected, the solution grew from the work of another of those special committees that suburbanites instinctively create when they want something done quickly.
"To some people," said Chuck DeLuca, chairman of the special Fourth of July subcommittee, "some of these budget cuts can seem trivial -- a park here, a playground there, a parade now and then, and July Fourth fireworks. But they are a part of a community's personality. If you lose that familiar fabric, you're not a community anymore. You're just a collection of people who happen to live in the same place."
Mr. DeLuca says he married into Ridgefield Park. A Lodi native, he was admitted after exchanging vows with his fiancee, Barbara. He fell in love with Fourth of July celebrations here, which begin with a cannon shot down Euclid Avenue at 7:45 A.M. All day there are parades of babies, bicycles and bands on Main and other streets. There are burgers, hot dogs and ice cream. There are screaming fire engines and unobtrusive judges with the dubious, delicate distinction of picking the best floats.
Three generations of DeLucas have worked on the family float for weeks now out in the garage with the windows papered over. And not by chance, the DeLucas's residence overlooks the parade route. "I have such good memories about the Fourth," says Mr. DeLuca, "and I wanted my kids to have them, too."
Which is why the fireworks' demise hit so hard. The DeLucas protested, nearly alone, at a March Council meeting. They got little response. So they packed the next meeting with fireworks supporters.
The resulting fireworks subcommittee set to work. Members wrote every business in town, all 325 of them. That produced $2,000 in donations. They studied what other towns in similar straits had done and settled on selling tickets. With promises of a share of the gate plus a chance to solicit donations from the anticipated crowd of 10,000-plus, the subcommittee enlisted the aid of clubs with their own fund-raising needs. So the junior football and soccer clubs will run the park gates with the Boy Scouts. Others take turns selling $2 tickets at the Municipal Building from 9 to 5 and 6 to 8. (At the gate, a ticket will set you back $3.)
By 8 P.M. Thursday, the boring official speeches will be over at Veterans Park, where the Little League and the Ridgefield Park Scarlets do regular athletic combat. The food stalls will be bustling. The grandstands will be full by then and the blankets will blanket the grass and base lines.
The Harrison Bushwackers, a drum and bugle corps, will entertain the growing throng. And then, about 9:30, it will happen once again. Within 30 minutes Rick DePollo will send several hundred packets of gunpowder flying into the New Jersey sky.
Sitting there on the grass, Barb and Chuck DeLuca will be holding their daughters. This will be Michelle's fourth Fourth. Glimpsed in the staccato flashes, her face will be as excited as usual. This will be Christine's first Fourth. She won't understand the fireworks. But eventually she'll get the message, watching her father watch all that money go up in smoke with such delight.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET BATTLES;
The Twisting Road to a Budget Deal

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
At about 3 P.M. Sunday, under the curious gaze of a pair of police officers and lulled, perhaps, by the pungent aroma of boxed red geraniums, two deputy mayors and two City Council tacticians adjourned to a park bench outside City Hall and, in less than half an hour, resolved the budget impasse that had threatened New York City with fiscal chaos.
The two Council representatives, Joseph Strasburg and Marc V. Shaw, then left Deputy Mayors Bill Lynch and Sally Hernandez-Pinero and rushed to join Peter F. Vallone, the Council Speaker, at Angelo of Mulberry Street, a restaurant in Little Italy. There, as they consumed half-orders of the house specialty, spaghetti with light tomato sauce, they briefed Mr. Vallone and Councilman Jerry L. Crispino on the tentative accord. 
 At City Hall an hour later, the deal was sealed with a cigar. Mr. Lynch plucked a prized Havana from a plain wooden box on his desk and presented it to Mr. Strasburg as a trophy of their elusive compromise, which may represent a turning point in the strained relations between Mayor David N. Dinkins and the Council.
All that had separated them, as it turned out, was one-tenth of 1 percent of the proposed $29 billion budget. In the end, both sides winked, rather than blinked, in a surprisingly amicable endgame to a test of wills with profound political implications.
 
Weeks of Jockeying
 The jockeying between the Mayor and the Council that had gone on for weeks and the negotiations that had begun in earnest only Friday were as much about public perceptions as about the public purse. They redefined power-sharing between the two branches and reflected the quirky intimacy that New York's 19th-century City Hall bestows on the democratic process. "The Council let the Mayor save face and the Mayor let the Council off the hook," said Councilwoman Ronnie M. Eldridge.
Both sides staked out their bargaining positions back in May, when Mr. Dinkins proposed his budget. But for weeks, they merely sparred from afar, with Mr. Vallone insisting that the Council would not approve more than $300 million of the $776 million property tax increase that the Mayor was seeking. The Speaker championed the businesses and middle-income homeowners who make up the city's tax base. The real-estate industry, meanwhile, bombarded officials with calls and postcards demanding that the Council hold the line.
Then 10 days ago, details of the Council's proposed $465 million in alternative cuts were leaked by the Mayor's office. That shifted public outrage from the Mayor's doomsday budget to the Council's economies, but it also deepened the emnity provoked by irritants ranging from the role of the Mayor's representatives in Council redistricting to an apparent oversight that led Mr. Vallone to believe he had been snubbed during last month's parade for Persian Gulf war veterans.
The Council refused to discuss a further increase in property taxes. The administration ridiculed the Council's proposed economies.
Last Thursday, the Council once again seized the initiative and embarked on a collision course with the Mayor. It began drafting its own budget -- one that would have required thousands more layoffs than the Mayor had already imposed -- and threatened to adopt it by the Sunday deadline unless an agreement was struck.
But Council insiders recognized that the threat, while not empty, represented more of a public-relations gesture than a genuine fiscal strategy. The new City Charter that gave the Council broader powers still reserved for the Mayor the wide discretion to estimate revenue; if the Council's revenue projections were too optimistic Mr. Dinkins could impose further cuts or, more likely, require a property-tax increase after all.
 
'It's Only Thursday'
 Mr. Lynch, a veteran of many labor and political negotiations, was sanguine when he was asked late in the week why no serious talks had begun. "It's only Thursday," he replied. "Wait until Sunday."
Meanwhile, he had mobilized community groups, civic organizations and city commissioners to protest the Council's proposed cuts.
Intense negotiations finally began at City Hall late Friday. That night, Mr. Vallone encountered the Mayor at a reception in Astoria and misread Mr. Dinkins's public embrace as a conciliatory sign. Mr. Vallone returned to City Hall. Mr. Dinkins did not. It was the last time they spoke until moments before they announced an agreement Sunday night.
While Mr. Dinkins was at City Hall over the weekend, his agenda went beyond the immediate budget talks. Anticipating moves by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, the Mayor was also fashioning some joint review of city and state fiscal problems that would allow for help from the Municipal Assistance Corporation but avoid triggering the oversight authority of the State Financial Control Board.
The first sign of a break came unexpectedly Saturday afternoon. A reporter told Leland T. Jones, the Mayor's chief spokesman, that the Council was acknowledging that it needed to make technical adjustments to bring its proposed budget into balance. "I said to Norman, 'They're caving,' " Mr. Jones recalled telling Norman Steisel, the First Deputy Mayor.
Mr. Lynch was largely handling negotiations with Mr. Strasburg, the Council's chief of staff. But sometime after midnight Saturday, Mr. Steisel invoked a relationship that demonstrates the role personal dynamics play in politics. He reached out to Herbert E. Berman of Brooklyn, who heads the Council's Finance Committee, whom Mr. Steisel has known for years -- since he used to tag along when his sister dated a friend of Mr. Berman.
Conferring with Mr. Berman, what Mr. Steisel apparently intended to convey was the administration's final offer: The Council would have to raise its last offer of a property tax increase from $388 million to $400 million. The administration, for its part, raised its offer on budget restorations.
But either Mr. Berman or Mr. Strasburg, whom Mr. Steisel subsequently briefed, or their staffs misunderstood, so that between 4:30 A.M. Sunday, when negotiators wearily left City Hall, and about 10:30 A.M., when they returned, what had seemed to be grounds for a settlement had all but collapsed. The dispute appeared to center on whether the administration had been willing to budge beyond $40 million in restorations -- the so-called "L list" of life-saving services -- or beyond $100 million, still well short of the $169 million demand that the Council had retreated to from $220 million.
Deputy Mayor Hernandez-Pinero was apparently instrumental in reviving the talks. She telephoned Mr. Strasburg, with whom she shared friends as fellow graduates of the Bronx High School of Science, and determined that both sides wanted an agreement before the deadline and that they were feuding over many cuts that both sides hoped to restore.
 
Meeting a Deadline
 That call led to the walk in the park -- literally, not figuratively. The park-bench protocol, Mr. Lynch recalled, "was when we closed it all up."
It rapidly set in motion the compromise that Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Vallone announced at 10:30. In the time warp in which city government often operates, their vague agreement to agree on a budget constituted what both agreed was compliance with the deadline.
Ultimately, the administration budged slightly and increased the amount it would agree to restore to $117 million. That, combined with $350 million in higher projections of tax collections and one-shot revenues, provided the basis for the agreement.
Even without the Mayor's personal plea to Mr. Vallone -- which the Council staff had demanded -- the Speaker agreed to raise property taxes by $400 million. That was about half of what Mr. Dinkins had proposed and well within the figure real-estate lobbyists had said would be acceptable. By acting jointly, the Council averted as much as $500 million in cuts it might have had to make itself.
Mr. Dinkins was flanked by Mr. Berman and Mr. Vallone when he read the text of the agreement. Two words were underlined: "together," which was how the two sides had managed to piece together a budget; and "independence," which was what they hoped that budget would achieve for the city if it passes muster with state monitors and with bond buyers.

HEADLINE: Kohl Threatens to End German Aid to Yugoslavia

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, July 1

 BODY:
Chancellor Helmut Kohl toughened his position toward Yugoslavia today, threatening to cut off all German aid if the Belgrade Government again sent troops against the independence-minded republics of Slovenia and Croatia.
He also raised the possibility for the first time that Yugoslavia might not survive the current crisis intact. 
 "One does not hold a country together with tanks and violence," Mr. Kohl told journalists in Bonn.
Like most other European leaders, Mr. Kohl has spoken often about the need to preserve Yugoslav unity. Today, facing domestic political pressure set off by the fighting that broke out in Slovenia and Croatia last week, he instead stressed the right of national and ethnic groups to self-determination.
Treaties signed by European leaders in recent years, Mr. Kohl noted, guarantee "human rights, the legitimate rights of minorities, and the right to free elections."
 
Sympathy for Republics
 Mr. Kohl suggested that hostile factions in Yugoslavia try to negotiate a loose confederation. "If that doesn't work, then we'll have to think again," he said.
German aid to Yugoslavia last year totaled about $550 million, according to official figures. Mr. Kohl made his threat to suspend this year's aid after Foreign Minister Jacques Poos of Luxembourg announced that the European Community was considering halting its $900 million aid program.
Public opinion in Germany, as in much of Europe, is sympathetic to the secessionist republics. Leading politicians and commentators have been urging the Government to back away from what is widely understood to be its pro-Belgrade stance. Among them have been senior leaders of Mr. Kohl's own Christian Democratic Union.
The Christian Democratic chairman, Volker Ruhe, urged in a radio interview today that Germany and other nations of the European Community formally recognize the independence of the breakaway republics.
"If we Germans think everything in Europe can stay just as it was, if we accept the status quo and do not recognize the right of self-determination in Slovenia and Croatia, then we have no moral or political credibility," Mr. Ruhe said. "We should start a movement in the E.C. to lead to such recognition. It can't be done alone."
 
A Test for European Agencies
 German reaction to the crisis in Yugoslavia reflects an ambivalence felt in many European capitals as well as in Washington. Political leaders want to appear sympathetic to oppressed minorities, but they are afraid of setting precedents that could encourage nationalist movements from Flanders to Kurdistan.
The crisis also tests the ability of new European agencies to deal with threats to peace. Austria has asked the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to set its new crisis-prevention mechanism into action, and today Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of Germany flew from Bonn to Yugoslavia as a representative of that organization.
Before leaving Germany, Mr. Genscher discussed the crisis with the United Nations Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, who is visiting Bonn.
"It is important that we try and use all our powers to end the military deployment in Yugoslavia," Mr. Genscher said.
Slovenian and Croatian leaders have urged the European Community to send observers to monitor the current cease-fire. Such a step would be a minor landmark in the community's evolution from an economic union to one with political and security powers.
"We understand their request, and we told them we are willing to consider it," the Dutch Foreign Minister, Hans van den Broek, said in The Hague today after returning from an overnight visit to Yugoslavia.

HEADLINE: Japan's Central Bank Lowers Discount Rate to 5.5 Percent

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 1

 BODY:
Japan lowered its benchmark interest rate today by a half percentage point, to 5.5 percent, ending its two-year-old policy of keeping interest rates high to wring inflation out of the economy.
The announcement by the Bank of Japan, which came at 12:15 P.M. here, appeared to be intended to spur Japan's economy after a recent slowdown in growth. The country is headed toward its longest-running economic expansion in postwar history -- it is two months short of the record of 57 months set more than 20 years ago -- and the central bank had recently come under increasing pressure to lower its rates to encourage capital spending and revive the lagging stock market. 
 The announcement came after widespread speculation that an increase was imminent. The bank's action caused a stock market rally in Tokyo, reversing the steady decline of the last week. The Nikkei index of 250 issues soared 817.80 points, or 3.51 percent, in active trading today, closing at 24,108.76. And the yen strengthened against the dollar in Tokyo, with the American currency falling to 137.14 yen from its close of 138.15 on Friday.
In the United States markets, the overnight surge in the Nikkei contributed to a sharp rise in the Dow Jones industrial average, which gained 51.66 points. The move, however, had no impact in the credit markets, which had expected the move, traders said.
Today's reduction in the discount rate, the rate the central bank charges banks for short-term loans, was the first since February 1987, when the Bank of Japan cut the discount rate to just 2.5 percent. But in May 1989, the bank began to push up interest rates in an effort to stem what the central bank's governor, Yasushi Mieno, said were dangerous signs of inflation. Mr. Mieno has consistently viewed inflation as a bigger threat than a slowdown in growth.
There was no offical reaction in Washington today to the rate reduction, though it was expected to be welcomed. The United States has been pushing Japan and Germany for months to ease interest rates. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady had urged rate cuts to quicken economic growth around the world at a time of recession in the United States.
Lower Japanese interest rates would also tend to free more Japanese capital to flow abroad to areas with shortages of capital, like Eastern Europe and the United States. Washington's big budget deficits require the sale of tens of billions of dollars of Treasury bonds to foreigners.
Politically, the rate cut seems excellently timed.
The leaders of the seven leading industrial democracies plan to meet in London in two weeks. The cut may ease American pressures on Japan at the meeting and give more weight to Japan's views -- in particular, its staunch opposition to providing financial support to the Soviet Union.
Over the weekend, Japan's Prime Minister, Toshiki Kaifu, said Japan would not extend large-scale aid to the Soviet Union until it made significant progress on resolving the longstanding dispute over the Northern Islands, a cluster of four islands the Soviets have occupied since World War II.
The announcement capped several weeks of conflicting signals about whether the Bank of Japan would acceed to pressures for a reduction. Several newspapers, including Nihon Keizei Shimbun, Japan's leading financial daily, predicted in recent weeks that the cut was imminent, only to be contradicted by Mr. Mieno.
 
A Cooling Economy
 After the Japanese economy blazed ahead at a rate of more than 5 percent last year, economists are predicting that it will grow about 3 percent to 3.5 percent this year. That rate is still considered a healthy pace, particularly compared with growth in the United States.
Paul Summerville, an economist at Jardine Fleming Securities here, said there were clearer signs now that the economy was cooling. Housing construction and industrial production have been declining, according to figures released last week.
Consumer inflation appears to have diminished to about 3.5 percent, from its high of about 4.5 percent in January. There are also indications that Japan's labor shortage, while still severe, is easing somewhat. Overheated property prices -- one of Mr. Mieno's special targets -- have also shown some signs of slowing.
Not least, the stock market has been sluggish for more than a year, and it has fallen sharply in recent weeks. Analysts have attributed part of the recent drop to a scandal involving Japan's Big Four securities houses. But they also said it had stemmed from disappointment that the central bank had not moved to cut interest rates at a time when the economy was clearly expanding at a slower pace.

HEADLINE: The Dow Advances 51.66 Points, to 2,958.41

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
An exceptionally strong stock market in Tokyo and a favorable purchasing managers' report did wonders for Wall Street yesterday as stocks bounced back sharply and recovered almost everything they lost last week.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which sank nearly 59 points last week, soared 51.66, or about 1.8 percent, to 2,958.41. 
 Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Company, said the National Association of Purchasing Management's report was a "real stimulus" in the price rise, along with the reduction in Japanese interest rates and the rise in the Nikkei stock index.
The purchasing managers' index rose to 50.9 percent in June, up from May's level of 45.4 percent.
"It was a very positive report on the economy, particularly the manufacturing end," Mr. Sinai said, "and it is clearly saying the recession is over."
The much broader Standard & Poor's 500 index climbed a little more than 1.8 percent. The day's trading brought the Dow industrial average to within 77 points of its all-time high of 3,035.33.
The smaller stocks, as measured by the Nasdaq composite, advanced a bit more than 1.1 percent, while the American Stock Exchange's market-value index of small stocks rose seven-tenths of 1 percent.
The rise spread across most leading stock groups, from airlines, chemicals, technology and drugs to oil, insurance, retailing and telephone stocks. Except for a few banking companies, even the bank stocks, a big worry for most of last week, turned upward.
Trading activity, while still sluggish, rose to about 167.5 million shares, from 163.8 million on Friday. Almost 30 million of the total came in the final hour. Birinyi Associates, which monitors computer-programmed activity, said that four big buying waves lifted the Dow 33 points, thereby accounting for most of yesterday's strength.
Traders cited the sharp rise in Tokyo's Nikkei index of 225 stocks. It climbed 817.80 points, or 3.5 percent, to 24,108.76. Much of yesterday's gain came after the Bank of Japan lowered its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point, to 5.5 percent.
[At the close of trading in Tokyo today, the Nikkei index was down 113 points, or 0.47 percent, to 23,995.76]
 Kenneth P. Ducey, trading director for the BT Brokerage Corporation, said of the trading in the United States, "There's no real resistance as far as selling goes."After last week's big selloff, he added, "most of the selling seems to be out of the way."
Noting that like many Wall Street people he tracked the market on a color-coded Bridge machine, where falling stock prices show up in red and rising ones in green, he said, "My machine is all green; it's the first time it's happened in a long time."
 
Dow Is Up From the Opening
 The rise in the Dow seemed impressive from the opening bell. Within minutes it was ahead 24 points. Within an hour it had jumped almost 40. The average drifted somewhat higher from then on, climbing another 15 points by the end of the day. Program buying was at its heaviest early in the session, Birinyi said, with the Dow climbing 17 points on a 14-minute wave of buying started around 10:30 A.M.
Among the big movers were Japanese stocks like Hitachi up 3 7/8, to 82 5/8; Matsushita 2 3/4, to 122 3/4; Ito Yokado 3, to 131, and Tokio Marine 2 7/8, to 44 3/8.
Dillard Department Stores rose 4 1/8, to 125 1/2. Last week, Fourteen Research and First Manhattan raised their 1992 earnings estimates.
UAL climbed 3 1/4, to 142, after Stephen M. Wolf, the chairman of the airline, said in an Orlando, Fla., news conference that second-quarter results would be substantially better than in the first quarter.
Merck jumped 3 1/8, to 119 1/4, and United States Surgical added 3 1/8, to 65 3/4, both in brisk trading, but there did not appear to be any news to account for the buying.
SciMed Life Systems, maker of disposable medical supplies, rose 4 1/2, to 70, in heavy trading in the wake of last week's better-than-expected first quarter. Dow Jones said Kurt Kruger of Hambrecht & Quist and Jonathan Osgood of Alex. Brown & Sons subsequently recommended the stock and that Carol Winslow of Vector Securities recommended it yesterday.
Wells Fargo, which plunged 17 7/8, or almost 21 percent, last week, slid 3 3/4 more, to 65 1/4, in strong trading in continued reaction to last week's announcement that it would reserve $350 million in the second quarter against possible loan losses.
Shearson Lehman Brothers, one of the nation's biggest brokerage houses, revealed its 1992 list of the top 10 stock picks; all 10 rose in brisk trading. I.B.M. gained 1 1/4, to 98 3/8; Autozone 2 3/8, to 36 1/4; Bankers Trust 1 5/8, to 50; Centel 1 1/8, to 32 1/8; National Health Laboratories 1 1/4, to 20 1/4; Scitex 1 1/8, to 32 1/2; Texas Instruments 1 1/4, to 34 1/2; Acuson 3/4, to 29 7/8; Federal Express 5/8, to 39 1/8, and Union Camp 5/8 to 45 1/8.

HEADLINE: June Surge In Economy Is Reported

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
The nation's purchasing managers reported yesterday that their monthly survey of economic activity indicated that the economy surged in June to its highest level in more than two years.
The National Association of Purchasing Management's main economic index rose to 50.9 percent in June, up sharply from May's level of 45.4 percent. It was the highest reading since April 1989, when the index stood at 52.1 percent. 
 A reading below 50 percent indicates that the manufacturing economy is declining, while a reading above 50 percent indicates an expansion. Before June, the index had been below 50 percent for 12 consecutive months.
 
Some Await Future Data
 The group contended that the rise in the index indicated that the recession was over. Economists generally agreed but were more cautious in their interpretation of the figures, with some suggesting that the next few months would better gauge whether the recession had indeed reached an end and how robust a recovery would be.
The report surprised most credit market participants, who had expected that economic activity would remain weak to sluggish in June. Prices for Treasury issues fell as traders feared that a rise in economic activity could lead to a resurgence in inflation. The news helped the stock market stage a rebound, with the Dow rising 51.66, or 1.78 percent, to 2,958.41. [Pages D8 and D14.]
The purchasing managers' report is considered an important economic indicator because it is based on a survey of managers from a wide range of industrial companies. Also, it is the first important indicator each month of how the economy performed in the previous month.
 
'Recession Is Essentially Over'
 "With the index over 50 percent, the recession is essentially over for the manufacturing sector as well as the overall economy," said Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the association's business survey committee and director of corporate purchasing at Pitney Bowes Inc. "The continued sharp increase in the engine of growth, new orders, virtually assures continued growth in production in the months ahead."
Wolfgang H. Demisch, director of research at UBS Securities Inc., said that questions remained "about the slope of the upturn." He added that the pace of the economic recovery was likely to be more moderate than previous recoveries. "It's hard to see the financial fuel that would propel a more vigorous ascent," he said.
Richard D. Berner, a senior economist with Salomon Brothers, agreed that the purchasing managers' report was one in a series of data indicating that the economy was emerging from the recession. "We've begun to see some firming in demand in the industrial sector," he said.
The index of economic activity was pushed up in June by a surge in new orders, a measurement considered by economists to be the most important component of the monthly survey. Activity in new orders in turn affects the level of production, employment and inventories. The association's index of new orders soared in June to 59.1 percent, from 50.6 percent in May. It was the highest reading for new orders since August 1988, when the index stood at 50.2 percent.
"The new orders are particularly strong, which suggests that the pattern of improvement has set in and is likely to persist for a meaningful period of time," said Neal Soss, chief economist with the First Boston Corporation. "They say that the figures signal the end of the recession and I think that's a correct assessment."
 
Production Index Climbs
 Production increased sharply in June, with the association's production index jumping to 55 percent, from 48.8 percent in May. The report said that the sharp increase in new orders in June should provide continued growth in production in upcoming months.
The association's price index rose for the second consecutive month, to 39.5 percent in June, from 36.9 percent in May. The report said tht prices would rise further, because "they lag the economy, which has just begun its recovery."
The purchasing managers' employment index rose to 43.3 percent in June, fom 37 percent in May.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET BATTLES;
New York Taxes Batter Middle Class

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
The middle class is likely to feel the greatest impact from the $735 million increase in income and property taxes that the Dinkins administration and the City Council has agreed to impose to balance the budget, tax experts say.
Businesses will also be hit hard, the smallest ones the worst. 
 Throughout New York City the prospect of higher taxes was generating a variety of responses. For Helen Daniels, a 42-year-old single parent who owns a brownstone in Harlem and who is trying to put her two children through college on her $47,000 salary, the tax increase is more unwelcome pressure.
She was already finding it tough to juggle a $1,000-a month mortgage payment and a $10,000 tuition fee she expects to pay for her daughter to transfer to George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., this fall. Now she must make room for a $150 increase in her water and sewage charges, to $500; an estimated $162 increase in the personal income tax she pays to the city, to $1,320, and an estimated $119 increase in her property taxes, to $969.
 
'Struggle Is So Great'
 "People tell me I'm a member of the middle class, but the struggle is so great just to maintain the basics that in one respect I don't feel like it," Ms. Daniels said. Many of her neighbors, she said, are also single women with children. The talk these days is about leaving the city, taking in boarders or being forced to sell the houses they have spent years making livable.
The outlook is not much happier for Dan Tubridy, the owner of a seafood restaurant in Rockaway Beach, Queens, who has a wife and five boys. To pay the increase in a variety of different business taxes, he fears that for the first time in 13 years, he may have to close his restaurant for several weeks or months this winter to save on labor costs in a slow period.
"For the first time in my life I'm saying, 'Is there a better place to be?' and that scares me," said Mr. Tubridy, whose family has lived in the Rockaways since the early 1900's. "I love this city!"
Of course, tax increases are never popular. But in the case of New York City, there is more than just rhetoric behind the current round of complaints. Before the prospect of new increases loomed, city residents were already paying three times more in city taxes than residents in other localities, according to City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman.
 
City Services at Risk
 City officials defend the latest rises as necessary to insure that city services are not slashed to the extent that the city becomes unlivable. And they say property and income-tax increases are the fairest because they are spread over the largest group.
"We were going for taxes that had the broadest base and that were deductible," said Carol O'Cleireacain, the city's Commissioner of Finance.
The middle class feels the impact of these taxes more than the wealthy because the latter are still enjoying the benefits of sharp cuts in their Federal income-tax burden during the 1980's, when the rate for those at the top end of the income scale fell from 50 percent to 31 percent. Because of those reductions, many people with high incomes are still better off -- even with this latest round of local taxes -- than they were at the beginning of the 80's.
But many small businesses are facing new hardships with a new round of tax increases.
 
Landlord's Lament
 Winifred Dozier-Davis, a 55-year-old widow who owns an apartment building in Harlem with 67 units, has for the last few years been hit with property-tax increases of about $3,000 a year. This year, she said, her water and sewage charges went up by about $1,700.
Because so many of the apartments in her building fall under rent-control or rent-stabilization guidelines, she cannot pass along those increases, or the ones just agreed upon, to her tenants. And currently five tenants are delinquent in rent payments.
 
286,000 Jobs Predicted to Be Lost
 The prospect of higher taxes in an already weak economy troubles some economists.
The Comptroller's office estimates that this latest round of tax increases will result in twice as many jobs being lost as would have occurred if the economy had been healthy. Stephen Kagann, the office's chief economist, predicts that the tax increases agreed to on Sunday will result in a loss of 286,000 jobs by 1994.
Not only might companies have to cope with a business climate that will continue to be weak, but they also will bear a disproportionate share of the city's new property-tax increase. Because of ceilings put on the rates of taxes on one- and two-family homes in the city, businesses paid 63 percent of the city's property taxes in the fiscal year that ended in June 1990, compared with just 55 percent at the time of the last fiscal crisis in the 1970's, according to a tax commission appointed by former Mayor Edward I. Koch.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET BATTLES;
Cuomo and Dinkins Strive to Find Long-Term Solutions to Fiscal Ills

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
With their immediate budget crises not fully resolved, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Mayor David N. Dinkins turned yesterday to finding ways to solve New York City's and the state's deep long-term fiscal problems by shifting and streamlining their complex burdens of taxing, spending and providing services.
Just what form such a joint review would take or what force its recommendations might have remained in some dispute, and both sides jockeyed yesterday to be seen as leading the effort. City Hall proposed the creation of a new city-state commission, while the Governor said he favored increasing coordination through existing staff-level efforts. 
 Both sides said the review should weigh issues like how the state might assume a greater share of welfare and Medicaid payments.
Political leaders, civic groups and fiscal monitors have argued for months that the best solution to the city and state's interwoven fiscal troubles would be a fundamental restructuring of their responsibilities.
For this year, city officials are hoping that labor concessions will help avoid some service cuts and thousands of layoffs, and yesterday two major union leaders said they would be willing to offer as much as $100 million in givebacks. [Page B5.]
But for future years, long-term solutions could include having the state take on new burdens by increasing state taxes, which now raise only aout two-thirds as much as local taxes throughout the state.
Movement toward such changes, with money-saving concessions Mr. Dinkins is seeking from the municipal unions, could pave the way for hundreds of millions of dollars in aid through refinancings by the Municipal Assistance Corporation, the state body set up to help bail the city out of its last fiscal crisis. The authority's chairman, Felix G. Rohatyn, has tied help from the corporation to long-term changes to reduce the cost of government.
Governor Cuomo and Mayor Dinkins have both been under increasing pressure to address the problem of the economic relations between the two governments. But it has been politically sensitive, because Mr. Cuomo was not eager to be seen as usurping the Mayor's powers or to get tied up in the city's problems. And the Mayor has vowed repeatedly to resist any effort that meant expanding the role of the Financial Control Board, the state oversight body headed by Mr. Cuomo, whose binding powers over city spending lapsed after the city's recovery from the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's.
But recently Mr. Cuomo has said he wanted to play a more active role. Yesterday, on the eve of a control board meeting to review the city's new budget, at which Mr. Cuomo planned to outline his ideas for government restructuring, City Hall aides said Mr. Dinkins was pressing what they described as their own proposal for a formal state-city commission, to the consternation of the Cuomo administration, which had hoped to dominate public attention with its announcement today.
Asked what he thought of starting a commission to review ideas that have been in the air for weeks on the economic relations of the city and the state, Mr. Cuomo said: "They're not in the air. They're in the speech I'm delivering tomorrow."
Mr. Dinkins, who complains in most of his speeches that New York is the only state in the nation that requires localities to pay 50 percent of Medicaid costs, totaling $1.5 billion a year for the city, said a review of that and other problems was "damn important."
 
'Not Just a Study Group'
 He added: "The most important thing in getting it off the ground, I think, is for there to be some sort of commission that is seen as being serious. Not just a study group."
The Mayor and his aides said such a group could take actions ranging from making recommendations to elected officials to proposing big changes in state law that could be voted on in the State Legislature, though they stressed that no particular version had been decided on.
Albany and City Hall have been quietly discussing the idea for weeks, with Cuomo aides preferring to expand an existing program called New York-New York, which involves cooperation on financial issues between the state budget director and the Mayor's Office of Operations. Mayoral aides said that they wanted a higher-profile effort but that the Governor was concerned that could open a rancorous debate with the Legislature over who would pay for such a group.
They said the Governor was also worried that such a group could leave him more open to embarrassment should its recommendations fail and could entail a host of changes in the state's dealings with all municipalities, not just New York City.
But the Governor dismissed those notions. "I'm easy when it comes to profiles," he said. "They can make it as a high a profile as they want. I'm a back-room guy myself. But if they want to have profile, they can have it."
Mr. Cuomo would not comment on the implications that restructuring the governments would have on persuading Mr. Rohatyn of the assistance corporation to provide money. He said: "I asked Felix if I could get M.A.C. money if I did it right. He said, 'If you do it very right, maybe.' "
For Mr. Dinkins, creating a new body to review such ideas, and perhaps help carry them out, would be a way to play a major role in such decisions without the intervention of the Financial Control Board, which some officials have suggested might shape such efforts. Mr. Dinkins has vowed to resist a more active role for the board.
But Mr. Cuomo, while repeating his desire for "cooperation, not control," said: "The Financial Control Board will absolutely be dealing with this subject. It must. The F.C.B. will be meeting regularly. Of course, the F.C.B. will be a very big part of it, but not in any way that should be threatening to the city."
For some time, senior Dinkins and Cuomo aides have been talking quietly about how best to handle efforts to restructure the city-state roles. First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel said the Mayor had asked him and Finance Commissioner Carol O'Cleireacain to "explore formulas and vehicles for thinking about it."

HEADLINE: 9 States Miss Deadlines for Budgets

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 1

 BODY:
California entered its new fiscal year today without a balanced budget. So did eight other states where politicians were also unable to make the painful decision of raising taxes and cutting spending in a time of deep recession.
For now, missing the deadline in California meant only another tense day of nail-biting and head-banging at the Capitol in Sacramento, but in Maine, Gov. John R. McKernan Jr. declared a state emergency and furloughed 10,000 state employees considered nonessential. 
 In Connecticut, Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. vetoed a no-income-tax budget passed by the Legislature, warning that he would furlough 7,000 workers if the legislators did not approve a state personal income tax.
The other states still hammering out budgets today are Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
 
Some Timely Budget Action
 One state that did pass a budget before the start of the new fiscal year today was Iowa, but its Governor, Terry E. Branstad, said today that he was ordering an additional $104 million in across-the-board cuts.
Another state that beat the deadline, barely, was New Jersey, where Gov. Jim Florio signed a $14.7 billion budget at 11:54 P.M. on Sunday after the Legislature approved it earlier in the evening. The budget could force the layoffs of 2,000 to 3,000 state workers.
Nevada and the state of Washington also reached budget agreements within minutes of their midnight Sunday deadlines.
In New York City, officials reached an agreement on the outlines of a grim budget a few hours before the deadline. The agreement provides for tax increases, service cuts and the layoff of 10,000 municipal workers.
 
A $14.3 Billion Gap
 Nearly every state has had a tough time balancing its budget in this recession year, but nowhere has the task been more daunting than in California, which faces a gap of $14.3 billion between spending on state programs and expected revenue. This shortage alone is so large that it dwarfs the entire general fund expenditures of every other state except New York.
By Sunday night the California Legislature had passed additional sales and other taxes and cut welfare and other services enough to erase all but $2 billion of the shortage. But, in a special session Sunday night, they were unable to reach agreement on the final measures, which might include raising the income tax for the wealthy and cutting the salaries of state employees by 5 percent.
Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, has threatened to veto the $56 billion budget passed by the Democratic-controlled Legislature on June 20 if the additional taxes and spending cuts are not made by this Wednesday.
"We're definitely standing," said Franz Wisner, a spokesman for the Governor. "We just don't know where we're standing."
 
A Question of Taxes
 The chief sticking point is whether to raise personal income taxes. Democratic leaders, backed by big-business interests, prefer to raise the tax on individuals who earn more than $100,000 rather than impose a 2 percent tax on utility bills. Governor Wilson, who has long opposed any such income tax increase, appeared to yield over the weekend.
The process has been complicated by last-minute demands, advanced by Republicans in the Assembly, for new legislation to make it harder for employees to claim workman's compensation benefits for stress. It is opposed by the Democrats in the Assembly, led by the Speaker, Willie L. Brown Jr. of San Francisco.
"The Assembly is hopelessly deadlocked and unable to send the Senate the tax bills backed by Wilson," State Senator David A. Roberti of Los Angeles, the President pro tem, told reporters Sunday night. But Mr. Wisner said today, "We are still counting on the budget being passed before Wednesday."
If not, the immediate consequences would not be devastating. A spokesman for Gray Davis, the Comptroller, said the state would have to pay an extra $11 million in interest in money borrowed to maintain normal cash flow after Wednesday.
The real showdown would not come until the next pay day, on July 15, when highway workers and other state employees might go payless, as happened last year. But the Health Services and Social Services departments said they planned to continue essential services to the sick and poor under a court order issued in a similar impasse last year.
A larger concern was that the state's AAA bond rating might be downgraded by Standard & Poor's, the New York-based rating agency.
 
The Situation Elsewhere
 In Maine, about 200 furloughed state employees rallied outside the Governor's office in Augusta, The Associated Press reported. "We hope this impasse is going to be resolved as quickly as possible and we want to get back to the normal operation of government," Governor McKernan said. Despite the furloughs, the number of state employees working at prisons and mental health centers was normal.
In Pennsylvania, a marathan legislative session ended shortly before 9 P.M. Sunday with only a stopgap plan to keep money flowing for welfare recipients and for interest payments. State offices were to remain open, but $250 million for schools and pay for 10,000 state employees would be suspended on July 5.
In Massachusetts, the Legislature sent Gov. William F. Weld a $12.9 billion budget that called for deep cuts in social services and increases in the property tax.
Elsewhere, procrastination was the watchword. The Ohio Legislature, unable to reach agreement, passed a 30-day temporary spending bill. In Illinois, the debate continued amid the prospect of the shutdown of some state services. And in North Carolina, the Legislature gave up temporarily and took the weekend off.

Connecticut's government stood today on the threshold of an undefined, but sharply worsened budget crisis.
For the first time in this century, there was no state budget in place through the first full day of business of a new fiscal year. Senior state officers warned that the void could lead to huge legal claims and constitutional questions about who pays the bills when the budget process breaks down. 
 Late Monday night, House Democrats emerged from a three-hour caucus announcing that they had enough votes to pass a compromise income-tax plan to finance the budget. The plan would require a smaller tax than the one sought by Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., but would establish the precedent of a tax on income in Connecticut. If passed by the House, the measure would still require approval by the Senate to take effect.
The Governor, who had threatened 24 hours earlier to make good on a previous threat to shut down state government if a budget was not approved by 12:01 A.M. today, relaxed that deadline, but continued to threaten to begin closing parks, motor-vehicle offices and other services deemed nonessential to the public safety if a tax plan was not approved sometime overnight.
The previous 24 hours had been filled with ultimatums, and much of the air of drama involved figuring out which ones might be real, which ones might be feints, and which ones should be taken seriously -- however unlikely or irrational they might seem -- because of the bargainer's reputation.
People in both the legislative and executive branches of government were staking out positions about whose voice should prevail in maintaining economic order.
Mr. Weicker, a third-party governor who has insisted now through two budget vetoes that an income tax is necessary to resolve the state's revenue shortfall, had issued an executive order early Monday saying that essential state services would be maintained even without a budget. His action came after he vetoed the Legislature's efforts to resolve the state's fiscal crisis with an expanded sales tax in place of the income tax.
 
'Uncharted Legal Territory'
 Many lawmakers immediately questioned whether Mr. Weicker was exceeding his powers by pledging to spend money that the legislative branch had not appropriated. The State Attorney General, Richard Blumenthal, disagreed, saying Mr. Weicker had the authority to act.
But Mr. Blumenthal said the government shutdown would be a complete disaster for the state and he publicly urged Mr. Weicker not to veto an extension if lawmakers need more time.
"There's a world of very serious potential legal liabilities, risks, costs and lawsuits that will result from a shutdown," Mr. Blumenthal said in an interview. "We are in completely uncharted legal territory."
Mr. Blumenthal said that because Connecticut has no legal framework or court precedent for segregating essential from non-essential services, the Governor would be exposing the state to a lawsuit from anyone -- whether furloughed employee or discomfited residents -- who felt that the decisions to be wrong. And he said that the state would have little legal ammunition with which to defend itself from the claims that the decisions were arbitrary because without a law to help define what is "essential," the decisions would be arbitrary almost by definition.
The State Comptroller, William E. Curry Jr., whose office is responsible for paying the state's bills, said that because of the recession, the state was falling $100 million deeper into debt each month. The lack of a budget could push that to $200 million a month, partly because of higher borrowing costs, or about $270,000 for every hour that no budget is passed, he said.
"Everyone agrees that the essential operations of government continue to be authorized," he said. "But what are the essential operations of government? Payment of interest, or payment of welfare -- try making that Hobson's choice."
Lawmakers were also divided among themselves about when and how to press a continuing resolution to keep paying the state's bills. The Senate passed a two-week budget extension early Monday morning, but House leaders deliberately postponed taking up the Senate's resolution, pressing instead toward the compromise income-tax plan that looked like it might somehow go where no income tax plan has gone before and obtain a majority of votes.
That compromise plan, sponsored by a Republican Senator whose party has been all but unanimous in opposing Mr. Weicker's efforts to overhaul the state's revenue system, would enact a smaller income tax than Mr. Weicker has sought, and would thus allow lesser cuts in business taxes, which Mr. Weicker identified as essential to stimulate the state's economy.
The new plan would create a 4.75 percent flat rate income tax on adjusted gross income over $12,000 for an individual or $24,000 for a couple filing jointly. It would thus provide a lower tax rate than the last income tax plan, a graduated income tax that rose to a rate of 6.5 percent at the highest income levels. That earlier plan was defeated in the House on Saturday night by a large margin, thus setting the stage the effort on Sunday to pass the no-income tax plan that Mr. Weicker vetoed early Monday.
The no-income tax plan would have resolved the state's revenue shortfall -- now projected to reach $2.8 billion in a budget of about $8 billion -- through a drastic expansion of the sales tax system. Governor Weicker, signing the veto papers on live television, said it would only make the state's problem worse because falling sales tax collections are at the heart of the current shortfall.
And while some elements of the drama were perhaps best appreciated by accountants, other acts of brinksmanship or bravado were clear enough for all to understand. The state employee unions, for example, held a news conference to announce that they might still accept a $340 million package of wage and benefit concessions negotiated with the Weicker administration if lawmakers could approve a budget in the next few days.
A spokesman for the group, Robert Krzys, decried the pain that would result from a state government shutdown, even though Mr. Curry and other officials said the state employees would probably be among the least harmed.

HEADLINE: Union Leaders Are Willing To Make More Concessions

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
Two major leaders of municipal unions in New York City said for the first time yesterday that they were willing to give back as much as $100 million in wages and other concessions to avert some of the thousands of layoffs called for in the budget.
City officials are hoping that the concessions will eventually help restore cuts in services and the jobs of many of the 10,000 workers slated to be laid off -- including 6,000 laid off last week -- as part of the budget agreement reached Sunday night after tough bargaining between the City Council and the Dinkins administration. 
 Based on the formula that $23,000 in give-backs saves a job, the $100 million in concessions could avert 4,300 layoffs. Union leaders are also pushing an early-retirement plan that they say would save an unspecified number of jobs, and a plan to shift laid-off workers to fill job vacancies.
The union leaders' statements came as the City Council struggled to resolve a range of last-minute snags that kept it from formally passing the budget. As of early today, the Council still had not voted on the budget, more than 24 hours after it was technically due.
 
Safe Streets Plan Is Reduced
 Yesterday, the Dinkins administration said that in the late budget maneuvering it had cut $70 million, or more than a third of Mayor Dinkins's ambitious public safety plan, "Safe Streets, Safe City."
The city will cut its planned hiring of police officers by 125, to the minimum levels required by the State Legislature when it approved taxes to pay for the plan, and it will not hire the officers required under the plan until June 29, 1992, officials said.
The possiblity of union concessions is only one uncertainty in an unusually tentative budget, and city officials predicted that it would be heavily revised.
Complicating the city's budget picture, the State Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, yesterday reiterated his reluctance to allow the city to raise income taxes by $335 million. He said the Republican-controlled Senate would be willing to consider the tax increase if it lapsed after a period of time "considerably less" than the four years the Democratic-controlled Assembly announced it would approve.
City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman said that the simple act of agreement on a budget was likely to shore up the confidence of the financial community.
 
Impact on City's Economy
 But she said she was concerned that the city's revenue estimates were far more optimistic than ones she put out only a few days ago. "Layoffs, tax increases and service cuts are themselves going to have an impact on the underlying economy," she said.
Raymond D. Horton, the president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a research group supported by businesses, called the budget "transitory."
"There are so many assumptions going into it that probably are risky, so that some if not all of them will fail to materialize and put it out of kilter," he said.
The new union position was disclosed at an angry news conference on the steps of City Hall yesterday, in which the two union leaders, who had helped elect the Mayor, accused him of betraying them by refusing to make a deal to stop the layoffs.
 
'Political and Sacrificial Lambs'
 "I cannot stand by and allow my members to be the Mayor's political and sacrificial lambs to Wall Street," said Stanley Hill, executive director of the 140,000-member District Council 37 of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees.
Barry Feinstein, the teamsters leader, said that the union leaders would unleash an army of 10,000 workers to press the Mayor to restore their jobs. "The damage that will be done to the city is the sole responsibility of the Mayor."
But even as they attacked the Mayor, the union leaders for the first time publicly acknowledged that they were considering $100 million in concessions through a five-day payroll lag, forgiving some or all of the wage increases won in the last year and forgiving welfare fund payments owed by the city.
The payroll lag would push back the issuance of paychecks by one day for each of five pay periods.
City negotiators said that despite the fierce speeches, the commitment of the union leaders to make concessions went beyond any statements they had made privately over the last two weeks, and was grounds for hope, if not optimism, that an agreement could be reached this week.
Mr. Feinstein and Mr. Hill are considered crucial pegs in the efforts to avert layoffs. Other union leaders, citing either past concessions or the lack of a contract, have shied away from the talks. But because a settlement by one municipal union often sets a pattern for others, city officials hope that whatever concessions are made by Mr. Feinstein and Mr. Hill will eventually be applied to other city workers.
Both sides said the talks broke down Sunday night, the night the Mayor and the Council agreed on the outlines of a new city budget. The breakdown occurred after Mr. Dinkins's negotiators said that even if the union leaders made substantial concessions they could not guarantee that the city would not lay off workers later, if the city's fiscal situation deteriorated.
 
'They Are Still My Friends'
 Asked about the union positions at a news conference yesterday, Mr. Dinkins said: "They are still my friends. They have over time used intemperate language. I understand they are speaking to the members."
Under the budget agreement between the Council and the Mayor, Mr. Dinkins, who had been pressing for a $776 million property-tax increase, agreed to accept a little more than half that, while the Council agreed to change its list of restored cuts from $220 million to $117 million.
But after that simple agreement a cloud of confusion settled over City Hall.
The Mayor and the Council jockeyed over which programs to restore. According to a Council spokesman, at the last minute, Mr. Dinkins insisted that a prison mental health program be given the highest priority for health and safety reasons, and a $3.2 million restoration was raised to $14 million. This in turn forced a reduction in the amount of money restored to the recycling program, the spokesman said.
 
8 Cents Back for Each Dollar
 Even so, the city was able to restore about eight cents out of every dollar in previously announced cuts. Out of a $42 million cut in libraries made by the Mayor only $14 million was restored in the final budget. Out of a $53 million cut in the Parks Department only $3.7 million was restored.
And to pay for the restoration and smaller tax increase, $200 million in still other cuts were made, raising the total service cuts in the budget to $1.6 billion, with $68 million or about a third of the reduction programs coming from Mr. Dinkins's own "Safe Streets, Safe City" program.
The passage of the program was a highlight of Mr. Dinkins first year in office. But yesterday, new spending for both police and youth programs were cut back, with the Board of Education losing $30 million in expected aid and the expansion of youth programs slowed. The hiring of two police classes was delayed, along with plans to hire more civilian aides for the Police Department.
"Everything else was cut to the bone," said Philip R. Michael, the city budget director.
School officials said that while the Board of Education may have gained as much as $70 million in state aid in the last week, the $30 million loss in the city budget, on top of a $500 million cut, was devastating.

HEADLINE: Engineers Teach 'Smart' Buildings To Foil Quakes

BYLINE: By SANDRA BLAKESLEE

 BODY:
LAST week's earthquake in southern California may jolt even the building industry, notoriously slow to innovate, into experimenting with new kinds of earthquake resistant buildings. Among the most interesting are so-called smart buildings in which a system of computers, sensors and moving weights detects and moves to counteract the alarming motions generated by earthquakes and strong winds.
Traditionally, building engineers have taken a brute strength approach to structural safety. They use massive, heavy materials and build stiffness into a building's infrastructure to resist winds and earthquakes. To filter out shaking, some newer buildings have been constructed on huge rubber pads or materials that act as springs that help dissipate energy. It has taken 30 years to get such passive control systems into the building codes, because American construction companies are extremely slow to innovate, said Dr. Tsu T. Soong, a professor of civil engineering at the National Center for Earthquake Engineering Research at the State University of New York in Buffalo. 
 But in Japan, where destructive earthquakes are an ever-present threat, five major construction companies compete for contracts based on new technologies, and the company with the best new ideas tends to win more contracts. Japanese construction companies invest 10 percent of their gross income in research and development, said Dr. S. Chi Liu, program manager of the Earthquake Hazard Mitigation Project at the National Science Foundation in Washington. They are particularly interested in active and passive control systems to resist earthquakes and wind. U.S. companies invest virtually nothing.
As so often happens, Dr. Liu said, many of the most innovative ideas for such systems are originating in the United States but are being developed by the Japanese. To help spur American involvement, the foundation expects to award $5 million over the next five years to American researchers, Dr. Liu said. But whether American construction companies will use that research, he said, is hard to say.
The world's first building with an active control system was built on a sliver of land in a Tokyo suburb in 1989. The Kyobashi Seiwa office building is only 12 feet wide, 100 feet long and 11 stories high, he said, and the owners worried that wind would buffet the slender structure.
To stabilize the building, the construction company Kajima suspended a four-ton weight and a one-ton weight, one above another, on the building's roof. Sensors were embedded into the building's walls and base and attached to a computer. When the ground shakes or the wind blows, Dr. Liu said, the computer sends signals to hydraulic arms called actuators that move the weights to counteract the motions in the building.
Kajima claims that 80 percent of the building's motion has been dampened out by the active system, Dr. Liu said, although the building's performance has not been independently verified.
A second structure, also built in Tokyo in 1989, is a joint venture between between the Buffalo researchers and the Takenaka Corporation of Japan, another leading construction firm. It is a six-story, 600-ton building without walls that was built solely to demonstrate both weight and bracing systems, Dr. Soong said. Its performance is being monitored and will be published in scientific journals.
The weight consists of a six-ton slab of steel suspended on the roof. Sensors in the basement, third and sixth floor detect motion from earthquakes, wind and even local traffic and send the information to a computer that activates the actuators. The building's motion in strong wind and small earthquakes has been reduced by half, Dr. Soong said.
The bracing system is even more effective, Dr. Soong said, reducing motions by up to 70 percent. The braces are conventional steel tubes of the type that hold all buildings together, but these have been fitted with actuators at each end. When the computer sends its signals, the actuators lengthen or shorten the building's internal braces to accommodate motions from earthquakes and wind.
Both systems are capable of making the building shake, Dr. Soong said, so that one can be used to test the other's ability to dampen motion. Data will be collected for two more years.
The Tokyo buildings are performing very well, Dr. Liu said, and four more "smart" buildings are on the drawing board. But the technology is still in research and development stages, as safety, reliability, and cost questions are explored in the different designs.
People are going to need "a lot of convincing" before these concepts become acceptable in construction, Dr. Soong said. Whenever human lives are dependent on computers and mechanical systems, he said, people want to be sure about reliability.
Active control systems have long been used in airplanes, ships, spacecraft and other mobile structures. They are just beginning to be applied to stationary objects on land like buildings, bridges and elevated freeways.
 
Disrupting Seismic Waves
 Active control systems will make new buildings more expensive, Dr. Soong noted. But the new technology may also allow architects and engineers to design more economical buildings using lighter, more flexible materials instead of the heavy, steel-reinforced materials used today.
During earthquakes, many buildings collapse when they naturally oscillate at the same frequency as seismic waves traveling through the earth, amplifying their effect, said Dr. Thomas Heaton, a seismologist at the United States Geological Survey in Pasadena. Active control systems might prevent that from happening, he said.
Many skyscrapers sway tens of feet near their top floors in strong winds, Dr. Heaton said, and suspension bridges sometimes bounce vertically by tens of feet. Although such motions do not threaten the safety of the structures, he said, they can make people feel sick and disoriented. Again, active control systems might eliminate this problem.
A different idea for an active system is being developed at the University of Southern California by Dr. Sami Masri and his colleagues in the civil engineering department. When the wind or an earthquake imparts energy to a building, Dr. Masri said, it takes several seconds for the oscillations to build up to potentially damaging levels. Chaos theory, he said, suggests that a random source of energy injected into this rhythmtic flow should disrupt the system.
In Dr. Masri's scheme, the random energy is provided by jet thrusters mounted on the roof. Once again, sensors alert a computer that the building has begun to move and a signal is sent to the thrusters. The thrusters, powered by compressed air, would fire for short periods, just enough to destabilize the oscillations, Dr. Masri said. When the motions ceased, he said, the compressors would be recharged.
All three systems, the two Japanese ones and Dr. Masri's, could be added to old buildings and built into new buildings, bridges and elevated freeways, Dr. Liu said, but not until safety questions are ironed out. Active weight systems require a lot of energy, he said, and may have to be powered by power lines which may be knocked out in an earthquake. People are not going to trust "smart buildings," he said, if sensors, computers and actuators can fail.
An unanswered question, Dr. Masri said, is whether active systems should be used to save lives or merely to make buildings and structures more comfortable.
In the meantime, four new active control systems are in the planning stages. Two will be built overseas, Dr. Liu said. Two others are going to be added to existing buildings in the United States, one of which sways excessively in the wind. Because building owners do not like to admit their problems, he said, the names of the buildings are confidential.

Instead of swaying in response to an earthquake, some new buildings are designed as machines that actively suppress their own vibrations by moving a weight that is about 1 percent of the building's weight. In an experimental building in Japan using the system, the sway was said to be reduced by 80 percent. (Source: Dr. S. Chi Liu) (pg. C10)

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Demise and Pall Of the Indians

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
If Columbus had sailed east, if the Wright brother had preferred trains, if George Steinbrenner had bought the Cleveland Indians . . .
In fact, 20 years ago, Steinbrenner and his partners tried to buy the Cleveland Indians. In fact, they thought they had bought the team from Vernon Stouffer, the latest of the Indians' transient owners. 
 "George knew Stouffer from the time he was a little kid," Gabe Paul, who was long associated with the Indians and was a member of the Steinbrenner group, recalled. "He went to school with Stouffer's son. They thought it was a done deal. George called Vernon, and Vernon was burned up because the story had leaked in the paper. Vernon said, 'Nah, I'm not interested,' and that was it."
That certainly was it for the Indians. Had Steinbrenner bought the club and made the moves that he did in his early years with the Yankees, the history of Cleveland baseball most likely would have taken a dramatic turn and not left the Indians and their fans wondering why, in 1991, the team has been incapable of producing a winner -- a contender even -- for more than three decades.
 
Club Hasn't Won A Division Title
 This is a franchise that has not won any kind of championship since 1954, when they won the pennant before losing the World Series to the New York Giants. The Indians have had only six winning seasons in the last 31 years, finishing higher than fourth only once in that span (third in 1968). They are the only American League East team never to have won a division title. In the last 31 years, except for the strike-split 1981 season, they have not finished a single-digit number of games out of first, but they have finished 20 or more games behind 16 times.
This season has been more of the same for the Indians. They entered last night's game against the Yankees with a 24-48 mark, the worst record in the major leagues that included 20 losses in the last 23 games.
Some people trace the Indians' generation of despair to an alleged curse that Bobby Bragan put on them (he has denied that he did) after they fired him as manager less than halfway into his first season (1958). Others point to their trading of Rocky Colavito, their best player and a favorite of the fans, for Harvey Kuenn just before the start of the 1960 season. The real reasons, however, are more mundane.
*Frequent changes in ownership have created instability and a lack of continuity in planning.
*Given the weak financial status of their owners, the Indians have not had the money needed to develop players in their minor league system, or retain their own players, or go after free agents.
*Their 60-year-old stadium, a dreary, cavernous edifice, works against the team, psychologically and economically.
In their 31 years of misery, the Indians have had more owners than above-.500 records. Beginning with William Daley and running through the current owners, Richard and David Jacobs, the club has had eight owners or ownership groups.
"You've had an awful lot of change in ownership," said Peter Bavasi, who was the Indians' president for two years in the mid-1980's. "Then management changes and plans change. Any time you change plans, you go one step forward, two steps back. That's an element of instability."
 
Ownership of Team Has Often Changed
Hank Peters, who is the current club president and was the club's director of player personnel in the latter half of the 1960's, has experienced the ramifications of change first-hand.
"It seems every few years somebody would sell the club and someone else would buy it," said Peters, who is retiring after this season. "There was no commitment to doing some of the things you need to do to establish competitive and winning teams. The income was limited, and player development was the last thing on the budget."
 Peters recalled the time during his earlier role with the team when the $1.2 million player development budget was to be cut by a third. Peters was asked by Stouffer whether the cut would affect the team.
"I said, 'Are you going to keep the club?' " Peters said. "I said, 'The reason I ask is the things you do in player development are never reflected immediately. If you intend to keep the club for a few years, you've just committed suicide.' That's what has happened. The club keeps committing suicide."
 Bob Quinn, the Reds' vice president and general manager who spent 13 years working for the Indians in player development, recalled how Phil Seghi, the general manager, used to say, "The good news is we're entered in the Indianapolis 500. The bad news is we're driving a Volkswagen."
 The lack of money has also resulted in the departure of many of the team's better players through trades or free agency. Why couldn't the Indians afford to develop players and hold on to them? Paul offered some insight in describing the financial state of some of the owners.
 When Stouffer bought the Indians in 1966, Paul explained, he had recently sold his food business to Litton Industries in a stock transaction. "He took it at 108 and it went down to 8, and we had trouble paying the bills," Paul said. "He had plenty of money when he bought the club and he would've spent it. But things got tough and he couldn't do anything."
 Steve O'Neill, whose purchase of 57 percent of the club brought Paul back to Cleveland in 1978, had "plenty of money," Paul related. "But he felt the 15 to 20 others should share in taking some of the load, and they didn't do it," Paul explained in referring to the minority partners.
 Paul was the largest stockholder, with about 21 percent, in the group that owned the Indians from 1963 until Stouffer bought them. "I got out, Paul said, "because while a lot of the partners would've been willing to put in their share, I didn't have enough money to put in mine."
 
Outmoded Stadium Is Difficult to Play In
If money has retarded the Indians' growth, the absence of growth has kept the fans away from ancient Cleveland Stadium, built as a public works project.
"The park served its purpose," Al Rosen, a former Cleveland star and the San Francisco Giants' general manager, said. "It's outmoded. The stadium is cold. You don't warm up there until July. It's just been a series of bad dreams for them."
 Ralph Kiner, the Met broadcaster, who finished his Hall of Fame playing career with the Indians in 1955, recalled the mammoth stadium as a "very difficult place to play."
"It has to be worse than when I played there," he added. "It certainly isn't any better and it never was any good at its best."
 Doc Edwards, a Met coach who played for the Indians in the early 1960's and who became the Cleveland manager late in 1987 until he was dismissed late in the 1989 season, said the stadium on Lake Erie holds good memories for him. "But for players today," he said, "there's no nostalgia, They're just looking for a place that's comfortable."
 The stadium presents another problem, one that goes to the club's economic difficulties. Although the Indians have held many attendance records and still hold some, the stadium, with 74,483 seats, is just too big.
 "If you win a game in April, you should sell a ticket for August or September," Paul said. "But you don't do that in Cleveland. They wait until the day before the game. Then you have to have a winning streak. Nobody ever has been turned down in the Cleveland ball park, not even in the World Series. When they had the big crowd of more than 80,000 they didn't turn anyone down, They squeezed them in."
 The Indians, though, not only don't generate an advance sale, but they also don't get much of a game-day sale. They haven't drawn 2 million fans in a season since 1949, and they have attracted less than 1 million in 22 of the last 31 years. This season they are averaging 15,000 a game, lowest in the league.
 "The stadium can be depressing because you can have a pretty good-sized crowd and not notice it," Jeff Torborg, a former Indian manager who is now the Chicago White Sox manager, said.
 
Lack of Enthusiasm From the Fans
 The stadium atmosphere, Quinn said, does not breed enthusiasm.
 "It's very difficult to play at the stadium," the Reds executive said. "You say a player should put on the uniform and go out and play. But if you walk into a house and it's gloomy and it's been lived in by a couple in their 80's, it's not as perky as a young couple's house. The stadium is a gloomy place. A new stadium would do so much for the psyche of the 25 players on their roster. You'd see a marked improvement in the caliber of play."
 The Indians have not played at even a mediocre level this season. And there's no improvement in sight from the team that became even less experienced last week when Tom Candiotti, a veteran pitcher, was traded because he planned to leave as a free agent after the season.
 But the future does hold one bright hope. A new stadium is planned, although the Indians, the city and Cuyahoga County reached a self-imposed deadline Sunday without having reached agreement on the financing package and a lease. Despite the unfinished negotiations, officials are optimistic that they will reach agreement and make the new stadium a reality. Meanwhile, the Cleveland fans wait for positive signs that would jerk them out of their indifference and their resignation to having a disaster for a team.
 "It's been discouraging, no question about that," said Morton Klein, a 69-year-old Cleveland area resident who has been an Indians' fan for 60 years, and who in his youth was employed as a stadium vendor and usher. "But you become complacent and you don't expect them to win the pennant. I don't. It's discouraging, but we've gotten so we don't expect anything anymore. We go crazy if in July the team is still in contention."

HEADLINE: Base Closings, Without Politics

 BODY:
A Federal commission's recommendations for shutting 25 more military bases have caused understandable anguish in the communities that will lose thousands of jobs and millions in income. But closing bases is as necessary as it is painful. The commission did its unpleasant work with intelligence, compassion and admirable independence.
The commission was created by Congress to handle a hot potato that the members of Congress were afraid to handle themselves. The seven commissioners didn't look too comfortable doing it, either. They sat in open session all day Sunday and into the night -- gavel-to-gavel on C-SPAN television -- discussing, debating and finally casting their fateful votes. It was high drama, and a rare display of decision-making in the open. 
 The commission received the Pentagon's list of proposed closings in mid-April. In a short 10 weeks, the commissioners mastered a mountain of information. Courageously, they kept both the Pentagon and the politicians at arm's length, challenging the military's arguments for closing the bases as coolly as they examined local pleas to keep them open.
It is no mystery why Congress ducked this chore. Thousands of jobs are at stake. Small towns and big cities long dependent on huge bases like Fort Devens in Massachusetts, Long Beach Naval Station in California and the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard will have to build a new economic base. Families will have to build new lives. But there's time. The closings will come gradually, over several years, and the Pentagon stands ready to help with the adjustment.
The commission's recommendations are only the first step. President Bush, who has two weeks to accept or reject the whole list, says he is likely to accept it as is, even though it differs somewhat from the Pentagon's. It will then be Congress's turn to accept or reject the whole package.
Some members with targeted bases will try to scuttle the whole procedure. There were unsuccessful attempts to kill the first round of closings in 1989, and there are already signs of scheming against the new list; for example, defenders of the Philadelphia yard are pushing appropriations for ship repairs to keep it going.
The overriding consideration is, and should be, wasted taxpayer dollars. It sounds cruel to yank the props out from communities whose livelihood depends on the military's presence, but continuing to pour hundreds of millions of dollars into installations that are now obsolete is inexcusable.

HEADLINE: Labor: Key to New York's Crisis

 BODY:
All the celebrating at City Hall because New York met its budget deadline is understandable but premature. Of course it is better to have a budget than not to have one. But the new budget that emerged over the weekend is more a draft than a finished document. It relies on optimistic hopes for tax collections, and it is still missing one big piece of the budgetary puzzle: a contribution from the municipal unions.
Yesterday, labor leaders indicated that they would be willing to make concessions. But what a paltry beginning it was. Labor was talking of concessions worth about $100 million in the new fiscal year while the city was seeking about $600 million. 
 If labor leaders do make meaningful concessions, and can buy back some of the thousands of layoffs that began Friday, the city truly will have something to celebrate, despite a budget that will include higher taxes and many painful cuts.
What can the unions do? Precisely what they and city bargainers have been talking about. They can agree to reduced city payments to the union welfare funds, and rescind part of the wage increases several of them won only months ago. The city couldn't afford those increases in the first place, and now it could dearly use some of that money to soften the impact of its austere budget.
Union concessions in the form of furloughs or wage deferrals, like those already negotiated with the United Federation of Teachers, are not the sole answer to the city's economic problems. But they can save the jobs of thousands of men and women instead of forcing layoffs that worsen the city's economy and deprive all citizens of services.
Moreover, labor's cooperation would pave the way for the Municipal Assistance Corporation to help the city with $1 billion through debt refinancing over four years. This is money the M.A.C. board and its chairman, Felix Rohatyn, will not make available unless confident the city will invest it in vital services and not give all of it to the unions.
M.A.C. wants to see a long-term restructuring of city government that would produce a leaner, more efficient, and therefore less costly work force. Productivity savings, work rule changes and a gradual shrinking of the work force -- instead of destructive layoffs all at once -- are crucial.
New York City's fiscal crisis is not labor's doing. But the municipal unions are now in a position to repeat their statesmanlike role during the last fiscal crisis by again recognizing that their fate and the city's are one.

HEADLINE: Much Too Soon to End South Africa Sanctions;
Reinvestment

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Even if the United States lifts South Africa sanctions, the economic gloom in South Africa will not correspondingly be lifted (news article, June 18). 
 The adverse effects of sanctions should compel Congress to adopt "reverse sanctions." Our new policy toward South Africa should be designed to enhance South Africa's Western-style capitalism, which in turn will insure the success of whatever new political system develops.
We should turn the sanctions legislation upside down. Why not reduce taxes, tariffs and quotas on banned South African products and legislate tax and other incentives for Americans to do business with South Africa? The unemployment rate in South Africa would go down, the economy would become more robust, and other African states would benefit.
We must bond ourselves to an economically strong, post-apartheid evolving democracy in South Africa and help develop a multiracial middle class there. However, business executives will not risk the boycotts and adverse publicity of years past unless they have assurances from South Africa that their investments will not be expropriated and assurances from our Government that sanctions will not be renewed.
Merely ending sanctions is not enough. Clear and irrevocable signals from our Government affirmatively encouraging our return to South Africa are needed.
Those most vocal in favor of sanctions should consider raising their voices loudest in support of reverse sanctions.

HEADLINE: Oil Drilling Weighed In Peru Nature Area

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru

 BODY:
AN American oil company's plan to drill for oil in Peru's largest Amazon nature reserve is presenting this impoverished country with a cruel choice.
On one hand, oil revenues are desperately needed to revive an economy that shrank 30 percent in the last three years. With proven oil reserves down to about one-third the level of a decade ago, Peru this year became a net oil importer. 
 "Let's ask, 'What is good for the people of Peru?' " said Al Curry, operations manager for Texas Crude Oil Inc., the company that plans to produce oil in the Pacaya-Samiria reserve. "This goes above and beyond the right of someone in California, New York or Lima to say, 'Let's preserve the trees.' "
On the other hand, the Amazon reserve is a critical habitat for gray and pink river dolphins, black and speckled caiman, Amazonian manatees, giant South American river turtles and saddleback tamarins. A largely pristine stretch of rain forest the size of Massachusetts, the Pacaya-Samiria reserve contains more than 150 oxbow lakes and a wide variety of riverine forests.
"Because this is a flood zone with very slow-moving waters, an oil spill would cause a very serious pollution problem," said Antonio Brack, a Peruvian biologist with Asociacion Amazonia, a private group here that opposes the oil contract.
In April, Peru's official gazette published an executive decree granting Texas Crude exploration rights to a 2.4-million-acre tract in Peru's northern Amazon. Almost 75 percent of the exploration block is inside the Pacaya-Samiria, one of two reserves in Peru's Amazon.
 
Opponents Rally
 But recently Peruvians have rallied to urge Peru's state company, Petroperu, not to sign the contract. Last month, a protest strike supported by the regional government shut down Iquitos, the largest city in Peru's Amazon, for one day.
Opponents say the contract violates an environmental code signed into law last September by President Alberto Fujimori. Under this code, it is illegal to explore or to extract nonrenewable natural resources in natural reserves.
Noting that only 6 percent of Peru's 286,000-square-mile Amazon region is protected in parks, Mr. Brack said: "We are not against development. We conservationists only ask, 'Why do they have to explore in a reserve?' "
Demonstrating a growing cooperation between South American and North American environmental groups, an international coalition is now putting pressure on the Texas oil company.
In the first week of May, Rainforest Action Network, a group based in San Francisco, sent an "Action Alert" to 36,000 people on its mailing list. Asserting that American oil companies "can operate in the Amazon with almost none of the environmental controls imposed on them in the United States," the network calls for a letter-writing campaign against the contract. The alert suggests including the statement, "I am sure that Texas Crude does not want to develop a reputation as a company that destroys rain forests."
 
More Contracts, More Scrutiny
 Mr. Curry of Texas Crude rejected such criticism. "We think we are on solid legal ground," he said in a telephone interview from Houston. "We have worked around the world in some of the most environmentally sensitive areas, none the least of which is California. Contracts in Peru have requirements for environmental impact statements. They have set certain guidelines that are not going to allow people to rape and pillage the land."
Environmental scrutiny in increasing as more and more oil companies penetrate the Amazon.
In mid-May an international consortium announced the discovery of a one-billion-to-two-billion-barrel field in Colombia's Amazon. In early June, Bolivia signed a contract with an international consortium to explore and exploit a 5,700-square-mile tract of the Bolivian Amazon. Also in June, Petroperu started sending to 180 foreign companies maps and technical information on oil exploration areas in the Peruvian Amazon.
Last year Occidental Petroleum dropped talks with Petroperu after the discovering that the block under consideration was in Manu National Park, Peru's other Amazon reserve. "Once we checked it out and found out where the block was, we told them we were not interested," Philip Zander, an Occidental spokesman, said in a telephone interview.
To spotlight pollution caused by careless oil-drilling practices in the Amazon, the Natural Resources Defense Council in February published "Amazon Crude," a 130-page study of oil production in Ecuador's jungle.
 
Keeping Settlers Out
 A northern neighbor of Peru, Ecuador relies on oil exports for half of its foreign exchange and is actively seeking foreign investment to maintain oil production. In April, Donald Castillo, Ecuador's Energy Minister, said he expected to sign Amazon exploration contracts with three foreign companies.
"As a result of the Persian Gulf war, oil companies are going to be intensifying their search for oil in other parts of the world," predicted S. Jacob Scherr, a defense council lawyer who worked on the study. "The last frontier is the tropical forest."
Environmentalists fear that oil exploration will involve roads, opening protected areas to the slash-and-burn farming techniques of settlers.
On Thursday, an environmental group in Quito, Acion Ecologica, led demonstrations outside local offices of Texaco , Conoco and British Gas to protest drilling plans in the Amazon.
Largely because of this intense attention, Conoco Ecuador Ltda., a subsidiary of E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, has drawn up an elaborate program to minimize impact of oil production in the Huaoroni Indigenous Reserve and in the Yasuni National Park, Ecuador's largest park.
"Not one inch of the access road will be open to colonists," Edward J. Davies, president of Conoco Ecuador, said of a 90-mile road that the oil company plans to build into the fields.
 
Enter U.S. Environmentalists
 Even before the Texas Crude contract was announced, the Nature Conservancy, of Arlington, Va., made the Pacaya-Samiria reserve part of its "Parks in Peril" program.
Illustrative of growing efforts of United States environmental groups to make functioning parks out of Latin America's "paper parks," the Nature Conservancy plans next year to start training rangers and to provide boats, radios and control posts. Funds are to come from a $100,000 grant from the United States Agency for International Development and from a matching grant by the private conservation group.
Adding urgency to the effort is the desperate poverty in Peru's Amazon. This poverty was highlighted recently by two disasters. Since March, a cholera epidemic has preyed on the poor hygiene of slum dwellers in Iquitos, killing about 300. And in early May, an overloaded river ferry smashed into an empty Petroperu oil tanker, killing about 150 passengers.
Texas Crude maintains that the greatest economic aid to the Amazon would come from oil production. Mr. Curry noted that in the last decade only one foreign oil company, Mobil Oil, signed an exploration contract with Petroperu.
Last December, Maoists guerrillas attacked Mobil's exploration base in the Amazon, 250 miles southwest of where Texas Crude plans to work. The guerrillas, from the Shining Path movement, killed two people and destroyed millions of dollars worth of computers and communications systems. Mobil has returned and expects to drill its first exploratory wells in November.
But now the Shining Path guerrilla movement has turned its wrath on Texas Crude. Two weeks ago, the movement's newspaper, El Diario, threatened to apply "popular justice" against "the imperialists and their businesses like Texas Crude."

HEADLINE: What Price Yugoslavia?

BYLINE: By Michael Scammell; Michael Scammell, professor of Russian literature at Cornell, is a frequent visitor to Yugoslavia.

DATELINE: ITHACA, N.Y.

 BODY:
How is it that whenever some small European nation seeks to establish freedom, democracy and independence for itself, the U.S. invariably backs away from these principles and turns a blind eye to its suppression by force? So Poland in 1953, Hungary in 1956, Czechoslovakia in 1968 and Poland again in 1980. The Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have hardly fared any better, and now it seems to be the turn of Croatia and Slovenia.
U.S. opposition to their aspirations is said to be motivated by a need to preserve Yugoslavia's "unity and territorial integrity." Secretary of State James Baker says he is convinced that "separation will lead to violence," and that we "will not reward unilateral actions." 
 The reasoning seems to be that if Slovenia and Croatia persist with their plans for more independence, the federal authorities in Yugoslavia will be justified in unleashing the army again, as they did this weekend. Dark hints are also being dropped about Greek and Bulgarian designs on Macedonia, Albanian claims on Kosovo and even Italian claims on Istria, while U.S. statesmen are fond of recalling, with divine irrelevance, that "World War I began in the Balkans."
These arguments are bogus. Talk of preserving the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia would make some sense if the country were threatened with invasion, which seemed to be the case after the break with the Soviets in 1948. But that threat has disappeared. As for Balkan irredentism, more or less democratic revolutions have taken place in every one of Yugoslavia's formerly Communist neighbors.
These small states, all with shattered economies and huge social problems, have neither the means nor the will for expansion or conquest. If Greece and Italy actually presented a problem, which is doubtful, they could easily be restrained through their membership in the European Community.
The situation in Yugoslavia offers a rare opportunity for the U.S. and the European Community to bring about constructive change. It is true that the Serbian Government is wedded to violence, as its brutal suppression of Albanians in Kosovo demonstrated. It has also manipulated the federal presidency to suit its own ends and is clearly behind the federal army's decision to invade Slovenia. But the present U.S. policy of insisting on federal unity at any price and rigidly refusing even to consider Slovenian and Croatian demands constitutes a submission to Serbian blackmail.
While the Soviet Union was in its expansionist phase, U.S. passivity toward Eastern Europe was understandable, if not forgivable. But in the Balkans, the Soviet Union is no longer a player, and Serbian power cannot be compared to that of the Soviets. The Serbian economy, also in ruins, depends on Western credits. In fact, Serbia is an anachronism -- an authoritarian island in a sea of nascent democracies.
All this presents the U.S. with a clear choice. We ought to tell the Yugoslav republics that we support efforts to introduce political pluralism, a market economy and legal safeguards for minorities. Not just in words but in deed. This would mean support for Slovenia and Croatia, where these principles are observed far more than in the rest of Yugoslavia, and unequivocal opposition to the violence, corruption and repression on the old Communist model, even if it is done in the name of a unitary state.
We can do this by placing conditions on further economic aid to Yugoslavia. The European Community made a start on Sunday by threatening to suspend up to $1 billion in aid unless the present hostilities ceased. But the U.S. can go further and exert greater leverage by discriminating between republics that honor democratic principles and those that don't.
Paradoxically, such a policy would be far more likely to preserve Yugoslavia in its present form than tacit support for armed force and invasion. The Slovenians and Croatians have bent over backward to avoid proclaiming outright independence, and even now are stopping short of secession. What they need is reasonable assurance that they can progress at least in step with the other countries of Eastern Europe. Strong U.S. support for a Yugoslavia in which democratic freedoms are prized above enforced unity would bring them back to the negotiating table.
Strong democratic forces have been gathering in Serbia, too, and are waiting in the wings for the fever to pass. We can either prolong their agony, and that of all the Yugoslav peoples, by encouraging violence, or we can shorten it by exerting pressure in the right places. Let's hope that we get it right this time.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
AIDS Testing Doesn't Pay

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
THIRTY-THREE state legislatures have decided it is bad social policy to permit discrimination against workers with the AIDS virus. Now, two economists at Columbia University have found that AIDS testing, the keystone to discrimination, is also bad business policy. The costs of screening prospective employees, say David Bloom and Sherry Glied, far exceed the likely savings on insurance.
Their research results, published last week in Science magazine, should be welcome news to people with a healthy respect for the power of the profit motive: If testing did indeed pay, it would put the interests of corporate America in direct conflict with those of society. 
 The numbers also suggest that involuntary screening for genetic diseases is likely to remain a hypothetical threat for years to come. Genetic screens, Ms. Glied notes, are more expensive than tests for the AIDS virus, while the potential rewards to employers are much smaller because the identifiable diseases are less common.
But the analysis leaves moral loose ends. While most employers apparently do not stand to gain from AIDS testing, they may still have an incentive to avoid hiring workers in high-risk groups. Thus the inability to test for the virus could increase discrimination against male workers who are (or might be) gay.
It is worth remembering, too, that employers worried about AIDS costs retain the option of paring the insurance of all employees against chronic illnesses. The only certain way to eliminate the incentives of companies to favor healthier workers is to get them out of the business of health insurance.
In a city with high medical costs like New York, the typical large company offering generous insurance benefits must pay out an extra $115,000 to cover the expenses of treating AIDS. Premature death reduces a company's pension liability. Moreover, just one-third of employees who test positive for the virus can be expected to come down with a serious illness during their tenure with the company.
But there is no way this calculus can be reworked to avoid an unpleasant truth: On average, it would save a large employer in a high-cost city about $32,000 to deny work to an HIV-positive job applicant. Even a small company with less comprehensive insurance coverage that is in a city with lower treatment costs can expect to save several thousand dollars just by saying no to HIV-positive applicants.
The redeeming catch, note Mr. Bloom and Ms. Glied, is that AIDS screening is expensive and few testing programs are likely to unearth a single worker who tests positive. For a small employer drawing from the same low-risk population pool that donates blood to the Red Cross, the typical cost of identifying one HIV-positive applicant would exceed $300,000.
The researchers concede that testing costs for large employers are lower, and that some may draw the bulk of their workers from groups with a higher than average incidence of the virus. But they argue that only a small minority of companies -- the fashion and entertainment industries, perhaps -- could make a case for mass screening.
The states with the highest concentrations of AIDS cases already bar discrimination against carriers of the virus. And last year Congress passed legislation prohibiting any form of medical screening by companies with more than 15 employees after July 1994. But this will not necessarily stop -- indeed, it may encourage -- employers to discriminate against workers whom they guess are at risk.
Happily, Mr. Bloom and Ms. Glied believe that would rarely be rational: The percentage of, say, never-married men over the age of 30 who are HIV-positive is very small. Thus an employer who burns time and money turning down an otherwise satisfactory job applicant on such crude demographic criteria is probably a dumb employer.
But there are dumb employers. And in any event, the AIDS-testing ban certainly could be felt in perverse ways, increasing the impulse to discriminate against openly gay males on the chance they might carry the virus.
Perhaps a more significant hazard in barring testing for AIDS (or any other expensive-to-treat disease) is that it reduces the incentive of employers to provide comprehensive health benefits. Some may drop insurance coverage altogether. More insidiously they may cap benefits, covering workers for the odd $12,000 appendectomy but leaving them vulnerable to catastrophically expensive illnesses.
The testing question is thus a tiny piece in the exasperatingly complex health insurance puzzle. Most Americans depend on their employers for insurance, and most employers have never doubted the logic of providing it. But with premiums representing an ever growing share of labor costs and screening soon to be barred by law, prospective medical bills are bound to affect decisions about who is hired and who is insured.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Handleman Deal Draws Praise

BYLINE: By Doron P. Levin

 BODY:
WHEN a movie becomes a successful home video or when Michael Jackson releases a hit recording there is rejoicing not just in Hollywood, but in Troy, Mich., home of the Handleman Corporation.
Handleman stocks videos, CD's, cassettes, computer software and other entertainment items on the shelves of mass merchandisers like K Mart and Wal-Mart. While most video fans are renters, the market for purchased videos is sizable and growing. 
 On June 25, Handleman, the entertainment industry's leading "rack jobber," said it had agreed in principle to buy the assets of Lieberman Enterprises Inc., a leading competitor. Lieberman is a subsidiary of Live Entertainment Inc. and is based in Bloomington, Minn. Carolco Pictures Inc. owns 54 percent of Live Entertainment. Both companies are based in Los Angeles.
Wall Street generally has applauded the acquisition, in the belief that antitrust regulators will approve the deal and that the reduced competition will help Handleman improve earnings.
Moreover, the sale should improve Live Entertainment's prospects, since the Lieberman division lost more than $12 million in its latest fiscal year. This also might mean a more expensive price tag for Carolco if it buys the shares of Live Entertainment it does not own.
Handleman's stock closed at $14 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, up from $12 on June 6, before the announcement that it was negotiating with Live Entertainment.
But in the longer term there may be dark clouds looming before Handleman. A rack jobber owns the merchandise, stocks store shelves, and keeps track of what's hot and what's not, acting as a distributor for the entertainment industry. But some retailers, notably Wal-Mart, are exploring the possibility of removing the extra layer of expense by buying or setting up rack-jobbing operations of their own. Last year, for example, Wal-Mart bought Western Merchandiser, another rack jobber.
The retailing industry's problems have had an impact on rack jobbers. For example, when Hills Department Stores filed for bankruptcy protection in February, Handleman was listed as the largest unsecured merchandise creditor, with accounts receivable of $7.1 million.
Michael Hamilton, a financial analyst with the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis, thinks the $100 million price is not much to pay for Lieberman's sales, since the sum includes inventory and fixtures. "This will help Handleman spread its fixed costs over a greater base," he said.
Lisbeth Barron, an analyst at S. G. Warburg & Company in New York, said, "Handleman paid a lot for Lieberman but it was a great acquisition." Warburg valued Lieberman at $88 million. Ms. Barron noted, however, that the acquisition would not include some small Lieberman units worth $10 million to $15 million.
But Warburg is putting a "hold" rather than a "buy" recommendation on Handleman because of concerns about retailing and entertainment, Ms. Barron said. "The music business in particular is so dependent on hits that there are dry spells," she said.
Louis A. Kircos, Handleman's senior vice president, declined to be interviewed because he was too busy with the details of the acquisition, an assistant said. It is understood that the company recently told analysts that it expected a number of big music and video hits in the coming year. It mentioned the artists Vanilla Ice, Michael Jackson, Aretha Franklin and Bob Seger, and the movies "Home Alone" and an animated version of "Robin Hood."
Handleman's 1991 fourth quarter, ended April 27, showed a 12 percent fall in sales and flat earnings. Weak retail sales because of the recession were one reason for the mediocre showing, but the company also complained that the quarter lacked "mega-hit videos" comparable to last year's "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," "Honey I Shrunk the Kids," and "Lethal Weapons II."
David Katz, chief investment officer for Matrix Asset Management in New York, has owned about 100,000 of Handleman's 32 million shares outstanding for the last year and thinks the stock should reach the $19 to $20 level in the next year to 18 months.
Matrix's investment philosophy is to buy stocks with strong balance sheets that are selling at a one-third discount to what Matrix considers fair market value -- and then sell at that value. Using this method, Matrix bought Handleman after the stock market crash of 1987 and sold it six months later at a 60 percent profit. Mr. Katz estimates that Handleman is now worth $19 to $20 a share, which is why his company bought at $12.
"Basically they were able to buy a 25 percent to 30 percent increase in sales for a good price, and that makes them a stronger player," Mr. Katz said. "They won't hurt the balance sheet doing it either." Furthermore, he does not think that K Mart is going to buy its own rack jobber. "They've already got a lot on their plate revamping their stores," he said.

HEADLINE: Labor Dept. Outlines Job Skills Students Will Need in Future

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2

 BODY:
As part of the Bush Administration's effort to promote education as a Republican initiative, Labor Secretary Lynn Martin today made public a report outlining what American students must learn in school to compete in the workplace of the future.
The report, "What Work Requires of Schools: A SCANS Report for America 2000," defines the skills young people must have "to hold a decent job and earn a decent living." 
 In an interview today, Ms. Martin said, "More than half of young people leaving high school won't have the knowledge or foundation required" to achieve either goal. Some 70 percent of students do not go on to college, she added, but enter the workforce.
The report also says that only with a skilled labor force can the United States be economically competitive in the global marketplace.
"Employers and educators must come together in a marriage of necessity if our youngsters are to be prepared for meeting the challenges of securing rewarding and well-paid work," Ms. Martin said. "The fact is the world's technological explosion has caught many of our students by surprise."
The report, the result of a year's work by the 31-member Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills, is similar to one issued by the National Assessment of Education Progress, a federally supported testing group, and carries no legal obligation to be acted on. But the commission's document is based on interviews with employers, managers and workers, who described in detail the skills needed to perform their jobs.
Besides reading, writing and mathematics, the report outlines five areas of competency for students: resources, information, interpersonal abilities, social and organizational systems, and technology.
Resource competency, for example, involves knowing how to allocate time, money, materials and staff. Interpersonal abilities involves learning how to work on teams, teach others and negotiate.
 
No New Funds Recommended
 The report encourages parents, businesses and schools to give as much importance to the learning of these skills as is currently given to the acquisition of basic reading, writing and mathematics.
But schools would not be required to change their curriculums. Rather, Ms. Martin said, such decisions should be left to the local level. The commission did not recommend any new expenditures for the program.
William E. Brock, chairman of the commission and a former Labor Secretary, said the report outlines the "practical steps we need to take to achieve the National Education Goals," a reference to the goals for the year 2000 that President Bush and the nation's Governors agreed on in 1989. In April 1990, Elizabeth Dole, who was the Labor Secretary at that time, established the commission and charged it with developing a test to determine whether 16-year-olds had the appropriate skills to enter the work force.
Mr. Brock said that instead of using testing, students could be awarded "merit badges" at each stage of competency.
Ms. Martin, a former high school teacher and former Representative from Illinois, said that she was taking the program to the Labor Department's 10 regional offices so that it could be made available to state and local officials, to business executives and educators as well.
She noted that the Indiana would be using the report's five competency areas in a program, scheduled to begin next week, in which high school students survey employers about job skills and report back to junior high school students.
Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers, with 750,000 members, praised the commission findings, but said that making changes in education requires "the money to implement it."
William Kolberg, president of the National Alliance of Business, also praised the report, saying, "The realities of international business competition underline the need for highly skilled workers who have abilities well beyond the three R's."

HEADLINE: Sequent Computer Expects Loss in the Second Quarter

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, July 2

 BODY:
Sequent Computer Systems Inc. said today that it would report a loss for the second quarter, citing the combined effect of the recession and a significant decline in orders from original equipment manufacturers -- companies that resell other manufacturers' machines under their own names.
Sequent's largest original equipment customer, the Unisys Corporation, has had severe financial problems because of the recession, which has limited its ability to resell Sequent computers. 
 Sequent said it would restructure to focus on direct sales. The company, based in Beaverton, Ore., added that it would maintain its original equipment manufacturers business with Unisys but would not initiate any new original equipment business.
Sequent's shares closed today at $9.75, down $2, in over-the-counter trading.
"While our primary business of selling computers directly to end-user commercial customers continues to grow significantly, the recession gripping this industry is not allowing us to grow fast enough to offset the decline in our sales to O.E.M. customers," said Scott Gibson, Sequent's president and co-chief executive.
Sequent said it expected revenues of $49 million to $51 million, down from $58.2 million in the second quarter of last year. It said it expected a loss substantially greater than the $7 million loss it had in the first quarter. In the 1990's second quarter, Sequent earned $5.7 million, or 24 cents a share.
Sequent said it planned significant cost-cutting measures, including a 7 to 9 percent reduction in its work force by July 15. The company will also restrict capital purchases, reduce travel costs and freeze salaries. The company said it expected these measures to be temporary.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Soars Against Mark; Level Highest in 20 Months

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar closed yesterday at its highest level against the German mark in 20 months, pushed up by turmoil in Yugoslavia and data indicating strength in the United States economy.
The dollar closed at 1.8345 marks, up from Monday's 1.8305 marks, but still shy of the 1.8415-mark close reached Nov. 17, 1989. 
 The dollar also rose against the Japanese yen, closng at 138.75 Japanese yen, up from 138.42 on Monday.
"It looks like the market likes the upside" for the dollar, said Frank Pusateri, vice president at the First National Bank of Boston.
Gold prices ended the day lower. On the Commodity Exchange in New York gold closed at $367.90 an ounce, down 30 cents.
At least 10 Yugoslav soldiers were killed in fighting with Slovenian nationalists yesterday, as another fragile truce collapsed between the federal Government and the breakaway republic. Yugoslav warplanes bombed Slovenian fighters, after they fired on federal tanks.
"The situation has gotten quite a bit out of hand," said Belal Khan, corporate dealer for Fuji Bank. Because of Yugoslavia's proximity to Germany, the mark suffers from the unrest, traders said.
The dollar was also helped by a Commerce Department report that factory orders rose 2.9 percent in May. The increase was the largest since March 1990 and higher than economists had forecast.
Higher factory orders were seen as a sign of a rebounding economy, making the dollar more attractive.
The mark was also hampered by continued worries over Germany's investment rules. Although the German Government has said it is not considering reintroducing a withholding tax on investment earnings, it is considering a relaxation of bank secrecy rules to combat tax evasion.
Bankers said such a move could prompt capital flight. Investors are staying out of marks while they wait for a clearer idea of what the German Government will do.
The British pound closed at $1.6030, down from $1.6070 Monday. The dollar ended at 1.5825 Swiss francs, up from 1.5685, and, against the Canadian currency, at 1.1425 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1430 on Monday. Against the French franc, the dollar closed at 6.2125 francs, up from 6.1985 on Monday.

HEADLINE: American Air Pessimistic

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: LONDON, July 2

 BODY:
American Airlines, the nation's largest carrier, said today that the recession and the Persian Gulf war had lowered air traffic and created an unsatisfactory second quarter.
If American's problems are mirrored by the industry, it would be the third straight quarter that weak traffic, higher fuel costs and the recession severely hurt airline earnings. 
 The AMR Corporation, American's parent, lost $195.6 million in the first quarter of the year and $215.1 million in the fourth quarter of last year.
In trading on the New York Stock Exchange today, AMR's shares fell 87.5 cents, closing at $61.875.
Since late last year, four United States carriers have sought bankruptcy protection, seeking time to reorganize and pay their debts while they keep flying. They are Midway Airlines Inc., Pan American World Airways Inc., America West Airlines Inc. and Continental Airlines Inc.
Robert L. Crandall, chairman of AMR, said the economic downturn and effects of the war had severely reduced demand for air travel. "That is why we have lost substantial amounts of money in each of the previous two quarters and why the second quarter will not be a very satisfactory financial period for us, either," he added.
But Mr. Crandall, who made his remarks after American began its new service to London's Heathrow Airport, gave no specific projection of the company's second-quarter results.

HEADLINE: Stocks Mixed, With Dow Rising by 14.31

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
After Monday's big run-up, stock prices turned mixed yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising 14.31, to 2,972.72. and the rest of the market giving ground.
Walt Disney and Alcoa accounted for almost 90 percent of the Dow's gain. 
 Activity was sluggish, with 157.3 million shares traded, down from 167.5 million on Monday.
The level of trading is particularly weak because it covers not just the normal trading day between 9:30 A.M. and 4 P.M. but also after-hours dealings between 4:15 and 5:15 P.M. in effect since June 13.
Even program trading subsided. Birinyi Associates, which monitors such activity, said it spotted only one 13-minute selling wave starting at 10:30 and that it lopped less than 3 points off the Dow.
Disney jumped 5 1/8, to 118 7/8, while Alcoa rose 1 7/8, to 68 5/8, both in heavy trading.
While there did not appear to be any news to account for the Alcoa rise, Alan S. Gould, entertainment analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds, recommended Disney yesterday after recommending it last week. He said it had had strong advance hotel reservations at Walt Disney World near Orlando, Fla.
Alan Kassan, media analyst for Morgan Stanley, said Disney's attendance had been "a little better" since the opening of its 3-D Muppet movie attraction at its Florida studio theme park. Moreover, he said, "its cold stretch in the movie business seems to have come to an end with "What About Bob?" and "Rocketeer," new movies that he said had "done reasonably well."
 
Mending of Economy Seen
 New data released yesterday showed that the economy was mending steadily but Wall Street seemingly paid little attention to the news.
Factory orders rose 2.9 percent in May for the biggest gain in over a year, while consumer confidence, as measured by the University of Michigan, rose last month to the highest point since the Persian Gulf war.
Traders, however, argued that the market had already had plenty of evidence that things were getting better.
"The market," said Peter G. Grennan, senior vice president of Shearson Lehman Brothers, "has had enough statistics showing the economy's turning upward; now it wants earnings."
"It believes the economy is going to improve," he said. "This is up and that's up. It's in the market; it no longer impresses the market. The market wants to see better earnings in the third and fourth quarters. And based on what it sees in the second quarter coming out now, it'll get a better feel on what's coming in the third and fourth quarter. So the market's on hold for the moment."
Asked why the Dow industrials were up and the rest of the market was down, the Shearson executive said that traders had become very selective in their buying, such as the concentration yesterday on Alcoa and Disney.
He argued that in a long market rise such as this one institutional buying tended to narrow, that is, "they go after fewer stocks and get more selective as the market rises or, as now, plateaus on top of a big rise."
The market, he said, "is trying to figure whether we go down on the other side of the plateau or go to a higher plateau."
Except for a bit of a decline at the start of trading yesterday, the blue chips tended to move ahead for most of the day. At 10:30, in spite of professional program selling, the Dow advanced a bit, fell a bit and zigzagged its way upward for the rest of the session.
In a weak insurance group, Conseco, the life insurer, rose 1 5/8, to 37 1/4. It split the stock 2 for 1 payable July 1.
Tenneco slid 4 3/8, to 35 1/2, on 1.9 million shares after Paul Milbauer of C. J. Lawrence dropped his "buy/ hold" rating on the oil company and cut his earnings estimate. Other oil stocks weakened, with two Dow stocks, Chevron and Exxon down, respectively, 1/2, to 71 1/8, and 1 1/8, to 58 3/4.
A. T. & T. led the New York Stock Exchange's active list, rising 5/8, to 39 1/4, on 2.2 million shares after Jack Grubman of Paine Webber recommended it. He pointed to strong second-quarter forecasts and expectations that it would be able to work out an accounting problem in its takeover of NCR.
Technology stocks had a bad day, with the Pacific Stock Exchange's high-tech index down slightly. Intel, the semiconductor producer, topped the Nasdaq active list, dropping 2 5/8, to 42 7/8, with 9.1 million shares changing hands. Drew D. Peck, semiconductor analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, cut his rating on Intel from moderately attractive to netural. Reuters said he had found that demand for its 386 chip had dropped "rather sharply."
I.B.M. rose 3/4, to 99 1/8, and Compaq Computer 1 1/8, to 32 1/2, but Microsoft fell 3 1/4, to 68 1/8.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Notes and Bonds Little Changed

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
More optimistic news about the economy had only marginal impact on the credit markets yesterday, where prices of Treasury notes and bonds were little changed in thin trading.
A sharp increase in factory orders in May, the largest monthly rise in more than a year, and an improvement in the consumer confidence survey conducted by the University of Michigan were both seen as signs that the economy is continuing to improve. 
William Melton, vice president and chief economist at IDS Financial Services Inc. in Minneapolis, said the rise in orders and shipments, the second straight monthly increase, "tell you about as loud and clear as they can that the production process is picking up."
The pickup in orders, however, will not necessarily produce a big rise in inventories, Mr. Melton added. The fact that orders and shipments have moved together for the last several months reflects the increasingly widespread use by business of "just in time" delivery methods.
"For a long time a lot of people have regarded factory orders as a leading indicator, but that is less and less true," he said.
"Because orders and shipments increasingly move in concert, you are not likely to get a big bulge in inventories as you have at the beginning of previous recoveries. In the past, the rebound in inventories has accounted for between one-quarter and one-third of total output. This time it will be more like 10 percent."
Yesterday's reports came on the heels of the release Monday of a survey from the nation's purchasing managers indicating that activity in the manufacturing sector was much improved during June.
"We have gotten a lot of very strong economic data over the last couple of days, but right now the market is paralyzed," one government bond trader said.
"The fundamental news has been a negative, but right now are not many securities with maturities of more than five years to trade. That lack of supply is allowing prices to stay higher than they otherwise would be."
Traders said the stronger than expected reports have given market participants little choice but to position themselves very conservatively in advance of the release Friday of June employment data.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 96 21/32 late yesterday, unchanged on the day, to yield 8.43 percent, the same level as late Monday.
Among Treasury note issues, the 8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 98 10/32, down 1/32, to yield 8.13 percent. And the 7 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 1/32, down 2/32, to yield 6.98 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were narrowly mixed.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.55 percent late yesterday, down two basis points, or two one-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by one basis point, to a late offered rate of 5.70 percent.
An announcement that the New Jersey Turnpike Authority intends to restructure more than $2 billion worth of outstanding debt obligations pushed up bids for some turnpike bonds by around 1/2 point in the secondary market for tax-exempt municpal securities.
The announcement did not come as a surprise, because the authority has made no secret of its desire to refund this debt, much of which was issued in 1984 and 1985. Details about the timing of the refinancing remain to be worked out.
Away from turnpike issues, municipal bond traders said that prices of most widely quoted securities rose by about 1/8 point.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said that prices of most actively traded issues were unchanged on the day.

HEADLINE: Oil Exporters and Users Agree to Continue 'Dialogue'

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, July 2

 BODY:
Twenty-five oil-producing and consuming countries ended a two-day conference here today with an agreement to continue "a dialogue" that the United States has steadfastly opposed.
Six members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, including major producers like Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Iran, sent their oil ministers to the conference, called the Ministerial Seminar for Oil-Producing and Consuming Countries. 
 Energy and industry ministers from France, Norway, Britain and Germany also attended what is considered to be the first such contact since the "North-South dialogue" of the mid-1970's ended in failure, as the West resisted demands then from poor and socialist countries to share its wealth and technological advances with them.
 
'Informal, Frank and Direct'
 "It was informal, frank and direct," said Roland Dumas, the French Foreign Minister, at a news conference at the end of the meeting. France and Venezuela were the leading coordinators of the conference.
Many conferees said they had agreed to hold another meeting that would be sponsored jointly by Norway and Egypt and would be held in Oslo. No date was set for that conference.
The United States had steadfastly refused to endorse the idea of any dialogue between oil producers and oil consumers, asserting that it was totally opposed to any interference in the free-market mechanisms of the world's crude oil markets.
The United States agreed after the personal intervention of France's President, Francois Mitterrand, to send an "observer" to the meeting and insisted, at the end of the meeting, on stressing that it participated only as an observer.
 
Need for Stability Seen
 "The problem is that there is not now, and there was never, a free oil market," said Algeria's Energy Minister, Nordine Ait-Laoussine. "There has always been interference of one sort or another in the oil markets. What we advocate is stability. We can agree on at least that which is good for both consumers and producers so that we can do our economic planning on a sound basis."
Oil experts at the meeting said they agreed with the statement made at the end of the conference by Mr. Dumas, the French Foreign Minister, that "we are witnessing the birth of a tradition."
The desire to have a broad agreement to regulate oil markets is strongly supported within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, whose 13 members have suffered over the last few years from sudden and steep falls in oil prices.
 
Actions Taken by Consumers
 These falls were largely because of action taken by consuming countries in energy savings and seeking alternative sources to oil as an energy source and OPEC is now of a mind to reach a broad agreement with consumers about a general range of prices, something that the United States continues to resist fiercely.
Taking American concerns into consideration, Mr. Dumas said the dialogue did not mean that any of the industrialized countries at the conference endorsed any interference with free-market mechanisms.
Armando Duran, Venezuela's Foreign Minister, strongly endorsed the view that some interference in the market was possible without harming free-market mechanisms. "It is possible, and right, to insure perfect markets working by making them more transparent," he said.
OPEC officials said that what they were seeking was not an agreement on a specific price of oil but a control to be exercised on the free-wheeling energy markets of the West, where oil is traded without physical movements from one location to another.

HEADLINE: Yields Are Slightly Lower On Bank Funds and C.D.'s

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields on certificates of deposit and money market accounts were down slightly for the week ended yesterday.
According to The Bank Rate Monitor, an interest-rate publication, more savings institutions raised rates last week than in the previous few weeks. 
 At the Treasury Department's weekly auction held on Monday, average discount rates increased for the second consecutive auction to their highest levels since the beginning of June. The three-month bill rose a basis point, to 5.59 percent, with the six-month bill up 13 basis points, to 5.71 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
 
Forecast on C.D. Yields
 Analysts at The Bank Rate Monitor said investors could expect further declines in short-term yields on certificates of deposit, with some rise in long-term accounts. A week ago the average annual yield on a two-and-a-half-year certificate rose by as much as 27 basis points, to 8.36 percent, at the Carver Federal Savings Bank in New York. The analysts said investors should not be taken in by some higher numbers and should refrain from buying a long-term C.D. too early, since odds favored a slow upward movement in rates later this month.
The analysts suggested a more prudent approach by savers would perhaps be to open a C.D. with a maturity of one year or less and wait for the numbers to go up.
The largest yield changes in New York-area banks this week were found at the Dollar Dry Dock Bank of New York, which cut the yield on its money market account by 26 basis points, to 5.39 percent, and the Connecticut Bank and Trust Company, which reduced its three-month certificiate of deposit by 11 basis points, to 5.53 percent. People's Bank of Connecticut also lowered the yield on its six-month certificate by 11 basis points, to 5.60 percent.
 
Yields at Commercial Banks
 Among commercial banks, the average money-market yield rose 5 basis points, to 5.19 percent, while three-month certificates fell 2 basis points on average, to 5.46 percent, and six-month maturities fell a basis point, to 5.64 percent.
Depositors at savings institutions saw the average yield on a money-market account fall 2 basis points, to 5.54 percent, and on a three-month certificate 3 basis points, to 5.75 percent. Six-month maturities on average were off only a basis point, to 6 percent.
By comparison, at 20 large banks around the country, all of which are outside the New York market, the average money market yield fell by a basis point, to 5.24 percent, with no change in the average yield of a six-month certificate, at 5.74 percent.

HEADLINE: Eating Well

BYLINE: By Marian Burros

 BODY:
NOW that we have all learned how to pronounce salmonella (though we haven't learned what to do about it), it is time to add another kind of bacteria to our lexicon: campylobacter (that's CAM-pill-o-back-ter). As with salmonella, if you swallow enough of it, you can get very, very sick.
Dr. Mitchell Cohen, director of the division of bacterial and mycotic diseases at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, estimates that 30 to 70 percent of the poultry in this country is infected with campylobacter. 
 "Of the top four important enteric diseases -- salmonella, listera, e. coli 015787 and campylobacter," Dr. Cohen said, "I would list campylobacter as No. 4. But it probably causes more cases of disease than any of the other three. I think it's less serious than salmonella, and salmonella would probably have a higher death rate."
The C.D.C. estimate that there are two million cases of campylobacteriosis a year in the United States, and 200 to 800 deaths.
Campylobacter has been around for a long time. But it was not until the 1970's that scientists realized it could cause illness among humans as well as animals. Campylobacteriosis causes typical food-poisoning symptoms: fever, chills, diarrhea, abdominal pain. Sometimes there may be more serious and permanent consequences, like arthritis. Occasionally, someone dies.
Last week, Dr. Leonard Kapcala, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Maryland Medical School, testified before a Congressional committee about the effects of campylobacteriosis. He, his wife and one of his children were acutely sick with it for a week after eating chicken, and he continued to have chronic problems for months.
"I can never remember feeling so sick," he said in a telephone interview. "I felt as if I had been hit by a truck."
Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, the Ohio Democrat who held the hearings, has introduced a bill to revise the way the United States Agriculture Department inspects poultry. Currently, inspectors look, feel and smell poultry as it whizzes by on the line.
"This system was set up 80 years ago," said Tanya Roberts, a senior economist in the Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service. "Today it isn't working because you can't see parasites and bacteria with the naked eye." And the bacteria does not cause a change in odor.
Stories about filthy chickens have become almost routine. The public has come to expect an expose a year, detailing the processing procedures that contaminate even those chickens that came to the slaughterhouse without any pathogens on them. If it isn't salmonella, it's campylobacter. Conditions never seem to improve.
Carole Tucker Foreman, who was an Assistant Secretary of Agriculture in the Carter Administration, thinks she knows why. "The industry has been growing very, very rapidly," she said. "Its production capacity and marketing capacity have outstripped its ability to produce a clean product. And there has been no incentive to produce a product with low bacteria count because the Government lets them sell the poultry with a seal on it that says 'wholesome.'
"All of the weight is on the side of make it fast and make a big profit, and there is no counterbalance from public or the Government saying we want it to be clean."
Ms. Foreman has suggested that one way to provide that counterbalance is "to have U.S.D.A. take the seal off the poultry and put some handling instructions on it." But that won't keep contaminated poultry off the market, she added.
Dr. Glen Morse, an associate professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, said there is no incentive for poultry producers to clean up their operations.
"So why should they do it?" he said. "Maybe if chickens had different grading depending on how much bacteria there is or if the label said how much bacteria the company's chickens had the previous month . . . ."
Dr. Morse served on a National Academy of Sciences panel that made recommendations to the Agriculture Department on how to reduce poultry contamination. But Dr. Morse said, "The Federal Government isn't doing much about it."
There are a lot of ways the production of chickens could be changed to reduce the amount of harmful bacteria they carry when they reach your kitchen counter, but the Agriculture Department is proceeding slowly, not only in looking for solutions but also in requiring the industry to make the changes.
"The U.S.D.A. is not a public health agency," said a scientist at a Government health agency who spoke on the condition that his name not be used. "The poultry industry wants to view the organisms as inevitable and nothing can be done about it."
Dr. Wilson S. Horne, Deputy Administrator for Inspection Operations at the Agriculture Department, disagrees. "Campylobacter is obviously something we are going to have to address," he said. "But you have to remember that raw products by nature contain pathogenic bacteria.
"One of our main thrusts is consumer education while we are working to reduce the numbers of campylobacter. Modern-day homemakers aren't nearly as knowledgable about safe food handling as they used to be."
Dr. Horne's view is shared by Dr. Douglas Archer, deputy director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition at the Food and Drug Administration. "Some people eat dumb things, like raw animal-derived products," Dr. Archer said. "We don't think that's too bright a thing to do. Consumer education is the key thing. I think antibiotics lulled people into a sense of false security."
This blame-the-victim attitude makes Ms. Foreman and others angry. "I think the American public believes it our responsibility to use reasonable care in the preparation of food," Ms. Foreman said, "but I also think that when a package has a seal on it that says 'inspected for wholesomeness by U.S.D.A.' that it will be reasonably clean.
"They are asking us to treat chicken like it's toxic waste and to treat our kitchens like a surgical suite and I don't know anyone who does that."
No one wants to get sick the way the Kapcala family did. But for certain groups, whose numbers have been increasing in recent years, the problem is far more serious than for the general population. For the elderly and people whose immune systems are weak, like cancer patients and people with AIDS, campyllobacteriosis can mean death.
 
An Ounce of Prevention
 WHILE waiting for the Government and the poultry industry to reduce the danger from bacteria in poultry, there are ways to protect yourself.
Good cooking techniques and good sanitation improve your chances of avoiding campylobacter or most of the other bacteria on poultry that cause disease.
Above all, campylobacter is easily killed by thorough cooking.
If poultry is not to be used in one or two days, freeze it.
Thaw poultry in the refrigerator, never at room temperature.
Using hot soapy water, wash your hands and any surfaces or utensils touched by raw poultry, especially food that is to be eaten raw. Suppose, for example, that you slice tomatoes on the same countertop on which you placed the raw chicken. If it had any campylobacter, they would contaminate the tomatoes.
Do not leave uncooked poultry at room temperature for more than 30 minutes. If poultry has to be longer than that becasue it is being transported, pack it in an insulated container with ice.
Many chefs cook poultry to an internal temperature of 160 to 165 degrees. Scientists agree that all bacteria are destroyed at those temperatures. But the Agriculture Department, preferring to err on the side of safety, says poultry is done when the temperature reaches 180 degrees in the center of the inner thigh muscle. That temperature will probably result in an overdone bird, but the department has factored in a margin of safety for those who don't know how to use a meat thermometer. Cooking poultry to 170 degrees is a sensible compromise.
Cool cooked poultry rapidly, and after eating, refrigerate it; do not leave it out.
If you plan to use a marinade for dipping or basting, reserve some in the refrigerator before using on raw poultry. If you want to use a marinade that has held raw poultry, bring the marinade to a boil before serving.
Never use a dish that held raw poultry without washing it thoroughly.
When cooking poultry in a microwave oven, first cook it under cover; steam helps kill bacteria. Stir or rotate the dish during microwaving for even cooking and be sure to observe the "standing time" recommended in the microwave recipe.

HEADLINE: Time on Your Hands? It May Be Increasing

BYLINE: By TRISH HALL

 BODY:
PEOPLE are always talking about how busy they are, how starved they feel for time. But do they really have less of it today? John P. Robinson, a University of Maryland professor of psychology who has been studying the way Americans spend their waking moments for 25 years, asserts that the perception does not match the reality. His findings show a steady increase in free time.
"I'm the guy with the odd data," said Professor Robinson, who directs the Americans' Use of Time Project at the university's Survey Research Center in College Park. He agrees with the widely held notion that people feel more harried. Surveys by poll takers like Louis Harris and Associates, for instance, say they have found that people believe that the work week has been increasing and leisure time has been decreasing. 
 But Professor Robinson, a man of diverse interests and multiple projects who seems perfectly confident that his numbers tell the real story, thinks people remember the past inaccurately. "The perception of a time crunch appears to have gone up in the period of time where free time has increased," said Professor Robinson, who, in those 25 years, has studied thousands of diaries that men and women around the country have kept on how they spent their time.
Since 1965, he said, men have gained seven hours of free time in a week, to 41 hours from 34 in a week. Women, he reports, have gained six hours of free time, to 40 from 34, in a week. He defines free time as any time when people don't have commitments to work, family, chores or personal needs like sleeping, eating and grooming.
Professor Robinson is considered one of the few experts on spending time who is able to make comparisons over decades. "Very few people actually study how we use time," said Prof. Geoffrey Godbey of the leisure studies department at Pennsylvania State University. He characterized Professor Robinson's work as "first rate," an evaluation echoed by colleagues in the field.
And Professor Godbey, too, reports that he has found that perceptions of how time is spent differ from reality. He said that in a study five years ago, he found, by comparing interviews with sign-in records, that people thought they had used a tennis and swim club 100 percent more than they really had. "People want to believe that they play tennis and swim," he said, "not that they watch TV and drink beer."
In a small office on the College Park campus decorated with family photos and souvenirs of trips to the Soviet Union, Professor Robinson studies the diaries, where groups of Americans around the country try to account for every minute of a day: what they did, who they were with, whether they were doing anything else at the same time. The diaries were filled out by 1,240 participants in the survey in 1965; by another 2,409 in 1975, and by 5,389 in 1985.
He became interested in the use of time when he was a graduate student at the University of Michigan. It seemed odd to him that much research had been conducted into how people spent their money, but little into how they spent their time.
Professor Robinson, who has a doctorate in mathematical psychology and social psychology, has written books on the use of time, including "The Rhythm of Everyday Life" ( Westview Press , 1988) and "How Americans Use Time: A Social-Psychological Analysis of Everyday Behavior" (Praeger Publishers, 1977). He is currently finishing a third, to be titled "Free Time in America," about his most recent studies.
In addition to the time diaries, financed by the National Science Foundation with some occasional backing from the Sloan Foundation and A.T.& T., Professor Robinson sometimes undertakes related projects. In his findings in a recent nationwide study for the Hilton Hotels Corporation, he reported that there was ample evidence that people felt starved for time. Almost half of 1,010 people interviewed by telephone in January said they would be willing to sacrifice a day's pay for an extra day off each week.
The answers indicated that women feel much more harried than men, especially if they have children. "We are at a point," said Professor Robinson, "when the value of time to most Americans is reaching parity with the value of money."
Although the feeling of time's pressure is real, he said, the findings of research, over time, indicate that women as a group have more free time than they did two decades ago, all of which has gone into watching television. He said further that although TV watching has declined very slightly in the last decade, it rose so much between 1965 and 1975 that it still consumes 37 percent of the free time of American women and 39 percent of the free time of American men.
Professor Robinson said that the perception that society as a whole has become short of time and is thus in dire need of things like instant food and instant shopping, may in part be a consequence of the large number of people who are in their 30's and 40's, a period when demands on time are greatest. People older than 65 have the most free time, Professor Robinson said, falling just slightly short of the amount they would like.
There has always been a large segment of the population that feels rushed. Professor Robinson estimates that a third of the population now feels rushed; about a quarter of the population felt that way 25 years ago. Then, as now, he said, women with jobs and with children have the least amount of leisure. Having a husband does not result in more leisure for women with children. Being married, he said, reduces the free time of a woman by an hour a week; being single increases her free time by four hours.
For those who do not actually have less free time today, the pressure for instant results and the technology that makes them possible, may help explain the feeling of a time crunch. "It could be because of the pace," Professor Robinson said, or the ever-expanding variety of life. "There are just more choices. Even the choice of doing nothing is a harried choice."
But using time as an excuse has become a valid explanation, making it a convenient cover-up. "People say they don't have time to read newspapers," the psychologist said, "but it's just another way of saying they'd rather be doing something else." Indeed, his research has indicated the truth in a very old truism: those with the most to do do the most.
When he conducted a survey of participation in the arts, he expected to find that certain people would be likely to attend cultural events while others would be likely to, say, fix their carburetors in their spare time. But it turned out that those who fixed their carburetors were also more likely to pursue cultural activities.
"The more you do one thing, the more you do another," he said. He calls such people "the omnivores," and says they are also likely to work long hours. "I've looked at it as an extension of Newton," he said. "Bodies in motion stay in motion."
Professor Robinson, who is divorced and has two children age 21 and 23, said he always finds time to do what he really wants to do, like going to jazz festivals, searching for old miniature golf courses and testing locally brewed beers. Like "the omnivores," he is always moving. Pointing to a man on Roller Blades, he said, "A friend says I should have been born on those."
No matter how many information on time he amasses, intriguing questions remain. Next year, he plans to tackle one. The time diaries show that people are working fewer hours. But official Bureau of Labor Statistics show that the work week has remained constant in the last two decades. Armed with a grant from the American Statistical Association, Professor Robinson hopes to reconcile those conflicting numbers.
He theorizes that people may say they work 40 hours a week, but when they actually account for each hour of their day it is clear that they do personal things during their workday, like going to the doctor, meeting children's needs, and the like. Their jobs may make it easier to do that. "As you move into a service economy," he said, "there is less monitoring of what goes on." Ideally, he said, he would like to broaden his studies to include actual observation of how people use time.
After the 1980's, when it was stylish to believe that everyone was frantically rushing to make money, it is now stylish to believe that the rat race is over and the simple life is back. But he doesn't believe that habits change for everyone, or that they change radically.
"Behavior," he said, "moves more slowly than perception."

HEADLINE: Her Fame Is Ruled His Too: Soprano Must Share Income

BYLINE: By RONALD SULLIVAN

 BODY:
"The Marriage of Figaro" did not end like this.
A New York State appeals court ruled yesterday that the mezzo-soprano Frederica von Stade must share with her former husband money she made during their 17-year marriage. 
 The decision came in one of the more notable recent tests of the premise that a husband or wife who aids in a spouse's rise to fame is entitled to a share in the value of that celebrity. The unanimous ruling by the five-member court overturned a decision by Acting Justice Walter M. Schackman of State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
Last year Justice Schackman denied a claim by Ms. von Stade's former husband, Peter Elkus. Having been her voice coach, adviser and photographer during Ms. von Stade's rise to stardom, Mr. Elkus asserted that he was entitled to a chunk of her star value under New York's equitable-distribution law.
 
What's Hers Is His
 Yesterday the appeals panel agreed, saying that his contributions to Ms. von Stade's career were marital property and must be taken into account in their divorce settlement.
The ruling is the latest in which judges in New York State have had to make a determination on what constitutes marital property and what contributions during marriage are compensable at the time of divorce.
Five years ago, New York's highest court ruled that a wife who had deferred her ca reer to send her husband to medical school effectively owned part of his medical license.
A Manhattan trial judge applied the same principle in the 1988 divorce case of the actress Marisa Berenson and A. Richard Golub. The judge held that the increased value of Ms. Berenson's acting and modeling career were marital property.
Since then, trial courts have held that degrees in law, medicine and accounting are marital assets. But yesterday's ruling recast the criteria for courts to use in deciding such cases.
"It is the nature and extent of the contribution by the spouse seeking equitable distribution, rather than the nature of the career, whether licensed or otherwise, that should determine the status of the enterprise as marital property," the appeals panel said.
Ms. von Stade was not yet a celebrity when she met Mr. Elkus, a bass-baritone, in music school. She went on to international acclaim.
The lower court decision referred to Ms. von Stade only as "F. Elkus," and the records of the case were sealed. But yesterday, the appeals court provided some details in its opinion, noting that Ms. von Stade earned $2,250 in 1973, the first year of her marriage to Mr. Elkus, and $621,878 in 1990, the last. They have two children.
"While it is true that the plaintiff was born with talent and, while she had already been hired by the Metropolitan Opera at the time of her marriage to the defendant, her career, at this time, was only in the initial stages of development," the appellate court said. "During the course of the marriage, the defendant's active involvement in the plaintiff's career, in teaching, coaching, and critiquing her, as well as caring for the children, clearly contributed to the increase in its value."
Mr. Elkus's lawyer, Alfred Ferrer 3d, said the ruling yesterday was significant because it extended the principle of equitable distribution beyond the realm of licensed professionals like doctors and lawyers to artists and others whose jobs are not.
 
Seeking Future Income, Too
 Mr. Ferrer said he would seek to have the ruling apply to the income Ms. von Stade has earned since her divorce from Mr. Elkus a year ago, as well as to her future income.
"What this ruling clearly means is that marriage is an economic partnership," he said.
Ms. von Stade's lawyer, Raul Lionel Felder, warned that the ruling would "open the floodgates to spouses who want equitable distribution from plumbers and shoeshine men."

HEADLINE: Factory Orders Up Sharp 2.9%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2

 BODY:
In a compelling report of economic rebound, new orders to American factories surged 2.9 percent in May, the biggest increase in more than a year, the Commerce Department reported today.
It was also the second straight substantial rise after five months in which factory orders declined. The April gain, moreover, was revised upward to 2.1 percent from the 1.8 percent initially reported. 
 Today's report seemed to extinguish any remaining hopes that the Federal Reserve would find it necessary to cut interest rates again to spur the economy, which is widely believed to be climbing out of the recession that began a year ago. The central bank's Open Market Committee began a two-day meeting today to set monetary targets for the balance of the year.
"I think we're in a classic recovery environment now," said Edward Yardeni, an economist at C. J. Lawrence Inc., a New York securities firm. He noted that not only have new orders turned up -- a predictive indicator -- but that shipments of factory goods have now advanced for two straight months.
 
Consumer Confidence Up
 In another report, the University of Michigan said its widely followed consumer survey showed a sharp jump in confidence in June. [Page D2.]
The report on factory orders covered the entire range of factory goods -- $120.1 billion of durables, which are designed to last a minimum of three years, and $117.9 billion of nondurables. A preliminary report on orders for durable goods last Tuesday showed these surging 3.8 percent in May, a gain trimmed today to 3.4 percent, mainly because of a lower order level for fabricated metals.
Orders for nondurables rose 2.5 percent, with all major industries except rubber and plastics posting increases, the department said. For nondurables, orders are generally filled so quickly as to be regarded essentially the same as shipments.
Shipments of food products rose 1.3 percent, textile mill products rose 2.2 percent, chemicals and allied products rose 1.9 percent and petroleum and coal products rose 3.6 percent.
Tobacco products, which are highly erratic for tax and other reasons, soared 22.6 percent. Rubber and plastics fell 1.5 percent while paper and related products edged down one-tenth of 1 percent, the report showed.
In all, shipments climbed 1.3 percent in May after a 2.7 percent April increase, but backlogs of unfilled orders were essentially unchanged at $521.1 billion, the lowest level since February 1990.
Declines in orders for durables offset increases in nondurables.
Inventories, meanwhile, fell eight-tenths of 1 percent, to $382 billion, declining for the fifth time in six months since reaching a November 1990 peak of $392.4 billion. It appeared that these inventory reductions were involuntary, as sales have outpaced production rather than representing deliberate retrenchment by anxious executives.
By the stage of fabrication, inventories of finished goods eased 1.6 percent for durables and five-tenths of 1 percent for nondurables. Work-in-process was down seven-tenths of 1 percent and five-tenths of 1 percent, respectively, for these categories while materials and supplies fell 1 percent and four-tenths of 1 percent.
 
Unfilled Orders Rise
 Unfilled orders for nondurables in May rose 4.1 percent, to $21.2 billion, the biggest increase since February 1987 and the highest level since May 1990, the Department reported.
Over all, the 2.9 percent gain in factory orders reflected a gain of $6.8 billion for the month. This followed a 2.1 percent gain in April and a 2.9 percent decline for March. Orders, however, remain 2.2 percent below the level of May 1990.
By market categories, orders were up 5.5 percent for automotive equipment, 3.2 percent for consumer, 3.7 percent for machinery and equipment, 1.9 percent for business supplies, 1.5 percent for construction materials and supplies, 3.7 percent for information technology industries and 6.1 percent for health care products.
Orders for military goods, on the other hand, tumbled 18.1 percent, and home goods and apparel eased nine-tenths of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: Gains by Money Managers Proving to be Hard to Hold

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
For stock managers who were hot in early 1991, the challenge of the second quarter turned out to be holding on to the gains of the first quarter.
"It's more important to keep what you made," said Fred Astman, the chief investment officer of First Wilshire Securities Management of Los Angeles, which ranked second among investment advisers for the first half, according to estimates released yesterday by CDA Investment Technologies. 
 The CDA figures estimated that First Wilshire, which specializes in small stocks, gained 56.5 percent in the first half, with a gain of 51.2 percent in the first quarter and a much smaller rise of 3.5 percent in the second quarter.
 
No. 1 and No. 2 Trade Places
 First Wilshire had been the top manager in the first quarter, but it traded places for the half with Target Investors, a firm based in Wilton, Conn., which moved up from second place on the basis of an 11.1 percent second-quarter gain, which left the firm up 66.7 percent for the first six months.
Target, whose officials could not be reached last night, also specializes in small stocks, and seems to have benefited from holdings in Pacificare Health Systems and SciMed Life Systems, two companies that posted much-better-than-expected earnings and leaped more than 30 percent in the quarter.
For many small stock managers, however, the second quarter was disappointing. Typical was Dwight E. Lee of New York, which had ranked third at the end of the first quarter, with a gain of 42.6 percent, but which CDA estimated lost 13.9 percent in the second quarter. Many small technology stocks suffered in late May and June as a reaction set in to the explosive growth in prices earlier in the year.
 
Data Based on S.E.C. Filings
 Most money managers are not required to disclose performance data to the public, so the CDA figures are estimates based on the limited filings the managers do make with the Securities and Exchange Commission. CDA calculated the performance of the stocks each manager reported earning at the end of each quarter and assumed that no transactions took place in the second quarter.
Such an assumption is obviously incorrect and has the added disadvantage of ignoring cash and bonds that the manager might hold, as well as any short positions in stocks, which are not reported. But over time the estimates have proved generally accurate.
Because of the big growth in the first quarter, the average money manager, as calculated by CDA, showed a rise of 17.1 percent in the first half. That figure is probably overstated, because most managers hold at least some cash, but it nonetheless outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which rose 14.3 percent in the quarter. That rise reflects the fact that smaller stocks generally did better than their larger counterparts.
By the CDA calculation, none of the 528 firms for which it was able to make estimates lost money during the first half of 1991.
CDA did not publish a breakdown for the second quarter, so it is not possible to calculate how many of the firms lost money in that period, but the answer probably is close to half, as share prices gyrated but showed little overall movement in the period. An analysis of stocks in the S.& P. 500 by Shaw Data showed that the best performances generally were in the more economically sensitive industries, as investors grew to expect an economic recovery that could be stronger than had been forecast.
Mr. Astman said that he expected it would be more difficult to make money in stocks in the second half of the year. "The market is around 20 times earnings, and at that level we are nervous," he said. He added that in choosing stocks, he was paying a lot of attention not only to growth prospects, but also to a secure balance sheet.

HEADLINE: Foreign Investment in U.S. Decreased Last Year

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2

 BODY:
Foreigners invested much less in the United States last year than in previous years, according to Commerce Department figures released today.
Largely as a result, the excess of foreign investment in the United States over American investment abroad -- sometimes referred to as the nation's net debtor position -- barely widened last year and may actually have shrunk, the figures also showed. 
 Foreign direct investment in the United States, which includes purchases of land, factories, corporate subsidiaries and large stakes in companies, plummeted to $37.2 billion last year from $70.6 billion in 1989. Foreign companies and individuals bought fewer big stakes in American companies, reinvested less of their profits here and lent less money to their American subsidiaries, the department said.
 
Counters Popular Fear
 The report comes amid considerable concern in Congress and elsewhere about whether foreigners have been acquiring excessively large stakes in the industrial and technological base of the United States. "At the same time people were getting paranoid about foreigners coming in and buying up America, foreigners were beginning to disinvest in America, at least insofar as equities were concerned," said Robert Hormats, the vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International.
The declining value of the dollar relative to other currencies prompted many foreigners to sell shares in American companies, Mr. Hormats said. Foreigners' sales of these shares, he added, actually exceeded their purchases by $5.9 billion in the fourth quarter of last year.
Foreigners have also been losing interest in American real estate, though precise figures are hard to find, said James A. Fetgatter, the membership director of the Association of Foreign Investors in U.S. Real Estate, a Washington-based trade group. Higher interest rates abroad, particularly in Japan, have made the returns from United States real estate and other investments seem less attractive.
And much like many American banks, foreign banks have cut back on lending for overseas real estate investment, making these deals more difficult to finance, Mr. Fetgatter said.
The weakness of the United States economy also contributed to the drop in foreign investment, the Commerce Department said. American interest rates dropped compared with interest rates elsewhere, so that United States bonds became less attractive to foreign investors. In addition, the United States subsidiaries of foreign companies earned less than in 1989, leaving them with smaller profits to repatriate.
 
Slowdown in Mergers Cited
 Part of the fall in direct foreign investment may be temporary because of the scarcity of very large international mergers last year, said Edward M. Graham, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington.
Foreign purchases to acquire or enlarge large stakes in American companies fell to $47 billion from $51.9 billion, a drop that was smaller than the value of the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company's $6.1 billion purchase of MCA, he said. "The equity coming into the U.S. tends to come in quite big chunks," he added.
The Commerce Department also issued varying estimates today of whether foreign holdings in the United States increased in value last year faster than American investments overseas. By the measurement that many economists prefer, the United States fell further behind. But by two other measures the United States gained ground.
The United States is sometimes described as the world's largest net debtor nation because foreign investment here exceeds American investment abroad, though much of the investment takes the form of equity rather than debt.
Using stock market indexes to calculate the value of direct investments made many years ago, total accumulated foreign investment in the United States as of last year exceeded American investment overseas by $360.6 billion, a deficit that widened from $267.7 billion in 1989. But using either the original purchase price or the replacement cost of these investments, the United States net investment position improved by about $25 billion, though it remained in a large deficit.
The deficit widened using the stock market measure because many foreign stock markets fell dramatically last autumn, more than the United States market fell, after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, so that the value of many American holdings abroad also fell.
Officials of the Reagan and Bush Administrations have contended that strong net foreign investment in the United States has been an expression of confidence in the nation's economic future rather than an indication of current economic weakness. But a senior Administration official, who insisted on anonymity, said weak foreign investment did not mean foreigners had lost confidence.

HEADLINE: Fighting It Out on TV, With Fists, Pies and Slime

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 2

 BODY:
Got a quarrel with a neighbor, friend, relative or mate that you want settled on national television? You don't have to take your case to Judge Wapner and "The People's Court" anymore. Now you can simply slug it out on "The Grudge Match."
In the latest twist in reality programming, people who might otherwise be in small claims or divorce court are entering a boxing ring and going three rounds against each other, cheered on by a studio audience that picks the winner. "It may not be PBS, but it's a real hoot," one production assistant said on Monday during taping of the program, which began production late last month. 
 "The Grudge Match," produced by Richmel Productions in association with Genesis Entertainment , is to go on the air in September in more than 100 cities around the country, mostly in late-night weekend slots. In New York, the program will be broadcast on WNBC.
Lisa London and Robert Branaman, though, did not seem particularly amused when they went at each other with the cameras rolling and the commentators Steve Albert, who is a sportscaster, and Jesse (The Body) Ventura, a former wrestler, describing their bout from ringside. Mr. Branaman and Ms. London once lived together, but parted ways when she insisted they marry and he refused; shortly thereafter, she moved in with his brother, sticking him with back rent. Then she wrecked his car.
 
From Fists to Food
 After knocking each other around the ring, Mr. Branaman, listed at 5 foot 11 and 170 pounds, and Ms. London, who at 5 foot 6 weighed in at 106 pounds, donned wedding veils and moved on to serious business: tossing wedding cakes, hors d'oeuvres and glasses of champagne at each other. Mr. Branaman got so much into the spirit of things that he rushed to Ms. London's side of the ring and creamed her with tiered cakes from her own arsenal.
"I hit her with tunafish, cake and eggs," Mr. Branaman crowed afterward. "She never even got me once."
Mr. Branaman and Ms. London were followed by Bryan Jardine and Sam Sloves, who were surfing buddies until Mr. Sloves' $800 surfboard was wrecked in a maneuver he blamed Mr. Jardine for and Mr. Jardine refused to pay the damages. Next up were Ann Greenfeld and her husband, Robert, a pair of transplanted New Yorkers who were soon wrestling in a sea of goop and pelting each other with matzoh balls. She thinks she might like to have a third child, but he is perfectly happy with two.
Among other contestants scheduled to appear on the program are a bride and groom who can't agree on what to do with the $10,000 wedding gift they received from her parents. There are also neighbors disputing a fence's position on their property line as well as two women whose friendship dissolved when one lent her wedding gown to the other, who promptly had it altered into a miniskirt.
 
An Effort to Avoid Injuries
 "The Grudge Match" is set up in such a way that the first round always consists of fisticuffs or something equally physical, as when the adversaries batter each other with inflated bats. Contestants then battle it out for two more rounds with implements chosen from the program's Gallery of Weapons, which include saws, bows and arrows (rubber-tipped), tennis rackets, rotten tomatoes, sauerkraut, baked beans, buckets of sludge, cat litter and cream pies. The adversaries wear costumes, starting out in tights and capes and then perhaps putting on giant chicken-head masks or other appropriate embellishments.
There are limits to the mayhem, of course. The boxing is done with oversize gloves, a referee is always on hand during the bout, and a paramedic examines the contestants afterward in case there are cuts, bruises or something worse.
"We don't want people getting hurt," Rich Melcombe, the program's executive producer, said. "We want them to vent their frustrations and settle their differences. But we do not want them to kill each other."
Lynette Klump and Peter Varvel, whose bout ended with them rolling around in the ketchup, mustard and mayonnaise they had been slinging at each other, said they had found their joint appearance to be therapeutic. The two are part of a group of college friends and co-workers who rent a house together in Riverside, Calif. Their relationship took a turn for the worse a year ago, when his car ran over her cat and he followed it up with a series of dead cat jokes she found offensive.
 
'Not Mad at Him Anymore'
 "I'm a very physical person, and this was a good way to release all the stress and tension that had built up between us," Ms. Klump said. "It was definitely better than going to the gym. I was really mad in the first round, because he was laughing, but when I got him, it felt so good. I'm over it now, I'm not mad at him anymore."
Mr. Varvel said that at first he had worried about treating Ms. Klump too roughly. "I thought I should hold back," he said. "But then I got into it, because I didn't want to lose." Nevertheless, the audience, recruited from tourists on the Universal Studios tour, voted Ms. Klump the winner.
Contestants on "The Grudge Match" have been recruited through advertisements like those in The Los Angeles Times, which read "Revenge!!! Get even with that certain someone on Nat'l TV Show." The program has also sent staff members to small-claims courts in Southern California and expects to receive a flood of solicitations from around the country once it begins broadcasting.
All contestants on the program receive a $250 "appearance fee," with an additional prize, custom-chosen for the contestants, going to the winner of the bout. Ms. London, for instance, would have received a set of satin sheets had she defeated Mr. Branaman, who as the victor walked away with a $700 cash award.
 
Rejected by Turner
 Mr. Melcombe said he came up with the idea for "The Grudge Match" in 1987, when he was working for Turner Broadcasting and the network's owner, Ted Turner, asked him to develop some sort of program that could run in tandem with the network's wrestling shows. But when Mr. Melcombe presented the idea to Mr. Turner, "Ted laughed and said, 'Rich, come on,' " Mr. Melcombe recalled.
Since then, however, both television economics and audience tastes have changed. "The Grudge Match" costs relatively little to make, thanks to a fixed set and low overhead, and is expected to appeal to the same viewers who have made solid succeses out of so-called reality-based cop and rescue programs on the Fox network.
Mr. and Mrs. Greenfeld said they had decided to appear on the program because they thought it would be a good way to end their deadlock over a third child: whoever won the bout would also win the argument. The audience sided with Mrs. Greenfeld by a margin of 2 to 1, and the $1,000 prize "that would have gone for a vasectomy or tubal, will now go into the kids' college fund," he said, graciously conceding defeat and kissing his wife.
"We wanted to have some fun and just get on TV so our friends and relatives back East could see us make fools of ourselves," Mrs. Greenfeld said. "But having done it, I'd say you should only do it if you really love each other. Otherwise, something could happen, and the next step is divorce court."

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET BATTLES;
Idealism With Gloves Off

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, July 2

 BODY:
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. did not create the budget problems in Connecticut; they arose from problems of falling tax revenues caused by the recession. But at every turn in the six months since he took office as the state's first independent third-party governor in a century, he has gone out of his way to make those problems indelibly his own -- in proposing and defending the kind of income-tax plan that residents and lawmakers have resisted for decades.
Through two budget vetoes -- and his order, issued early today, to begin shutting down nonessential state services until lawmakers pass a budget that he will sign -- Mr. Weicker has argued in ringing and righteous terms that he is defending residents from budget chicanery and long-term fiscal ruin. 
 Without insisting directly on the imposition of a deeply unpopular income tax as a requirement in the budget, he has said he cannot conceive of an honest budget without an income tax.
Mr. Weicker defends the income tax as the fairest system of taxation and the only one that would allow the cuts in business taxes that he argues are essential to stimulate the limping economy. But behnd his often elegant phrases, Mr. Weicker has not spared using political tools that are as tried and true as those of any ward heeler.
He has emerged as a bare-knuckled idealist willing to use all the maneuvers of traditional politics to achieve the individual idiosyncratic goals of a maverick.
The state employees unions provide a case in point. Mr. Weicker said today, for example, that he would veto any continuing budget resolution to temporarily finance the government for two weeks. He argued that doing so would formally dissolve a $340 million package of state employees' wage and benefit concessions negotiated this spring. His administration then declared a budget emergency and ordered about 7,000 of those employees in non-essential positions to stay home from work.
In both opposing the resolution and ordering the shutdown, Mr. Weicker said that political tactics to keep pressure on the legislature were not even given the slightest consideration.
 
'I Have No Alternative'
 "In the absence of a budget as required by law, I have no alternative but to do what I have done," he said at a news conference in his office. "It's up to me to harbor the resources of the state."
But a whole spectrum of factors make those decisions almost impossible to understand except in the context of old-fashioned politics.
Unlike many other states, Connecticut has no mechanism to furlough its workers, and state laws also require written notice for layoffs. That means that any labor savings resulting from the shutdown are questionable at best: according to the State Comptroller's office, the laws and contracts will probably require everyone to be paid. The written notices even said that all those "contractual obligations" would still be met.
What that means is that the state workers, ordered not to do any work for the state, but pointedly not laid off either, were simply footloose for the day. The Governor's press office politely notified reporters this morning that the workers would be rallying on behalf of the income tax on the Capitol grounds.
 
Supports His Tax, Not Him
 At least some of the state employees who showed up at the rally were torn between their support for the income tax that their unions had endorsed and their personal views about the Governor.
"It's totally counterproductive," said Vincent Diana Jr., a technical systems analyst for the Department of Education. Mr. Diana, who was wearing a T-shirt saying "Shut Weicker Down," said he supported the income tax but not the Governor.
By Wednesday the shutdown will include the closing of all state parks, beaches and campgrounds just in time for the beginning of the long Fourth of July weekend, was also based on the premise, Mr. Weicker said, that the lack of a budget is by definition a state emergency requiring executive action.
But the very lack of a budget resulted from Mr. Weicker's refusal to accept the temporary two-week budget resolution that both chambers of the General Assembly had already passed.
 
Says He Protects State
 Mr. Weicker said today that he was protecting the state because the resolution guaranteed current labor obligations -- which entitled workers to raises of up to 6 percent effective July 1. The $340 million concession package would postpone those raises, as well as putting off a large payment to the employee pension fund -- though both savings would untimately have to be made up in future budgets.
"An emergency is something that happens to you -- it's not something you create," said the Comptroller, William E. Curry Jr., who has urged Mr. Weicker to relent in accepting a temporary budget measure. "You can't cause an emergency, then certify its existence," Mr. Curry said.
But while some of the torments of lawmakers trying to pass a budget can be legitimately traced to Mr. Weicker's unbending ways, at times he has also apparently failed to communicate what was on his mind.
On Sunday, for example, the last day of the fiscal year, Mr. Weicker was invited into private caucus to address the majority Democrats in the House of Representatives. According to lawmakers who were there, Mr. Weicker for some reason danced around the question of whether he would veto a conventional tax plan, which would resolve the state's revenue shortfall through a traditional expansion of the state's 8 percent sales tax.
Even though Mr. Weicker's objections to a sales-tax expansion were well known, and even though he had already vetoed a similar plan in May, he said when asked that he would in fact sign a conventional plan "if it worked."
Lawmakers were apparently so confused by the answer that they pressed forward with a conventional budget, which passed both chambers before being smashed by another Weicker veto on Monday. All parties concerned lost at least a full day's work on the eve of the deadline. In his veto message, Mr. Weicker called the budget "shocking."

HEADLINE: Consumers' Survey Shows Sharp Jump in Confidence

 BODY:
Consumers' faith in the present and future health of the economy jumped sharply in June, the University of Michigan's widely followed survey on consumer sentiment showed.
Richard Curtin, who oversees the survey, said yesterday that the latest soundings showed that the "slow but steady improvement" in consumer confidence that began early this year continued strongly in June. "That is based on the expectation that the economy will improve, although the recovery is expected to be slow," he said. 
 Mr. Curtin said the weakest element of the survey was consumers' expectations about their personal finances. "That reflects the effects of the recession and the belief that income gains will be slow in the recovery," he said.
 
Provided in Confidence
 He declined to give specific details of the latest findings, which he said were provided in confidence yesterday to the survey's subscribers. But Reuters quoted economists who had seen copies of the report as having said that it showed confidence at its highest level since the euphoric period after the Persian Gulf war.
Reuters said the report showed that consumer sentiment rose to 82.1 percent in June from 78.3 percent in May. Consumer sentiment was the highest since March's 87.7 percent after the victory in the war. Excluding the March blip, the index was at its highest since August 1990 -- a month after the recession began.
"Confidence is now in a range where we can see a revival of consumer spending and a revival in the economy," said David Wyss, an economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill Inc.
Consumer spending alone buys two-thirds of all goods and services produced in the economy, so any sharp change could be an important factor in an overall rebound.
"The details of this report conform to the view that the economy is recovering, but the pace of recovery will likely be slow," said Marilyn Schaja, an economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "Confidence improved in all regions of the country except for the Northeast."
The Michigan survey works from a base of 100 percent in 1966 and is compiled through a telephone survey of 500 households. It is used by the Commerce Department in its monthly index of leading economic indicators, which is intended to predict the economy's direction six to nine months in the future. Consumer confidence is one of 11 factors in the report.
In addition to overall consumer sentiment, the Michigan study showed that an index on feelings about current economic conditions improved, rising to 91.9 percent in June from 89 percent in May.
A third index, based on expectations about the future, rose to 75.9 percent from 71.5 percent. That was the highest since March, when expectations surged to 84.5 percent.
The Conference Board, a business group in New York, also tracks the consumer. Its survey, released last week, showed confidence rose to 78 in June from 76.4 in May. It works from a base of 100 in 1985. The June rise was attributed to more optimistic expectations for the months ahead, the board said.
In contrast to the Michigan survey, it said consumer opinions of current economic conditions slid for the 10th straight month in June.

HEADLINE: With Jobs Scarce, Many Turn to Graduate School

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DEPALMA

 BODY:
From the beginning of the academic year, Dana M. Lew, a senior majoring in economics at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., knew that finding a job after graduation would be a nightmare. So she, like a record number of this year's seniors, kept her options open by applying to graduate school.
As the term progressed, iss Lew, who grew up in Metairie, La., regularly checked the job listings at Northwestern's placement office but did not come across anything hopeful. She spoke to several corporate recruiters who said they would be hiring half as many people as they had first expected. 
 "It got kind of discouraging," Miss Lew said. Finally, she received a letter of acceptance from the University of Illinois at Urbana, for its master's degree program in business administration. "I decided that this was the way to go," she said.
So many members of the class of '91 at colleges and universities around the country applied to graduate school this year that applications rose by as much as 20 percent at the 430 largest institutions, according to the Council of Graduate Schools, a national organization. Nearly 1 million foreign and American students applied to graduate school in the United States this year as against more than 830,000 last year, excluding law and medical schools and a few other specialized programs.
 
A Common Phenomenon
 Victor R. Lindquist, the director of placement at Northwestern, who wrote the Lindquist-Endicott Reports, an annual survey of employment trends for college graduates, said that in a bad economy it is common for applications to graduate school to increase.
"Graduate school is a socially acceptable place to hide," he said.
While applications at graduate schools nationwide have blossomed, enrollments are expected to inch up only about 2 percent, according to the Council of Graduate Schools, because most colleges and universities have not expanded their faculties to accept additional students.
The result is a double whammy for many students who, shut out of the job market, have also been rejected by the graduate programs of their choice.
But at least one school, George Washington University in Washington, is trying to help its own students by cutting in half graduate school tuition rates in 28 of its programs.
Nonetheless, some students say they cannot seem to get ahead, no matter what strategy they follow.
"I just got lost in the numbers," said Adam M. Goldstein of Fairfield, Conn., a chemistry major who graduated in May from George Washington and was rejected by several medical schools, despite decent scores on the entrance examination. He said college advisers had told him it was because so many others had applied.
Mr. Goldstein, who graduated with a minor concentration in business administration, said he then looked for a job as a salesman for a pharmaceutical company. He sent out 120 resumes, without getting a single job offer.
"I knew it was going to be bad, but I never expected it to be like this," said Mr. Goldstein, who plans to take the medical school entrance examination again in the fall and reapply for admission.
Because of his interest in medical school, Mr. Goldstein was not able to take advantage of George Washington's unusual plan, which offers its own graduates who meet admissions requirements the chance to pursue an advanced degree at half the cost of $490 per graduate credit hour.
Under the plan, the usual graduate tuition of $8,820 a year would be reduced to $4,410 each year for the two years it customarily takes to complete a master's degree.
 
'Sale' on Master's Programs
 The tuition "sale" applies to 28 of George Washington's 185 master's degree programs. Robert W. Kenny, acting dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, said the disciplines included in the program are under-enrolled and can accommodate additional students without increasing the faculty. They include standard programs like English, history and mathematics as well as some specialized ones like art therapy, neuroscience and women's studies.
"Giving students the credential of a master's degree may restore their competitive edge," Mr. Kenny said.
So far the response has been lukewarm. While about 15 seniors inquired about the program, none have enrolled. Part of the reason may be that it was not announced until May 10, just a few weeks before the end of the semester. Also, the most popular graduate programs, including the one in public administration, are not covered.
Stephen J. Trachtenberg, the president of George Washington, said he would decide next winter whether to extend the program for another year.
Paying for a graduate education appears to be a big impediment for many. As budget problems force public and private universities to trim expenses, there will generally be less financial aid available for graduate students.
Roy A. Koenigsknecht, dean of the graduate school at Ohio State University, said graduate applications there have increased 10 percent this year to some 20,000. But he said the university could assist just over 4,000 graduate students, roughly the same number as in 1990.
Mr. Koenigsknecht said the aid cutbacks hit particularly hard for women, who might need to pay for dependent child care, and minorities, many of whom have fewer alternatives for financial assistance.
"Over all we may see some gains in graduate enrollment," he said, "but it will be a net loss for women and minorities."

HEADLINE: Gold-Stock Funds Win in Quarter

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
When it came to stock mutual fund performance in the second quarter of this year, it turned out that what glittered really was gold.
Gold-oriented mutual funds greatly outpaced the stock market from April to June, making them one of the few bright spots among mutual funds investing primarily in common stocks. Stock funds, in general, fell a bit more than the stock market did. 
 Lipper Analytical Services reported that, on average, general equity funds -- those that invest in a broad array of stocks -- fell in value by 0.86 percent in the quarter. That was a slightly greater decline than the 0.23 percent drop in Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. When specialized funds are included, the average of all equity funds fell by 0.79 percent.
 
Gold-Oriented Funds Up 8.04%
 By contrast, funds with large holdings in gold-mining companies rose an average 8.04 percent in value. The biggest gainer, Strategic Investments, a Dallas-based fund that invests in South African gold-mining stocks, rose 34.39 percent. That was the largest rise among all of the 1,264 equity funds that Lipper tracks.
The biggest losers this time around were funds that invested in technology and environmental companies and those that invested in small businesses. These funds were hurt by poor earnings in high-technology companies, like I.B.M., as well as by a shift by investors toward larger, better-capitalized companies that are expected to fare better as the recession moves toward a recovery.
Gold shares are among the most volatile stocks traded, and it is not unusual for them to pop up temporarily to the top of hot-stock lists. Their recent strong showing followed a year in which they were big money losers. Gold mutual funds, which had slumped in value at the end of 1990, began to rise slowly in the first quarter and accelerated that pace in the second.
 
Lifting of Sanctions a Factor
 Leroy S. Brenna, founder and president of Strategic Investments, which has $38 million invested, said more favorable investor perception had helped lift South African gold mining stocks, particularly as many European and Asian countries ended their economic sanctions against that country, and the United States is expected to do the same.
Nearly 97 percent of Strategic Investments' holdings are in South African gold companies. American economic sanctions now prohibit Americans from investing in South African stocks issued after 1986. Strategic Investments buys only shares issued before that date. Many other gold funds invest primarily in gold mines in North America, and their shares did not rise as much.
Mr. Brenna said that the lifting of sanctions "has prompted Asians and Europeans to become big buyers of South African gold funds, and the stocks are rising in anticipation of our being able to own South African gold assets."
 
No. 2 Also Big in South Africa
 Another Texas-based gold fund, U.S. Gold Shares, a $300 million fund based in San Antonio, took the No. 2 position, rising 21.28 percent in the quarter. This fund is also fully invested in South African stocks.
"South African gold shares have traditionally had a certain amount of political discounting," said Edmund Serfaty, U.S. Gold Shares' portfolio manager. "Once the sanctions are lifted, it means that more people can invest in South Africa. We seem to be first out of the chute on this one."
The third-highest performer was another of Mr. Brenna's precious-metal funds, called Strategic Silver, which rose 18.95 percent. Mr. Brenna said its strong performance came from the increasing demand for silver from electronic and photographic users at a time when many American mines have been closed. Silver prices have risen recently on heavy buying by Japanese investors, he added.
 
Gains in Financial Services
 After precious metals, financial-services stocks rose the most, up an average of 3.51 percent. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services, said stocks of regional banks helped lift these mutual funds.
"Financial-services stocks are benefiting from the recovery," he said, "and the regional banks have been in pretty good shape."
At the bottom end of performance were environmental funds, which fell in value by 7.13 percent, and science and technology funds, which fell by 6.49 percent.
The biggest loser was the Schield: Progressive Environment fund, a $4.1 million fund, which fell by 15.89 percent. "The story is simple," said Glenn S. Cutler, the fund's manager. "Environmental stocks got pounded during this quarter, and that's what we are."
 
Environmental Companies' Plight
 Mr. Cutler said his fund was hurt by disappointing earnings at many environmental companies, and by a switch by investors to other kinds of stocks better poised to benefit from an economic recovery. Among his big holdings are Sanifill, which operates non-hazardous landfills, and Harding Associations, an environmental engineering company.
Another big loser was the Fidelity Select: Computer fund, which was the second-worst performer, with a loss of 15.13 percent. Robert Chow, portfolio manager, said that the computer stocks his fund invested in were "sold off very heavily" and that there was "no place to hide."
Mr. Chow said his stocks were hurt especially by a decline in demand for computers by European buyers as a result of a downturn in demand there.
But for Mr. Chow, the poor showing of his computer fund was nearly offset by the performance of another fund he manages, the Fidelity Select: Paper and Forestry fund, which rose by 13.94 percent, making it the fifth-biggest gainer.
That fund benefited from investor interest in cyclical stocks, with paper companies considered to be well postioned to benefit from an economic upturn.
Mr. Chow added that forestry stocks had been helped by a sharp rise in wood prices because of heavy rainfalls and environmental issues that had limited logging at a time when demand for wood products was increasing.

HEADLINE: Fibreboard Names Chief

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, July 2

 BODY:
The Fibreboard Corporation said today that it had elected John D.C. Roach chairman, president and chief executive, effectively immediately. Based in Concord, Calif., Fibreboard manufactures lumber, plywood and other building materials, and also owns a ski resort. The company has been the defendant in a long-running series of asbestos suits.
Mr. Roach, 47 years old, succeeds Lawrence C. Hart, who had announced his intent to resign on April 11, and subsequently tendered his resignation on June 18. Mr. Roach joins Fibreboard from the Manville Corporation in Denver, where he was executive vice president as well as president of the mining and minerals group, the Manville Sales Corporation and the fiberglass and specialty products group. He had been chief financial officer. 
 Fibreboard "represents an excellent opportunity for imposing and increasing shareholder value," Mr. Roach said. He said that the company's insulation business was No. 1 in its market, that the wood products division should prosper as the country emerged from the recession, and that Fibreboard had handled a long series of asbestos liability suits well.
Fibreboard said that the experience with asbestos litigation Mr. Roach gained at Manville was a crucial factor in deciding to hire him. along with his experience in the insulation business and the wood products industry.
James F. Miller, one of Fibreboard's four directors, issued a statement that he vigorously opposed the selection of Mr. Roach. "In my opinion, I am the only director who truly represents the shareholders of this business," Mr. Miller said. He could not be reached for further comment and did not explain in the statement why he opposed the choice of Mr. Roach.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET BATTLES;
New York City Budget Hardly Final

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
When it comes to New York City's bad-news budget, Yogi Berra was wrong: even when it's over, it's not over.
At least, that's what Mayor David N. Dinkins and millions of New Yorkers, who would suffer from service cuts and higher taxes, have to hope. What remains to be seen is whether the blueprint will get better or worse. 
 Most budgets are part wish-list, part worst-case warning. But more than usual, this one is built on uncertainty: revenue estimates that some monitors suggest may be too rosy, and pinched plans for spending that the Mayor hopes to improve. It was passed because it had to be by law and political reality in a city that skirted bankruptcy in 1975.
"I don't think all our decisions are decisions that we can live with over the long haul," said Councilwoman Mary Pinkett of Brooklyn as she voted for the $28.5 billion plan about 7:30 A.M. yesterday. But she said, "We have a responsibility to do that which we were elected to do."
 
Avoiding His Own Worst Ideas
 Just as Mr. Dinkins hoped never to adopt a budget that contained all the gloomy ideas he proposed in May -- and by the time it was finally passed, a bit of the gloom had lifted -- so he now hopes to avoid carrying out the worst of what remains, including 10,000 layoffs.
To do so, he will need concessions on wages or benefits by the municipal unions to which the Mayor granted recent raises, and help from the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which was set up to help borrow money to bail the city out in the fiscal crisis of the 1970's. But there are no guarantees.
"Of course it's not over," said Felix G. Rohatyn, chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation. This time, he has tied hundreds of millions of dollars in potential aid to proof by the city that it is willing to cut costs permanently.
For Mr. Rohatyn, and the Mayor, that proof means obtaining give-backs from the workers' unions that pounded the pavement for Mr. Dinkins's election. In some senses, Mr. Dinkins is not in a bad bargaining position, since the main city union, facing great pressure to restore whatever jobs it can, can do so through concessions.
But not all unions have equal incentive: for example, no police officers are being laid off, in keeping with the Mayor's big expansion plans for the force. And even if many workers return to the payroll, the cost would be tremendous disruption in the lives of some of the city's poorest-paid employees and the poorest people they are supposed to serve. Workers just keeping their heads above water in a civil service system that has been the route to middle-class life for generations of New Yorkers would find themselves back on welfare rolls.
In the end, it would be hard for the average citizen to understand why it could not have all been worked out sooner and more sensibly, through better planning, quicker cost-cutting, more aggressive attrition and smaller raises -- even in a collapsing economy.
"I don't think anybody wins in this budget," said Penelope W. Pi-Sunyer of the City Project, a nonprofit coalition of social-service and community groups. "I think the Mayor lost from the moment he put out his executive budget, because he lost union support and he lost advocate-group support." She said the attitude of protesters on the steps of City Hall during the negotiations was "one of despair."
In a budget so big -- the fourth largest in the nation after those of the Federal Government, California and New York State -- it is hard to remember that the pieces and the politics are often so small. Not everyone lost. The firefighters' union, which ran an open bar from the trunk of a car in the City Hall parking lot, plying Council members with food and drink, kept 245 chief's aides' jobs -- drivers who help coordinate operations at fire scenes -- that the Council had proposed to cut.
As Council members debated a point in the wee hours, an irate citizen stood up and shouted that they should be ashamed, that they had no business doing business in the middle of the night. Councilman Jerome X. O'Donovan of Staten Island replied without a hint of irony: "This isn't business! This is legislation."
Whatever happens, Mr. Dinkins has vowed to avoid letting binding powers over the city's spending return to the State Financial Control Board. It has an oversight role since the recovery from the last crisis, but could resume control if the city's budget went out of balance.
The Mayor never misses a chance to note that the city remains the ward of a state government that is at least as fiscally frazzled but much less second-guessed. If the city's leaders needed any reminder of that legacy, they found one as City Council members wrangled over last-minute details Monday night. An aide found a 16-year-old memo, crumpled in a member's desk. It warned all members to stand by for a vote on the creation of the Municipal Assistance Corporation.
To insure the city's independence and to try to fix some of the problems that contributed to the current crisis, the Mayor has proposed a joint city-state commission to recommend ways to realign their complex taxing and spending responsibilities.
As Manhattan Borough President, Mr. Dinkins produced a number of reports by special commissions, recommending thoughtful ways the city could better handle the needs of the homeless and children, reports he once cited constantly but whose prescriptions he mentions less often now.
The Mayor and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo are still warily reviewing just what form the new commission should take, or whether it should be a commission or a more informal effort. They might be thinking of a bit of British doggerel that ran decades ago in the magazine "Punch":
"If you're pestered by critics and hounded by faction
To take some precipitate, positive action
The proper procedure, to take my advice is
Appoint a commission and stave off the crisis."

HEADLINE: Back Manipulation Gains Respectability

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
FRUSTRATED by a lack of good treatments for back pain, doctors are turning to a therapy they have long dismissed as chiropractic quackery: spinal manipulation.
The American Association of Orthopedic Surgeons this year for the first time included a symposium on back manipulation at its meeting and, in a show of hands, almost a third of the 1,000-member audience bashfully admitted that they had referred patients for the technique. 
 "No question, manipulation is more accepted," said Dr. Scott Haldeman, a neurologist who is also a chiropractor. "Ten years ago if you practiced manipulation, you were a quack; you couldn't get published and were never invited to meetings. Now I can't keep up with the invitations."
This year's edition of the major textbook on backs, "The Adult Spine," contains its first chapter on manipulation therapy. But perhaps the most convincing sign that the therapy is moving center stage is that researchers at the Rand Corporation, who have studied the medical utility of coronary bypass surgery and hysterectomies, have recently turned their attention to spinal manipulation. And to their surprise, early studies indicate that the technique holds up well.
In a report being made public this week, a panel of medical experts assembled by Rand to review the medical literature concluded that manipulation was appropriate for patients with certain types of low back pain. The best candidates were patients whose pain had lasted less than three weeks, who had no signs of spinal nerve damage and whose spines appeared to be normal in X-rays. In studies, patients in this group had significant relief after manipulation and were able to return to work sooner than similar patients treated with conventional methods.
"I was surprised at how much agreement there was on when manipulation was appropriate and surprised at the interest on the part of the orthopedists," said Dr. Paul G. Shekelle, an internist, who is leading the Rand project. At one time, he said, he would never have sent a patient to a chiropractor, but he now does so on occasion.
Dr. John Frymoyer, director of the McClure Musculoskeletal Research Center at the University of Vermont, says that a growing number of doctors practice manipulation themselves or, more commonly, refer patients to other professionals who are skilled in the technique, from chiropractors to physical therapists.
Dr. Nortin Hadler, a professor of rheumatology at the University of North Carolina Medical School at Chapel Hill, describing himself as "a cantankerous doctor who would have never dealt with manipulation in the past," said, "It's not mainstream, but it has become acceptable to talk about because some of us establishment figures have become interested."
 
Restoring Normal Mobility
 Today, most hands-on back therapy is done by chiropractors, who believe that back pain and a number of other maladies can be treated by manipulation, the physical movement of joints past their normal range of motion. In their view, manipulation relieves aching backs because it restores normal mobility to vertebral joints that are abnormally stiff, altering the function of adjacent muscles and nerves.
While few doctors accept the whole of chiropractic doctrine and remain skeptical of chiropractic explanations, a growing number of physicians have turned to chiropractors for their hands-on skills.
"Chiropractors, who used to be ostracized, are now invited into major hospitals, H.M.O.'s and practices," Dr. Haldeman said.'
Dr. Louis Sportelli, past president of the American Chiropractic Association, said two decades ago he could not get doctors to accept his phone calls; today, he said, new surgeons in town invite him to lunch and he often "co-manages" patients with neurosurgeons or orthopedists.
"Until a few years ago they were still buying into the A.M.A. effort to eliminate chiropractors," he said. "Now, there's no stigma attached to referring people to us." Until recently, the American Medical Association held that it was unethical for a doctor to associate with a chiropractor.
As acceptance of manipulation has spread, physical therapists, osteopaths and even conventional doctors are offering a service once shunned. Traditional osteopathic doctors learned manipulation, but that waned in recent decades as they took on mainstream medical jobs.
When Dr. Stanley Paris, a physical therapist, joined the Boston University faculty two decades ago, the university forbade him to practice, teach or write about the manipulation technique he had learned in his native New Zealand.
He now lectures at major hospitals across the country, and at his private Institute of Graduate Physical Therapy in St. Augustine, Fla., he trains 2,000 physical therapists to manipulate backs each year.
 
An Ancient Therapy
 Spinal manipulation to treat back pain dates to Hippocrates and was widely practiced by American doctors until the last century, when, in the name of science, it fell out of favor. Overseas, some medical doctors continued the practice.
"Now after years of trying to discredit it, people in this country are saying maybe there's something there," Dr. Shekelle said.
The current spate of interest started 10 years ago when reports began to appear in conventional medical journals showing that manipulation held some promise. Four years ago, Dr. Hadler and Dr. Peter Curtis conducted a tightly controlled study "designed to prove it didn't work," said Dr. Hadler.
The researchers found that for patients with less than two weeks of pain, manipulation did not make a difference. But for people whose pain had persisted for two to four weeks, a single manipulation produced significant relief and allowed patients to return to activity four sooner on average. Their findings were reported in the journal Spine. Other studies have since confirmed and expanded the results.
"For acute back pain the general drift from all these trials is that there's a short-term benefit for people who get manipulation that lasts three to six weeks," said Dr. Shekelle. Although some of the studies have design problems, he added, "The control group never does better."
"There are a lot more good studies on this than on other things doctors accept and do all the time," said Dr. Robert Brook, a leader of the Rand group.
The mainstream doctors' interest is as much a sign of their frustration in treating backs as it is a tribute to the the chiropractors' success. Although a badly damaged spine can be diagnosed with magnetic resonance imaging and treated with surgery, most acute low back pain produces no detectable findings on X-rays or in traditional medical examinations. The patient just hurts.
Back rest, exercises and pain killers can generally get the patient through the acute episode, and about 80 percent of back pain goes away on its own in two weeks. But for some patients the pain lingers, and they miss work as they wait for their backs to recover. Back pain is the major cause of lost work days.
"If manipulation could be used for symptom control so the patient can be mobilized sooner that would be beneficial," said Dr. Stanley Bigos, an orthopedic surgeon at the University of Washington, who said he would wait for the results of more studies before recommending treatment.
But others are taking tentative steps. "Patients say it helps and there are a lot of thriving chiropractors out there, so obviously they are doing something patients like," said Dr. Vert Mooney a back specialist at the University of California at San Diego, who refers patients to physical therapists who incorporate manipulation into their care. In this country, twice as many patients suffering from back pain go to chiropractors as go to traditional physicians.
Experts emphasize that manipulation should be used as part of a program that includes back exercises and medicine, if needed.
Nonetheless, the truce between these formerly warring parties remains uneasy. Physicians are troubled by the lack of a scientific explanation for why the therapy helps.
At the Rand consensus panel, which included medical doctors, osteopaths and chiropractors, the group was able to agree on a number types of patients who could benefit from manipulation and a number of patients for whom manipulation would be fruitless or even dangerous. This latter group included patients with neurological symptoms, like weakness or numbness in a leg, and patients who had not had any radiological tests, like X-rays or scans of the bones of the spine.
But there was also a "a large gray area," of patients about whom the panel members could not agree. For example, the chiropractors felt that patients should continue maintenance manipulation after their symptoms had gone away, while the medical doctors felt there was no role for therapy once the pain had dispersed. The panel could also not reach a conclusion about whether chronic back pain was amenable to manipulation or how many treatments were necessary.
Most studies have looked only at the effect of a few treatments over a period of weeks, but new studies suggest that treatments may have long-term benefits.
Because of the divergent traditions, many medical doctors say they prefer to refer back patients to physical therapists or other physicians. "It's a fact of life that we have to cooperate with chiropractors and we're tolerating each other much better these days," Dr. Mooney said. "But there is still no great affection and trust."
At the orthopedists' symposium on manipulation, one back expert was loudly applauded after urging doctors to resist chiropractors who performed fake treatments to treat sham diagnoses. Many doctors have been comforted by the realization that "you can accept the laying on of hands without accepting the whole culture of this other profession," said Dr. Frymoyer, who was chairman of the meeting.
But Dr. Shekelle says chiropractors are a diverse group and that most today no longer make lavish claims about the curative potential of manipulation. "There are some chiropractors who never do X-rays and don't try to diagnose the cause of back pain, and I would be uncomfortable dealing with them," he said. "But there are others who I can sit down with and feel like I'm talking to another doctor."
Experts say the field of chiropractic has become more scientific in the past decade. "Chiropractic scientists are scrutinizing their own profession and finding they don't have the research to justify treatment of things like diabetes and cancer, which manipulation has never really been shown help," said Dr. Haldeman.
Many recent research on manipulation, including the Rand study, have been financed in part by chiropractic groups. "They took a big risk," said Dr. Shekelle. "It's turned out that some manipulations are worthwhile and some not, just like lots of medical practices."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
A New Operating Head Of Sumitomo Trust Unit

 BODY:
Hiromasa Yakushiji, the new head of the Sumitomo Trust and Banking Company's operations in North and South America, faces a double challenge: improving Sumitomo Trust's lowered credit ratings while contending with a sluggish real estate market.
Mr. Yakushiji, 47, has been named director and general manager of business planning for the Americas after 25 years with the Osaka-based commercial bank. Sumitomo Trust, one of the world's major banks, is separate from the Sumitomo Bank Ltd., which is even larger than Sumitomo Trust. 
 Mr. Yakushiji was also named chairman of the Sumitomo Trust and Banking Company (U.S.A.), the company's New York-based trust banking subsidiary, and was elected to the parent company's board.
Mr. Yakushiji, who had been general manager of the bank's New York branch, replaces Kaneaki Hori, who has been named president of Sumitomo Trust's Sumishin Credit Card Company subsidiary.
Two months ago, Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered the senior debt rating of Sumitomo Trust to A-1, from Aa-2, and the Standard & Poor's Corporation in February lowered Sumitomo Trust's long-term debt rating to AA-, from AA. Mr. Yakushiji yesterday called the lowered ratings disappointing, but he added that Sumitomo Trust would not alter its business practices merely to please the ratings agencies.
"It is difficult to accept such a tough downgrade," Mr. Yakushiji said. "We lost some of our ratings even while we were showing stronger and stronger performances."
Those strong performances did not come from real estate lending problems, which have hurt Sumitomo Trust. Despite the difficulties, Mr. Yakushiji said, Sumitomo Trust remains committed to real estate.
"We have not stopped real estate transactions at all," he said. "If we can find good deals, we want to do them."
Mr. Yakushiji said that Sumitomo Trust would stay with its historic businesses, exercising caution because of the uncertain economic climate. "Being one of the foreign banks here, we have made it clear that we are not seeking any retail banking here," he said. "We are a wholesale bank."
A native of Tokyo, Mr. Yakushiji holds a degree in economics from Keio University. He said he joined Sumitomo Trust right after leaving college in 1966, adding with a laugh, "I haven't changed my job yet." He and his wife, Hiromi, live in Scarsdale, N.Y., and have two children.

HEADLINE: South Korean Leader Begins Visit to U.S. by Meeting Bush

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2

 BODY:
President Bush met with President Roh Tae Woo of South Korea today for talks on Seoul's role as an emerging Pacific economic power and the growing prospect of political and military changes in North Korea.
North Korea is said to be within a few years of producing nuclear weapons even as its estrangement from South Korea and the West shows signs of collapsing under the wave of changes sweeping the Communist world. 
 South Korean and American officials have sought for months to slow the nuclear program while speeding the diplomatic changes, and Mr. Roh's two-day stop here -- the first official state visit by a South Korean leader in 25 years -- will review that effort.
At a 40-minute meeting that was more ceremony than substance, Mr. Roh told Mr. Bush that he hopes that the two Koreas can be rejoined by the turn of the century. A senior Korean official, speaking on condition of anonymity, later asserted that that goal is "certainly" attainable in light of North Korea's growing economic problems and the prospect that the architect of the nation's hard-line policies, 79-year-old Kim Il Sung, is in poor health and could soon die.
 
'When Korea Is Made Whole'
 In welcoming remarks at the White House, Mr. Bush said that lasting peace will come to Korea "only when Korea is made whole."
Administration and Korean officials later said that the two men talked largely about South Korea's military and economic role in Asia and their concerns about North Korea's weapons programs.
The senior South Korean official later said the North's nuclear and chemical-weapons programs were matters of "grave concern" that must be remedied before relations can significantly improve.
North Korea said last month that it would allow international inspection of its nuclear sites, dropping a longstanding demand that the United States first remove all nuclear arms from South Korean soil. But it lagged in agreeing to an inspection schedule, saying the United States should simultaneously allow inspection of any nuclear arms it maintains in the South.
 
U.S. Rejects Arms Inspection
 The United States and South Korea have rejected that demand, and officially, the Pentagon neither confirms nor denies that any nuclear arms are in South Korea. But news accounts in Japan and elsewhere have said the South Koreans favor the withdrawal of American weapons if that will help stop North Korea's arms program.
Both Administration and South Korean officials refused today to say whether that issue arose in today's meetings. Mr. Roh and other South Korean officials are to have lengthy talks about the North Korean nuclear program and South Korean defense policy on Wednesday with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and other Pentagon officials.
As part of an agreement for South Korea to assume greater responsibility for its own defense, the United States has begun a slow reduction of the 43,000 American troops stationed in the South, removing about 7,000 this year, with more scheduled to be withdrawn in the future. Pentagon officials said today that the command of forces in South Korea could be shifted next year from American officers to South Koreans.
 
Changes in U.S. Role
 Mr. Roh's visit comes amid major changes in Washington's old role as Seoul's military guardian and economic benefactor.
South Korea's economy has boomed in the last decade, growing at double-digit rates during much of the 1980's and achieving a $7-billion-a-year trade surplus with the United States.
Although most of today's talks were devoted to strategic issues, the restrictive trade policies that have helped amass that surplus remain a "serious concern," a senior Bush Administration official said this week, and were to be raised during Mr. Roh's visit.
The United States wants South Korea to lower barriers to the import of farm goods, protect the secrecy of foreign patents and allow American banks and other financial institutions to make larger investments.
Although no formal agreements were expected to emerge from this visit, President Roh told Mr. Bush today that he supports "as free a trading regime, as liberal terms for trade as possible," the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian Affairs, Richard Solomon, said today.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET BATTLES;
Weicker Loses Again in His Bid For Income Tax for Connecticut

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, July 2

 BODY:
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s attempt to impose the first income tax ever in Connecticut went down to defeat today -- again -- whn the Senate killed an exhaustively negotiated tax plan.
The rejection meant that the Governor, an independent, had come up short for now in his effort to force a restructuring of Connecticut's tax system through a legislature in which he has no natural political allies. He was thwarted even though, at dawn today, he had carried out his greatest threat: to begin shutting down state offices. 
 For a few hours, a tax plan that met with the Governor's approval had been alive. That plan, passed in the House at 4:15 A.M. by a vote of 76 to 72, balanced a budget for the fiscal year, which began on Monday, by adopting a tax on wages while reducing the state's high sales and corporate taxes.
 
Regret, Annoyance and Anger
 But in late afternoon the Senate, with a mixture of regret, annoyance and anger, voted 23 to 12 to kill an income tax plan that its own members had devised and that they accused the House of corrupting.
The Senate vote promised two consequences: It set off a scramble for vetoes and overrides aimed at reviving a resolution that would provide money to keep the government running temporarily and send nearly all state employees back to work. But the vote also left the General Assembly, controlled by Democrats in both houses, with almost no idea where to turn.
Across Connecticut, state workers awoke, like schoolchildren waking to news of snow, to radio broadcasts announcing that Mr. Weicker had acted at 5 A.M., issuing an order to close state offices deemed nonessential to the public's safety, health and welfare.
 
Closing Notices Posted

 The workers deluged an emergency telephone hot line to learn whether they should report for work or were among the 7,000 ordered to stay home.
Those who went directly to their offices found photocopied notices taped to locked doors, as at the Office of Policy and Management on Washington Avenue, two blocks from the Capitol:
"This notice will confirm that you have been told not to come to work today. This office is closed due to a lack of a state budget, in accordance with the Governor's Executive Order."
As the day went on the state prepared to close all its parks and beaches by sundown, and as many as 13,000 more employees were to be furloughed on Wednesday. Thousands of residents called the hot line, asking if Motor Vehicle Department offices were operating (today, but not Wednesday), if welfare checks were being mailed (yes), and if banks were open (yes, even if the Banking Department was closed.)
And so Connecticut found itself, for the first time this century, without a budget on the second day of its new fiscal year. Two budgets balanced without an income tax have been killed by Mr. Weicker, who insists the tax is needed to smooth the state's boom-and-bust budget cycles. Two budgets balanced with income taxes have been killed by legislators whose constituents, when it comes to taxes, still fancy themselves Connecticut Yankees.
Perhaps more important, a sense of betrayal stained the bipartisan cooperation that has marked this unusual year, when Mr. Weicker, as an independent governor, has had no party of his own.
Republicans, who wanted to beard a powerful income-tax with a constitutional amendment limiting the growth of state spending, were especially angry at Democrats' efforts in this tax bill to begin exempting various kinds of spending.
"We've spent a lot of time on how to raise taxes, and very little on how to cut spending," said Senator Louis C. Deluca, a Republican from Woodbury.
The budget and tax plan that died today was built around a 4.75 percent tax on all income over $12,000 a year for individuals and $24,000 for couples; the exemption would shrink for taxpayers with higher incomes, disappearing entirely for couples with incomes over $96,000. One percentage point of the tax was to go toward paying off this year's $940 million budget deficit and would be eliminated in 1995.
The plan also reduced the state's workhorse 8 percent sales tax to 6 percent in an effort to make Connecticut's tax system both less regressive and less dependent on the tax, and gradually eliminated a 20 percent surcharge on corporate taxes.
 
Aimed at Middle Class
 But Republicans complained that the plan also extended the sales tax to many previously untaxed goods and services and that the relatively flat nature of the income tax aimed it squarely at the middle class. For some wealthy investors whose income comes from dividends and interest, taxed now at a top rate of 14 percent, the income tax could amount to a tax cut.
To Mr. Weicker, however, the plan met his goals. And not following through in the Senate could cost taxpayers dearly, he said. If the tax were killed and both houses resorted to a temporary budget resolution, they would also kill $340 million in raises and pension payments that unions had agreed to defer in return for no-layoff pledges.
Hundreds of union members rallied around the back steps of the Capitol today and then filled the Senate galleries to support income-tax advocates, while union officials went to court to seek an injunction against the furloughs. The unions had offered the concessions in return for the state adopting a more recession-proof source of revenue: an income tax.
 
Need for Long-Term Solutions
 "I know the Governor has his reasons for sorting out this mess as quickly as possible," said Daniel Perry of Hartford, a supervisor at the Department of Labor whose department was closed today. "But if he can't do it without hurting substantial numbers of people, maybe he should consider more long-term solutions."
In a room deep within the state armory next to the Capitol, more than 20 volunteers answered telephones that rang steadily with calls from employees and residents.
 People needing welfare benefits were told to apply at their town offices, the first step in any case. Those who could not get to motor-vehicle offices before they closed this afternoon were assured that the state police were being asked to give a break to motorists with just-expired registrations.
With parks closing at sundown, two days before a long holiday weekend, campers were perplexed at being told to leave.
"Right at their moneymaking peak, they're going to close down?" asked Edward T. Buggie of Hebron after bicyling to the park offices at Rocky Neck State Park just before 8 A.M. "It seems like pure manipulation of the public."
At the Hamden branch of the Department of Motor Vehicles, a sense of panic grew in the long lines as employees began announcing that the office would close three hours early to prepare for a possible shutdown on Wednesday.
"If I don't have a license, I can't drive, and if I can't drive, I can't work," said 40-year-old Bob Sachse of Wallingford, a bus driver for Peter Pan Bus Lines.
At 12:45 P.M., when the state told branches that they would be closed, employees began letting people in only a few at a time, so they could close in plenty of time to count money that would have to be deposited in banks tonight.
"We usually do it tomorrow morning," said the Hamden branch manager, Jack Molia. "But we don't know if there is a tomorrow."

HEADLINE: Consumer Rates;
Yields of Money Market Funds Up Slightly

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields of money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were up slightly for the week ended yesterday.
Tax-exempt money fund yields, up slighly for the week, show the average number of days to maturity of securities held in portfolios rising to 51, from 45. The large jump in average days underlines the efforts by fund managers to keep yields up by buying securities with longer maturities. 
 Analysts said total assets of tax-exempt funds fell $787.3 million, to $87.2 billion.
The seven-day average tax-exempt compounded yield was up 2 basis points, to 3.93 percent, while the simple yield rose a basis point, to 3.85 percent. During the same period the compounded and simple 30-day yields each rose by 2 basis points, to 3.85 percent and 3.78 percent, respectively. Some of the rise in yields is attributed to the supply of new issues, analysts said.
For investors in the 28 percent tax bracket the taxable equivalent of the current seven-day compounded yield is 5.45 percent, while the equivalent in the 31 percent tax bracket is 5.69 percent.
Of the funds monitored by IBC/ Donoghue's with assets larger than $100 million, the Strong Municipal Money Market fund, which buys a fair amount of paper that for some investors is subject to the Federal alternative minimum tax, continues to be the best performer as it has for two months. The fund is distributed by Strong/Cornelison Capital Management Inc.; the return was 5.05 percent, unchanged from the previous week.
Assets of taxable funds fell by $5.03 billion, for a total of $444.4 billion. Institutional funds lost $2.9 billion, for a total of $106.9 billion, while assets of the consumer funds lost $2.4 billion, to a total of $337.6 billion. Since yields are still very low, there is some speculation that investors are going elsewhere in the money markets for higher yields.
The average seven-day compounded taxable yield rose by 2 basis points, to 5.65 percent, and the seven-day simple yield was also up 2 basis points, to 5.50 percent. The 30-day compounded yield was unchanged at 5.64 percent as was the seven-day simple yield, which remained at 5.49 percent.
The taxable fund with the best return for the fourth consecutive week was Olde Premium Money Market Series, with a yield of 6.42 percent. The fund's distributor is the Olde Discount Corporation of Detroit.
By comparison, bank money market accounts, which compete with the money funds, were down a basis point, to 5.26 percent, according to The Bank Rate Monitor's national index.

HEADLINE: 'Junk Bond' Funds Show Strength

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
A revival of the high-risk "junk bond" market pushed up the value of high-yield fixed-income funds in the second quarter of this year and made them the star performers among all bond mutual funds.
New figures by Lipper Analytical Services Inc. also show that a rise in interest rates from April to June lifted 93 percent of all bond funds.
The average return for all taxable bond funds was 2.05 percent. And junk-bond funds rose by 6.54 percent. 
 But at the other end of the spectrum, the rise in interest rates pushed down funds that invested in long-term securities, particularly target maturity funds, which invest in bonds that are redeemable up to 30 years from now. These funds fell in value by four-tenths of 1 percent. A rise in the dollar also pushed down the value of world income funds, which slipped by two-hundredths of 1 percent.
 
'Still Coming Back'
 After having nearly collapsed in the last several years, junk-bond prices have recently been rising, and this recovery was reflected in returns from mutual funds that invest only in these bonds.
Of the 25 top-performing bond funds last quarter, 24 were high-yield funds.
"High-yield funds were the best of all funds and they are still coming back in terms of price action," said A. Michael Lipper, the president of Lipper Analytical, the Summit, N.J. mutual-fund research firm.
The market is so strong partly because many companies that issued junk bonds have lightened their debt burdens, thus increasing their financial well-being. What is more, the improving economy has been easing fears that many companies with high debt in the form of junk bonds would default. And since few new junk bonds are being issued, there is a limited supply for investors seeking securities with high returns.
Lipper said the leading performer was the American Investors Income Fund, a $10 million mutual fund based in Greenwich, Conn. Warren K. Greene, the president of the fund, said many of his bonds that had been trading as low as 50 cents on the dollar as recently as December were now valued at par. And his fund, which rose by 12.76 percent, was also helped by the conversion of one of its convertible bonds into stock at a favorable price.
"One of the bullish things about this market is that the supply of bonds is limited," Mr. Greene said. But as a result of the turnaround in prices in the junk-bond market, yields have been falling somewhat -- from as much as 30 percent at the beginning of the year to about 13 percent to 15 percent today, he added.
Thomas O. Dial, the portfolio manager of the $370 million National Bond Fund, a junk-bond fund that came in second with a return of 11.58 percent, said the market perception had changed on bonds that six months ago were discounted to "really ridiculously cheap levels."
Among the larger holdings in Mr. Dial's fund are the bonds of Owens-Illinois, Dr Pepper/Seven Up, and the Hospital Corporation of America.
Mr. Dial warned, however, that too much euphoria might be seeping into the market. "Before, people were looking at everything that could go wrong" with junk bonds, he said. "Now, they are discounting risks that are really in the market."
Among the worst performers were funds that invest in long-term bonds, which tend to be more volatile and whose prices have fallen sharply as rates have climbed.
 
'Extremely Volatile'
 David Schroeder, the portfolio manager of the Benham 2020 fund, which has $93 million invested in fixed-maturity Government zero-coupon bonds, said that "when rates rise, our funds will be at the bottom, and when they fall, we're at the top."
Other Benham funds that fared poorly were similar funds but with different maturity dates -- the 2015 fund and the 2010 fund. Mr. Schoeder described these funds as "extremely volatile" because they are zero-coupon securities.

HEADLINE: End of Slump Forecast For Industrial World

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: PARIS, July 3

 BODY:
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development predicted today that the industrial world's economic slowdown would end in the second half of this year, led by a recovery in the United States.
The O.E.C.D., a group of 24 industrial nations that promotes economic growth, added that the rebound would be modest and would not be strong enough to reduce unemployment in most of the industrial world. 
 In its semiannual economic outlook, the Paris-based organization said it "expects a moderate pickup in the second half of the year, led by upturns in some of those countries now in recession, in particular the United States."
The group's economists said the American economy would grow by 2.7 percent in the second half of this year and 3.3 percent for all of 1992. That compares with a 1.8 percent drop in output in the first half of 1991.
 
Less Robust U.S. Recovery
 The O.E.C.D. said the American recovery would be less robust than previous ones because the nation's banks might not expand their lending enough to fuel a strong recovery.
According to the O.E.C.D., whose sophisticated computer models and economic projections are widely respected, the slowdown will end because of a rebound of confidence after the Persian Gulf war and lower interest rates in countries experiencing recession. The United States, Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Finland and Sweden have all been in recession in recent months, the group said.
The O.E.C.D. report said the robust growth that Japan and Germany enjoyed last year would slow this year because of their tight monetary policies. The report added that the current-account imbalances of the United States, Japan and Germany were all decreasing.
The group said the American current-account deficit would fall from $99.3 billion last year to $8.7 billion this year, partly because of the financial aid that Japan, Germany and other countries have given Washington to pay for the gulf war. The O.E.C.D. expects America's current-account deficit to rise to $58 billion next year.
 
Risk in Dollar's Surge
 The report said the dollar's recent surge against other currencies carried a risk that the reduction of the American trade deficit "may stall or even be reversed through a deterioration of U.S. competitiveness."
In its first-ever projections for Eastern Europe, the group said that in the Soviet Union, output would fall by 8 percent this year and hyperinflation had "become a serious danger." It prediced that all of Eastern Europe, except Poland, would be in recession this year, projecting a 2 percent increase in output in Poland, a 9 percent drop in Czechoslovakia and a 3 percent drop in Hungary.
The unemployment rate for the O.E.C.D.'s 24 members would average 7 percent next year, with Western Europe's rate stabilizing at 9 percent. "Unemployment, which is high and rising in many countries, may not decline much in the coming recovery period," the report said.
 
U.S Unemployment Estimated
 The report projected that American unemployment would be 6.3 percent next year, down from the 6.7 percent expected in the second half of 1991, but up from last year's 5.5 percent.
Noting that the Federal Reserve has substantially relaxed monetary policy since late 1990, the O.E.C.D. said the American "expansion is expected to be led initially by consumer expenditure, but by the end of the year it should be sustained by the monetary stimulus that had been put in place."
Warning that inflationary pressures could again build up, the report said that given the shallowness of the recession, there would be only mild downward pressure on American inflation. It projected American inflation of 4 percent this year, compared with 4.1 percent last year. The O.E.C.D. sees the Federal Reserve raising interest rates in late 1992 to counter inflation.
"It is assumed that the Federal Reserve will begin to shift to a less accommodating stance late in 1992 in order to head off renewed inflationary pressures, although the macroeconomic effects of this would appear only in 1992," the report said.

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Fell 3.3% in May

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 3

 BODY:
The Government today reported a surprising drop in new-home sales in May, raising questions about the strength of the housing recovery and sending builders and bankers scrambling for explanations.
The Commerce Department said sales of new homes fell 3.3 percent in May, contrary to economists' expectations of a 2.3 percent rise. Furthermore, April sales were revised downward to a drop of two-tenths of a percent, instead of the 1.2 percent gain originally reported. 
 Other recent economic reports, including higher factory orders, more construction starts and higher personal incomes in May, have indicated that the recession that began last July is ending.
 
Bottom Seen in January
 The building industry insists that the market for home sales bottomed out in January, when sales fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 414,000 units.
Sales bounced back in February, gaining 17.9 percent, and rose six-tenths of a percent in March before the back-to-back declines in April and May. Even so, sales in May reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 474,000 -- 14 percent higher than in January.
"I'm betting this is not a double-dip phenomenon for the housing market," said Dave Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, referring to the chance that sales might begin falling again, as they did during most of 1990.
"We believe that the low was in fact January, and we're moving along as expected in an erratic but upward-trending market," Mr. Seiders said, adding that he expected new-home sales to reach 520,000 in 1991. That would still be weaker than in 1990, when sales totaled 534,000.
Decline Was Widespread
The drop in May sales was widespread, led by a 13 percent decline in the South, to an annual rate of 187,000 units. In the Northeast, sales fell 6.7 percent, to a rate of 56,000. Sales in the West were down eight-tenths of a percent, to an annual rate of 125,000.
The only region where sales rose was in the Midwest. Sales there were up 21.6 percent, to an annual rate of 107,000 units.
The actual number of new homes sold in May was 44,000, down from 49,000 in April and 50,000 in May 1990.
The average price of a new home rose to $154,400 in May, from $149,400 in April, while the median sales price rose to $121,900, from $120,000.
Setback Called Temporary
Tom Holloway, an economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association, whose members provide financing for home buyers, said the May sales dip was a temporary setback. Monthly increases should show up in the summer and fall, he said.
"The thing holding the housing market back is simply the sluggishness of the overall economy," Mr. Holloway said. With interest rates for 30-year mortgages at about 9.5 percent, "we believe there are a lot of buyers out there who would take the plunge if they had jobs."
By most measures, including more construction starts and building permits in May, as well as a 6 percent rise in sales of existing homes, housing has already begun to help the economy out of recession.
The National Association of Realtors conceded that it was surprised by the May decline and suggested that the drop stemmed from banks' tighter lending standards.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Modestly Higher

BYLINE: By By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved modestly higher yesterday in thin trading before the Fourth of July holiday.
A report of a 3.3 percent decline in new home sales during May, the second straight monthly drop, was seen as a catalyst behind the price improvement. 
 The gains held as the session wore on, despite reports from the nation's major auto makers that sales in the last 10 days of June reached 7.4 million units at an adjusted annual rate, a figure that was well above market expectations and was the best 10-day rate since December.
"The car sales numbers should have upset the market, but they didn't," said Raymond W. Stone, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J., research firm.
 
Employment Data Ahead
 With all American financial markets closed today, yesterday's activity mostly represented last-minute positioning before the Labor Department's scheduled release of June employment data tomorrow morning.
Reports released earlier this week, particularly the June survey of the nation's purchasing managers, have portrayed an economy that seems slightly stronger than anticipated.
But the latest statistics have not caused economists to massage their employment forecasts much. After a surprising increase of 25,000 jobs in May, most economists anticipate that non-farm payroll employment was unchanged to down slightly in June. Estimates range from a decline of 100,000 in payroll jobs to an increase of 75,000. Most analysts anticipate that the unemployment rate, which stood at 6.9 percent in May, will show a bit of an increase.
 
Delayed Reaction?
 Although the employment numbers often determine the tone for trading activity for the balance of each month, reaction to the June employment numbers may be delayed for a few days, traders and analysts said. Many credit market participants are taking Friday off, thereby creating a very long weekend out of the Fourth of July holiday.
"I wonder how many people will be willing to take positions on Friday," said Maury N. Harris, chief economist at the Paine Webber Group Inc., "because ultimate buyers and sellers are not likely to be around."
In the secondary market for Treasury securities yesterday, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 96 7/8 late in the day, up 7/32, to yield 8.41 percent, down from 8.43 percent late Tuesday.
Among note issues, the 8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 98 13/ 32, up 3/32, to yield 8.23 percent. And the 7 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 2/32, up 1/32, to yield 6.96 percent.
Late in the session, the Treasury announced that it would sell $9 billion worth of seven-year notes on July 10. The size of the offering was roughly in line with market expectations.
 
Movement Into Bills
 Yesterday's sharp slide in stock prices -- the Dow Jones industrial average lost 38.02 points -- helped to push down short-term Treasury bill rates, as investors left stocks and moved funds into more liquid and safe securities like bills.
By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.54 percent, down a basis point, or one-hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by 4 basis points, to a late offered rate of 5.66 percent. And one-year bill rates dipped by 2 basis points, to a late offered rate of 5.98 percent.
Activity in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds was very light, traders said. Prices of most issues were unchanged to up 1/4 point.
Trading was also slow in the tax-exempt municipal bond market. Prices of most widely quoted issues were unchanged, dealers said.

HEADLINE: For King Center in Atlanta, New Leader and New Focus

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, July 3

 BODY:
The center founded to carry on the work and legacy of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. today announced the hiring of a Harvard University administrator as its new executive director, a shift in focus and $1 million in new corporate financing.
Two years after Dr. King's son, Dexter Scott King, was installed amid great fanfare as executive director only to step down four months later, the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change Inc. here named Ronald L. Quincy, associate vice president and assistant to the president of Harvard, as its new executive director. 
 Mr. Quincy will handle daily operations and planning for the center while its founder, Coretta Scott King, Dr. King's widow, stays on as president and chief executive. Mr. Quincy said the move would free Mrs. King to spend more time developing international programs and good will for the center, which was founded in 1968.
The moves come after an 18-month re-examination of the center and its mission. Some critics have questioned whether the center is carrying on Dr. King's work or just preserving his memory.
Mrs. King and the center's chairman, Jesse Hill, stressed today that the center had never strayed from its goal of carrying on Dr. King's teachings and training leaders around the world in the techniques of what they call "Kingian nonviolence." Mrs. King said the center now plans to emphasize "international conflict resolution" and training of leaders around the world in Dr. King's philosophy.
Still, the announcement today reflected some of the fine lines walked by the center. Mrs. King spoke at a lectern adorned with the logos of the Coca-Cola Company and BP America, part of the international energy company, each of which donated $500,000 to the center for its expanded international focus. Both have been criticized by some blacks for maintaining economic activities in South Africa in recent years.
When asked if the shift in emphasis was appropriate at a time of growing despair in black America, Mrs. King said the emphasis on international concerns was in keeping with Dr. King's vision.
"We live more and more in a global village, people of all races and religion," she said. "Martin talked about how we can no longer be separated; we have to live together, find a way to live together as human beings who share so much. If we decided to ignore that, we are still being provincial."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Generally Lower; Concern on Recovery Cited

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar retreated against most other major currencies yesterday as a thin pre-holiday market responded to overseas unrest and renewed doubts about the United States economic recovery.
Traders initially sold dollars in reaction to a report showing that United States housing starts were unexpectedly lower. The report said single-family home sales fell 3.3 percent in May, compared with expectations of a 2 percent to 3 percent rise. 
 But the market eventually recouped most of its losses as overseas developments battered the German mark and the Japanese yen.
The dollar strengthened as growing attacks by the Yugoslav Army led some European leaders to take a hard-line approach to the unrest in Yugoslavia.
"What we really see here is there is still a strong underlying sentiment toward the dollar," said Hillel Waxman, head of foreign currency trading for the Bank Leumi Trust Company in New York.
In New York, the dollar ended at 1.8286 German marks, down slightly from 1.8345 late Tuesday. Tuesday's level was the dollar's highest against the mark in 20 months.
In addition, traders sold yen as investor confidence was affected by the second scandal in two weeks involving major Japanese trading companies. On Tuesday, Tokyo prosecutors arrested four executives in connection with a $26 million swindle.
In New York, the dollar closed at 139.58 yen, up from 138.75 late Tuesday. Overnight in Tokyo, the dollar rose by 0.82 yen, to 139.32, and in London, it was quoted at 139.50 yen.
Trading in New York slowed to an afternoon trickle as traders left early for the Fourth of July holiday. United States currency trading will resume tomorrow.
The British pound rose against the dollar, closing at $1.6070 in New York, up from $1.6025 late Tuesday. Earlier, in London, sterling rose to $1.6052, from $1.6020 late Tuesday.
Other dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's prices, were: 1.5793 Swiss francs, down from 1.5815; 6.2015 French francs, down from 6.2125; 1,361.00 Italian lire, down from 1,362.75, and 1.14225 Canadian dollars, down from 1.14255.

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN YUGOSLAVIA;
WAR IN YUGOSLAVIA FEARED BY BAKER

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 3

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said today that Yugoslavia could be on the brink of "a full-fledged civil war," that its army appeared to be out of the central Government's control and that the United States and its allies were considering imposing an arms embargo on Yugoslavia and suspending all financial assistance.
Mr. Baker also acknowledged a subtle shift in United States policy on Yugoslavia. He spoke to reporters after a meeting on Yugoslavia at the State Department with Hans van den Broek, the Foreign Minister of the Netherlands, which is the current head of the European Community. 
 Mr. Baker emphasized that the United States was prepared to accept any new political configuration that the Yugoslav republics negotiated -- even if it meant changes in the internal and external borders of the country -- provided it was done peacefully through negotiations.
 
A Change of Emphasis
 American policy since May has been open to "any framework, federal, confederal or other" for Yugoslavia's six republics. But Washington had emphasized its preference for maintaining the basic Yugoslav federation and the territorial integrity of the country, while downplaying suggestions for any radical change.
In the last two days Washington has changed its emphasis, telling the Yugoslavs that while the United States still believes continued federation would be in the best long-term economic and political interest of their country, they can reshape however they want, including the creation of independent republics, so long as they do it peacefully.
Mr. Baker was asked if the United States had been too slow in shifting policy, thereby encouraging the Serbian-dominated Yugoslav Army and central government to believe that it had American backing to use excessive military force to prevent any form of separatism by the republics of Slovenia and Croatia.
"Of course, we categorically reject that," Mr. Baker said. "What we did was to make it very clear that we were concerned that something like this would happen and, indeed, it has. And we warned against unilateral actions which could pre-empt dialogue, pre-empt the opportunities for peaceful negotiations. It's only the Yugoslav people that are going to determine their own future. And our strongly held position is that should be determined through peaceful negotiation and through dialogue."
While the United States is signaling a greater willingness to consider alternatives to the old federal arrangement in Yugoslavia, Mr. Baker continued to stop short of signaling any readiness to recognize the declarations of independence by the republics of Slovenia and Croatia.
Mr. Baker spoke this morning by phone with German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, and officials said he told Mr. Genscher that Bonn was making a mistake in hinting at such recognition now.
Mr. Genscher said Tuesday that the Yugoslav army's effort "to keep its old position of power and to preserve old structures is bound to fail and merely brings bloodshed to the people of Yugoslavia."
Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger, a former Ambassador to Yugoslavia, echoed Mr. Baker and Mr. Genscher's assessment that the Yugoslav army now appeared to be out of control.
 
Joint Statement Issued
 "My sense of it is that the Army is, if not out of control, at least not under control," Mr. Eagleburger said in an interview with CNN. "I think they are largely acting on their own. There are some Serbian generals who are basically in charge, and I think they have decided they're going to put this thing to an end. And they are probably acting without the consent of the central government. I think it's foolish, I think it's stupid, I think it's counterproductive, but I'm afraid that's where they are."
Mr. Baker and his guests from the European Community issued a joint statement calling for all military forces in Yugoslavia to return to their barracks, for an immediate cease-fire and an opening of negotiations "to decide their future political arrangements peacefully."
The European Community has internal disagreements on what to do about Yugoslavia, and so the declaration was limited to a simple call for a cease-fire. Germany and Italy have been hinting at supporting the breakaway republics unless the army crackdown ends, while other European Community members are being more cautious.
The Western allies also believe there is little they really can do to stop the fighting short of armed intervention themselves and that is not going to happen, since none of them yet believe that they have enough interests at stake to merit such a move.
 
Arms Embargo Considered
 Said Mr. Eagleburger: "In the last analysis, this is one of those cases, and there are so many of them in foreign policy, where if the parties themselves cannot bring themselves to sit at the negotiating table and find a peaceful solution to the problem, the outside world isn't going to be able to do it for them."
Mr. Baker said the United States and its allies nonethless "should give consideration to the suspending of aid and assistance to Yugoslavia" and mentioned the prospect of an arms embargo.
The United States sells no arms to Yugoslavia, so this would only apply to European countries. The Soviets have been Belgrade's traditional arms suppliers, providing mostly tanks. Slovenia is reported to have obtained weapons from Singapore and on the open market, while Hungary in recent months shipped weapons to the Croatians. Also the United States, which gives Yugoslavia $5 million a year, has already suspended the $1.5 million it has not already dispensed this fiscal year.

HEADLINE: At a Corner Near You: Fireworks

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
Considering that yesterday was the day before the Fourth of July, the sales pitch was hardly a shock. "Bottle rockets!" barked a street peddler named Rob, as he thumbed through a wad of cash, making change for a half-dozen customers. "Roman candles! Sparklers! I got the fireworks, folks! Check 'em out!"
Rob's location, though, was unusual: the corner of 46th Street and the Avenue of the Americas in midtown Manhattan, far from Chinatown, where New York's illegal fireworks dealers have congregated for decades. 
 "This is where the boss, the big boss, sent us," said a tanned young man named Richie, who worked as a lookout (a.k.a. "Hawk") on Rob's three-man fireworks sales team.
 
Dramatic Increase in Vendors
 Sergeant Michael T. Collins, the head of the Fifth Precinct Special Task Force, said the Chinatown area still accounted for 90 to 95 percent of the city's illegal fireworks traffic. But he also said that the number of sellers had been expanding and that, in some cases, vendors have been spotted in other parts of Manhattan.
By early last night, the city had made at least 33 arrests since early June for illegal sales of fireworks. They had also issued 178 summonses and confiscated six cars, $3,000 in cash and 450 cases of various pyrotechnic devices with a street value of more than $100,000.
"We're way over last year's figures," Sergeant Collins said.
But he added that he did not believe more people were buying illegal fireworks. He said increased police efforts, the recession and more competition between dealers had made a dent in the business, which is still predominantly run by Chinese and Italian organized-crime families.
Though the sale of illegal fireworks is generally not considered a serious crime, the devices are considered a significant public safety threat, particularly to minors and particularly when the more powerful explosives like M-80's and cherry bombs are used.
Last year, about 12,000 people nationally were treated for injuries caused by fireworks, according to the Federal Consumer Product Safety Commission. About 2,000 of those injuries occurred in around the Fourth of July.

HEADLINE: Shearson Must Pay Investor

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Shearson Lehman Brothers and three stockbrokers were ordered to pay nearly $600,000 to an unemployed plumber's assistant whose account was depleted in risky trading.
A New York Stock Exchange arbitration panel ruled that, among other wrongdoing, a Shearson broker altered a document to make it appear that the customer was an experienced investor when he was not. 
 The panel ordered Shearson to pay $441,240 to the customer, William Tornquist of Staten Island. A broker and two Shearson branch managers were ordered to pay Mr. Tornquist a total of $134,760.
In addition to accusing the broker, Rudolf Dobutovich, of altering the trading questionnaire, Mr. Tornquist also said that Shearson failed to explain the risks of options trading and made numerous trades to generate commissions in a practice known as "churning."
In a statement, Shearson said: "The firm undertook a comprehensive investigation of the matter, and uncovered absolutely no evidence of any wrongdoing whatsoever by a Shearson employee."
Lawrence R. Sandak, Mr. Tornquist's lawyer, said his client had lost more than $634,000 of a $750,000 account. Mr. Tornquist opened the account with the proceeds from the sale of a building.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET BATTLES;
Weicker Broadening Shutdowns In Pressing for Fiscal Compromise

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, July 3

 BODY:
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. expanded the shutdown of Connecticut's government today, turning up the gas still further under the pressure cooker that surrounds the search for a budget compromise with legislative leaders.
About 20,000 state employees were told to stay home, out of a total work force of 48,000. Every state park but three was ordered closed at sundown. 
 Then there was personal pressure: Mr. Weicker, whose ability to work his will with individual state lawmakers one on one has been demonstrated amply in his six months as Governor, began a series of what his office called summit meetings with the party leaders in the General Assembly.
 
The Big Question
 Conducted in Camp David-style seclusion at the Governor's mansion, the meetings were to extend through the holiday and into the weekend, presumably until a middle ground is found or one side or the other blinks on the question of an income tax. Through two budget vetoes and now through the third full day of a new fiscal year with no budget at all, Mr. Weicker has insisted on the tax just as hard as lawmakers have resisted.
It was a day of soft drinks and coats off at the Governor's back porch, according to the cryptic communique issued about the talks' progress, while, across the state, residents registered a mixture of bewilderment, anger and frustration about how and why things could have come to such a pass.
"I've had it," said David G. Benham, a Torrington resident who was evicted from his camping spot by rangers at Rocky Neck State Park on Tuesday, only to find out today that the park was reopening. He came back, even more in need of a vacation than before. "I figure the state owes me money for gas," he said. "And I'm not leaving again."
Mr. Weicker announced what he termed good news this morning at a Capitol news conference that Rocky Neck, in East Lyme, and two other heavily used shoreline parks -- Hammonasset Beach State Park in Madison and Sherwood Island in Westport -- would reain open, using $43,000 in corporate charity to pay for lifeguards and parking-booth clerks.
He had said on Tuesday that he would act immediately on a two-week temporary budget resolution that would set in motion events that could lead to a complete end to the shutdown. But a spokesman, Charles F. J. Morse, announced in a statement just before the news conference today that the decision had been deferred, and Mr. Weicker declined to take questions on it from reporters.
The resolution, already passed by both chambers of the General Assembly, has been on Mr. Weicker's desk since Tuesday. The resolution would put into place a temporary promise to meet all of the state's financial obligations.
 
Public Disagreement
 The Governor had said he would veto that bill, thus allowing the House and the Senate to proceed with an all but certain two-thirds override vote that would put the temporary budget in place over his objections. Under state law he could hold off that process until next Tuesday, five business days after passage, before it would become law without his signature. Or he could veto it any time before that.
In deferring the veto and prolonging the emergency shutdown, Mr. Weicker has publicly disagreed with two of the state's top elected officials -- the Attorney General and the State Comptroller -- both of whom argue that any budget authorization, even a temporary one, is better than the legal and economic limbo of having no budget at all.
Mr. Weicker said again today that a budget extension would be disastrous for the state because it would legally and formally eliminate a $340 million package of wage and benefit concessions negotiated with state employees. By promising to meet all state obligations, the extension would put the state in the position of promising the pay raises and pension payments that unions have said they would defer. It would also set a precedent of budget failure, he said.
But in a legislature that only seems to do anything at all under pressure, the vise that Mr. Weicker has applied to the process may not be entirely unwelcomed by the leaders now meeting with the Governor, some of whom are firm supporters of an income tax and could presumably use the continued shutdown as another means to lean on reluctant members of the rank and file.
And every player in the process seemed ready to raise the stakes today, or at least create that impression. The coalition representing unionized state employees announced, for example, in a terse news release that the state had "walked away" from the union concessions by failing to pass a budget and that "there is no agreement."
Earlier this year, Mr. Weicker presented the group with the choice of accepting either massive layoffs or the concessions. Today a spokesman for the group declined to say that "no agreement" really meant that all bets were entirely off.
"Our point was to clear the air," said the union spokesman, Robert Krzys. "We're still interested in trying to lead out of the crisis, but it's obviously more difficult now."
Within the General Assembly, the question of who might be willing to lead the way out of the crisis that hangs over the holiday "summit" remains something of a mystery. The House of Representatives, for example, has a strong contingent of income tax supporters, including the Speaker, Richard J. Balducci, a Democrat from Newington, and remains the only chamber to have passed an income tax plan.
 
Straddle Districts
 That proposal, a compromise package that featured a more modest income tax than Mr. Weicker had sought, and thus less of a drop in the sales tax, a main plank of the Governor's plan, was killed in the Senate Tuesday afternoon. The Senate has long been regarded as a sort of doomsday chamber for any income tax. The Senate minority leader, M. Adela Eads, Republican of Kent, has been a hard-line opponent, and many of the majority Democrats, including the Senate President John B. Larson, a Democrat from East Hartford, have not been far behind.
Lawmakers say many senators, representing large districts that take in both cities and suburbs, are more likely than House members to have at least some core community of constituents who are vocal against an income tax. In many such straddle districts, taking a position on such an uncomfortable and unpopular issue invariably means offending one group over the other.
But almost all groups will be affected by the park closings. The Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection, Timothy R. E. Keeney, said about 250,000 people usually visit the three big seaside parks on a Fourth of July weekend. An additional 250,000 would typically visit the other parks that are being closed.
 
A Select Committee on the Budget
 Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. is meeting with Democratic and Republican leaders of the Connecticut Senate and House of Representatives to come up with a budget and tax plan that can be put to the General Assembly this weekend. Past positions on an income tax are not predictive; legislators who have vehemently opposed some income tax plans say they are willing to consider others.
 
Richard J. Balducci, Democrat, Newington. Speaker of the House. Business owner. Elected to House in 1975. Favors income tax to restructure tax system.
 
Robert F. Frankel, Democrat, Stratford. House majority leader. Lawyer. Elected to House in 1977. Favors income tax to restructure tax system.
 
Edward C. Krawiecki Jr., Republican, Bristol. House minority leader. Lawyer. Elected to House in 1979. Has opposed income-tax plans but does not rule one out.
 
John B. Larson, Democrat, East Hartford. Senate president pro tempore. Insurance agent. Elected to Senate in 1983. Opposes income tax.
 
Cornelius P. O'Leary, Democrat, Windsor Locks. Senate majority leader. Lawyer. Served in House 1973-77. Elected to Senate in 1977. Opposes broad-based income tax; favors tax on higher-income residents.
 
M. Adela Eads, Republican, Kent. Served in House 1977-81. Elected to Senate in 1981. Strongly opposes income tax.

U.S. Rescinds Approval of A Malt Liquor

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
The Government ordered the G. Heileman Brewing Company yesterday to stop marketing its Power Master malt liquor, whose high alcohol content had brought protests. Heileman, which said it would comply, will be able to sell existing stocks of the beverage for four months.
Heileman had been told earlier in the day that it faced a potential boycott of its top-selling Colt 45 brand if it continued to market Power Master. The company announced that it was agreeing to discontinue the product because of the "economic burden a legal contest would entail." 
 Heileman, based in La Crosse, Wis., has been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since January.
 
Alcohol Content of 5.9%
 The decision was viewed as a success by critics of Power Master, which has an alcohol content of 5.9 percent. They had contended that Power Master was aimed at blacks, who suffer disproportionately from alcohol-related illnesses.
The opponents, led by religious leaders from across the country, asserted that Heileman was using the name Power Master to covertly advertise the higher alcohol content in violation of Federal rules. Power Master has 31 percent more alcohol than Colt 45, which has an alcohol content of 4.5 percent.
In addition to the grass-roots campaign, whose leaders included the Rev. Calvin Butts of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, the product was criticized by Surgeon General Antonia Novello, who contended that Heileman was aiming Power Master at young black men.
The controversy reached a fever pitch yesterday, as Heileman executives met with protesters in Chicago and with officials of the Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. On Tuesday, the bureau ordered the company to stop using the Power Master name. Yesterday, it announced that it had officially withdrawn its earlier approval of the Power Master label and that the company could no longer market the beverage.
But because of the earlier approval, the brewer "will be able to sell existing stocks over the next four months," Stephen E. Higgins, the bureau's director, said in a statement.
 
Earlier Defiance
 The ruling came hours after Heileman executives pledged to continue to market Power Master in the face of a boycott. The Rev. Michael Pfleger, a Roman Catholic priest on the South Side of Chicago and a leader of the protest, met for two hours with Michael Evans, a Heileman vice president, and Randy Smith, the company's general counsel, who traveled to Chicago to answer criticism about the brewery's advertising.
The Heileman executives were told that a boycott of Colt 45 was scheduled to start Friday in 10 cities. After the Government issued its ruling, Heileman conceded.
Power Master is the second product aimed at black consumers to be pulled off the shelves in the last year because of protests about health risks. In 1990, the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company abruptly canceled its marketing of Uptown cigarettes.
Opponents said the developments showed that companies could not disregard the concerns of blacks. "This demonstrates to corporations that the black community is taking an activist role in consumer and marketing issues," said Ken Smikle, president of the African American Marketing and Media Association, a trade group.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET BATTLES;
To the 'Nonessential,' Weicker's Shutdown Stings

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, July 3

 BODY:
Everyone in state government is essential, but some are more essential than others.
Connecticut's capital bowed to the Orwellian inevitable when government shut off every service save those deemed vital but not without bringing confusion and anger to its citizens -- and considerably wounded pride to its bureaucrats. Many of the latter, in fact, had trouble recognizing themselves in the unflattering description, "nonessential." 
 "That is a horrible word," said David Dearborn, an employee at the Department of Human Resources, whose services were deemed temporarily expendable on Wednesday. "I prefer to call myself 'not-as-essential.' "
State agencies were not immune from feeling slighted. The Election Enforcement Commission was one that lobbied strenuously to stay open late last week, arguing that its mandate to police voting procedure was absolutely essential. Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s aides had to gently explain, "You would be if this were November, but this is July." Employees at the election commission were asked to stay home along with some 20,000 other state workers officially furloughed.
 
Almost Empty State Building
 The result on Wednesday was an antic State House teeming with absolutely essential legislative staffers, budget analysts and computer technicians, and, across Capitol Street in Hartford, an almost empty gray granite State Office Building where only a very few employees of the Consumer Protection Agency and the Environmental Protection Agency as well as other branches of government were needed.
The State Office Building's main doors were sealed shut with yellow "do not enter" ribbon similar to the tape the police use to block off homicide areas. Inside, door after door was shut, desk after desk vacant, while a few essential workers, those who process state revenue checks, huddled along darkened corridors that had the forlorn air of a school building during an epidemic of measles.
Those citizens who phoned in and were lucky enough to have their calls answered by volunteers who went into work, were greeted with the sing-song response, "That person has been furloughed and will be back in his office when the state has a budget."
For many state residents, at least those without Fourth of July plans in 25 closed state parks, or car registrations that expired on July 1, or a sudden yen for a fishing license, the government shutdown was barely noticed. "We can't issue a license today, but we could arrest you tomorrow," is how Wanda Rickerby, of the Environmental Protection Agency, explained the predicament.
 
Court and Lotto Continue
 Don Phee of New Haven went to his local Department of Motor Vehicles to register his car on Wednesday, blithely unaware that the department had been shut down. "I don't have a TV or a radio," he said. "I'm not normal."
State police patrolled the highways, courts stayed open and the lottery, lotto, jai-alai and the tracks, essential sources of revenue if not always matters of life and death, went on as usual. (Only Off-Track Betting was shut down.) Even those not directly affected by the shutdown, however, were disgusted.
"This is the true meaning of politics," said Robert Mattes, 38 years old, of Granby, Conn., who sells computer software to insurance companies. "Politicians push their policies, and shove their employees between a rock and a hard place."
The state's information hot line, a phone bank set up to answer questions about the shutdown, was deluged. Thousands of confused residents wanted to know the latest status of parks, banks, lotto, drivers licenses, welfare checks, unemployment compensation and even whether summer school homework was still due (it was).
 
Outraged Residents
 Many state employees called for more specific information, demanding to know who exactly in their department had judged them "nonessential."
"I just refer them to their commissioner or personnel department," Bruce Bockstael, an architect for the Department of Public Works who volunteered after he was furloughed, said weariliy.
The hot line also became a de facto consumer complaints department as outraged residents unable to get through to their Governor or local representative commandeered volunteers to listen to their indignation.
"I got a whole family yesterday," said Tom Moriarty, one of 24 state employees answering phones. "First the man yelled at me, then he got tired and put his son on, and then the mother took over." The family had been disappointed by the cancellation of a fireworks display.
"What the state considers an essential service, and what people consider essential isn't always the same," said Michele Sullivan, deputy press secretary to the Governor.
 
Government Choices
 Some government choices, however, were not always easy to fathom. The State Psychiatric Security Review Board, which oversees forensic mental patients, stayed open, while the Board of Parole, did not. In that case, as in others, the state's legal liability was as much a part of the decision as the service provided. "The Psychiatric Security Review Board has legal custody of those patients," the Governor's press secretary, Avis Meehan, said. "They are ultimately responsible."
The entire welfare department known in Connecticut as the Department of Income Maintenance, and which had mailed out monthly checks before the shutdown, was closed until next Tuesday. Yet the Bureau of Rehabilitation Services, a branch of the Human Services Department, was able to hold its weekly job training seminar on Tuesday for the handicapped, because 80 percent of its funding is Federal and the state was in danger of losing that support if it shut down that program.
There were other odd twists of administrative fate.
Vincent Diana Jr., a technical systems analyst for the Department of Education who was also furloughed, attended a union rally held in support of an income tax increase on Monday at the Capitol, where, inevitably, the conversation turned to who was essential and who was not. Mr. Diana was surprised to run into a female accountant from his division who was deemed "essential" and remained on the payroll. He recalled that only last spring she had been given a pink slip during a mass layoff plan, which had been forestalled at the last minute by union concessions.
Not all of it makes sense, said Donald Morton, a Labor Department employee who learned he was being furloughed on Tuesday, and noticed that some Department of Transportation maintenance workers were still on the payroll.
"Is cutting grass more essential than what I did?" he asked.
He added pensively, "At least not with all the rain we've been having."

HEADLINE: Records Indicate Company Ignored Warning on Drug

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
The Swiss maker of a widely used sedative was warned by its American affiliate six years before the drug was marketed in the United States that in certain circumstances it could cause life-threatening side-effects, according to internal company documents.
Yet the company, F. Hoffmann-La Roche, went ahead with what the affiliate correctly predicted would be a dangerously concentrated formulation, and more than 40 deaths and about as many injuries resulted. 
 The drug, known as Versed, was designed to replace injectable Valium as its patent expired. The documents, made available to The New York Times by a person who said he was outraged at the company's conduct, include a memorandum from the company's own legal advisers stating that it might have disregarded safety concerns for economic reasons.
 
Company Cites Clinic Trials
 The company denied that it had acted improperly or ignored warnings from its own employees about safety problems. It characterized the initial recognition of safety problems as a preliminary concern that was allayed by additional data. It stated that safety was a concern from the beginning and that the drug passed all its safety and clinical trials without adverse effects.
Max W. Gurtner, the director of corporate information for the company at its headquarters in Basel, Switzerland, and Carolyn R. Glynn, a spokeswoman at the headquarter's of the company's United States affiliate, Hoffman-La Roche Inc., in Nutley, N.J., declined to allow executives to be interviewed but responded with written answers to questions about Versed's development.
Versed (it is pronounced VER-sed) was promoted as a drug to produce conscious sedation, a twilight sleep in which patients are conscious during minor operations, like oral surgery or colonoscopies, but have no memory of the procedure. It could also be used before and during general anesthesia.
 
Problems From Beginning
 But from the time it came on the market in March 1986, doctors had problems with the drug. They wrote to the company and testified at a 1988 Congressional hearing about problems with Versed that it was so concentrated that they could easily give too much. The doctors, as they dripped the drug into patients' veins, said they could quickly overshoot conscious sedation and go straight to unconsciousness or even death.
The company wanted Versed to look like injectable Valium, which meant marketing it in the same concentration as Valium and in the same sort of ampuls, the internal company documents indicated. But Versed was up to four times as potent as Valium, and it left doctors small room for error.
The company documents show that the potential dangers of the concentrated Versed were no surprise to Hoffman-La Roche executives. In 1979 and 1980, Dr. Ronald Kuntzman, a vice president for pharmaceutical research and development at Hoffman-La Roche in Nutley, supported by a group of researchers and administrators, urged officials at the concern's headquarters in Basel to use a less concentrated form of the drug. But his concerns were overruled.
In a letter on Feb. 21, 1980, Dr. Roman Amrein, head of clinical research for central nervous system substances at Hoffman-La Roche in Basel, laid out the company's reasoning. He noted certain safety factors in favor of the higher-dose version of Versed, like the fact that it required less of the chemical to dissolve the drug. He went on to discuss various marketing considerations, including the desirability of presenting the drug in the ampuls used for Valium and not the larger vials required by the low-concentration version of Versed.
 
Scientific Problem Takes a Back Seat
 He concluded by stating that the economic concerns outweighed the scientific. "The scientific problem is, at present, less significant," he wrote. "For the commercial exploitation, it is, however, under the circumstances decisive with regard to the price. It has to be taken into consideration that the cost price for the vial form is around three to five times that of the ampul which we have proposed."
After receiving this letter, Dr. Kuntzman made one more effort to persuade Roche headquarters in Basel to use the lower concentration.
In a letter to Dr. Amrein on April 1, 1980, Dr. Kuntzman explained his group's fears that the drug would be particularly problematic when used for conscious sedation in doctors' offices. He expressed particular concern about apnea, a temporary cessation of breathing, and cardiovascular collapse.
Referring to Versed by its chemical name, Dr. Kuntzman wrote, "The safety issue is expected to be of greatest concern when midazolam becomes available for direct intravenous administration for minor medical and dental procedures in situations in which there usually is neither resuscitation equipment available nor personnel trained in the use of these measures."
But three weeks later, Dr. Kuntzman changed his mind. He wrote to Basel saying that new data from the use of Versed for inducing unconsciousness before general anesthesia had led him to change his position.
In 1988, on the eve of a Food and Drug Administation investigation into the marketing of Versed, Hoffman-La Roche asked its law firm, Arnold & Porter, to review its internal documents. In a confidential memorandum to the company, Arnold & Porter lawyers expressed surprise at Dr. Kuntzman's sudden change of heart.
"Within three weeks of this detailed exposition of the Nutley position which had previously been articulated many times during the preceding year, new data were presented to completely reverse Nutley's position," the memo said. The memo went on to question Dr. Kuntzman's conversion to the Basel point of view. It pointed out that the new data were from the use of the drug to induce anesthesia, but Dr. Kuntzman had been primarily concerned about its use for conscious sedation.
 
Pressure From Top Cited in Document
 The Arnold & Porter memo concluded, "One interpretation possible from these documents is that Roche/Nutley disregarded its own concerns for safety of the drug in favor of marketing and political pressure from Roche/ Basel."
Stuart Land, a senior lawyer at Arnold & Porter, said he could not comment on the documents or the memorandum because of client confidentiality.
Dr. Kuntzman, reached at his home, said he had nothing to add to the written statements by Hoffman-La Roche.
From 1980 to 1985, Hoffman-La Roche tested the drug in clinical trials, which took place in settings where resuscitative equipment was available. Mr. Gurtner, the director of corporate information, said, "There were no deaths -- indeed, there were no unexpected problems -- in those American clinical trials."
Within 18 months after Versed went on the market in the United States, the F.D.A. received reports of 86 serious adverse reactions, including 46 deaths. Some experts say that other deaths may not have been reported. One anesthesiologist, Dr. Robert M. Julien of Portland, Ore., said he knew of seven deaths in Portland alone. "There were thousands and thousands of very close calls" throughout the country, he said, adding, "It was a real fiasco."
Dr. Julien, a former professor of anesthesiology at Oregon Health Sciences University and who is an author of anestheiology textbooks, wrote to Hoffman-La Roche in 1987 complaining about the concentrated formulation. He wrote that in a typical situation, he would have to drip in 0.056 cubic centimeter of drug a minute, an amount that is much less than a drop.
"I would state to any jury that 56/1,000 cc. is virtually impossible for any physician to accurately inject by any known human technology," he wrote. "In other words, the presentation of Versed is not only impractical, it is dangerous and any indication on your part that drug overdose is the sole responsibility of the physician is blatantly wrong."
Ms. Glynn, the Roche spokeswoman, said in a written response that at the time Dr. Julien sent his letter, the company had already submitted an application to the F.D.A. to market a less concentrated formulation "because we believed that some physicians preferred that formulation."
 
Doctors Distraught Over Patient Deaths
 Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of Public Citizen Health Research Group in Washington, said he had been called by several doctors who were distraught at their experience with Versed. This was the only time in his 20 years of consumer advocacy work that doctors called him to report deaths, Dr. Wolfe said. "These were conscientious doctors who had bought the Roche line that Versed is the greatest thing since sliced Valium," Dr. Wolfe said. When their patients died, the doctors felt terrible, he added. "They were practically crying on the phone." he said.
At the Congressional hearing held in 1988 by the House Subcommittee on Human Resourches and Intergovernmental Relations, officials of the Food and Drug Administration testified that they had not been informed of deaths and adverse reactions that had been reported in Europe before the drug was approved in the United States. They said they were also unaware that the British counterpart of their agency had forced Hoffman-La Roche to lower the concentration and dose of Versed 10 months before the F.D.A. approved the concentrated formulation.
Hoffman-La Roche said that it obeyed all the F.D.A.'s legal reporting requirements.
Company officials refused to testify at the committee hearing, but Mr. Gurtner questioned whether the deaths that occurred after Versed was marketed should be attributed solely to the drug. Mr. Gurtner said that some were ascribed to incidental events like suicides and medication errors, while those receiving the drug "included high-risk patients with severe systemic life-threatening diseases."
Representative Ted Weiss, the New York Democrat who is chairman of the subcommittee, has said he would ask for a criminal investigation into whether Hoffmann-La Roche withheld data about the drug Versed before or after its approval by the Government.
 
Company Is Selling Less Potent Version
 In July 1987 Hoffman-La Roche introduced a less concentrated formulation of Versed that it recommends for conscious sedation, and it recommended a lower maximum dose. It continues to market the original concentrated formulation.
The company sent two warning letters to doctors in 1987. One, in February, cautioned that there had been reports of deaths among patients who took the drug and that doctors should be particularly vigilant in monitoring patients who received it. In November, the company warned that Versed was three to four times as potent as Valium.
The F.D.A. would not comment on the results of its investigation or say when it forwarded its report to the Justice Department. The agency usually forwards reports "for prosecution or with a recommendation for submission to a grand jury to see if a prosecution is warranted," said Peter Barton Hutt, a Washington lawyer and former chief counsel for the F.D.A. "Otherwise, it would not be forwarded at all."
Dan Sigelman, an Atlanta lawyer who was counsel for Mr. Weiss's committee, noted the pressures that accumulate in a company as a drug nears the market.
"At some point, the executives have a very strong investment in successfully marketing it," Mr. Sigelman said. "This is not only a dollar investment, but also a career investment. It is often the case that people's entire careers become principally tied to a single product. There are tremendous incentives to speed a compound through to successful marketing. In that environment, one is much more likely to have marketing concerns take precedence over safety concerns."

HEADLINE: Sardi Offers Long View Of Theater And Close

BYLINE: By ALEX WITCHEL

 BODY:
When Vincent Sardi looks out from the theater district restaurant his parents founded in 1921, this is what he sees:
*The Shubert Theater, dark since "Buddy" closed in May. 
 *The Minskoff Theater, dark since "Black and Blue" closed in January.
*The Helen Hayes, dark since "Prelude to a Kiss" closed in May.
*The Broadhurst, dark since Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Aspects of Love" closed in March.
Not a pretty sight. But Mr. Sardi, 76 years old, says he has seen worse and is not prepared to roll over and die. He skips the rosy, out-of-touch press-release chat favored by Broadway producers, and pinpoints exactly those areas he thinks need help. He's watched Broadway flirt with dying before, and each time it changed its mind he was there to greet it, martini in hand.
Mr. Sardi came out of retirement to take Sardi's back from the producers Ivan Bloch and Harvey Klaris, and the restaurateur Stuart Lichtenstein, who bought it from him in 1985 and declared bankruptcy last year.
He has wasted no time catching up. Weary of the bad reviews his kitchen has received over the years -- in The New York Times, Bryan Miller called the menu antediluvian -- he has hired a new chef, Robert McGowan, who has worked at Le Cirque and "21." He has started publishing a Sardi's newsletter, is printing his menus in Japanese and accepts J.C.B., the Japanese equivalent of an American Express card. He hails the influx of new hotels in the Times Square area as "the biggest boom we've ever had here," and unlike most of Broadway's old guard, he is a major proponent of combining Broadway and Off Broadway "into one New York theater."
"The day of divorcing the two is over," he says. "Broadway producers just have to take a realistic point of view, to make the theatergoing public aware of Off Broadway. Take 'The World Goes 'Round,' the Kander and Ebb revue. That's a terrific show and it's playing on 43d Street. Not an Off Broadway theater, a New York theater. And I think the unions will have to make adjustments not just so the theater will survive, but flourish."
 
He Knows the Neighborhood
 This is the point where most Broadway producers would tell Mr. Sardi to stick to his cannelloni, but if anyone knows this neighborhood and what's good for it, he does.
He grew up on 56th Street, on the edge of Hell's Kitchen, in a railroad flat where his parents took in boarders in show business. When his parents started Sardi's, the family moved in above it. Mr. Sardi went to school at Holy Cross, on 43d Street, and at the age of 10 joined one of those boarders, an acrobat in vaudeville, "on tour."
In those days, Mr. Sardi says, on tour meant to Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx. He also had a part in a 1925 Broadway show called "The Master of the Inn." "I played a street urchin," he recalls, "and I was billed as the Little Wop. Can you imagine that happening now? I never got the acting bug, though. I used to lose my voice."
He concentrated on school and graduated from Columbia University in 1937. He then joined his parents in the restaurant, after it moved to its current site on 44th Street, down the street from its first home in a brownstone, long gone, between the Helen Hayes and St. James Theaters. "Lee Shubert put this building up for Dad in 1926," Mr. Sardi recalls. "It used to be apartments." He adds that he has "a few customers from back then, all theatergoers, who still come in," including Helen Hayes.
 
Flattering the Clientele
 And if Miss Hayes was not there during a recent lunch hour, some of her contemporaries were, along with a few local businessmen and more than a few tourists dressed in shorts, toting cameras. Mr. Sardi took a table at the restaurant's rear.
He is dressed elegantly, though he worries that his tie might not match his shirt since his wife of nine years, June Keller, the graphic artist, is in Vermont and did not check him. He looks physically fit, after years of polo playing, but he credits the restaurant's lighting with making him look better. "I've met women on the street I haven't recognized because they look so much more attractive in the restaurant," he says.
The burgundy banquettes and the famous caricatures crowded on the walls add to the room's romance. And Sardi's smells like a good time -- food, Scotch, women's perfume. It's the way your mother's coat smelled when she came home on a Saturday night. The waiters and bus boys service their tables dutifully, but when it comes to Mr. Sardi, each has eyes in the back of his head. There is no question who the star is in this Broadway house.
"The whole audience has changed," he says while a waiter pours coffee. "You would open a play on Broadway, it would run one season, then go on the road. It didn't run five, six years like they do now. So your whole audience was from New York. After New York they used to go to the hinterlands for an audience. Now the hinterlands come here."
 
The Words Not Used
 "But I resent the word tourist," he continues. "You cater to whatever audience you have. In the winter you get the business traveler, and that's why this area will improve, because these new hotels are geared for business people on expense accounts, which is definitely a theater audience. In July and August it will basically be foreign visitors to the city. Maybe New York has lost glamour for the American tourist, but all over Europe and the Far East we're considered very reasonable. I don't like the word cheap."
Still, Sardi's is not exempt from the recession. The groups that used to number 60 or 70 have been coming in at 30 or 35, Mr. Sardi says. Theater parties promise the restaurant, say, 150 people, and "I'm lucky if I get 110," Mr. Sardi says. But he adds: "We're ahead of our projections for this season. Of course we made very modest projections."
And Sardi's is still very much part of the theater community. Opening-night parties this season ran the gamut from "The Speed of Darkness" -- the first play produced under the Broadway Alliance, a plan to bring serious drama back to Broadway at prices affordable to the audience and the producers -- to "Miss Saigon."
Philip J. Smith, executive vice president of the Shubert Organization, which owns the Sardi's building, says: "Everybody in the theater loves Vincent. You see him on the floor at 12 noon, and if you look back in there at 11 at night, he's still at the door greeting people."
 
To Feel at Home
 Mr. Sardi says he does it because the most important thing, especially in these troubled times, is for customers to feel at home. He wants everyone to be as excited as he is by the prospect of going out to dinner and seeing a show. It is a ritual that remains as compelling and exotic now as it was to the child growing up in Hell's Kitchen.
His maitre d'hotel, Mitchell Albert, recalls an example of Mr. Sardi's dedication to his customers. "A few weeks ago," he says, "we had a family eating here who asked directions to the Nederlander Theater. It turned out they had tickets for "Our Country's Good," which had closed."
Mr. Sardi picks up the story: "They were a nice couple with two young girls. So I told them to eat while I went down to the box office at 'The Secret Garden' and explained what happened. It was a Saturday night so I couldn't get them four seats together, but I got two pairs. I put it on my American Express card, came back and told the man, 'When you get home, send me a check.' I thought he'd forget, but he didn't. It turns out he's president of a big oil company. You see, you never know about people."
That's for sure. Whatever made him go to such lengths for people he didn't even know? He looks genuinely taken aback. "Those kids were all dressed up to go to the theater," he says. "It would have been terrible to disappoint them."

The Rising Sun on Plymouth Rock

 BODY:
Plymouth, Mass. -- "America's home town" -- has had Fourth of July band music as long as anyone remembers. But the recession made it harder to find sponsors this year. Enter Kao Infosystems, which makes floppy disks for computers -- and friends for Japan. 
 Kao landed in Plymouth in 1989 from Tokyo, and claims to be at least as American as those who landed in 1620. As evidence, it is paying for six hours of bluegrass, country-and-western and old-fashioned band music today just a stone's throw from the famous rock. It also has a float in the parade, offering out balloons and candy.
East may be east and west may be west, but today the twain meet in Plymouth.

HEADLINE: In the Nation;
Riding the Quota Wave

BYLINE: By TOM WICKER;

 BODY:
Starting this week, Tom Wicker's column will appear on Thursdays and Sundays. 
It used to be said down South that the only way to get a mule's attention was to hit it over the head with a two-by-four. If anyone doubted that "quotas" and the Democrats' alleged partiality to them will be a Republican theme in 1992, Jesse Helms got out his lumber last week and gave them a good lick.
Mr. Helms, the well-known "Senator No" from North Carolina, is not a man to let the voters wonder where he stands. In 1989, when some optimists doubted he would run again, he dashed their hopes by taking up arms against the Mapplethorpe show -- as good as an announcement of his candidacy. 
 In 1990, it appeared for a time that Senator No might be beaten by a strong black candidate, Harvey Gantt. Close students of the Senator's brand of politics never accepted this shining vision; sure enough, he turned the tide with a TV spot depicting a white man losing a job due to "quotas" for blacks.
Now Mr. Helms has introduced an amendment to civil rights legislation that would bar employers from granting any kind of preferential treatment whatever, in hiring, compensation or promotion, if based on race, color, religion, national origin or sex.
This, after centuries of the most blatant preferences in every aspect of American economic life -- preferences for whites, males, usually for those of Western European stock, almost always for English-speakers, all too often for Protestants. What blatant hypocrisy it would be for the Senate to say, after such a record, that preferences were no longer permissible.
Now, of course, some preferences are called quotas, whether they are or not, and are extended to blacks, Hispanics, Asians, women. Admittedly, they might once in a while inconvenience or disadvantage a white, Protestant male. But in the face of a history of discrimination, is rigid evenhandedness to be the test of a candidate's or party's devotion to American values?
If so, it's as distorted a view of history and reality as the argument that any deviation from the idea of a "colorblind" America must be denounced. Since when was America colorblind? When is it ever likely to be? Colorblindness is an ideal, not a fair standard of current action or employment rules.
The Helms amendment is less a serious proposal than a typically shifty Helms device to insure that those who dare to vote against it can be pilloried next year for "favoring quotas." Even before its introduction, President Bush had branded the civil rights bill a "quota bill." He has stuck to this indictment against all arguments -- not just by Democrats and black leaders but also the pleas of Republicans like Senator John Danforth of Missouri, who tried hard to get Mr. Bush to accept a compromise and now describes the adamant White House position as fostering job discrimination.

Mr. Bush is regarded as sure to veto the legislation as a "quota bill." With the aid of the Helms amendment, he can seek to establish himself and his party in 1992 as defenders, against quota-wielding Democrats, of an evenhanded, colorblind, non-preferential American working life. In such an America, the actuality soon would be pervasive preference for white males, as it always was in the past.
Besides, as Representative Howard Wolpe of Michigan recently said in a notable speech: "The real enemy of beleaguered workers today is not affirmative-action programs designed to overcome a legacy of race prejudice and discrimination, but an economy that does not provide secure employment for all Americans. The solution is not to fight over who gets the limited number of jobs available, but to create more jobs and to train people to fill them."
Education, unfortunately, could be another testing ground for the quota theme. Lamar Alexander, the Secretary of Education, told a House subcommittee the other day that he feared cultural-diversity policies and multicultural curriculums in higher education might lead "to race-based hiring quotas at educational institutions receiving Federal funds."
That might happen in some cases. But even if it did, those cases could be dealt with individually; the possibility is insufficient reason to ban or even to discourage cultural diversity in higher education. That would be like taking up a two-by-four to get a mule's attention -- or escalating the quota theme into a national crisis in order to win an election.

HEADLINE: The Bank Bill: More Profit, Less Loss

 BODY:
Radical bank reform could still be tampered with, even torpedoed in coming days, but the story so far can be told in four happy words: good and getting better. The House Banking Committee has now voted to reshape the banking system, improving on an already wise proposal by the Bush Administration.
The bill must snake through the House energy and Senate banking committees; members have expressed opposition to various provisions. The bill can and should be improved. But its two main provisions are essential -- to close failed banks early and to let banks increase profits. Meddling here would doom effective reform. 
 Though the bill is dizzyingly complex, its logic is simple. Regulators would be required to close troubled banks quickly, before they ran out of reserves, thereby protecting taxpayers. And banks would be empowered to diversify their investments, making it easier to earn reasonable profits.
Shareholders would be required to keep a substantial amount of money in the bank. If bank losses mounted and shareholder capital fell below preset targets, regulators would halt dividends and restrict new loans. If losses continued, regulators would be required to close the bank while there were still reserves to pay depositors.
These rules would prevent a replay of the savings and loan debacle. Then, regulators were under extreme political pressure to let crippled savings institutions lend money in desperate gambles for salvation.
The bank bill would thus protect taxpayers from having to pay for vast amounts of deposit insurance. Meanwhile, it would permit banks to earn more. They could set up branches throughout the country and, if well capitalized, sell insurance, mutual funds and securities.
Yet, there are grounds for criticizing the bill. Capital standards are too low; regulators still retain too much discretion. And the provision that would permit -- in an attempt to attract new capital -- commercial businesses to buy banks raises serious doubts.
Opponents argue that commercial ownership is dangerous and unnecessary, because capital will flow once banking is profitable. The provision would, they say, invite financial self-dealing and force the Federal Reserve to bail out parent companies to save banks.
The bill adequately addresses these fears. But if Congress remains jittery, it could strip commercial ownership from the bill without compromising the integrity of the other provisions.
Another challenge will come from Representative Charles Schumer of New York and other proponents of "core bank" proposals. The idea is to wall off insured deposits from other funds. Interest rates paid on them would be capped, tied to market rates on government securities. And restrictions would be placed on loans from insured deposits.
Core banks would provide appealing protection. But the cap on interest rates is a fatal flaw. During crises, private rates can rise well above government rates. If private rates were capped, depositors would withdraw their money, just when the economy would be most vulnerable.
Over the next several weeks, House and Senate committees will take hefty whacks at the banking bill. But if they spare the two key provisions, everybody will benefit: depositors, investors -- and taxpayers.

HEADLINE: Hold on, Here Comes The Next Bank Fiasco

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"New Finance Woes: F.D.I.C. Loss Worse; S.& L. Crisis Deeper" (front page, June 11). "Court Backs Banks' Sales of Insurance" (Business Day, June 11). There is a connection here. 
 This is the same Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Government that promised in 1988 that the cost of the savings and loan institutions bailout would not exceed $50 billion, right? Has not the same F.D.I.C. assured us that banks would not follow the savings and loans into a financial black hole?
Is this not the same banking industry that, with Washington's blessing, lent money to nonperforming oil-producing countries in the 1970's on the ground that oil producers cannot go broke, and sank billions into the late Eastern bloc, arguing that the Soviet Union must back these loans to save its own credit? Are the insurance companies now complaining about new competition the same ones that sank policyholder dollars into the same junk bonds and overpriced real estate as the S.& L.'s did?
Do the banks that have yet to find the bottom of the savings and loan-banking crisis really need another abyss into which to throw a trillion or so taxpayer-guaranteed dollars? They seem to think a Washington that is functioning beyond its intellectual capacity is willing to overlook prior sins. Must taxpayers conclude that, within a decade or so, our funds will be used to honor policies for lives and homes because the banks, like the insurers before them, threw policyholder premiums into bad investments? What assurances can Washington give that we can expect a more optimistic scenario?
Our "protectors" in Washington now wish to reduce the deposit insurance for small taxpayers to cover the bad guesses and demonstrated incompetence of large campaign contributors.

HEADLINE: Egypt's Arms Control Plan for Region

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, July 4

 BODY:
The Egyptian Foreign Minister unveiled new proposals today for Middle East arms control, including the demand that Israel be subject to the same restrictions as Arab countries on weapons of mass destruction.
Announcing the plan at a news conference for foreign journalists, Foreign Minister Amr Moussa declined to respond directly to a question about a report on British television last week that an Egyptian-based company, jointly owned by Arab and British interests, was cooperating with North Korea to develop and manufacture an extended-range version of the Scud-B missile. 
 Since the report was broadcast on the British Broadcasting Corp's investigative program Panorama, Defense Ministry and other officials here have declined to respond to repeated invitations to either confirm or deny it.
The Scud-B, originally designed by the Soviet Union with a range of around 200 miles, was deployed by Iraq during the Gulf war in a version Baghdad had developed that increased the range and lightened the pay-load. The missile is said to be capable of delivering chemical weapons, but Iraq, in attacks on Israel and Saudi Arabia, fired only conventional warheads.
 
Regional Disarmament Plan
 Mr. Moussa said President Hosni Mubarak had proposed that the Middle East be made a region free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.
But in a response to the Bush Administration's call for the Middle East arms race to be slowed after the Gulf War, Mr. Moussa said the Egyptian suggestions had been expanded to include a role for the United Nations in Middle East arms control, the adherence of all Middle East countries to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and a variety of other steps to secure formal commitments by all Middle Eastern countries to renounce nuclear, chemical or biological arms.
Israel is the only Middle Eastern country that is understood to possess functioning nuclear weapons.
Mr. Moussa made clear that the thrust of the Egyptian ideas was to have Israel included in any new arms control program. His comments reflected widespread Arab suspicion that the United States wants to use Middle East arms control to shelter Israel's military supremacy while further weakening Arab nations. after the decimation of Iraq's military power in the Gulf War.
"Precarious asymmetries cannot continue to prevail in a region striving for a just and comprehensive peace," he said.
In his summary of the Egyptian ideas, Mr. Moussa said Egypt urged Middle Eastern countries "to deal effectively and equitably with the issue of means of delivery of weapons of mass destruction in all their different forms."
Mr. Moussa said he would not respond directly to a question about how this proposal affected the program described by the BBC report to develop an improved Scud-B missile.
According to the Panorama report, an Egyptian-based consortium jointly owned by an Arab consortium and British Aerospace P.L.C. -- Britain's leading weapons manufacturer -- were involved in a project with the North Koreans to develop improved Scud-B's.
Panorama identified the joint venture as the Arab-British Dynamics Company, based in Heliopolis on the outskirts of Cairo. A British Aerospace spokeswoman, Irene Dodgson, said 30 per cent of the concern was owned by British Aerospace and 70 per cent by the Cairo-based Arab Organization for Industrialization, an arms manufacturer owned by Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Qatar and Egypt.
 
Reports of Missile Project
 Ms. Dodgson and British Government spokesmen would neither confirm nor deny that Arab-British Dynamics was involved in a program to develop an upgraded Scud.
The television report, which cited unnamed "intelligence sources," said the program with the North Koreans was nearing the production stage.
Before Iraq invaded Kuwait last Aug. 2, Egypt, along with Jordan and North Yemen, was grouped with Iraq in an economic body called the Arab Cooperation Council, which Baghdad had sought to transform into a military alliance strengthening previous military cooperation between the four nations in Iraq's war with Iran.
At that time Egypt was said by diplomats to be selling Iraq up to $1 billion worth of ammunition and other arms supplies a year. Retired Egyptian officers were loaned to the Iraqi military as advisers and officials here said privately that Cairo had shared rudimentary chemical weapons technology with Baghdad.

HEADLINE: Guyana Marxist, Mellowed, Makes a Comeback

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GEORGETOWN, Guyana

 BODY:
Surrounded by plaques and medals struck with likenesses of Marx and Lenin and other political mementos that seem almost quaint after Communism's collapse, Cheddi Jagan, a 73-year-old leftist crusader, lacks no enthusiasm for explaining why his time has finally come.
His face lit beneath a wispy halo of white hair, Dr. Jagan proclaims his rebirth, calling himself a "Gorbachev before Gorbachev," 27 years after the United States and Britain helped maneuver him from power for fear of seeing a Communist beachhead on the South American mainland. 
 Now, after decades of this continent's most orthodox authoritarian socialism under one of his rivals, Dr. Jagan is making a comeback. Foreign diplomats and the leaders of a cluster of smaller opposition parties describe him as the favorite in elections expected this year in this nation of 650,000 wedged between Venezuela and Suriname on South America's northern coast.
In 1953, with a strong base among this country's downtrodden East Indian sugar plantation workers, Dr. Jagan's People's Progressive Party won an overwhelming victory in colonially administered elections. The fiery young Marxist held the prime ministership for 153 days, before the British suspended the Constitution out of fear of "Communist subversion" and removed him from office.
 
Two Decades of Socialism
 Despite succeeding election victories, American opposition and a new proportional representation system helped insure that Dr. Jagan's longtime rival, Forbes Burnham, would eventually lead South America's only English-speaking nation out of colonial rule in 1966.
Under the control of President Burnham's black-based People's National Congress, Guyana underwent two decades of socialism that drove this country, the former British Guiana, into poverty. Since Mr. Burnham's death in 1985, his successor, Desmond Hoyte, a longtime official of the People's National Congress, has moved gradually to undo much of his predecessor's socialist legacy.
With the Government promising that this fall it will hold what international human rights monitors say would be the first free and fair election in Guyana since 1964, Dr. Jagan, long the Moscow-inspired purist, is competing with his rivals on questions like who can best attract foreign investment and safeguard political liberties.
That he is the front-runner after all these years is partly a testament, his supporters say, to the personal integrity widely attributed to him. Another factor is the ethnic tension that continues to divide this nation into two main groups: the offspring of East Indian indentured servants, like Dr. Jagan himself, and the descendants of African slaves, giving Dr. Jagan a near-captive racial base that makes up about 50 percent of the electorate.
 
'Nothing Works Here'
 But perhaps most responsible for making Dr. Jagan the election favorite, Guyanese and foreign diplomats say, is the condition of this nation itself. In 27 years of rule by the People's National Congress, Guyana has been driven from breadbasket of the Caribbean to contender for the title of the hemisphere's poorest country.
Even in predominantly black Georgetown, long a stronghold of the People's National Congress, years of perceived electoral fraud and severe economic decay seem to have taken their toll on the Government's core supporters.
"We never had to vote for them in the past because we knew the vote was going to be rigged anyway," said an unemployed Afro-Guyanese professional. "Now even many black people are willing to vote for a change. Nothing works here and there is no reason to stay."
On average, diplomats estimate, every flight that leaves here these days carries away 20 Guyanese emigrants, part of an estimated 5 percent of the population that is now thought to be leaving each year.
 
A Fillip of Leftism
 To fight this, Dr. Jagan looks to foreign investment -- with a fillip of the leftism of old.
"Foreign capital must be given incentives," he said in an interview, criticizing the Government's newborn economic conservatism. "We agree on the basic goals. But we must start the development process from the local level, involving the people's organizations, the farmers' organizations and trade unions in the decision making."
When asked how he felt about the United States, three decades after it worked to keep him out of power, Dr. Jagan said: "What happened to us was part and parcel of the cold war. It wasn't that we were charged with suppressing the people or doing anything wrong." Professing no bitterness, he added, "We appreciate the help of those in Congress who are supporting fair elections."
 
Still a Goal
 While support for Dr. Jagan seems to be growing among the disinherited, others here wonder how much his Marxist prescriptions have changed.
After years of competing for the image of true champion of the left, the Government now criticizes Dr. Jagan as being too socialist. "Many people may perceive that voting for Cheddi is jumping from the frying pan into the fire," said one Government official, Kit Nascimento, chairman of the Guyana Public Communications Agency.
For his part, Dr. Jagan, who spoke wistfully of his socialist dream, seemed to acknowledge it would have to await another era. "We feel that in this stage of our struggle we want what we call a national democratic program, not a socialist program," he said. "We maintain that as a goal for the end of the road."

HEADLINE: For Fed, a New Set of Tea Leaves

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
From corporate offices to the headquarters of the Federal Reserve, economists are always looking out for new indicators that will give them clues to where things are headed. David W. Mullins Jr., a governor of the Federal Reserve and its vice chairman-designate, is betting that an experimental indicator of bond market jitters will help tell him whether investors expect inflation to flare.
The index's current calm readings suggest that the Fed has some latitude to ease its monetary policy if other conditions warrant -- though Mr. Mullins and other Fed officials have made it clear that they see no reason for easing right now. 
 Many economists look to the Fed itself to divine where interest rates and the economy are heading. Fed officials can directly influence short-term rates, but they are often uncertain about how their actions will affect long-term rates. Will an easing by the Fed result in lower long-term rates by making more money available for lending, or raise rates as investors question the Fed's commitment to fighting inflation?
 
Possible Answers
 Mr. Mullins said his indicator, which uses the prices of Treasury bond options to measure investor uncertainty, could help answer such questions.
Mr. Mullins, said by some at the Fed to exert significant influence already, has been talking up this measure with other members of the Fed's policy-setting Open Market Committee. He has also asked Fed staffers in Washington to begin the basic research that, he said, could result in the indicator's formal inclusion in policy deliberations. "There is a lot of groundwork that has to be done," he said.
Some Wall Street economists doubt that the indicator will prove as useful as Mr. Mullins expects, or as reliable as, say, exchange rates or commodity prices. "It's a reach," said Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Company. "The U.S. options market isn't sufficiently well developed nor is it truly international."
But the New York Fed, the most powerful of the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks because it carries out the directives of the Open Market Committee, already follows the indicator closely.
"We pay a lot of attention to options markets," said Charles M. Lucas, the senior vice president for international capital markets at the New York Fed. "Our view is that they reveal the market's expectations of future variability of the price of bonds." Bond prices vary inversely with interest rates.
The inventor of Treasury bond options, Richard L. Sandor, an executive managing director at Kidder, Peabody & Company, also favors the Fed's use of the indicator. "The market, unlike some economists' model, does reveal participants' expectations," he said.
Mr. Mullins readily agrees that the indicator has been far more popular among bond traders than economists. Traders have used the measure for years to forecast options prices. "Normally, macroeconomists don't look at this number, and market-oriented people don't think about how to use it in a macroeconomic context," Mr. Mullins said.
 
An Intimidating Name
 Underlying the indicator's intimidating name -- the implied volatility of options prices on Treasury bonds -- and its complex mathematical derivation is a simple concept: Options are a kind of insurance, with their costs reflecting both the prices of underlying assets and the perceived risks.
"When the environment gets riskier, the price of insurance goes up," said Steven P. Feinstein, an economist at Boston University and a former Fed staffer in Atlanta.
Options are rights to buy or sell assets, like 30-year Treasury bonds, at a specified price within a certain time. Corporations and financial institutions use them to hedge their risks, locking in a price or protecting against an unfavorable price change.
Two University of Chicago finance professors, Fischer Black and Myron S. Scholes, invented a formula in 1973 for how much this insurance, the option, should cost, based on how much volatility investors foresee. The greater the expected volatility, the more the option costs.
 
Inferring Market Risks
 "Anyone equipped with that formula can infer how risky the market thinks investing in a given asset is at a given point in time," Mr. Feinstein explained.
The implied volatility can be calculated primarily from the prices of an option and the underlying asset. The Chicago Board of Trade, where options on Treasury bonds are traded, publishes a chart of implied volatilities in its monthly newsletter. A 10 percent reading for an option on a bond worth $1,000 means that investors expect the price to vary between $900 and $1,100 over the year ahead.
Mr. Mullins said that as a guide to inflation fears, implied volatility could help the Fed gauge how investors might respond to its actions: for example, when steps meant to lower long-term interest rates might backfire and instead raise them.
Mr. Mullins said he was already making use of the volatility index. He has watched yields on long-term Treasury bonds rise from 7.98 percent in late February to about 8.4 percent, even as the Fed has eased. Should the Fed conclude that investors are becoming more fearful of inflation?
 
Less Uncertainty Is Seen
 Not according to recent readings of the implied volatility measure, just 8.1 on July 3, about half the rates recorded during the Persian Gulf war. "We don't see a lot of uncertainty out there," Mr. Mullins said. "Maybe investors really aren't that worried about inflation. They may simply be forecasting higher rates because worldwide saving hasn't risen enough to take care of new investment demands."
Economists say the volatility measure, like most other indicators, must be viewed in the context of other statistics. While a steep yield curve -- with long-term rates much higher than shorter rates -- suggests inflation fears, other statistics point the other way. The dollar has been appreciating and commodity prices have remained weak.
Last August, after Iraq invaded Kuwait, implied volatility surged and stayed high for weeks. "The fact that volatility went up and the dollar went down made me think that markets were more concerned about inflation then than now," Mr. Mullins said.
An internal memorandum from the New York Fed said that loosening monetary policy then "might have confirmed pessimistic views of inflation." Despite strong pressure from the White House, the Fed, for a variety of reasons, refused to ease even as the economy slowed.
 
Intellectual Tradition
 Mr. Mullin's interest in implied volatility continues a tradition by which Fed governors establish their intellectual credentials and leave their marks. Manuel Johnson, the last vice chairman, promoted the exchange rate of the dollar as a crucial indicator.
In the Fed's university seminar atmosphere, governors pride themselves especially on contributions that reflect their unique knowledge and experience. Wayne Angell, one of the governors, has brought more attention to commodity prices, implying that his experience as a Kansas farmer and banker is as pertinent to policy-making as a bushel of Ivy League degrees.
Mr. Mullins brings a background in markets and finance. One of Professor Scholes's star students, Mr. Mullins taught options theory at the Harvard Business School and was the associate director of the Brady commission on stock market reform.
But Mr. Mullin's indicator might have some homespun uses far from the Fed's marble halls. Mr. Feinstein, the Boston University economist, is trying to decide whether to protect against higher interest rates with a 30-year fixed mortgage, or go for an adjustable rate. He is scanning the financial pages to see how options on 30-year Treasury bonds are behaving. "I can't predict interest rates." he said, "but I can look at implied volatility to see whether the market expects a lot of fluctuations."

Expected future volatility of Treasury bonds implied by the weekly options price. A reading of 8, for example, suggests that investors in a $100 bond expect its price to vary between $92 and $108 over the next year. (Source: Chicago Board of Trade)

HEADLINE: California Tax Plan Loses, Returning State to Turmoil

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., July 4

 BODY:
California was thrown back into fiscal turmoil today after the Legislature failed to approve more taxes to balance the state budget in a chaotic session that ended minutes before a Wednesday midnight deadline.
But unlike Connecticut and Maine, California faces no immediate shutdown of services. A spokesman for Gov. Pete Wilson said the state had enough cash reserves to carry it until about July 15, the next payday for state employees. 
The breakdown in negotiations was a political setback for Governor Wilson, a moderate Republican who has repeatedly set deadlines in the lengthy budget battle and then backed off.
The Governor had threatened to veto the $56.4 billion budget passed on June 20 by Wednesday midnight unless the Legislature passed a measure sought by business interests to cut workers' compensation claims for psychological stress. He characterized this as a "modest" change that was the price for his agreeing to increase income tax rates for the wealthy.
But he was unable to get his fellow Republicans in the State Assembly, the lower house of the Legislature, to accept the tax increase. Nor was he able to get the Democrats to agree to changes in workers' compensation.
By beating a tactical retreat Mr. Wilson bought more time. He used a parliamentary device in which he returned the budget bill to the Legislature, which then sent it back to him intact today, starting the clock again for 12 days.
The failure was foreordained on Wednesday evening when, with the temperature outside at 112 degrees, the Assembly Speaker, Willie L. Brown Jr. of San Francisco, left the baking Capitol to see the new Arnold Schwarzenegger movie "Terminator 2."
While he was waiting in the ticket line, Mr. Brown was paged by the Governor to return for a leadership meeting, a meeting that produced no miracles.
The budget crisis underscored the dramatic reversal of economic fortunes in the nation's most populous state. As recently as 1988 California had a $1 billion surplus and returned $75 to every taxpayer. But the recession and troubles in the aerospace industry have deflated the state's economy.
 
A $14.3 Billion Gap
 For the fiscal year that began Monday, the state government faced a $14.3 billion gap between spending and expected revenue, the largest such shortage ever faced by any state in the Union.
On Wednesday the State Controller, Gray Davis, reported that tax revenue for the just-completed fiscal year dropped by $462 million from last year -- the first decline resulting from economic conditions since the Depression.
In recent weeks the Legislature has closed most of the $14.3 billion gap mainly by raising and broadening the sales tax, increasing fees for vehicle registration and other services, and by cutting welfare grants. Four days ago the Governor signed the tax increases, amounting to more than $5 billion, the largest in California history.
But the budget, which state law requires to be balanced, still remains more than $2 billion short. On Wednesday afternoon a new tax package was offered by the State Senate Republican leader, Kenneth L. Maddy of Fresno.
Among other things, the plan would have raised the personal income tax to 10.3 percent from 9 percent for taxpayers making more than $200,000 a year or $400,000 for married couples filing jointly. It also would have reduced the tax credit for renters, imposed a 2 percent tax on telecommunication services and raised various business levies.
"This is a budget balancer," Mr. Maddy said. "It is the best we can do."
The Senate passed the package at about 10 P.M. amid a chorus of complaints against the more contentious Assembly and against Mr. Wilson for being unable to get his fellow Republicans in the Assembly to cooperate. Both houses are controlled by the Democrats, but a two-thirds majority is required for budget matters, meaning that the votes of at least 9 of the 31 Republicans in the Assembly are needed.
"I guess the Governor cannot get the votes just by enforcing party discipline," said State Senator David A. Roberti of Los Angeles, the President pro tem. Mr. Roberti also complained that he had delivered the earlier tax increases and painful welfare cuts that the Governor had sought, and said he resented Mr. Wilson's raising the workers' compensation matter at the last minute.
Across the hall in the Assembly, all hope was lost. The workers' compensation bill was stuck in the Insurance Committee, and voting on the taxes, which began only 15 minutes before midnight, produced nowhere near the two-thirds margin.
"If this budget blows up it will not be because the Democrats did not do the job," said Mr. Brown. At 11:57 P.M. he announced that Mr. Wilson had agreed to his suggestion to return the budget bill. "We did not go off the deep end," the Assembly Speaker said.
Eight minutes later the drawn-looking Governor met with reporters and said the action "allows the opportunity for negotiations to compromise."
Despite the night's failure, he added, much progress had been achieved. "We have come a long way on this budget," he said. "There is more reform than I have ever seen in the state of California."
 
Excessive Claims Blamed
 He strongly defended the workers' compensation revisions, saying excessive claims for psychological stress had driven up the cost of doing business in California and were driving companies out of state.
In essense, the proposed revisions would prohibit payment for psychiatric injury on the job unless the employee could demonstrate that at least 50 percent of the injury was job-related, instead of the current 10 percent. They would also bar compensation for demotions, layoffs or transfers made in the normal course of business.
Businesses complain of thousands of unfounded stress claims, but unions and lawyers' groups contend that workers with legitimate claims may be excluded by the stricter standards.
Governor Wilson defended his tying the workers' compensation issue to the budget, saying it was the only way to get leverage over a Legislature "as corrupted as it has been by applicants' attorneys."
The Legislature is scheduled to resume its budget deliberations Monday.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
U.S. Will Press Plan for Growth In London Talks

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
IN an interview on Wednesday, the Treasury Secretary, Nicholas F. Brady, said that at the London economic summit conference of the seven major industrial countries later this month, the United States would press for a "three-pronged strategy" to lift the world economy out of stagnation and help rescue the economies of the fledgling democracies of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
At the end of the meeting of the rich industrial countries, Mikhail S. Gorbachev will arrive for talks on reconstruction, trade and aid, first with President Bush and then with the other Western leaders. 
 These are three elements in the United States strategy for the meeting that Mr. Brady described:
* A more dynamic monetary policy aimed at bringing down real interest rates -- what money really costs borrowers after allowing for inflation -- to stimulate economic growth and yield more employment, income and a higher rate of capital formation for a world desperately short of capital.
* An international trade policy focused on the successful completion of the current round of negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The talks are aimed at opening markets in all countries and breaking down regional barriers to the flow of goods, including agricultural products and textiles, as well as services and intellectual property.
* The elimination of structural rigidities hampering job creation and productivity growth within countries, whether capitalist, socialist or still struggling in the transition from Communism to a market economy.
In describing his overall strategy, Mr. Brady said, "When I first raised it last April, I was cast as a Johnny one-note." The "one note" heard by his critics in the United States and abroad was his call for lower interest rates. Foreign governments and publications said the United States had shown itself to be, as The Economist put it, "incapable of wise leaderhip." Many blamed Mr. Brady for trying to force monetary expansion at the risk of reigniting inflation.
Now Mr. Brady is seeking to put his quest for lower interest rates in a broader context and to reply to the charge that he is soft on inflation. "The economists always insist that we must have non-inflationary growth," he said, while he prefers to talk in terms of low-inflationary growth.
Mr. Brady is doubtful, as was the late Prof. Sumner Slichter of Harvard in the early post-World War II period, that zero inflation and vigorous growth are compatible. Like Professor Slichter's position, Mr. Brady's is regarded by many conservatives as not just heretical but, far worse, undeliverable and unstable. The acceptance of even low inflation is likely to lead to a much higher rate of inflation, the critics say.
In the 1950's and early 1960's, however, low inflation -- by Professor Slichter's definition, 2 percent a year -- did prove consistent with strong economic growth in the United States. In the 15 years from 1950 through 1964, real economic growth in the United States averaged 4 percent a year. With the escalation of the Vietnam War in the mid-1960's and the failure of the Johnson Administration to cut domestic spending or raise taxes to pay for the war and the Great Society, the compatibility of low inflation with high growth was shattered.
Mr. Brady believes that the world's economic leaders need greater confidence and should concentrate on positive goals, like growth and open world trade, rather than being hamstrung by negatives like fear of inflation and unemployment.
He did not try to defend all the policies that had produced economic growth and financial boom in the 1980's. On the contrary, he was highly critical of the wave of leveraged buyouts of corporations in the United States and excessive debt creation.
"The banking system is less strong," he said. "Are certain banks in trouble? Of course. Bigger banks? Yes!" But the mistakes of the 1980's, he said, should not deter us from moving ahead, "so that we're creating jobs, increasing investment."
Affirming that "a strategy of hope is important," Mr. Brady drew a comparison with what he is proposing for the world economy and with the policy taken vis-a-vis Mexico, which, he said, is moving ahead economically "by marrying the Brady Plan for reducing Mexico's foreign debt with President Salinas's progress in opening up markets."
He said that in convincing Mexicans, including expatriates as well as foreigners, that Mexico meant business and that debt reduction would work, what critics regarded as the missing element in the formulation of the plan -- money -- was flowing into the country. Mr. Brady said the inflow to Mexico of expatriate capital would rise this year to $14 billion from $4 billion last year.
Mr. Brady said he believed other governments were "getting the message" that he has been trying to deliver for a comprehensive growth-oriented strategy, including reductions in interest rates. He called attention to the Bank of Japan's half-point cut in its discount rate, its benchmark rate of interest, to 5.5 percent on Monday. Japan had been holding interest rates high to wring inflation out of the economy.
Mr. Brady said he also saw evidence that Britain, Italy, Spain and Denmark were moving to lower-rate policies. He was more equivocal about Germany, where Karl-Otto Pohl has resigned as head of the Bundesbank to be replaced by another monetary hard-liner, Helmut Schlesinger. Timothy Deal, a member of the National Security Council who is helping to prepare the United States position for the London summit meeting, said he thought the Germans were still adamant about their rate policies.
Mr. Brady's line on the urgency of growth appears to be gaining international support. This week, the United Nations World Economic Survey for 1991 predicted that global economic growth this year would be zero and would rise in 1992 to only 2 percent -- barely enough to keep pace with population growth. And the U.N. declared: "In various industrialized countries, the monetary authorities feel that output growth over 2 or 3 percent a year would be inflationary and must be restrained. As long as this view prevails, these nations cannot serve their historic role as an engine of world economic growth."
The survey concluded that the present mix of monetary and fiscal policy seems to express political priorities in which unemployment is an acceptable price for containing inflation, "and high real interest rates are welcomed even at the expense of growth, at least in the short term." If such policies continue, the report said, "the more dynamic international economic environment needed for a shorter adjustment in the developing countries and a less costly transition in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union will not materialize."
This will be not only the United Nations' but the United States' line at the summit meeting in London. Mr. Brady said that as he saw it, a strategy for regenerating growth is the most important item on the summit's agenda.

HEADLINE: Flea Markets Pit School Against Merchants

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BERGENFIELD, N.J., July 4

 BODY:
The fund-raising flea markets at the high school -- source of scholarships, gifts for schools and students, and angst -- have embroiled just about everyone in town in a nasty fight.
Local merchants are mad at the Board of Education for opening the high school to out-of-town vendors and bargain-basement prices that, they complain, undercut their stores. The parents and teachers who sponsor the flea markets and return their earnings to the school system are angry at the merchants and are threatening to boycott their stores on South Washington Avenue. 
 And the five-member school board is caught in the cross-fire.
"This town is being ripped apart," the school board president, Michael Mullarkey, said after the board listened to an hour of appeals on Monday night about how many flea markets was the right number. "We're not saying anybody's right and anybody's wrong. We're just trying to ameliorate a real bad problem and make it a harmonious town again."
Flea markets have become more commonplace in the suburbs of the New York region in recent years, with wholesalers, suppliers and manufacturers' representatives, offering, at deep discount, the same clothing, cosmetics, jewelry, records, sporting equipment and other goods available in local stores and highway malls.
Most create little commotion. But Bergenfield's, which began in 1978, has become fractious, primarily because of its size.
The parents' club at the high school sponsors a two-day flea market on the weekend after Thanksgiving and the teachers' union another two-day affair just before Christmas. They're are the year's biggest, each drawing about 10,000 shoppers -- and the biggest complaints from merchants who say they cut into their peak sales season. Each class at the high school has its own market between January and April and the parents' club has another in May., near Mother's Day.
Net earnings from the seven average about $51,000, with the two holiday markets alone generating about $37,000, said Rich Catoggio, chairman of a coalition of parents and teachers now fighting to keep all seven. Earnings come from the $25 rental of sales tables to the vendors, sale of hot dogs, hamburgers and soda, and a 50-50 raffle, Mr. Catoggio said.
"That money gets dispersed through every kid in the high school," Mr. Catoggio said.
The parents' club annually spends $6,000 on scholarships and $10,000 buying items from a "wish list" submitted by teachers and administrators, he said. Over the years, he said, they have included a $10,000 refreshment stand at the football field, a $3,000 scoreboard in the gym, a $6,000 laser printer for the high school paper, Bear Facts, a $2,500 copying machine for the library, and assorted maps, microscopes and computers.
The teachers' union spends all its earnings each year on scholarships, said Charles Bruen, a union vice president. This year it awarded three four-year scholarships of $750 totaling $9,000. and set aside $3,000 for next year.
Each class's money goes for gifts for the school and class members and to help defray costs of prom tickets and yearbooks, Mr. Bruen said.
The merchants begrudge the students none of this money.
They are angry, they say, because the flea markets hurt their businesses and provide vendors a gold mine in exchange for the $25 rental of a sales table.
"What the students get is a pittance in terms of what the vendors make," said Matthew Connell, owner of Betty Lee Drugs on South Washington. He estimated vendors' earnings at about $1.5 million and $2 million a year since the markets started 13 years ago.
"That money spent at the flea markets wasn't spent in Bergenfield; it wasn't spent in Teaneck, it wasn't spent in New Milford, and it wasn't spent in any of the surrounding towns," Mr. Connell said. "And we don't know if they pay the state any sales tax."
Mr. Catoggio, head of the parents-teachers group, said all vendors must sign a contract agreeing to pay state sales tax. He also disputed Mr. Connell's earnings estimate of $1 million, telling the school board on Monday he believed the vendors made about from $4500,000 to $500,000 a year.
 
'Compete on an Equal Level'
 "The merchants have yet to prove the flea markets take $1 from them," Mr. Catoggio said.
The merchants counter that their customer flows shrink on flea-market weekends. And, they argue, the flea markets, on top of the recession, have doomed three stores in recent months -- Brass Roots, a gift shop; The Baby Carriage, and Victor's Men's Shop.
They The merchants also complain that competition from the flea markets is unfair and inequitable because they pay property taxes, rent and utilities.
"If someone is going to compete with me, compete on an equal level," said Harold Kriegsman, owner of a home accessories store. "I pay $7,000 in real-estate taxes and if I go out of business, the people in town have to make up that difference. Multiply that situation by the 100 merchants in town and you have a ghost town. When the business part of a town goes down, the whole town goes down."
The merchants, through the Chamber of Commerce, have been fighting the flea markets since 1987 -- before the Town Council, before the Board of Adjustment and in the courts.
The issue has twisted and turned back to the school board, which has been debating whether to drop the November and December flea markets, leaving the other five. The meeting on Monday ended with a 2-to-2 tie in favor of the five-market agreement with one member abstaining. On Monday, the board then agreed to bring the merchants and parents together for talks seeking a solution.
Mr. Catoggio, in the meantime, is threatening a residents' boycott of stores unless his side prevails.
Not all merchants are intimidated.
"This boycotting works both ways," said Russ Dermond, owner of the local hardware store. "If all the merchants stopped donating to civic groups and stopped giving to the Little League and the PAL and the Boy Scouts, a lot of people would be hurt."

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Cuomo's Tax Shift Reflects Fiscal Squeeze

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 4

 BODY:
As a leader whose power flows from his mastery of words, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo is often careful to leave himself plenty of linguistic wiggle room.
Rather than making a Shermanesque statement of disinterest in the Presidency, for instance, Mr. Cuomo prefers to say that he has "no plans and no plans to make plans" to run. The implicit suggestion, of course, is that plans can change. 
 That is why it was so striking that Mr. Cuomo, from the beginning of this year's legislative session, sounded so categorical in ruling out an increase this year in the personal income tax. The State Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, seemed equally firm.
"We will not consider any P.I.T.," Mr. Cuomo said at an April 5 news conference. "Not a smidgen, not a big one, not a little one, not a medium-sized one, not a last-minute deal."
On Wednesday, as part of a last-minute deal, the Governor and the state's legislative leaders signed off on a smidgen of an income-tax increase to raise $100 million and put the state budget to rest. That Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Marino were willing to break their pledges testified to the severity of New York's fiscal crisis and to the potential for an endless summer of destructive politics.
 
'We've Put Together the Pieces'
 The resolution demonstrated the truism that political jockeying in Albany inevitably expands to fill available time, no matter how dire the consequences.
And that a $100 million tax plan ultimately would close the $52 billion budget -- but not until three months after the start of the fiscal year -- also showed how intractable positions had become.
"This year, like in a labor negotiation, compromise didn't work," Assembly Speaker Mel Miller said today at a 3:30 A.M. news conference shortly after his house had recessed. "We had to go on strike."
Now, he said, "we've put together the pieces and we've learned to compromise again -- we look a lot worse when we don't compromise."
Neither Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, nor Mr. Marino, a Republican, was happy about dining on a meal of their own oratory. But faced with the continuation of a fiscal firefight that was scorching all parties, they decided to negotiate a deal with Mr. Miller, who had been calling for a much larger income-tax increase.
The Assembly Speaker believed that a significant income-tax increase was a more progressive way to solve the state's fiscal problems than the deep cuts in state programs and local aid proposed by Mr. Cuomo.
Mr. Miller and his Democratic colleagues in the Assembly could affect a modicum of smugness on Wednesday night as the final budget bills were being passed. But they conceded that the tax increase was too little and far too late to be declared much of a victory.
 
Containing the Damage
 The agreement succeeded in containing the political damage, but everyone involved in this year's budget process is likely to be tainted by its touch. More than one lobbyist mused that the Legislature had stretched its business into the wee hours of Independence Day so that lawmakers would not have to return home to face constituents at picnics and parades.
The income-tax deal was born of political desperation. With the clock ticking toward the close of the legislative session -- it ended when the Senate recessed at 6:34 A.M. -- the leaders concluded that backtracking on a pledge was preferable to prolonged chaos.
If an agreement was not reached before the end of the session, the legislative leaders said they were prepared to restore most of the spending that Mr. Cuomo had vetoed from the budget passed by the Legislature last month. The Governor, who maintained that the Legislature's budget was out of balance by $900 million, said he would use the veto again.
"You just got to the point where everybody had exhausted alternatives and we were down to a grim choice between the devastating prospect of another round of vetoes, which were inevitable, and a constitutional struggle, which was going to come, or a compromise," Mr. Cuomo said. "And a compromise was better."
Pressure was also building from business leaders who wanted the abolition of energy taxes in the Legislature's budget as well as from New York City and other municipal governments that needed to know how much state aid to expect.
The Business Council of New York State had been lobbying for a month to kill the new taxes paid by producers and importers of petroleum and natural gas.
On June 25, the council published a report estimating that the taxes would cost New York 32,000 jobs by 1994. Late last week, it called formally for the Legislature to swap the energy taxes for an income-tax increase on the wealthy.
Mr. Cuomo said today that the Business Council's position helped persuade the Republican-majority Senate to accept an income-tax increase in exchange for elimination of the natural gas tax and restrictions on the petroleum tax.
But it also helped undermine the Governor's stance that an income-tax increase would hinder the state's economic competitiveness in attracting and keeping businesses.
The Governor said today that he continued to believe that income-tax increases were damaging to the state economy. But he said this year's increase was not large enough to hurt the state's competitiveness. "Everything is degrees," he said.
The increase would apply higher tax rates to the first $26,000 of income earned by the 225,000 New York taxpayers -- both single and joint filers -- with incomes above $100,000 a year.
Taxpayers who earn $150,000 or more would pay an additional $720 in state income taxes.
Mr. Cuomo stressed today that the focus of his pledge against raising income taxes had been to maintain existing tax rates and to avoid surcharges.
"This is not a rate increase or a surcharge," he said. "But those are words. The fact is you pay more in personal income."

HEADLINE: Stock Prices Gain in London; Dollar and Gold Advance

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks rose in London and were mixed in Frankfurt yesterday, while the dollar advanced against most major currencies. Gold prices were also higher.
Trading on some overseas markets was light and uneventful. American exchanges were closed for the Independence Day holiday. 
 Prices fell on the Tokyo Stock Exchange yesterday as investors continued to worry that Japan's stock market scandals would widen.
In Toyko, the 225-issue Nikkei stock average fell 237.86 points, or 1.02 percent, closing at 23,135.61. The index has fallen 973.15 points in three trading days since rising 817.80 points on Monday.
"The environment surrounding the stock market still remains very gloomy," said Isao Okada, head of the stock department of the Taiheiyo Securities Company.
 
Discouraged by Scandal
 Investors have been discouraged by a scandal in which major brokerages are said to have compensated large clients for investment losses and arranged loans for a company linked to gangsters. Hitachi Ltd. acknowledged yesterday that it had been compensated by Nomura Securities for losses in its account.
On the Tokyo exchange today, stock prices opened higher, but closed with a loss. The Nikkei index fell 237.27 points, to 22,898.34, a decline of 1.03 percent.
Prices advanced on the London Stock Exchange amid speculation there would be a cut in British interest rates next week. Dealers said trading was quiet because of the holiday in the United States.
The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index rose 22 points, to close at 2,470.2. Volume was 352.8 million shares, well below Wednesday's total of 459 million.
In Frankfurt, stocks ended the day mixed in lackluster trading. The DAX index of 30 blue-chip stocks inched higher, to close at 1,616.11, up from Wednesday's finish of 1,614.41.
The dollar was mostly higher on foreign exchange markets. In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 139.40 yen, up 0.08 yen from Wednesday's close but below its overnight New York finish of 139.58 yen.
Nobuyoshi Okada, a dealer with the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, said many market participants refrained from big moves with the New York market closed.
In London, the pound fell to $1.6030 from $1.6052 late Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday's prices, included 1.8343 German marks, up from 1.8315; 1.5825 Swiss francs, unchanged; 6.2210 French francs, up from 6.2090; 2.0655 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0623; 1,365.25 Italian lire, up from 1,362.25; and 1.1423 Canadian dollars, unchanged.
Gold rose in London to a late bid of $369.25 an ounce, from $369 on Wednesday. In Zurich, gold closed at a bid of $369.25, up from $369. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.19, to close at a bid of $369.40.

An Exhibition About Art Exhibitions

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
To see the latest theories of art history squeezed and prodded into exhibition format, there's no place in Manhattan quite like the Whitney Museum's downtown branch at Federal Reserve Plaza. Several times a year, a group of graduate students from the museum's independent study program are given the run of this sleek exhibition space, whose gleaming metal accouterments can bring to mind scenes from Charlie Chaplin's "Modern Times." These students are well-read, conscientious and almost terminally up to date, and they tend to orchestrate shows that stand out in one way or another, even if they're not completely outstanding in the visual sense.
This summer's offering, "Constructing American Identity," organized by Elizabeth Bingham, Eric Miles, Andrew Perchuk and Ellen Tepfer, is no exception. The exhibition, which includes more than 60 paintings dating from the late 1920's to the late 60's, is a show that nourishes the mind while frequently starving the eye. It outlines an ambitious subject but often treats it too skimpily. It also commits some glaring curatorial errors, the most prominent of which is too much required reading. A nearly one-to-one ratio of text panels to actual artworks is not a good idea. 
 "Constructing American Identity" is an exhibition about art exhibitions, specifically about how they mirror society as well as its art. It sets out to examine the ways three prominent exhibitions of contemporary art, each from a different decade, reflected America's changing sense of national identity and the role of its culture in the formation of that identity.
The shows under scrutiny are "American Art Today," held at the 1939-40 New York World's Fair; "The New American Painting," a 1958-59 traveling exhibition of Abstract Expressionist painting organized by the International Council of the Museum of Modern Art, and a selection of new artworks, mostly Pop, that was displayed on the exterior of the New York State Pavilion of the 1964-65 New York World's Fair. One of the current exhibition's goals is to demonstrate that both national identity and the idea of a national art are not consistent or linear in development; rather they are fluid, changing as the times -- and the sponsoring institutions -- require.
On a purely visual level, the separate sections devoted to the three shows contrast vividly with one another, each reflecting a distinct period look and national mood. (That the sections are also divided by walls of red, white and blue is heavy-handed.) From the isolationist, Depression-torn 1930's that was encapsulated in "American Art Today," which was organized by the Federal Art Project of the W.P.A., comes the idealistic Regionalism of Grant Wood and John Steuart Curry, with their back-to-the-earth images of Midwestern farmers. This section also includes the less than utopian Social Realism of Phillip Evergood and William Gropper, who focus on urban workers and the unemployed, and the Cubist-inspired abstraction of Stuart Davis, Byron Browne and Ad Reinhardt, who strove for a universal abstract language.
The show's second section focuses on the expansionist postwar 1950's, when artists were less politically involved than in earlier decades, and when personal isolation and existential doubt fueled large-scale, gestural abstractions. Here there are works by Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline and other artists represented in "The New American Painting," which toured under the auspices of the United States Information Agency and introduced Abstract Expressionism, the first American art style of international stature, to Europe. Finally, from the tumultuous 1960's, a time when both American life and art took a turn for the materialistic, are Pop Art works by Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg and Robert Indiana, as well as a crushed-metal sculpture by John Chamberlain and a serene abstraction by Ellsworth Kelly.
This exhibition often looks like another excuse to trot out a succession of well-known American art chestnuts. In fact, until you start reading the myriad wall texts, the visual evidence seems to confirm the impression of "inexorable linear progression" and the ultimate "triumph of American art" that the exhibition's organizers hope to dispel. For better and for worse, it is the words and the accompanying documentation that make the issues of the show come alive. In each section, various art reviews and news accounts, as well as polemical quotations from artists, critics and occasionally disgruntled Congressmen, provide glimpses of the ways these shows were presented and received, and of the debates they stirred up.
Beyond its extremely didactic slant, one of the exhibition's biggest problems is that its organizers simply could not borrow the artworks necessary to do their ideas justice. The resulting skimpiness tends to reduce art to the level of visual aid, or stand-in for more important artworks by more important artists. The meager selection of six examples of Abstract Expressionism does not include anything by Jackson Pollock, whose work was most representative of the new American painting. The Pop Art section is pumped up with portfolios of prints by Warhol, Mr. Oldenburg and Mr. Rauschenberg, which are arranged in clusters so repetitious that the quotations, weighing the relative merits of Pop Art, become the primary points of interest.
Like many other exhibitions today, this one might make a better book. Its lack of visual life reminds one that the curator's art -- that mysterious ability to to arrange art objects in space so that they speak to one another and to the viewer in their own language -- is fragile and highly susceptible to the winds of fashion.
 "Constructing American Identity" remains at the Whitney Museum of American Art Downtown at Federal Reserve Plaza, 33 Maiden Lane, at Nassau Street, through Aug. 30.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
The Truth Is Self-Evident: The Yankees Are Doing Dandy

BYLINE: By FILIP BONDY

 BODY:
The Kelly on second base stole third. The Kelly at bat poked a grounder through the drawn-in infield to win another game.
So elemental, these Yankee victories. There is an economy of motion, of deeds, of words. 
 "I got a really good jump," said Pat Kelly, the base-stealer, who scored the tie-breaking run in the eighth inning of the Yankees' 3-2 victory yesterday over Baltimore.
"I was just trying to put the ball in play somewhere," said Roberto Kelly, the batter, whose single up the middle scored Pat.
 
One Game From .500
 The Kellys completed their assigned tasks. The rookie starting pitcher, Jeff Johnson, got the Yankees into the eighth, tied 2-2, with 89 thoughtful pitches. The bullpen closed out the Orioles.
The i's were dotted. The t's were crossed. The Yankees won their sixth straight game, their ninth in the last 10. They moved to within one game of that elusive .500 mark, and six and one-half games of the first-place Toronto Blue Jays. With the All-Star break and a pennant race both clearly in sight, life is good off the Major Deegan rampway.
"You don't know who's gonna do the job around here, but you know someone's gonna do it," Manager Stump Merrill said. "It's nice to see."
The Yankees fell behind again yesterday, 1-0, then managed to blow a 2-1 lead on a homer by Baltimore catcher Chris Hoiles to lead off the seventh. All game long, the Yanks had put up with the unorthodox slow curves and floaters of Orioles starter Roy Smith. Pat Kelly finally chased Smith with a double to left-center to lead off the eighth, only to bring on an even odder reliever -- submariner Todd Frohwirth.
Merrill gave Pat Kelly the green light to steal, and the rookie measured Frohwirth's weird delivery for several pitches. Meanwhile, Steve Sax, who had homered off Smith in the sixth, tried to bunt against Frohwirth but popped out to third. That brought up Roberto Kelly. On the first pitch, Pat Kelly took off for third. The pitch bounced out of Hoiles's mitt. The runner would have been safe, anyway.
 
Don't Annoy The Fans
"With a sidearmer like that, you can get a pretty good jump," Pat Kelly said. "I had to get the best jump of the season. You get caught in that situation, the Yankee fans come out and get you."
There was no summary execution necessary at third base. Now, facing a 2-1 count and the realigned defense, Roberto Kelly put wood on ball, which was all he was trying to do. "I was trying to make contact, maybe hit the ball in the outfield," he said. "I got jammed a little bit."
One Kelly ended up at first with a run batted in. Another scored. Lee Guetterman went in for Eric Plunk in the ninth to nail down his fifth save, to hand the Orioles their third straight defeat.
Plunk (1-2) got the victory, but Johnson's performance was equally encouraging. The 24-year-old left-hander had his sinker ball working until late in the game. He has just one victory in six outings since joining the Yankees on June 5, but has deserved better. He said yesterday he can wait.
"Every time I face a hitter up here, it's a new experience," Johnson said. "I've got to figure out what I got that they can't hit."

 
 
INSIDE PITCH

 DON MATTINGLY'S 16-game hitting streak ended as the first baseman flied out to center three times and struck out in the eighth. "We won, and there's a good feeling in the clubhouse," Mattingly said. "That's all I care about." . . . It can happen to anyone, at any time: Old pro ROBERT MERRILL finally blew the national anthem, on the Fourth of July, no less. One stanza of the always-tricky, never-melodious "Star Spangled Banner" came out, "O'er the ramparts we hailed . . ." . . . STEVE SAX , who homered leading off the Yankee first in the 3-2 victory over Cleveland on Wednesday night, last homered in consecutive games in 1986, playing for the Los Angeles Dodgers against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field. The Yankees have homered five times to lead off innings in their last three games.

HEADLINE: South African Sanctions: Go Slow

 BODY:
The anti-apartheid sanctions imposed by Congress in 1986 have fostered change in South Africa. What made them credible was Washington's ability to speak with a bipartisan voice. Yet a big foreign policy success is now threatened by domestic politics as President Bush and the Democratic Congress square off for a needless row on when to lift the sanctions.
Mr. Bush impatiently hints that Pretoria has fulfilled all but one of five conditions for ending sanctions, which is debatable. Prodded by a black caucus deeply suspicious of White House racial politics, Democratic leaders claim that South Africa has barely met a single condition, which is more debatable. 
 That change has occurred in South Africa is not in dispute; whether reforms meet U.S. legislative tests is open to argument. If Mr. Bush hastily lifts sanctions, with Congress in recess, the U.S. will lose credibility and leverage at a critical moment in South Africa. If Democrats resist acknowledging compliance, it will be just as damaging.
The responsible solution is to review the law -- and fairly stipulate which conditions must still be satisfied.
Releasing all political prisoners. Though Nelson Mandela and many other prisoners have been released, hundreds remain in jail. Pretoria asserts that it will release all genuine political prisoners, and that none are now being detained without trial; this surely can be independently verified.
Ending the state of emergency. The emergency laws have been repealed, and Pretoria's critics concede minimal compliance.
Unbanning political parties. Change has been substantial but incomplete. Previously illegal parties now operate freely, and debate is unfettered. But some leaders are still in exile, and negotiations for their return are still under way. It would be stretching the language of the law, however, to insist -- as some Democrats do -- that blacks must be enfranchised before sanctions are lifted.
Repealing apartheid laws. With the repeal of the Population Registration Act and the Group Areas Act, the main legal pillars of apartheid have fallen. Critics assert that 59 other laws are still on the books, and that repeal has left untouched the evils of segregation. But these charges are in factual dispute, and an item-by-item reckoning is needed.
Opening a negotiation track. The law stipulates that Pretoria must "agree to enter good faith negotiations with truly representative members of the black majority without preconditions." By any fair reading, this condition has been met.
For Mr. Bush to lift sanctions before reasonable doubts are resolved would be as indefensible as stretching the law's language to prolong sanctions. America's good faith and South Africa's struggle for a new democratic order would both suffer if this debate soured into a partisan brawl.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Adrift

 BODY:
Connecticut has no budget for the fiscal year that began Monday -- and, alas, no leadership. Gov. Lowell Weicker and the Legislature's Democrats and Republicans are in a three-way standoff, mainly over adopting an income tax. It is time to end the brinksmanship.
The Legislature, under Democratic control, has passed two no-income-tax budgets in recent days. Mr. Weicker, an independent, wants an income tax and vetoed both. The House then passed a budget with an income tax, but Senate supporters couldn't muster a majority. The key holdout is the Democratic leader, Senator John Larson, who aspires to be governor himself someday. 
 The need for an income tax is clear. Connecticut depends unwisely on an 8 percent state sales tax, the highest in the nation. Sales taxes unfairly tax the poor proportionately more than the rich. And the yield is undependable, fluctuating erratically with economic ups and downs. But for Republicans and some Democrats, opposing an income tax is an article of faith, no matter that faith in the sales tax undermines their state's future.
Connecticut also needs to brake its spending binge. Spending soared in the 1980's when the Northeast was flush with prosperity and rising revenues. It couldn't last, and now comes the torture of sharp cutbacks. If good sense prevails, the state will follow the Republicans' lead on reining in future increases. But Democrats are maneuvering for loopholes to make any ceiling less binding.
Meanwhile, Governor Weicker, true to his reputation for bluff and bluster, has shut most government offices -- a move more symbolic than sensible. While saving little or no money, he sows confusion and much resentment.
In Connecticut this weekend, politics reigns while policy suffers.

HEADLINE: Don't Forget Inflation in Corporate Tax Figures

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Business Helps Schools" (letter, June 6), Richard W. Rahn of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce would have us believe: "Corporate taxes have increased dramatically in the last decade. Total corporate taxes have increased 60 percent while profits rose 19 percent." Mr. Rahn seems to be misusing statistics. 
 Mr. Rahn probably used the same figures I took from the 1990 Statistical Abstract of the United States in computing the rise in taxes and profit, but he forgot to correct for inflation. Between 1980 and 1990, the increase in corporate taxes (from $84.8 billion to $132.1 billion) was about 56 percent in current dollars. But the increase in the Consumer Price Index (from 86.3 to 133.8) over this period was about the same: 55 percent. Thus, there was no dramatic real increase in corporate taxes.
In fact, total corporate taxes rose only .05 percentage points a year more than inflation during that decade. Since the inflation-adjusted per year gross national product increased by about 3 percent a year during that period, the data indicate that corporate taxes have proportionally decreased. According to the Statistical Abstract, the increase in corporate profits for the decade was 103 percent, more than 7 percent a year, which exceeded the rate of inflation by about 3 percent, and so did the G.N.P.

HEADLINE: No Progress On Tax Plan In Connecticut

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, July 4

 BODY:
After agreeing on how much Connecticut should spend in the fiscal year that is now four days old, Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. and legislative leaders met for more than seven hours today without settling on a tax plan to raise that money.
On a holiday when all but three of the state's parks and beaches were closed because there is no budget, Mr. Weicker and six Senate and House leaders did reach a consensus on one issue: what goods and services should be subject to the state's sales tax. But they did not disclose which goods and services those were. 
 Today's talks ended at 4:30 P.M. with continued division over what has brought the budget process to an impasse: whether to continue to rely on the work-horse sales tax or restructure the tax system by adopting Connecticut's first tax on wages.
The talks began on Wednesday, their goal a budget and tax plan that could be brought to legislators this weekend and so end the partial shutdown of the state government that the Governor began on Tuesday.
 
'Every Tax Known to Mankind'
 On Wednesday, when talks ended at 11 P.M., a gubernatorial spokesman said general agreement had been reached on the spending side, though he would not say how it differed from the most recent budget proposal of $7.8 billion. Income-tax opponents have said that the Legislature has not tried hard enough to cut the budget.
The only progress today, said the spokesman, Charles F. J. Morse, the Governor's speech writer, was general agreement on what to apply the sales tax to.
Mr. Morse said one legislative leader had described today's talks as including consideration of "every tax known to mankind."
After a week of day-and-night politics that produced one budget vetoed by Mr. Weicker and one killed by the Senate, the Capitol was deserted today, its doors locked and only a handful of cars in front.
The talks had begun at 9 A.M. in a conference room of the Supreme Court building across Capitol Avenue. But the only activity on the nearly empty streets was crews preparing for Hartford's Fourth of July Riverfest celebration.
In its stillness, the Capitol resembled a principal victim of Mr. Weicker's shutdown -- the state's parks, which normally are jammed with picnickers on this holiday.
Contributions from corporations allowed the state to keep open three beaches along Long Island Sound: Rocky Neck in East Lyme, Hammonasset in Madison and Sherwood Island in Westport. But through the rest of Connecticut, park gates were swung shut and beaches, campgrounds and picnic areas were silent.
Parks that were open were not jammed. The largest, Hammonasset, with parking for 7,000 cars, had a rush when it opened as families and groups staked out tables. But the beach parking lots were slow to fill, and none of the three parks reached capacity.
 
Oil From a 'Happy Taxpayer'
 Most of the closed parks, meanwhile, were empty under the bright July sun.
Wharton Brook in North Haven often reaches capacity by noon on the Fourth of July, and it is not uncommon for some picnickers to arrive as early as 5 or 6 A.M., said Hammonasset's supervisor, Mark Rickert.
Today its parking lots along Route 5 were empty and one of the few people in sight was a sunbather asleep on a chaise next to his car beside the gate. Cars pulled up every few minutes, only to drive off slowly as their occupants realized the park was closed.
One act of vandalism was reported, at Wadsworth Falls State Park in Middlefield. Wanda Rickerby, spokeswoman for the Department of Environmental Protection, said someone dumped used motor oil from a 55-gallon drum into Wadsworth Pond during the night. Scrawled in the sand nearby, she said, was a message that the oil was from "another happy taxpayer."
 
40 Percent of the Work Force Off
 Governor Weicker began shutting down state services judged nonessential on Tuesday, saying he had no choice under laws that require Connecticut to have a balanced budget. Seven thousand state workers were told to stay home that day, and on Wednesday the number grew to 20,000, or 40 percent of the work force.
The Governor, an independent, is without a budget in part because he has vetoed two, neither of which included an income tax. They relied instead on expanding existing taxes, especially the state's 8 percent sales tax.
Mr. Weicker has demanded a budget that was balanced without fiscal gimmicks and that would stimulate the state's stalled economy. With the recession, he says he does not see how that can be accomplished without imposing a tax on wages for the first time and cutting the other taxes.
Opposition to an income tax, however, has long been a political badge of honor in Connecticut, and a budget that included an income tax approved by Mr. Weicker was killed by a bipartisan vote in the Senate on Tuesday.
 
Separate Meetings
 That night Democratic leaders of the Senate appealed to Mr. Weicker to meet with them on taxes, and the next day three senators, three representatives and Mr. Weicker began reviewing budget plans together.
Mr. Morse said Republicans plan to meet in party caucuses with their members in the House and Senate on Friday afternoon to review the tax discussions before they are resumed at the Governor's Residence at 6 P.M.
This afternoon, Mr. Morse said, the Senate president, John B. Larson, suggested that Governor Weicker and his staff leave the conference room so that the legislative leaders could discuss issues among themselves.
Afterward the two Republicans, M. Adela Eads, the Senate minority leader, and Edward C. Krawiecki Jr., the House minority leader, caucused alone, as did the four Democrats: Mr. Larson; Cornelius P. O'Leary, the Senate majority leader; Richard J. Balducci, Speaker of the House, and Robert F. Frankel, the House majority leader.

HEADLINE: Waiting for Darkness Puts a Glow on Hawaii

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KAILUA-KONA, Hawaii, July 3

 BODY:
The last time Dr. Donald Hall chased a total eclipse of the Sun he was in a Concorde jet, flying under the shadow of the moon for an hour at 70,000 feet.
"It produced tantalizing but inconclusive results," said Dr. Hall, director of the Institute of Astronomy at the University of Hawaii. 
This time around the solar eclipse is coming to him. At 7:28 A.M. next Thursday the Moon will slide in front of the Sun and park itself for four minutes directly over Dr. Hall's open window on the universe: an observatory on the 13,796-foot summit of Mauna Kea.
 
A Clear View of Space
 It will be the first time since the observatories were built that a total blockout of the Sun will take place over the dormant volcano, a site so far removed from the visual clutter of the rest of the world that it presents astronomers with an unusally clear view of the heavens.
Nine experiments, most of them measuring the extended atmosphere of the Sun, will be done atop Mauna Kea, which has the largest and most powerful collection of telescopes in the world.
But scientists are hardly the only ones here thrilled at the prospect of seeing the day dawn twice. The saying that the Sun in the tropics does things to people seems doubly true when the Moon is in front of it: the frenzy surrounding the spectacle is already being called ecliptomania.
When the sky darkens and the birds quiet, up to 60,000 tourists will be here on this island, where the population is usually about 100,000, gazing at the Sun's halo through Mylar-covered glasses.
For the Hawaiian tourism industry, which had been somewhat staggered by the recession and by travel jitters over the war in the Persian Gulf, the eclipse could not come at a better time.
"This is the biggest thing ever to happen to this island," said Debbie Baker, head of the Eclipse Information Center here on the big island of Hawaii, the largest of the eight major islands that make up the state. "It's a made-to-order eclipse: we get it in the middle of the resort area, one week after the Fourth of July, in a soft tourism year."
A battle between the ancient countries of Lydia and Media in Asia Minor was halted by a total solar eclipse in 585 B.C., but merchants in Hawaii have not shown similar restraint.
 
Homes Rent for $4,000
 They are selling eclipse golf balls (half black, half white) as well as offering eclipse haircuts (the halo effect, bald on top, fringe on the outside), and people are renting their houses for up to $4,000 on the day of the big event.
Most of the 9,000 hotel rooms on this largely rural and remote volcanic island are sold out for July 11. The airlines have added extra flights here from Honolulu; from midnight to 7 A.M. on July 11, one plane every few minutes will disgorge a new load of tourists on the island of Hawaii.
For $340 on the day of the eclipse, a visitor can swim with dolphins and sit in on a session with a man billed as a "shaman-drummer-flutist-artist."
"I was born during a lunar eclipse but that was in Ohio, which is different," said Kathleen Toepker, who has set up shop selling eclipse kitsch here in Kailua-Kona (pronounced ky-LOO-a CO-nah).
Her father, a nuclear physicist, suggested a T-shirt, "I Got Mooned in Hawaii," and it is selling faster than her tape of eclipse music, "Canned Hawaiian Dark."
 
A Very Bright Full Moon
 Although the island will not be as dark as night on the morning of the eclipse, the effect will be like that of a very bright full moon, scientists say.
"A lot of people think this is going to be like a drive-in movie," Miss Baker said. "But anywhere on the island you'll be under the full shadow. You don't have to drive up to it."
The next closest island, Maui, will be just outside the full shadow of the eclipse. "We're on the edge of totality, staying in Maui," said Nathan Johnson, a visitor from Mountainview, Calif., who is on a waiting list to get a room here in Kailua-Kona.
The path of the eclipse, which casts an oval-shaped shadow that covers only one-half of 1 percent of Earth's surface at any given time and moves at 7,600 miles an hour, will touch much more than Hawaii, of course. The blackballed Sun will also cross the peninsula of Baja California and Mexico City, all of Central America and parts of South America. But because this is the rainy season in many of those areas, the eclipse may be obscured.
A partial eclipse will be visible over much of the United States; in Los Angeles, 80 percent of the Sun will be covered; in Dallas, 60 percent, and in New York less than 20 percent.
The duration of the eclipse in Mexico, nearly seven minutes, will not be exceeded for more than 150 years, scientists say. The next total solar eclipse visible from the United States will happen in the year 2017.
Atop Mauna Kea, where the air is thin and the cloud cover rare, scientists from around the world will be viewing the eclipse through telescopes so powerful they can spot the design label on a bathing suit 200 miles away.
"The light-measuring equipment inside the observatories are a billion times better than what we had 20 years ago," Dr. Hall said.
The eclipse comes at a time of high solar activity -- sun spots, solar flares and magnetic storms -- making it an added bonus for scientists.
"For the first time we will be able to measure some very fine detail on the outer edge of the Sun, the corona dust," Dr. Hall said. "These experiments could very well produce some significant finds on the heat source of the sun's outer layer."
Many scientists, he said, have waited a lifetime for the four minutes they will have atop the highest vocano in Hawaii on July 11. "An eclipse of this magnitude brings with it enormous pressure," Dr. Hall said.
As the Sun begins to re-emerge at 7:32 A.M. Hawaiian time, some viewers will probably have an emotional letdown. Others will rejoice at the gift from above and its commercial spinoff on the ground.
"This event is supposed to change a lot of lives," said Manny Martinez, creator of the eclipse haircut, which cost $100 until Tuesday, when the price fell to $50. "I know it's already changed mine."

HEADLINE: BANKERS EXPECTED TO STAY HESITANT TO LEND FOR YEARS

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Just as the bank failures in the Depression years bred a generation of conservative bankers, the new banking crisis is creating a cautiousness among lenders that bankers themselves say may slow the flow of loans long after the recession ends.
 Many factors affect a bank's willingness to lend, from the health of the bank to the size of its underlying capital base. But none are as important as the mindset of the bankers themselves. And there is widespread evidence that that mindset has changed in a way that may transform banking for months or years to come. 
There has been a trauma, and that trauma will make bankers cautious for a period of time," said Robert Hawkins, president of the Southern Commercial Bank of St. Louis.
 
Wary of Loose Lending
 The caution in banking circles represents a shift away from the free-lending approach of the heady 1980's and a return to more traditional banking standards.
 What had loosened banking standards was partly deregulation, and partly the increased tendency of the most creditworthy corporations to borrow directly from the credit markets, bypassing the banks. Pressed for business, the banks looked elsewhere for customers, competing to make higher-risk loans, including many in real estate -- a strategy that cost the banks dearly in loan defaults.
 The new caution among lenders showed up repeatedly in 25 interviews with bankers, corporate finance officers and Government officials. It is a caution that goes far beyond the credit tightening of the last year that the banks have often attributed to Government regulators.
 
Even Big Banks Change
 Even large, healthy banks say they are changing their ways. "In all types of lending, the price -- the interest rate -- is not only higher, but the terms of the transactions are becoming tougher and will remain so," said Lewis Coleman, vice chairman of the Bank of America in San Francisco.
 For consumers, the new caution shows itself in such things as slightly higher rates on bank credit cards -- they have already risen by nearly a percentage point in the last year, to an average of 19.6 percent -- smaller lines of credit and a growing reluctance to issue new credit cards to people who already hold one or two others.
 "They are target marketing to those with higher incomes and good credit records," said Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation of America. "In terms of ZIP codes, instead of mailing down 80 percent of the income ladder, as they used to do, they mail down 50 percent or 40 percent."
 Lenders are also requiring higher incomes from home buyers seeking mortgages, and often larger down payments. They are declaring that any borrower, consumer or corporate, will have to show higher levels of income in the 1990's to qualify for loans than in the 1980's. And bankers increasingly are putting limits on how much they will lend to even the most creditworthy corporations.
 "If someone wants $50 million from us, they have a tough sell on their hands," said Jerry Jordan, chief economist at the First Interstate Bank Corporation in California, where lending officers once could make such loans without higher management's approval. "We are trying to limit how much exposure we have to any borrower."
 
Outgrowing Fear
 How long might this caution last? The estimates run from two or three years to the end of the decade. "Once there are enough new faces in banking who did not experience the current crisis, lending will ease up again," said Robert E. Litan, a senior fellow and banking specialist at the Brookings Institution.
 Many experts argue that not only the nation's banks, but also two other major sources of loans, insurance companies and private finance companies, are simply returning to the lending standards that prevailed before the 1980's -- forced into doing so by the numerous loan defaults that threaten the survival of many banks. As Mr. Coleman put it, "I am making loans today with a feeling of deja vu."
 
Low Inflation a Factor
 The earlier cutback in lending had largely been a result of Government rules that in effect limited lending at banks with insufficient capital or labeled as risky many loans that in the 1980's went unchallenged by bank regulators.
 These obstacles still exist. But other forces are also kicking in to prolong the lending cutback, chief among them the defensive reaction to the trauma of bad loans and bank failures. The failures have occurred in a more concentrated fashion than at any time since the Great Depression.
 Low inflation, expected to endure well into the decade, is also playing a major role, especially in real estate lending. Property is not appreciating the way it did in the late 70's and early 80's. High inflation made real estate loans low risks and masked any mistakes a lender might have made in granting the loans. Now weaker prices have often made homes and machinery worth less than the loans floated a year or two ago to purchase them.
 The greater care in lending probably will dampen the economic recovery, once it materializes, because of less credit for corporate operations and consumer spending. For the longer term, the result is likely to be weaker economic growth in the early 1990's than in the 1980's.
 
Growth of Debt Reduced
 The credit shortage has already helped to reduce the growth of all outstanding debt in the United States, except that owed by the Federal Government and the lenders themselves, to an annual rate of less than 4 percent, according to Federal Reserve data. That is less than half the growth rate for debt in the late 1980's.
 The slowdown is partly a result of the scramble by many banks to raise cash to reimburse depositors whose money has been lent out and lost in unrepaid loans. Citibank is engaged in this scramble, and the experience is changing its long-term lending standards, said Michael Callen, a senior executive in corporate lending. "The mistake the banks made in the 1980's was to move downscale and lend to less creditworthy companies," he said. "The banks were not recognizing the level of risks and appropriately pricing for it."
 To recognize the risks, Citibank has increased interest rates for many commercial loans, with some companies whose credit ratings are of less than top quality paying two to four percentage points more than the bank once offered, Mr. Callen said.
 Such caution is similarly in vogue for healthy lenders. Many institutions, for example, are trying to keep down the levels of unpaid debt on bank credit cards, in part by trying to issue the cards to higher-income people likely to pay their bills every month, said Diane Casey, executive director of the Independent Bankers Association, which represents 10,000 midsized banks. "You try to issue cards to people who don't really need them," she said.
 Similarly, General Electric Capital, a healthy lending company whose activities include financing charge-card operations for retailers like Montgomery Ward, is monitoring income levels of card holders and limiting credit to low-income households, said James A. Park, G.E. Capital's senior vice president of finance.
 Many banks are no longer lending out as big a proportion of their deposits as they did in the 1980's, a cutback that allows them to be more selective. Deposits instead are often invested in Government securities. First Interstate is in this category, and so is Southern Commercial in St. Louis. Southern Commercial once lent 90 percent of its deposits, which total $180 million today. Now the proportion is 80 percent.
 "We don't have the loan demand today and even if we did, I would be nervous about getting back up to that level," said Mr. Hawkins, who is also president-elect of the Independent Bankers Association.
 
The 'Club Loan'
 The multibillion-dollar bank loan, once common for corporate takeovers and huge commercial real estate projects, is also more difficult to obtain, although big sums can still be raised by creditworthy companies through new bond issues. In the 1980's, a major bank would underwrite a multibillion-dollar loan and then quickly syndicate it, selling off shares to other institutions. Now the syndicated loan has become what Mr. Coleman of Bank of America describes as the "club loan."
 "The banks all sit down with the borrower and decide how much each will take, before the loan is made," Mr. Coleman said. And the amounts involved are much smaller. In the late 80's, there were syndicated loans put together in excess of $5 billion, and now the top is about $2 billion, he said.
 Even the nation's most creditworthy companies, among them the Colgate-Palmolive Corporation, are feeling the pinch. They often raise money on their own, by selling i.o.u.'s known as commercial paper, which currently total more than $550 billion.
 Colgate-Palmolive's i.o.u.'s are in such demand that the consumer products giant is paying less than 6 percent interest annually on $100 million in borrowings, said Brian Heidtke, the company's treasurer. By comparison, the banking industry's prime rate for loans to good corporate customers is 8.5 percent and many companies say they now have to pay above that level.
 But any corporation, no matter how creditworthy, traditionally lines up a bank guarantee to assure holders of commercial paper that they will be repaid should disaster strike the company. Lately the banks are making these guarantees more expensive and publicly warning that they will not pay off under certain conditions. Mr. Heidtke, for example, says that when Colgate-Palmolive renews its current $460 million standby credit, the nearly $600,000 annual fee will probably double.

Equities Surging In Latin America

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
ON the economic ropes several years ago, Latin America is beginning to show real success in opening its economies, and one of the strongest signs is the flourishing of its stock markets.
 As a group, stock markets in these developing countries have been the best performers of the year, outdoing both their competitors in the world's developed economies and their rivals in developing countries in Asia. "They have replaced the Pacific Rim emerging markets as the flavor of the month," said Gary Kleiman of Kleiman International Consultants. The problem for investors is figuring out how much higher some markets, like those in Mexico and Brazil, can go before a large correction occurs. 
Most of this year's leading markets, like those in Brazil and Argentina, and in the Philippines and Taiwan, were last year's losers. Only Mexico has been a consistent performer.
 Before this revival, these markets had suffered severely with the debt crisis of the 1980's. In 1981, according to the International Finance Corporation, which follows emerging economies, stock markets in Latin America made up 46 percent of the capitalization of the world's emerging markets. At the end of 1990, that share had shrunk to 17 percent.
 But now the International Finance Corporation indexes show that Latin American markets rose 75 percent in the first half of this year in dollar terms. In comparison, the Standard & Poor's 500 was up 12.9 percent, the Financial Times Stock Index in London was down 5.7 percent and the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo was off 4.3 percent.
 According to Lipper Analytical Services, which follows the many closed-end funds that invest in Latin American stock markets, the total return, including dividends, of these funds was 69 percent in the first half of the year, based on preliminary data. In comparison, funds in Europe and the Mideast were off 27 percent and all emerging-market funds fell slightly less than 18 percent.
 Two forces behind the revival are the selling of state-owned companies and the promise of structural changes in the countries themselves. A third force has been the preliminary success of the Bush Administration's third world debt policy, which has led to agreements with Mexico and Venezuela that reduce their debt and to negotiations with Brazil and Argentina toward the same goal.
 The dollar has also played a role. Some currencies in Latin America, like the Mexican peso, are tied to the dollar. So while the dollar rally this year has cut the earnings of dollar investors in Europe, it has had much less of an effect in Latin America. And even in markets like Brazil's, where the dollar has hurt, the market has jumped so much -- more than 360 percent in local terms -- that its dollar rise is still nearly 140 percent, according to I.F.C.
 "I think that as the world has seen the economic miracles that have taken place in Chile and Mexico there has been a new acceptance on the part of investors who want to gain an advantage in the market," said Emilio Bassini, a managing director of BEA Associaties and president of the Chile Fund and the Latin American Investment Fund, two closed-end funds. Mr. Bassini has put 15 percent of his global institutional portfolios into Mexico.
 He said one important force in the markets is the shortage of stock. Although the tilt in many portfolios toward Latin America is small, he said there was still not enough stock around to satisfy the growing demand.
 In addition, heavy local buying in anticipation of profits when foreigners buy has pushed prices higher, especially in Brazil, said Edward B. Games Jr., vice president of the Brazil Fund, managed by Scudder, Stevens & Clark.
 This does not mean the story is all rosy. As the markets have become more popular the once-low price-earnings ratios are beginning to look expensive. In Venezuela, the ratio jumped from 6.44 at the end of 1989 to 29.31 at the end of last year, the I.F.C. found. Mr. Games said: "I lament what happened in Mexico; the charm was a lot of companies that were very cheap. I do not think that there is much left in Mexico that anyone could say is woefully underpriced."
 Brazil, Mr. Bassini said, still needs sweeping tax reform and a huge shrinking of the size of its Government to make the economy and market more attractive. And he says Venezuela, which has what he regards as unfavoravble tax laws, has made no earnest attempt to open the market and encourage foreign investment.
 "An awful lot of the opportunity has been nailed down in a short period of time," Mr. Games said of Brazil, a comment that could apply to the rest of Latin America. He added, "There is a lot of opportunity left but it will be longer in coming, and there will be a lot of volatility."

HEADLINE: Despite Furor Over Research Fees, Stanford Plans Similar Rate Again

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: STANFORD, Calif., July 3

 BODY:
Stanford University has proposed a research overhead rate for the next fiscal year that is almost as high as the one that got it into trouble with the Federal Government earlier this year.
 "It shows a lot of chutzpah," James Collman, a chemistry professor at Stanford, said Tuesday. "It certainly would appear to be a little bit arrogant. It's politically impossible." 
Robert Dean, the university's dean of research, said that Stanford did not expect the Government to approve the rate it proposed, but that Federal regulators required the university to give an accurate projection of costs.
 At issue is how much the university charges for indirect costs of federally sponsored research. Auditors have accused Stanford of overcharging the Federal Government millions of dollars and including as research-related costs personal extravagances for the university's president, Donald Kennedy, like cedar-line closets and a 72-foot yacht. While he has not been directly accused of wrongdoing, his critics say he did nothing to stop the improper practices.
 Federal research grants consist of two components: direct costs for a specific project, like laboratory equipment and professors' salaries, and indirect costs, for items like use of buildings, utilities, libraries and administrative services.
 
Rate is Well Above Average
 Since indirect costs are not easily attributed to specific research, universities charge the Government a percentage of the grant for all costs related to the research. Each university sets or negotiates its rate; the national average is 49 percent. For example, if a university receives a $1 million Federal grant, the Government is billed about $490,000 in indirect costs, making the total cost of the grant $1.49 million.
 Stanford's rate had hit 78 percent by the time Federal auditors began investigating the university last year. After scrutinizing Stanford's records, the auditors determined that the university overbilled the Government as much as $200 million in the 1980's.
 In April, the Government cut Stanford's overhead rate to 55.5 percent and made it retroactive to Sept. 1, 1990.
 
Heated Debate Insured
 The high opening bid announced Tuesday insures heated negotiations between the university and the Office of Naval Research, the agency that oversees Federal research grants at Stanford.
 Speaking of the 76 percent proposal, Paul Biddle, the Navy contract negotiator who uncovered the overbilling, said, "I think the opinion of most people I've spoken to in government today is that this is an outlandish proposition."
 Mr. Byer said the university did not expect approval of the 76 percent rate. "We have gotten the message loud and clear," he said in a statement. "We know that changing standards and upcoming negotiations are unlikely to produce a rate that fully reimburses our costs.
 "Nevertheless, Federal regulators require us to submit our best projection of our indicrect costs and, under today's conditions, this is it."

CORRECTION-DATE: August 6, 1991, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article by The Associated Press on July 5 about Stanford University's billing of the Federal Government for indirect costs related to Government research described past overcharges incorrectly. The figure $200 million was not a determination by auditors; it was an estimate by a representative of the Office of Naval Research. This correction was delayed through an editing error.
 Because of other editing errors, the article also misidentified the university's dean of research and referred incorrectly to a yacht for which expenses were in question. The dean is Robert Byer. The yacht was not a "personal extravagance" of Stanford's president, Donald Kennedy; it had been donated to the Stanford sailing club.

HEADLINE: Whose Park Is This Anyway?Chris Angus writes the "Canoe Country" column for The Advance News in St. Lawrence County, N.Y.

BYLINE: By Chris Angus

DATELINE: POTSDAM, N.Y.

 BODY:
When most New Yorkers think of the Adirondacks, they imagine a vast land of mountains, rivers and chain lakes held in a public trust for their use and enjoyment. Sadly, they're mistaken.
Most of the rivers and lakes of the Adirondack Park are locked away -- posted and often patrolled by private landholders. Of the 21 historic waterways that have been declared public since 1812, 18 are closed: two-thirds of New York State's wild, scenic and recreational rivers system is off-limits. 
 In the last two years, the State Assembly passed the Public Rights of Passage in Navigable Waterways Bill, which would have opened all such waterways in the state. Unfortunately, the bill has never made it out of committee in the Senate. This year, budget problems have delayed action yet again. There is still hope, though, that the bill will come up for a vote when the Senate meets to address its unfinished business later this year.
In the spring of 1986, I was cited for trespassing along with two friends after we used a bridge to gain access to the South Branch of the Grass River in the northwestern part of the Adirondack Park. Our case dragged on for more than a year and through two courts before being thrown out for lack of evidence.
The laws concerning river navigability are murky at best. Over the years, courts have interpreted common law in many cases. Together, these legal decisions form the basis for an uncertain situation that has played into the hands of landowners who want to keep the public out. What remains for the recreationist is the distinct possibility that he will be harassed and even prosecuted for enjoying what was one of the premiere canoe destinations in the U.S. in the 1800's.
Throughout most of the rest of New York and New England, waterways have remained open. Under common law, the public can claim property as a result of continued use over many years. From the time New York was a Dutch province, citizens were able to travel on any river.
But within the Adirondack Park, established in 1892 for "the free use of all the people," this open use of the waterways has been allowed to slip, largely as a result of a decision by a New York Court of Appeals, which in 1883 ruled against the idea that perennial streams were considered in the public domain.
There is much to be gained from a return to open navigability. Increasingly, corporations and individuals have sold their land to developers, who have then built houses and condominiums along miles of pristine lakes, rivers and streams.
Because of budget restraints and fierce bidding from developers, the state has been unable to act quickly enough to purchase and protect these lands. And because many beautiful rivers like the South Branch of the Grass have rarely been seen by the public, there is a limited constituency for their protection.
Many developers and game clubs claim that opening up the rivers and chain lakes for public use will destroy the wilderness. This doesn't make sense. Free access will let the public to act as watchdogs not only against quick sales to developers but against vandalism and illegal logging.
The Public Rights of Passage in Navigable Waterways Bill may well be the last chance for many rivers and lakes to be discovered by the boating public in time to save them from a gallery of waiting developers. With the defeat of the Environmental Bond Act of 1990, the state has no money to buy back the waterways. In this time of economic instability, the bill would open vast areas for public recreation while offering increased protection.
Declaring the Adirondacks the rival of Switzerland in scenic beauty, William H. H. "Adirondack" Murray, author of "Adventures in the Wilderness," wrote in 1869: "What luxury it is . . . to glide down the winding reaches of these rivers, overhung by the outlying pines and fringed with water lilies, mingling their fragrance with the odors of cedar and balsam!" What luxury indeed! But only if our legislators agree to make it possible for everyone.

HEADLINE: Drug Maker Assails an Article Critical of a Sedative's Safety

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BASEL, Switzerland, July 5

 BODY:
The Swiss drug concern F. Hoffmann-La Roche today rejected as false a report in The New York Times suggesting that a concentrated sedative marketed by the company is dangerous.
Hoffmann-La Roche accused the newspaper of spreading "incorrect allegations" about the sedative Versed in an article on Thursday. 
 Versed's safety "can in no way be called into question" if it is administered according to instructions included in the package, a company statement said.
The Times said the Food and Drug Administration received 46 reports of deaths linked to the drug within 18 months of its going on the market in the United States in 1986.
But the chief spokesman for Hoffmann-La Roche, Max W. Gurtner, called it "absolutely absurd to portray this as a causal relationship."
 
Disputing Cause of Death
 He said all deaths associated with the use of an approved drug in the United States must be reported to the drug agency, but that reporting them did not automatically pinpoint the drug as the cause of death.
The Times also said internal company documents indicated that a group of researchers and administrator at the company's United States affiliate, Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. in Nutley, N.J., twice urged Swiss executives to market the drug in a less concentrated form.
But the company pressed ahead with marketing plans, citing economic objectives, The Times reported. Three weeks after its second objection, the dissenting group said new data from the use of Versed led the group to change its objection, the newspaper said, citing internal documents.
Versed is used to sedate patients during minor surgery or before and during general anesthesia. It is chemically close to Valium, a hugely successful sedative also marketed by Hoffmann-La Roche.
At a Congressional hearing in 1988, it was reported that Hoffman-La Roche's Swiss operation knew higher concentrations of Versed were difficult for some doctors to administer and could cause over-sedation of patients.
Mr. Gurtner said that clinical trials in the United States and Europe of a 5-to-1 concentration of Versed showed it is safe in that formulation.

Tax Rule Benefits Night Workers

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
For thousands of urban workers, commuting late at night will become less worrisome, thanks to a regulation the Internal Revenue Service put into effect this week.
When an employer pays for a taxi or car service to take employees to or from work because it would be unsafe to walk or take public transportation, employees will have to report only $1.50 a ride, not the actual value, as taxable income. 
 The tax-forgiveness rule previously applied to people who occasionally worked late; it has now been extended to those who are assigned to the graveyard shift and are regularly given rides.
"The service has done a fantastic job in taking some action to recognize the realities of urban life," said Avery E. Neumark, chairman of the fringe benefits subcommittee of the American Bar Association's section on taxation, which helped to persuade the I.R.S. to change its position. "This can be tremendously beneficial, because usually people who work at these hours don't make much."
Law and accounting firms often employ word processers to transcribe documents overnight. Utilities have repair people and technicians who work late, as do broadcasters. People in a variety of service industries also work through the night.
Some law and accounting firms paid employees extra, to cover the taxes on the taxi rides they had to report as income, said Mr. Neumark, a partner in Weber, Lipshie, a New York accounting firm. But some did not, and many workers were afraid to accept a night job or risked using public transportation in high-crime areas to avoid the tax liability.
A taxi ride to the New York suburbs or the outer parts of the Bronx or Queens could easily cost $30, Mr. Neumark said. That would equal $7,200 a year; Federal, state and city income taxes on that amount, plus Social Security taxes, could be $2,900.
To be eligible for the tax forgiveness, a worker has to meet two tests: he or she must be paid $60,535 or less in 1991 (the number is indexed for inflation and will rise in future years) and be eligible for overtime pay of at least time and a half for working more than 40 hours a week.
In testimony before the I.R.S. this week, Mr. Neumark asked that only the first test be used. "The mugger doesn't ask, 'Are you an hourly or salaried employee?' " he said.
That and a further recommendation to extend the regulations to cover transportation in employer-owned cars are being considered. In the meantime, the rules already adopted should help to raise the morale of urban workers fearful of crime, Mr. Neumark said, and "it puts them on a parity with workers elsewhere, who are not taxed on employer-provided parking."
 
 Home Ownership
 When Americans start to look for new homes -- as many are doing this time of year -- the vast majority think first about the mortgage. How big and desirable a home they can buy is determined by how big a mortgage they can receive. Indeed, the conventional wisdom is that over the years the home's value will rise and its owner will receive tax deductions.
But William J. Goldberg, who is in charge of personal financial planning for KPMG Peat Marwick, rejects that view. He is advising home owners to take a conservative stance and hold down their mortgage costs.
"Back when there was high inflation, generally leverage worked in your favor," he said. "Fix your cost today, stretch, and pay it off with cheaper dollars." But since home values have declined in many regions, the opposite approach is now best, said Mr. Goldberg, a partner in KPMG's Houston office. With many economists expecting low inflation to continue, the situation may not change.
In addition, tax deductions were more attractive when they meant the Federal Government was picking up half of the cost of real estate taxes and mortgage interest. Now a taxpayer in the top Federal bracket of 31 percent is still paying 69 cents on the dollar, he noted.
"Vocational insecurity is also a factor," he said. With layoffs widespread, many employees are anxious about their jobs, he said, and many professionals like doctors, lawyers and accountants are finding their income is 20 to 30 percent lower than a year ago. People with relatively low monthly payments are in better shape to weather any storms.
Mr. Goldberg advises people who are selling one home and buying another to put the equity from the first into the second, rather than make a minimal down payment. "Not many people can pay cash," he said, "unless they are moving from Los Angeles to Houston," or are selling a big home to buy a retirement home. But many can make a large down payment and limit the size of the mortgage.
He also advises those who already have big mortgages to pay them down ahead of schedule, if possible. "The less your loan is, the better off you're going to be in the long run, barring fabulous inflation," he said.
But he added one caveat: "Don't do it if you are going to need the money for tuition next year. Don't think of the house as a piggy bank, where you put the money in and get it back out."

HEADLINE: About New York

BYLINE: By Douglas Martin

 BODY:
So here we are mired in a recession at a time when doomsayers see the lights dimming on the Great White Way, and we run across an absolute novice -- a waiter, in fact -- starting his own theater company and being the producer of an avant-garde Russian drama.
All on the strength of little more than a nice smile and a Visa card in the name of Keith Gilroy. 
 "He's doing everything wrong," Arthur Cantor sighed. "It's an absolutely foolhardy thing."
Mr. Cantor is an old lion of the theater world, having staged better than 100 shows, some quite classy. Eileen Atkins's recent one-woman performance as Virginia Woolf, for instance. And some not quite so classy. "Vampire Lesbians of Sodom" comes to mind.
He worships the histrionic art, but has also come to know Broadway for what it often is: a fool's-gold paradise where brazen compromise is revered as genius, where exquisite talent is brutally replaceable and where every dream carries a price tag.
"I'm so cynical about this business," he said.
Then, last Monday, a 26-year-old dreamer waltzed into the old schemer's cluttered office and sold him a deal almost certain to lose money. On the strength of Mr. Gilroy's "divine insanity" -- and a few phone calls to check his credentials -- Mr. Cantor agreed to rent the Provincetown Playhouse, a 175-seat theater he manages in Greenwich Village, to the young man for $1,000 next Friday through Monday. Maybe just enough to cover expenses.
Mr. Gilroy convinced the impresario -- or landlord in this case -- that Tverboul, a Russian dramatic troupe that had wowed him at a theater festival in Scotland last summer, just had to be seen by Manhattan audiences. Its eclectic approach, he said, can be described as "collages of street scenes."
Tverbol had planned only two American engagements, on Long Island and in Chicago. Mr. Gilroy took in the Long Island show, then offered the Russians a chance to pick up a couple thousand extra dollars, though they might have to sleep on his floor.
Their immediate "Da!" and Mr. Cantor's generosity were just two pieces of the puzzle: a friend who works for an ad agency is making fliers; another friend is using a personal computer to print tickets, and the Marriott Marquis Hotel on Times Square, where Mr. Gilroy is a waiter, is supplying free rooms. Actor friends, most of whom are also waiters, have written checks for as much as $1,500.
We caught up with Mr. Gilroy in the spinning rooftop restaurant where he usually works but where on this day he was complaining about the service. He sat at a window table with his girlfriend, Lisa Bobonis, 26, a former ballerina whose bad ankle has led to jobs like spritzing perfume on Bloomingdale's customers.
Sitting in such bubbly company, we had the distinct feeling that young dreams still might come true in this battered old burg. Just as a psychic had predicted, it was love at first sight for these two. They met at a "surrealistic fashion show" replete with mermaids munching shrimp. They live in a spacious apartment in a dilapidated Lower East Side building that was once home to the jazz legend Charlie Parker. The decor includes a horse's head from "Equus."
Since he played Winthrop -- the kid who lisps in "The Music Man" -- at a dinner theater, Mr. Gilroy's ambition has been the stage. He has drifted into directing.
An early effort was directing a friend's play produced in a small theater called Synchronicity Space in SoHo. They got a bargain-basement rental on the theater, provided they put up their set overnight. Hey, no problem for dreamers. That led to being invited to form a resident theater company at Synchronicity. Barebones Productions was born.
Mr. Gilroy made it a limited partnership, through which 21 members agreed to invest $125 a month for 15 months. They were guaranteed acting lessons with first-rate teachers; one comes from the Royal Shakespeare Company. They are also given a chance to participate in four productions a year. And who knows? The explicitly for-profit troupe might even make money.
Their first production, Viki Boyle's "The Whole Truth," was recently a winner at the Short Play Festival at the Double Image Theater in SoHo.
Mr. Gilroy hopes that the Russians can be persuaded to stay a week or two longer, but that may be precluded by an engagement in the Netherlands.
As is, it is too late to properly publicize next week's performance. Even free listings, including those in the Sunday New York Times, had unmeetable deadlines.
Well, shucks. Keith Gilroy Productions will present Tverboul, described as a "collage of striking scenes and beautiful, haunting songs," at the Provincetown Playhouse at 133 MacDougal Street, July 12-15. Ticket price is $20. For more information, call 212-279-4200.

HEADLINE: Ray of Hope for Homeless Penetrates Meager Walls of Miami Shantytown

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, July 5

 BODY:
From the elevated expressways that lace this city, Miami seems all glitter. But below the main ramp that leads downtown lies a shadowy shantytown, swirling with smoke and mosquitoes, where people like Andrew Johnson struggle to live in a city that has long refused to care adequately for its homeless.
"We're just trying to survive," said Mr. Johnson, who calls himself A.J. and has initialled gold caps on his front teeth to prove it. He said he got the teeth when times were good and when, as a Coast Guard veteran and long-haul truck driver, he was doing all right. 
 Now the slim 45-year-old man lives in an eight-square-foot hutch of old plywood and cardboard under the Interstate 395 overpass a few yards from Miami's showcase, Biscayne Boulevard. "Miami doesn't make it easy for us."
 
Plan for a Large Program
 But this week, under persistent prodding by a Federal court, city officials tentatively agreed to a plan intended to establish Miami's first large-scale program to help the homeless.
The plan, which still must be approved by the city commissioners, would provide accommodations for 30 days for as many as 500 homeless people at Bobby Maduro Stadium, an open-air baseball stadium, about a mile from the overpass, that a few years ago housed Nicaraguan refugees. The plan is seen as a first step toward a permanent program.
City officials said the state had committed as much as $300,000 for the project, which, along with city and county involvement, would provide shelter, showers, food, medical care and counseling to help the homeless find jobs and a place to live.
Until now, Miami has done almost nothing for its 6,000 homeless but arrest them for violating various city ordinances. The only city shelter program, run with Dade County, operates 100 beds. The city provides less than $400,000 a year to private organizations that help the homeless, and advocates say this does not amount to much compared to the efforts of nearly every other major city in the nation.
Mayor Xavier Suarez acknowledged that it was unlikely the city would have agreed to do anything without the pressures brought by a 1988 suit and a rising outrage among downtown merchants worried that the homeless are scaring away business. But in the city's defense, he said Miami has been hampered by a split in government responsibilities between the city and Dade County that has made it impossible to get a consensus on how to deal with the homeless.
In one way, the city backed itself into a corner. By sweeping the homeless from its parks last February, the city forced them to find a new place to stay, which turned out to be beneath the overpass, where they are more visible to thousands of commuters and shoppers.
"At this point," said Andrew L. Cherry, a professor of social work at Barry University, who has studied the homeless camps for four years, "the city is either going to really start helping the homeless or roust them out of here for good."
Around the country, there is a growing impatience with the homeless. New York moved aggressively last month to roust homeless people from encampments at Tompkins Square Park and Columbus Circle in Manhattan. Santa Barbara, Calif., has passed no-sleeping and no-camping ordinances. Cincinnati has taken to giving tickets carrying a $114 fine tohomeless beggars for aggressive panhandling. Atlanta, Chicago and Columbus, Ohio, are among cities that have recently shown a backlash toward street people.
But Miami stands apart.
"Miami is in a different league from other cities because it never had a positive response toward helping the homeless," said Fred G. Karnas Jr., executive director of the National Coalition for the Homeless, based in Washington. The head of the Miami Coalition for the Homeless, a local advocacy group that is loosely affiliated with the national organization, said Miami's attitude has changed for the worse.
"Miami seems to have jumped right from apathy to anger," said Christine M. Hildner, executive director of the organization.
That anger was most tragically displayed last May when someone jumped from a van and clubbed to death a homeless man sleeping under I-95, not far from the downtown shanties. The police said the attack was apparently unprovoked, and Ms. Hildner said she considered it an isolated incident.
 
Other Signs of Rejection
 But there have been other less violent expressions of rejection. "No windshield washing" signs have sprouted downtown to deter street-corner entrepreneurs with squeegees, and more than 100 homeless people have been arrested for violating the ordinance over the last year. Some merchants on Biscayne Boulevard have fenced their properties to keep the homeless away at night. Yacht owners who dock at the Bayside Marina put up a fence to keep the homeless from using their tap water.
With its easy climate and the traces of a frontier attitude, where thousands of immigrants have successfully started over, Miami never has had much sympathy for the homeless. The city relies on a sunny, carefree image to attract tourists and conventions, the region's lifeblood. Community leaders do not want to do anything to attract even more homeless people.
Concern for the city's image is one reason the encampment under the overpass has inflamed emotions. It lies in sight of Miami's fleet of bleached white cruise ships and just blocks from the city's new downtown shopping mall.
In recent months the encampment has become a focus of even greater frustration and concern as it has spread to cover an area as wide as a six-lane highway and as long as about four city blocks. The basic building materials are shopping carts, called buggies, discarded plywood and cardboard. Landscape sprinklers broken by the homeless provide water for cooking and washing. Men and women wearing swimsuits use the sprinklers to shower, and they use the bathroom at a local Burger King or in nearby bushes.
The highway about 16 feet above them provides shade all day and generates a steady hum that helps the homeless tune out the traffic whizzing by them on all sides. Arthur Harris, a 38-year-old unemployed construction worker, said the worst part of living under the overpass right now is fighting off the swarms of newly hatched mosquitoes.
 
A Precarious Existence
 Mr. Harris said he used to sleep in a city park until the police swept through it one night last February. He was not able to grab any of his possessions before he was carried off in a paddy wagon to be dropped off about half a mile away. By the time he walked back, he said, all his things were gone.
A Federal judge later fined the city $2,500 for those actions and others that violate an injunction against harassing the homeless. The court proceedings have been going on since 1988, when lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida brought a lawsuit against Miami, claiming the city tried to sweep the homeless from sight before events like the Orange Bowl football game or the 1987 visit of Pope John Paul II. A trial is scheduled to begin in September.
As controversy swirls around them, many people living under the overpass focus on their own needs, some with surprising success.
Chelly Bulnes, a 31-year-old Miami native who has been on the streets with her husband, Salvador, for two years, lives in one of the most elaborate hutches. It is a triumph of inventiveness, made from cloth-covered office dividers that she said she salvaged from the trash. In one room she has a pull-out sofa lined with plush toy animals, a plastic foam cooler containing soda and chicken parts and a table on which she keeps her coloring books and crayons. In a plywood extension, she has a black leather sofa that was thrown out in a downtown office renovation and a twin-sized mattress.
"I think the city is really trying," Mrs. Bulnes said. "I know Suarez has us on his mind, but it's not easy. There's just too many people on the street."
 
'That Was Foolish'
 Mr. Suarez concedes that until recently Miami deserved its reputation as a city that refused to care for its homeless. He blamed the city's inability to act partly on the ineffectiveness of the form of government.
The government of Miami is split between the city, which provides physical services, including the police, and Metro-Dade County, which takes care of social services.
"For years the city said, 'We don't have responsibility for social services,' and the county said, 'We don't have the funds,' " Mr. Suarez said. "That was foolish because the homeless were everywhere."
The plan to accommodate 500 homeless people in the stadium is described as a temporary response but one based on the city's experience this year of forcing the homeless from one location only to find them in another. Mr. Suarez said that he realizes the city must come up with a permanent solution and that with the current climate of soul-searching, the time is right.
Many people under the overpass welcomed the plan and said they would gladly move. "All I want to do," said Mr. Johnson, sweeping outside his plywood hutch with a broken-handled broom, "is get myself out of a jam."

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate Up But Pay Is, Too, In Mixed Report

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 5

 BODY:
More signs of an incipient economic recovery emerged today even as the Government's first comprehensive report for June showed a decline in business payrolls and a rise of one-tenth of a point in the unemployment rate, to 7 percent.
The latest data, although mixed, sent a shudder through the bond market, pushing up interest rates as traders contemplated, among other things, a six-tenths of 1 percent increase in average hourly earnings that hinted at a stepped-up pace of inflation. [Page 33.] 
 At the White House, Michael J. Boskin, the President's chief economic adviser, found "a variety of mixed messages" and interpretive difficulties in the new figures but said they did not change the Administration's basic assessment. "The economy, we believe, has begun to recover," Mr. Boskin said at a briefing for reporters.
 
Lagging Current Conditions
 The jobless rate is considered a lagging economic indicator, which means that it tends to keep rising, for example, even after business recoveries get under way. A principal reason is that to be counted as unemployed, one must be actively seeking work, and in an improved economy people who were not previously looking for work are now looking, therefore increasing the unemployment rate.
Private economists as well as the Bureau of Labor Statistics tended to dismiss the rise in the unemployment rate as both unsurprising and, because the change was less than two-tenths of a point, statistically insignificant.
But Democrats seized on the figures to assail the Bush Administration. The unemployment rate was the highest since late 1986 and there was a sharp increase in the number of people who had been jobless for at least 15 weeks.
Senator Jim Sasser, a Tennessee Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, and Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, a Maryland Democrat who is chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, wrote President Bush to urge action to provide additional weeks of unemployment compensation for those whose normal 26 weeks of benefits have expired.
In a separate report today, the Labor Department said initial claims for jobless benefits during the third week of June declined 8,000 from the preceding week, to a total of 423,000, well below the 500,000-plus peaks recorded in March.
Among the most striking positive factors in today's data were a 12-minute extension of the private-sector workweek, a 24-minute extension of factory hours and an 18-minute extension of factory overtime.
This was also seen as typical of the early stages of recovery when employers, many of whom are not yet convinced that the turn has come, tend to work their employees longer rather than hire new workers.
The longer factory hours, now at their highest levels since last fall, helped raise the index of aggregate weekly hours, a major determinant of industrial production, to 121.7 in June from 121.1 in May.
Other favorable elements in today's data were a second straight decline in the number of people working fewer hours than they would like, and a decline of 227,000 in the ranks of the newly unemployed, those looking for work for less than five weeks.
The quarterly survey of discouraged workers -- those who have given up looking for a job because they think they cannot find one -- found that the number fell slightly in the April-June period, to 981,000 from 997,000.
Among the report's negatives, one of the most disappointing was a decline of 50,000 in payroll jobs when a modest increase was widely anticipated. Factory jobs were down 59,000, with the hardest-hit industries being those making military and transportation equipment. Auto makers have for some time been managing their inventories of cars by altering employment levels.
 
Health Sector Keeps Growing
 But jobs in the service industry rose 69,000, the biggest gain since August, as recession-resistant health services gained another 40,000 and business services, an industry closely tied to overall economic conditions, gained 12,000.
Analysts also took some comfort from the fact that growth of payroll jobs for May was revised upward to a gain of 119,000 instead of the 59,000 initially reported.
During transition periods, the data are usually mixed, observed Donald H. Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch. "These don't indicate to me we're going back into recession," he said.
The survey of households, on which the official unemployment figure is calculated, showd that employment rose 293,000 in June after two months of unexplained gyrations that saw a jump in April of 644,000 and a drop in May of 807,000.
There were no significant changes in unemployment among the various population groups last month, but large swings were posted by some of the 11 major states for which June data are available. The jobless rate in Illinois soared 1.3 points, to 7.3 percent, while Pennsylvania's fell 1 point, to 6.7 percent. The rates for New York and New Jersey moved marginally, with New York at 7.7 percent, up three-tenths of a percentage point, and New Jersey at 6.6 percent, down two-tenths.
In all, 397,000 people were added to the labor force last month, with the 104,000 who failed to find work swelling the joblesss ranks to 8,745,000. The 7 percent unemployment rate was the highest since October 1986. Of the jobless, the nearly 2.6 million out of work for more than 15 weeks now account for 29 percent.

HEADLINE: Stocks Mixed In Slow Day; Dow Off 2.23

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Wall Street mostly took a holiday yesterday. Stocks turned mixed and activity sank to the lowest level of the year as hundreds of traders stayed home for a long Fourth of July weekend.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell to 2,932.47, off 2.23 for the day but ahead 25.72 for the week. 
 Activity on both the New York and American stock exchanges and in the over-the-counter market fell to the lowest levels of the year.
"It was just a post-July Fourth day," said Eugene E. Peroni, chief technical analyst for Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.
Monday's 51.66-point surge in the Dow in the wake of a big run-up in Japan's Nikkei stock index helped the Dow stay in the black for the week.
 
 Earnings More of a Factor
 Since then, however, the Nikkei has been losing ground, dropping another 1 percent yesterday. Even so, the few traders around yesterday on Wall Street looked more to earnings than either the Nikkei or another piece of news on the economy.
New employment data came out yesterday showing that while payrolls dropped in June they apparently did not decline enough to prompt the Fed to trim interest rates. The news toppled bond prices but had little impact on stocks.
Along with the Dow blue chips, the Nasdaq composite fell a little, with high-technology stocks leading the way. The Standard & Poor's 500, peppered with the big stocks, and the American Stock Exchange's market value index, loaded with smaller stocks, both rose a bit. But the changes were far less than even 1 percent and in any case meant little because many traders were elsewhere yesterday.
Except for a brief 12-point slide in the Dow at the start of trading, the blue chips jumped 28 points from their low by 10:30 but then began dropping. In a decline that lasted for the rest of the day, the Dow lost most of its gain by 1:30, moving aimlessly until the closing bell.
Trading on the Big Board hit a new low for the year yesterday of 69.9 million shares, down sharply from 140.6 million on Wednesday. Volume was also down sharply from the previous 1991 low of 109.5 million on May 20, a quiet Monday, and was the lowest since Dec. 24, 1990, when 57.2 million shares were traded.
The Nasdaq hit a 1991 low of 56.3 million shares, down from its previous low for the year of 92.02 million. Trading on the Amex hit a new low yesterday of 5.4 million shares, down from the previous 1991 low of 6.99 million shares.
Mr. Peroni, the Philadelphia market watcher, pointed, though, to the market's "relative firmness."
"Compared to the bonds' sharp selloff," he said, "this relative firmness in stocks indicates that investors who were in the market today are looking for quality growth plays in anticipation of a focused earnings turnaround in the second half."
With Wall Street's attention fixed on I.B.M. and a few other technology stocks as one of the best ways to forecast the direction of stock prices, Mr. Peroni argued that the market was "apt to remain unsettled for several weeks -- until it becomes clear whether investors have fully discounted lower earnings expectations for I.B.M. and other recently depressed tech stocks."
I.B.M. made the Big Board list of the 10 most active stocks, rising 1/2, to 98 5/8, in what appeared to be a reaction to its announcement with Apple Computer that the two would join forces to make personal computers easier to use.
Apple led Nasdaq's active list, rising 2 1/2, to 45 5/8, with nearly three million shares changing hands. A big competitor, Microsoft, stood in third place on the list, sinking 2 1/4, to 61 3/4, with volume of 1.6 million shares.
BankAmerica, which was down by 2 on Wednesday amid uncertainty over earnings, rose by 1, to 34 1/2, yesterday following its announcement after Wednesday's close of trading that it expected second-quarter earnings to be close to the $267 million it earned in the quarter a year earlier.

HEADLINE: BLACKS IN DECLINE IN NORTHERN CITIES

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 5

 BODY:
Blacks are moving away from metropolitan areas in the industrial North and toward metropolitan areas of the South and West, census figures show.
The trend, which counters old migration patterns, was underscored by declines in the black populations of the Pittsburgh-Beaver Valley area, by 1.5 percent, and in the Chicago-Gary-Lake County area, by 0.6 percent. Those were among many northern cities that were magnets for blacks escaping poverty and racial discrimination in the South in the 1950's and 1960's. 
 The Census Bureau tables from the 1990 count, made public on Thursday, showed that blacks are joining whites in moving to the Sun Belt and Far West, apparently seeking economic opportunities and better living conditions.
While black populations rose in some northern cities, the rates of increase were far lower than elsewhere and often were below the national increase of 13 percent in the number of blacks in the decade.
But the black population rose 65.5 percent in Sacramento, Calif., 52.5 percent in San Diego, 50.1 percent in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale area and 40 percent in Atlanta and the Seattle-Tacoma area.
 
Rises in the North
 In the North, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island area showed a 16.4 percent increase in black population, that in the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Trenton area was up 6.5 percent and the Detroit-Ann Arbor area grew by 5.9 percent.
The Boston-Lawrence-Salem area was one of the few in the North in which the black populations showed substantial growth, rising 35.6 percent. In the Washington D.C. area, the black population went up 19.7 percent.
The Census Bureau also reported that the Hispanic population in the Los Angeles-Anaheim-Riverside area grew more than 2 million, or 73.4 percent . At least 100,000 Hispanics were added to the rolls in 12 other cities and metropolitan areas, most of them in the border states of Texas, California and Arizona.
Proportionately, the biggest changes were in Orlando, Fla., up 271.2 percent; Washington, up 136.7 percent, and Las Vegas, Nev., up 136.3 percent.
The Los Angeles metropolitan area had the largest Hispanic population, with 4.78 million, followed by the New York metropolitan area, with 2.78 million, the Miami metropolitan area, with 1.06 million, and the San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose area, with 970,000.

HEADLINE: Frictions Haunt Rights Hero of Past

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, July 5

 BODY:
He left his blood on the streets of Selma, Rock Hill and Montgomery for the landmark civil rights bills of the 1960's, and John Lewis believes the moral issues that resonated then must resonate again.
"It is a shame and a disgrace that, in 1991, we are still debating whether or not we should protect our fellow American citizens from discrimination," Mr. Lewis, now a United States Representative from Atlanta, said last month as he called on the House to pass the latest civil rights bill. 
 Mr. Lewis, whose balding head bears the scars from beatings he received while being arrested about 40 times in the South in the 1960's, represents as much as any living American the heart and soul of the civil rights battles that changed the nation three decades ago. And as Congress lurches along in its struggle over the civil rights bill, which the House passed last month, he is also a symbol of the frustrations and contradictions surrounding civil rights issues today.
For Mr. Lewis, civil rights is still an issue of morality. When he attended dedication ceremonies this week for the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis, he marked a continuity of vision that goes from the streets of the South to the halls of Congress.
 
Some Difficult Questions
 But the dissension brought out in the debate over the civil rights bill has posed difficult questions even for Mr. Lewis: Does civil rights address the core problems facing minority groups today? Have the bill's proponents erred tactically and philosophically in putting it at the top of the Congressional agenda this year? What is the best way to build broad-based support for addressing the problems of the poor?
The questions come quicker than the answers.
Time has rounded out the slender frame that Mr. Lewis had in the days of the Freedom Rides. But, at the age of 51, his voice is still rich with the slow cadences of rural Alabama, and he still has the same dogged commitment he has had ever since he first heard the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. preach a scratchy radio sermon in 1955.
The story of Mr. Lewis, who was born the son of a sharecropper in Troy, Ala., on Feb. 21, 1940, has become a staple of civil rights lore -- from his beginning as a shy farm boy who preached to the barnyard chickens to his service on the front lines of the Freedom Rides and sit-ins that changed the South.
Some, like Dr. King or Ralph Abernathy, were more dynamic leaders. Others, like Julian Bond, were more eloquent speakers or compelling tacticians. But Mr. Lewis's penchant for putting his body on the line and his almost spiritual commitment to the philosophy of nonviolence inspired extraordinary respect from his peers in the civil rights movement. Over the years he has emerged as one of the most unambiguously heroic figures of the 1960's.
"There were a lot of people who pretended they were civil rights heroes," said Roger Wilkins, a professor of history and American culture at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va. "John was a true hero, an absolute hero, a man of absolute fearlessness and total and utter integrity."
That sense of integrity is his main attribute in Congress, where he is serving his third term after winning a bruising election in 1986 that essentially shattered his longterm friendship with the man he defeated, Mr. Bond.
Mr. Lewis has no major legislation to his credit and is not regarded as an insider in Congress. But last year he became one of 31 members of the influential House Democratic Policy and Steering Committee. He has also become one of the best-liked men in Congress and is something of a celebrity, frequently stopped and praised by tourists and passers-by.
But the esteem in which Mr. Lewis is held for his role in the 1960's does not necessarily translate into an ability to change people's minds on civil rights in the 1990's.
 
A One-Man Lobbying Effort
 In the civil rights debate Mr. Lewis worked almost nonstop in an effort to convince vacillating members, including some of his best friends in Congress, to support the bill. Some, he says, simply dodged his phone calls. Others, like Representatives Marty Russo of Illinois and George (Buddy) Darden of Georgia, listened long and hard and then voted the other way.
Mr. Russo said that when he finally made up his mind on his vote Mr. Lewis was the first person he told.
"John Lewis is a living hero who, along with Martin Luther King, changed the course of history," Mr. Russo said. "It's important I have his respect and friendship. But I had to tell him I think this bill just leads to an enormous legal quagmire. I think it's just contributing to more polarization of the races."
Mr. Russo, a Democrat who is usually aligned with House liberals, added: "Instead of working on a civil rights bill, we should be working on an economic rights bill. I view this as a bill that helps a small minority of the minority."
Mr. Lewis well understands the difficulties the bill poses for Mr. Russo, many of whose constituents are working-class whites in the suburbs south of Chicago and who are most sensitive to allegations of racial quotas, the main argument used by opponents of the bill.
 
An Unsettling Familiarity
 What he has a harder time coming to terms with, Mr. Lewis said in an interview, is the unsettling familiarity in the nation's racial politics. In the Southern politics of his youth, pitting whites against blacks was standard fare. Now, he believes, the same process has become a staple of national politics.
He says he finds the tenor of the current debate profoundly troubling, and places the blame squarely on President Bush, whose public comments he compared on the House floor to that of former Gov. George Wallace of Alabama, who had Presidential aspirations before being crippled by a gunman in a Maryland parking lot, and Eugene (Bull) Connor, the former Birmingham police commissioner.
"There was not much difference really to what George Wallace did in his campaign and what President Bush has done, or some of the people in his Administration," Mr. Lewis said. "No President in modern times, not in the past 40 or 50 years, has ever used the issue of civil rights, the issue of race, the way this President has used it."
Mr. Lewis said he was also aware that the debate over the civil rights bill so far had aroused more passion on the part of its critics than its supporters.
"There's been no groundswell of support for it," he said. "We're probably getting at least a hundred letters a day dealing with triple-decker trucks. That's more of an issue in the district than this civil rights bill."
Indeed, Mr. Lewis acknowledges a broader lack of passion among civil rights advocates. He says he knows it may be naive to expect the drama and passion of Selma and Birmingham. But he says he also knows that civil rights is doomed unless it connects to a mass of people.
"During the 1960's the movement was from the bottom up," he said. "In 1965 it was people from the black belt of Alabama or the Mississippi Delta literally writing the bill with their feet. In 1990 and 1991, it's the professionals, the people within the Beltway, and you need more than that."
To some critics, including some Democrats, who believe the civil rights debate is doing more harm than good, the problem is deeper than tactics and strategy. They say Mr. Lewis represents the degree to which civil rights leaders are fighting old battles with old issues, while the plight of the poor grows ever worse.
"John is truly misguided," said Bob Woodson, a black conservative who heads the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, which has pioneered some of the low-income housing strategies favored by Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp. "People like him continue to press this as the quintessential issue for black Americans today, and it's not; it's really a middle-class access bill."
 
Dr. King's Ability to Change
 Mr. Woodson added: "Martin Luther King is always held up as a model, but no one seems to have emulated King in his ability to change with the times and to regroup and refocus his energies. Remember, King died helping those garbage workers in Memphis. Martin Luther King would not have been hung up on civil rights today."
Mr. Lewis readily agrees that what is needed is not just civil rights legislation, but also a comprehensive program to address the needs of the poor. But he has few specific strategies for revitalizing the movement.
Still, if he does not have a blueprint, Mr. Lewis does have a sense of what is missing in the civil rights debate: a sense of shared purpose, of basic morality, that speaks to blacks and whites alike.
In Memphis this week he spoke of today's environment for civil rights, including Justice Thurgood Marshall's departure from the Supreme Court and the President's nomination of Clarence Thomas, a black conservative hostile to much of the civil rights agenda, to replace him.
"A lot of young people who came to Mississippi or Selma or the Freedom Rides thought you could come for a summer, a semester, a year, and create something new," Mr. Lewis said. "But most of us knew this is not a struggle that lasts one day or one week or one month or one lifetime."

HEADLINE: Bond Prices Depressed By Job Data

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury notes and bonds plunged and interest rates soared yesterday as the fixed-income market reacted negatively to indications of growing economic strength in an otherwise mixed Government report on employment in June.
The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell more than three-quarters of a point, or close to $8 per $1,000 face value, pushing its yield up to almost 8.5 percent. 
 Any hint of economic improvement is generally taken badly by bondholders and investors in other fixed-income securities because increasing strength raises fears of inflation and higher interest rates. Both erode the value of existing fixed-interest securities.
 
 Gains in Hours and Wages

The Government said the nation's unemployment rate rose to 7 percent in June, from 6.9 percent, as 50,000 non-farm jobs were lost last month. But it also revised growth in May payroll jobs to a gain of 119,000, up from 59,000 originally reported. And it reported gains in both the number of hours worked by employees and wages paid to them. When employers find business improving but are still unconvinced that a recession is coming to an end, they often prefer to pay for overtime rather than hire new workers.
"While the overall numbers were more or less neutral, the bond market chose to focs on the numbers of hours worked and wages paid last month and the bond market did not like what it saw," said William V. Sullivan Jr., senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds.
Mr. Sullivan said that two other lesser but significant factors also weighed on the bond market. One was a shortened trading session. The Treasury securities market, which normally does not observe fixed trading hours, closed at 2 P. M., Eastern time, to enable traders and their staffs to have a longer Fourth of July weekend. A shortened session tends to reduce the number of market participants, and this, in turn, often causes wider gaps in quotes and thus exaggerates price movements.
"We will have to wait until early next week to really see how hard the market is taking the employment data," Mr. Sullivan said.
 
More Than $30 Billion
 The other factor is the impending increase in the supply of Treasury paper scheduled for auction in the next few weeks. Not only will the auctions of roughly $42 billion of seven-, five- and two-year notes and one-year bills add to the supply of Treasury debt issues, but the market also faces the Treasury's quarterly refunding auctions the first week in August. The refunding should increase the supply of Treasury notes and bonds by more than $30 billion.
At yesterday's early close, the Treasury's benchmark long bonds, the 8 1/8 percent issue maturing in May 2021, were offered at 96 2/32, down 26/32, while the yield climbed to 8.49 percent, from 8.41 percent the day before and 8.40 percent at the end of last week.
On the Chicago Board of Trade's Treasury bond futures market, the spot September delivery closed down 30/32, at 92 25/32. Brokers there said traders were also influenced by the pockets of strength in the jobs data.
Treasury note prices were also battered. The 8's of 2001 dropped 19/32, to 97 26/32, for a yield of 8.32 percent; the 7 7/8's of 1996 lost 10/32, at 99 17/32, for a yield of 7.99 percent, and the 7's of 1993 fell 3/32, to 99 31/32, for a yield of 7.01 percent.
On Wednesday, the Treasury plans to hold its quarterly auction of seven-year notes. The amount to be sold is $9 billion. The notes traded yesterday on a when-issued basis to yield 8.21 percent. Terms of the regular monthly auctions of two- and five-year notes will be announced the next week.
At the short end of the Treasury market, the discount rate on the 90-day bills rose 2 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 5.58 percent. Six-month bills rose 3 basis points, to 5.71 percent. One-year bills rose 2 basis points, to 6.02 percent.
The Federal Reserve did not intervene in the market. The key funds rate that banks charge each other for temporary loans traded at 5 5/8 percent most of the day, and the Fed's perceived target for the rate, from which most other interest rates are scaled upward, is 5 3/4 percent.

HEADLINE: In New South, Old Crop Makes a Comeback

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: COTTONPORT, La., June 26

 BODY:
After the last farmers stopped growing it in the early 1970's, a lot of people never expected cotton to return to Cottonport.
But when Filmore Bordelon 3d resumed growing the crop that gave this town its name, he was taking part in a quiet revolution over the last few years that resonates with the enduring mythology of the South and irrevocable evidence of change. 
 The mythic element is the return of King Cotton to hundreds of Southern farming communities from Cottonport to Snow Hill, N.C., that abandoned it decades ago. In dollar value, the $5 billion cotton crop last year was the country's largest in history.
But cotton is returning to a changed world of declining rural areas where it is harvested not by slaves or sharecroppers but by expensive machines that often are run by crews of Hispanic migrant workers. And its resurgence means more to the few mechanized farms big enough to grow it -- with fewer employees -- than it does to the declining small town, which once lived or died with cotton.
Few miss the harsh economics of the day when cotton was king, but its return is a reminder that nothing has replaced it as an employer -- particularly as an employer of large numbers of rural blacks -- in much of the South.
"The revival of cotton in the South is not going to bring back the small towns," said Charles S. Aiken, a professor of geography at the University of Tennessee, who has studied cotton's decline. "You can go to the areas where cotton is still viable, and most of the towns are losing population and businesses are still going out."
For Mr. Bordelon, whose grandfather grew cotton on the family's "Old Boy" plantation at the beginning of the century and whose grandmother may have been one of the last growers to farm cotton with mules and hand hoes, the crop's resurgence is first and foremost an economic decision. But it is a sentimental one as well.
"Sure it's nostalgic," said Mr. Bordelon, 35 years old, who farms the rich Red River alluvial soil in central Louisiana, about 80 miles northwest of Baton Rouge. "I was the first one to grow cotton in Cottonport in maybe 20 years last year," he said. "You had people coming by to watch us pick it, people showing their grandkids how they used to pick some cotton themselves. That may not mean much to people in the city, but it does to me."
 
Cotton as a Way of Life
 For most of its history in the South, cotton has been more than a crop. It has been, for better or worse, a way of life.
Cotton provided the underpinnings for slavery before the Civil War and for sharecropping after it. When cotton picking was mechanized after World War II, the change led to the migration of Southern blacks to the North that changed both regions forever.
Cotton, of course, never disappeared from the South. For years, Texas has been the largest cotton producer, followed by California. Total production in the United States last year was 15.5 million bales, up 27 percent over the previous year. In 1937, the peak year for cotton production, 18.9 million bales were produced.
In parts of the South, including northern Louisiana and the Mississippi Delta, cotton never relinquished its role as the backbone of the farming economy, and it played some part in the economies of most Southern states.
But in the late 1930's, low prices, infestations of pests like the boll weevil, competition from artificial fibers and high production costs relegated cotton to a marginal status in many parts of the South and wiped it out in others.
Despite fluctuations over the years, cotton production continued on a downward trend that accelerated in the 1970's when many farmers deserted cotton for soybeans, corn and wheat -- plants that were less evocative for the South but more profitable. In the 1960's and 1970's, cotton production in the South, from Arkansas and Louisiana to Florida and Virginia, declined by half.
 
Popularity Helps Comeback
 But in more recent years, cotton production has surged, spurred by higher prices, a resurgence in popularity, as opposed to synthetic fibers, and advances in pest eradication as well as Government farm policies that have helped cotton farmers. And while the production of cotton in California has been slowed by water shortages, it has seen a sharp comeback in the South.
From 1983 to 1990, acreage devoted to cotton growing in five southeastern states increased to 1.1 million acres from 481,000. In five mid-South states, it grew to 3.5 million acres from 1.7 million.
In Louisiana, where the acres devoted to cotton fell to a low of 300,000 from a peak of 1.1 million, cotton acreage is back up to 770,000.
 
New Gins Are Sign of Resurgence
 Cottonport began as just that, a cotton port visited by paddle-wheelers that came down the Mississippi to what was then a flooded bayou. But cotton production had generally died out in the area by the early 1970's and all the old cotton gins were closed.
In the last few years, though, cotton acreage in Avoyelles Parish jumped to about 14,000 acres from a few thousand. The number of acres would have risen to 20,000 this year, but unrelenting rains held down the crop. More important, two gins are going up -- signs of a commitment to the crop.
"We're probably the only area in America that has two brand new gins being constructed," Mr. Bordelon said. "All people have talked about for the last 18 months is planting cotton."
Cotton's legacy for the South has always been a mixed one. It produced the wealth that built the South, providing much of the economic and cultural coherence that gave rise to the Confederacy. But cotton's rise, predicated on cheap labor, created not just a dependence on slavery, but a history of economic and political domination by a few large planters.
 
Small Farmers Paid Dearly
 Over time, many small independent farmers paid dearly for their flirtation with cotton.
"The great ideal of the yeoman farmer, the Jeffersonian ideal, is that you're independent farmers; you grow what you need and you rely on yourself," said Charles Reagan Wilson, a professor of history and Southern studies at the University of Mississippi. "When the plain folk started losing that independence was when they turned to cotton, because it made them dependent on the world market price. It seemed at first an easy way to make easy profits, but, in effect, it was kind of a seduction, and increasingly, they lost their land."
Any profitable crop will have some benefits for the rural South, and cotton may still provide more than most crops will.
"It doesn't take a lot of people to grow soybeans or wheat and harvest it," said J. Walker Clarke, a cotton merchant in Columbia, S.C. "Cotton spreads into the community better because you have cotton gins that have to be put up and run. You have cotton storage facilities. You have trucking. You have merchants, such as myself."
 
Big Farm Operations Required
 But the effects on the communities now do not approach what they once were. Because of the high costs of chemicals and machinery, like a $100,000 cotton picker, there are no small cotton farmers. And because of mechanization, cotton no longer provides nearly as many jobs.
Mr. Bordelon's house is decorated with colorful folk-art plantation scenes of blacks working in cotton fields. But most of the contract workers who run the cotton pickers or work at the gins in the fall harvest season are Mexican-Americans and aliens who work with crews that come from Texas.
"Cotton doesn't provide the jobs it used to, and nothing has replaced it," said Carlos Smith, the local extension agent here. "But then I don't think most people miss those kind of jobs. I certainly don't."
Cotton will always have its cycles, and some experts like Professor Aiken are skeptical about how long-lived and significant cotton's comeback will be. But some industry figures say the popularity of natural fibers bodes well for cotton's long-term prospects.
"Until they change the name of polyester, it's going to be a bad word," said Mr. Clarke, the South Carolina cotton merchant.
Still, economists agree cotton will never be king in the South the way it was in the past.
"Now growing cotton is an economic decision; it's not tied in with all the other social and cultural factors," said Professor Wilson. "When the market is bad, farmers will give up cotton, where in the past that didn't happen. Cotton is not going to energize the rural areas. We've already abandoned them to a large degree."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off in Quiet Trading After Unemployment Report

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar closed lower in quiet trading yesterday as dealers digested the latest Government report on jobs.
The Labor Department report showed unemployment in June climbing to 7.0 percent but also included indications of economic strength. As such, it carried mixed implications for the dollar, and "after the numbers, the dollar was just sold out," said Joe Cambria, foreign exchange manager for Banque Paribas. 
 The dollar also fell under pressure by traders squaring their books ahead of the weekend. The United States market was closed Thursday for the Fourth of July holiday.
The dollar ended at 1.8250 German marks, down from 1.8343 marks on Thursday in Europe and 1.8286 marks on Wednesday in New York. It closed at 138.35 Japanese yen, down from 139.15 on Thursday in Europe and 139.58 on Wednesday in New York.
The dollar initially fell because of employment statistics that showed June non-farm payrolls fell by 50,000, compared with economists' average forecast of an 11,000 gain.
But May payrolls were revised to a rise of 119,000 from a previously reported increase of 59,000. In addition, the statistics said hourly earnings and hours worked rose in June.
Dealers said market sentiment remained cautiously bullish toward the dollar after the data, but some said they were skeptical about a sharp rebound in the United States.
"I think it will be a long and slow recovery," said Kevin Weir, vice president of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in New York.
Sales of yen for marks also helped push the dollar lower against the German currency, traders said. Traders said the dollar was likely to test higher levels against the mark next week, but they did not anticipate huge gains for the United States currency.
The turmoil in Yugoslavia also improved sentiment for the dollar against the mark, said Belal Khan, a corporate dealer for Fuji Bank. Slovenia freed Yugoslav Army prisoners under a truce yesterday and said it had demobilized thousands of its own troops. The European Community agreed to send ministers back to Yugoslavia to reactivate a peace mission.
The British pound closed at $1.6155, up from $1.6030 on Thursday in London and 1.6070 on Wednesday in New York. The dollar ended at 1.5745 Swiss francs, down from 1.5825 on Thursday in Europe and 1.5793 on Wednesday in New York.
Precious metals futures were not traded yesterday on the Commodity Exchange in New York in an extension of the Fourth of July holiday.

HEADLINE: Federal Express in Pact To Buy Jets From Airbus

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: MEMPHIS, July 5

 BODY:
The Federal Express Corporation announced today that it would buy up to 75 wide-body cargo jets from Europe's Airbus Industrie consortium in a deal that could be worth as much as $6 billion.
The package-delivery company said the new planes, to be delivered at a rate of six per year, will have 40 percent greater capacity than the current Boeing 727s that dominate its 416-plane fleet. 
 In addition, the Airbus jets can be flown by two pilots, compared with three for the Boeings, analysts said.
Federal Express said it placed 25 firm orders for Airbus Industrie A300-600 aircraft, 25 reconfirmable orders subject to cancellation and options for an additional 25 planes.
Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but industry sources, noting that the Airbus planes cost about $80 million each, said the order would be worth $6 billion if all options were exercised.
The announcement of a deal had been expected since last month, when Federal Express said during the Paris Air Show that it was negotiating with the European manufacturer, a consortium of Aerospatiale of France, British Aerospace P.L.C., Daimler Benz AG's Deutsche Airbus and CASA of Spain.
The order was the first for Airbus's A-300 wide-body jet to be built in a freighter configuration. Earlier versions have been passenger planes that were later converted for use as freighters.
Federal Express said the planes will be powered by CF6-80C2 engines made by the General Electric Company. Deliveries are scheduled to begin in early 1994.
The planes will be used on United States domestic routes, the company said.
Craig Kloner, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs, said that Federal Express's focus in the last several years has been on international growth, noting that the planes on order have the potential to fly international routes as well.
The Boeing Company and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation have complained that state subsidies to Airbus have given the consortium an unfair advantage in the highly competitive market for new aircraft. American and European Community officials have been negotiating the dispute.
Spokesmen for Boeing and McDonnell Douglas said they had not competed for Federal Express's freighter aircraft orders.
"We do not have a freighter model with the specifications that Fedex requested," a Boeing spokesman said. A spokesman at McDonnell Douglas's Long Beach, Calif. division said the company was not participating in the competition.
Federal Express shares closed up 87.5 cents at $40.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Tourist in Car Killed as She Chances Upon Chinatown Gunfight

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
It was a reunion that drew Rhona Lantin to the New York area, a chance to mix with old high school friends from the Philippines, trade memories, catch up on too many years apart. It was also a chance to see the town, take in the theater, watch the fireworks explode over New York Harbor on a warm, beautiful night -- the best kind of things the area has to offer.
But a bullet ended that. It just happened. At 11:30 P.M. Thursday, as Ms. Lantin and friends were driving north on a Chinatown street, headed for a late-night snack after the mammoth fireworks display, members of a notorious Chinatown gang, the Ghost Shadows, began to fight, the police say. 
 By the time the car reached the crowded intersection, the dispute had become a gun battle. Gunfire erupted and a bullet hit Ms. Lantin, sitting in the passenger seat, in the head. She died yesterday morning at 8:53 at St. Vincent's Hospital.
Yesterday, friends of Ms. Lantin were left to contemplate the fate that linked their 26-year-old friend, a Government economist known for her gentleness, her devotion to her family and her fondness for Filipino handicrafts, to the brutality of a Chinatown gunfight.
"When tragedy strikes, you always hear people say, 'It couldn't have happened to a nicer, gentler person,' " said Hallis Seitz, a neighbor of Ms. Lantin's in Silver Spring, Md. "Well, in this case it really does apply."
The randomness of the shooting was unusual for Chinatown, where violent gangs like the Ghost Shadows usually choose their victims carefully, then stalk them on foot on narrow, winding streets that are almost always congested. The killers are usually precise, walking up to the targets and striking them at close range.
But the police were at a loss yesterday to explain what led to the chance killing of Ms. Lantin at the intersection of Mulberry and Bayard Streets, in the part of Chinatown that the Ghost Shadows call their turf. The police say the gang terrorizes storeowners and people in the neighborhood through extortion, robbery and a constant threat of violence.
There were no suspects last night. Chief Joseph G. DeMartino said he did not know what the dispute was about.
"We've been talking to people in the Chinese community about this," he said.
This was a particularly happy time for Ms. Lantin, who as an economist studied environmental and natural resources for the Department of Agriculture in Washington. She had traveled to a friend's home in Jersey City for a reunion of alumni of the Rural High School at the University of the Philippines in Los Banos. On Sunday, friends say, she was to return home to Maryland and then fly out to join her fiance, who had already started on a cross-country pleasure trip. They were to be married next spring.
Mr. Seitz said Ms. Lantin had met her fiance, 29-year-old Patrick Canning, two years ago at the University of Maryland, where they were doing graduate work. Mr. Canning had recently moved to Maryland from a rough neighborhood on 14th Street in Washington because Ms. Lantin was afraid of being shot there, Mr. Seitz said.
Ms. Lantin lived with her twin cousins, two women in their early 20's, on the third floor of a condominium complex, the brown-brick Americana Finnmark in Silver Spring.
"She was absolutely nice," Mr. Seitz said. "She was a really intelligent girl, really smart. She was a devout Catholic. Her family was a really close family. They did a lot of stuff together, like have barbeques and gatherings."
"It's just tragic," Mr. Seitz said. "It doesn't make any sense. She was just at the wrong place at the time, I guess."
A family friend, Tom Schruben, said that although she was born in the United States, Ms. Lantin had lived much of her life in the Philippines and had returned to this country only in 1987. In choosing the field of agricultural economics, she was following the footsteps of her parents, both of whom were agricultural researchers in the Philippines, where they still live.
 
'Always Wore a Smile'
 Mr. Schruben described Ms. Lantin as a woman who "always wore a smile."
"She was always making traditional Filipino handicrafts," he said. "She made dolls and baskets and was always knitting."
On Thursday night, she joined five of her classmates at Liberty State Park in Jersey City, where they watched a fireworks display, Chief DeMartino said. All six of the friends then piled into a friend's 1991 Ford Explorer and headed for Chinatown, the chief said.
The police believe that at 11:30 P.M., as the car passed through the intersection, one member of the Ghost Shadows pulled out a gun and fired at least two shots at several other gang members. Though the shots missed their targets, one bullet pierced the front passenger window on the right side of the car and struck Ms. Lantin in the head, Chief DeMartino said.
The driver, seeing Ms. Lantin slump forward, steered the car onto Canal Street and called the police. No one else in the car was injured, Chief DeMartino said.
 
No One Arrested
 None of the suspects in the shooting had been identified or arrested yesterday, Chief DeMartino said. Detectives were canvassing Chinatown but no witnesses had come forward, he said.
Though the police have questioned some members of the Ghost Shadows, witnesses had fled from the intersection by the time the police arrived late Thursday evening, Chief DeMartino said.
In the past, it has been nearly impossible to persuade Chinese witnesses to testify in court against the gangs, law-enforcement officials have said.
Chinatown has increasingly become a hotbed of gang warfare as its neighborhoods have continued to swell with Chinese and Southeast Asian immigrants, law-enforcement officials say.
Members of the Ghost Shadows, who often congregate on Mulberry, Bayard and Mott Streets, have been routinely linked to a number of crimes in the area, including extortion, robbery, the protection of illegal gambling establishments and the sale of fireworks, Chief DeMartino said. It was not known if the dispute on Thursday evening had any connection to the sale of fireworks, he said.
"They're just another Chinese gang," Sgt. Michael Wagner, who has spent more than five years monitoring Asian gangs, said of the Ghost Shadows. "They do the same things as other gangs."
The authorities have had some success prosecuting the Ghost Shadows. Five years ago, the Federal attorney's office overcame a lack of witnesses by using the flexible Federal racketeering conspiracy laws to convict 21 of the gang's members.

International
Financial regulators in seven countries seized control of a private banking empire rooted in the Middle East whose network includes 69 countries and two American banks. The seizure of Bank of Credit and Commerce Group, whose $20 billion in assets were regulated chiefly in Europe, came after what the Bank of England described as "widespread fraud" over a period of years. None of the alleged fraud affects the American banks controlled by B.C.C.I. [Page 1.] When the financial regulators swooped down on the B.C.C.I., they caught a very big bank, but one largely unfamiliar to much of the banking world and its public. [33.]
The Economy 
 The unemployment rate rose to 7 per cent in June, a gain of one-tenth of a point. Private economists as well as the Bureau of Labor Statistics tended to dismiss the rise in the unemployment rate as both unsurprising and, because the change was less than two- tenths of a point, statistically insignificant. There was a decline of 50,000 in payroll jobs, when a modest increase was widely antici pated. Factory jobs were down 59,000 but service industry jobs rose by 69,000. [1.]
The strength in the high-risk "junk bond" market in the last quarter spread into tax-free funds, with the high-yield municipal bond funds outperforming the general municipal bond funds for the three months ended June 30. [33.]
President Bush authorized a large increase in this year's peanut import quota. The limit has been raised to 100 million pounds of peanuts, up from 1.7 million. [9.]
New York City's assessors are not accurately measuring the market value of homes, a study shows. [1.]

Lewis Galoob Toys said it had been told by a Federal judge that a district court had ruled in its favor in a copyright-infringement case brought by Nintendo of America to prevent the sale of the Galoob product Game Genie. [35.]
 Delta Air Lines has made an offer for parts of Pan American World Airways Inc., offering to buy a package including the Northeast shuttle, the carrier's trans-Atlantic routes and 45 planes. [35.]
Federal Express has ordered up to 75 wide-body cargo jets from Airbus Industrie, the European aerospace consortium. [35.]
Southeast Banking has held talks with several parties about a merger or capital infusion with some Federal assistance. [36.]
 
 Markets
Prices of Treasury notes and bonds plunged and interest rates soared as the fixed-income market reacted negatively to indications of growing economic strength in the otherwise mixed Government report on employment in June. [33.]
Stocks turned mixed and activity sank to the lowest level of the year as hundreds of traders stayed home for a long Fourth of July weekend. The Dow fell to 2,932.47, down 2.23 for the day but ahead 25.72 for the week. [37.]
The dollar closed lower in quiet trading as dealers digested the latest Government employment report. [41.]
Prices of corn and soybean futures ended sharply lower after forecasts called for mostly wet weather in key growing regions. Prices of wheat futures also plummeted. [41.]

A new I.R.S. regulation will benefit people who work late-night jobs. Now employees will have to report only $1.50 for car service not the actual value, as taxable income. Your Money. [34.]

HEADLINE: Workers Protesting Budget Delays Rally in Pennsylvania and Maine

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Angered by the failure of state leaders to adopt budgets on time, workers in Pennsylvania and Maine held rallies at their state capitols yesterday to demand quick action.
In Pennsylvania, where workers did not receive their regular paychecks yesterday, more than 100 protesters stood on the stairway of the Capitol rotunda holding union banners, chanting "Paycheck! Paycheck!" and waving signs. 
 In Augusta, Me., an estimated 600 state workers and their supporters rallied on the Statehouse steps to urge an end to the budget impasse that has halted the government since Monday.
Budget negotiations also continued in Illinois, while California lawmakers took a break for the holiday weekend before making a renewed attempt to balance the state's $55 billion budget. Gov. Pete Wilson of California has given lawmakers an extra 12 days to approve additional taxes or find more cuts to close a budget gap of $2.5 billion. Because the state has enough money to operate until July 15, the next payday for state workers, state services have not yet been affected.
In Pennsylvania, Fred Davis, a public employees' union leader said at the rally outside the Capitol in Harrisburg, "We want a budget and we want our paychecks."
More than 10,000 Pennsylvania state workers, or about 9 percent of the state's employees, did not get paychecks because lawmakers failed to meet the June 30 budget deadline. Legislators planned no further negotiations until Sunday. The 10,000 employees did not receive paychecks because of a change in the state's payroll system several years ago which lengthened the lag in issuing paychecks.
In Maine, demonstrators sang, chanted and carried signs with messages like "End the lockout," "We want a budget" and "Free the Maine 10,000."
"It's the first time in the 171-year history of Maine that any governor has had the heartless audacity to shut down the state in order to pander to the interests of the rich and powerful," John J. Sweeney, a union leader, said.
The Legislature continued efforts to balance the state's $3.2 billion, two-year budget.
 
State Liquor Stores Close
 The partial government shutdown ordered by Gov. John R. McKernan Jr. has forced the closing of state parks and liquor stores and delayed the mailing of unemployment benefit checks.
The closing of state liquor stores has been a boon for private liquor sellers but is beginning to hurt restaurants, which must buy liquor from state stores.
In Illinois, the Senate President, Philip Rock, a Democrat, accused Gov. Jim Edgar, a Republican, of stalling budget negotiations, and said Democrats were prepared to seek a vote on their own version of the budget. But he acknowledged that Democrats might not be able to muster the three-fifths majority needed for passage.

HEADLINE: Transportation on the High Road

 BODY:
"We have poured enough concrete," says Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. The New York Democrat deserves much credit for the innovative transportation bill the Senate adopted last month by a resounding 91 to 8. After 35 years of focusing Federal aid on interstate highways, the Senate offers clear and welcome new directions.
President Bush calls the bill too costly, which it may be, and he still clings to old priorities; he advocates more for highways and less for mass transit. The House hasn't acted yet, but seems to be headed along the Senate's sensible course -- except for a not-so-sensible hike in the gas tax. 
 The Senate bill's main virtues are a new emphasis on improving the efficiency of highways, bridges and bus and subway systems already in place, and new flexibility in letting states decide how to spend Federal money. Broadly supported by rural as well as urban states, the bill also gives big metropolitan areas more power over the money. That's overdue recognition that clogged city and suburban arteries impede the national economy; they're not just local headaches.
In contrast, the Administration's proposals were routine, stressing money for new construction and aid formulas that favor road-building. Its bill gives less flexibility to the states and provides no money at all for mass-transit operating costs.
Mr. Bush objects to the Senate's 80/20 aid formula -- $80 for every $20 the states put up. But his formulas were absurd. Defying public concern about the environment and fuel consumption, he would have allocated money on the basis of how much gas a state's drivers guzzled, and would have aided roads more generously than transit systems.
The House Public Works Committee is shaping a bill of its own. It would cost even more than the Senate's bill but, like it, puts new emphasis on mass transit and flexibility. The package, to be introduced soon, includes a 5-cent hike in the Federal gas tax. Given its members' diligence in ladling gravy to constituents, the House's public-works bills tend to be overstuffed with dubious "demonstration projects." More revenue from a higher gas tax would surely lead to more overstuffing.
With constraints on spending, and resistance to higher taxes, this is no time for mandated waste. Rather, it is time to rethink Federal transportation policy. The Senate bill does so, with admirable intelligence and veto-proof, bipartisan conviction.

HEADLINE: To Curb China's Arms Trade

 BODY:
Despite pledges to curb sales of advanced arms, China now confirms it has begun delivering new missiles to Pakistan. And it's about to ship others to Syria. Understandably, the news fuels Congressional fervor to deny China trade privileges. A Democratic-sponsored bill would cancel China's most-favored-nation trade status for making such sales.
But economic sanctions have failed to restrain Chinese arms merchants in the past. A new strategy combining carrot and stick might be worth a try -- provided the Bush Administration is willing to curb its own arms sales. 
 In a depressing ritual, the U.S. gets assurances from China that it won't sell advanced arms and then learns that it has. The gap between word and deed stems from internal divisions in China. The assurances that arms won't be sold come from the Foreign and Defense Ministries, as a timely article in International Security by John W. Lewis, Hua Di and Xue Litai at Stanford's Center for International Security and Arms Control explains. But the sales are made by an army commission that has considerable autonomy and substantial inducement to sell as much as it can.
As China's leader, Deng Xiaoping, accelerated modernization in the 1980's, the commission became China's engine for technological development. It's as if the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ran the Manhattan Project, NASA, the National Science Foundation and Silicon Valley combined.
At the same time Mr. Deng slashed the military budget. That led the commission to promote sales in order to raise revenues and import advanced technology. Administrators of its two main arms export firms, who stand to profit personally from sales, have family ties to China's leaders.
One of those firms signed a contract in 1988 to sell medium-range M-9 missiles to Syria and has received some proceeds, but has yet to deliver any missiles. And it sent "a very small number" of shorter-range M-11 missiles to Pakistan.
The deals can still be killed. But discriminating against China's trade with the U.S. might spur its arms sales. And sanctions, by denying contact and technology, come down hardest on the modernizers who back liberalization and opposed the Tiananmen crackdown. A threat of sanctions may be more effective than their actual imposition.
A different strategy is worth a try -- cooperating with China in arms suppliers' groups while holding out a threat of trade sanctions by the U.S., Japan and other nations that want the missile sales curbed. Beijing has now told Washington it may join the 16-nation Missile Technology Control Regime, which seeks to halt the spread of medium-range missiles. And the world's five leading arms suppliers, China included, will meet soon in Paris to draw up guidelines for Mideast arms sales. China can be pressed in these forums to curb its sales -- but is not likely to comply unless the Bush Administration shows some sales restraint of its own.
Congress could facilitate that by renewing most-favored-nation status for one year, requiring Mr. Bush to report within the year on China's arms sales practices and imposing its own temporary moratorium on U.S. sales by year's end if Mr. Bush fails to exercise restraint.

HEADLINE: New & Noteworthy

BYLINE: By GEORGE JOHNSON

 BODY:
GET SHORTY, by Elmore Leonard. (Dell, $5.99.) Forced out of the loan-sharking business, a Miami hoodlum moves to Hollywood, where he finds himself feeling perfectly at home in his new job in the film industry. Last year our reviewer, Nora Ephron, praised this novel for its "great, punchy, pitch-perfect Elmore Leonard dialogue and great Elmore Leonard sentences, long looping twisting strings of words that turn around and back up and go the other way, managing somehow (but how?) to avoid all the accouterments of punctuation like colons, semicolons and parentheses."
A MIDWIFE'S TALE: The Life of Martha Ballard, Based on Her Diary, 1785-1812, by Laurel Thatcher Ulrich. (Vintage, $13.) Reconstructed from town records and elliptical, sometimes incoherent journal entries, this book tells about the people of Hallowell, Me., from the viewpoint of a woman who delivered as many as 50 babies a year. "Thanks to Mrs. Ulrich's imaginative talent, Martha Ballard's diary becomes a major source through which we can vicariously experience the rural life of early New England and reimagine the character of men's and women's economic and family existence," Carl N. Degler said in The Book Review last year. "Laurel Thatcher Ulrich wears her learning lightly and her prose sings." The book won the Bancroft Prize and the Pulitzer Prize. 
 ONLY BEGOTTEN DAUGHTER, by James Morrow. (Ace, $4.50.) In Atlantic City, Christ makes a second coming in the form of a girl named Julie, the daughter of a lighthouse keeper who supports himself by donating to a sperm bank. Last year our reviewer, Jack Butler, called the novel "a rich, intelligent tour de force."
AN UNCERTAIN HOUR: The French, the Germans, the Jews, the Klaus Barbie Trial, and the City of Lyon, 1940-1945, by Ted Morgan. (Arbor House/Morrow, $13.) Interweaving the story of Klaus Barbie, the "butcher of Lyons," with family reminiscences, a French-born journalist reflects on the bravery and the cowardice his compatriots showed in World War II. "This eloquent book of personal and public history is a dreamlike and, alas, at times also nightmarish account," Patrice Higonnet said here in 1989.
THE BODY AND ITS DANGERS: And Other Stories, by Allen Barnett. (St. Martin's, $8.95.) When these short stories, some about people with AIDS, were published in 1990 our reviewer, Meg Wolitzer, said Allen Barnett portrays his characters' "awareness of fragility with such candor and melancholy that they almost seem to be holding their own hearts in their hands."
DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT HISTORY: Everything You Need to Know About American History but Never Learned, by Kenneth C. Davis. (Avon, $10.95.) This crash course shows that Kenneth C. Davis is "a diligent researcher whose prose is light on the eyes," James M. Cornelius said here last year.
SWEET TALK, by Stephanie Vaughn. (Penguin, $7.95.) One night, while they're all cooking dinner, a woman discovers that her husband is the father of her best friend's unborn child. Last year our reviewer, Joseph Olshan, said the writing in this and Stephanie Vaughn's other short stories is "pure and elegiac, as though it were piped in directly from the soul."
THE LIFE AND DEATH OF A DRUID PRINCE: The Story of Lindow Man, an Archaeological Sensation, by Anne Ross and Don Robins. (Touchtone/Simon & Schuster, $10.95.) A historian and a chemist join forces to reconstruct the life of Lindow Man, the 2,000-year-old druid whose body was found in an English peat bog. Last year our reviewer, Malcolm W. Browne, called this "a plausible speculative history. . . . Right or wrong, it is a story that satisfies."
THE TONGUES OF ANGELS, by Reynolds Price. (Ballantine, $4.95.) Looking back 34 years to when he was an art counselor at a camp in the Smoky Mountains, a painter blames himself for the death of one of his charges. Last year our reviewer, Paul West, called this a "chastely visionary novel."
EXPATS: Travels in Arabia, From Tripoli to Teheran, by Christopher Dickey. (Atlantic Monthly, $9.95.) A journalist finds that foreign entrepreneurs have lent corners of the Arab desert the bizarre ambience of a shopping mall. "In his engaging book, laced with humor, pathos and sensitivity, Mr. Dickey unveils this new Arabia, shaped by the sometimes creative, always skeptical, tension between the Arab and the expatriate," Sandra Mackey said in The Book Review in 1990.
FLOATING IN MY MOTHER'S PALM, by Ursula Hegi. (Vintage Contemporaries, $9.) This novel about a girl growing up in the 1950's on the banks of the Rhine "is wholly convincing . . . absolutely successful and a delight," our reviewer, Edward Hoagland, said last year.
THE UNIVERSITY: An Owner's Manual, by Henry Rosovsky. (Norton, $10.95.) A former Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard tells how to play academic politics. "This is the real skinny," Linda Bradley Salamon said in The Book Review last year. The book is "the work of a scholar (the footnotes alone are a delight and the index looks like an arcane academic joke), a wit and an economist."

HEADLINE: CLASSICAL VIEW;
Dicey Times In Moscow And Berlin

BYLINE: By John Rockwell

 BODY:
Contrary to popular conviction, most critics prefer celebration to condemnation. So it was disappointing to confront two legendary European musical institutions, the Berlin Philharmonic early last month at Carnegie Hall and the Bolshoi Opera over the last two weeks at the Metropolitan Opera, and find them suffering through perilous transitions.
Both the Berliners and the Bolshoi came here with big reputations honorably earned, and both were marketed with a panache reminiscent of the late Sol Hurok's, with ticket prices to match (a $135 top for the Bolshoi). When people pay top ruble, they not only expect to have a good time, they resent being told they shouldn't have had one. 
 The Bolshoi's troubles seem more dangerous than those of the Berliners, who just need stability to insure their future as the gleaming orchestral symbol of the new Germany's new capital. The Bolshoi mirrors almost eerily the current crises in the Soviet Union itself.
Like the nation it so grandly represents, the Moscow company seeks to slough off old ways but seems unsure about the proper path to modernization. It wants to borrow from the West, but not at the expense of the best Russian and Soviet tradition. In short, it's confused, and at least the first two productions of its New York stand, which ended last night, exposed that confusion all too well. (There will be further dates this week at Wolf Trap, near Washington.)
Until recently, the Bolshoi looked like a curious throwback to 19th-century practice. Before recordings and fast international travel, each country's operatic style reflected its national attributes. Most Russian singers couldn't be expected to sing German or French or Italian roles, at least in those languages, but they did sing Russian opera more idiomatically than anyone else.
They still can, and one reason is that for all its modernist ideology, Communism prized old-fashioned aristocratic and bourgeois opera as a symbol of its commitment to the arts. With political restrictions and economic disparity blocking free interchange between East and West, the Bolshoi remained a haven for Russian style and talent.
But an increasingly moribund, enervated haven. The stale repertory, the plodding literalism of the productions and the ludicrous infrequency with which star singers and dancers were parceled out all bespoke a tradition in dire need of revitalization.
The current Bolshoi leadership, although it contains some veterans, has been in place for only three years. All three productions seen here were the work of Aleksandr Lazarev, the company's artistic director and chief conductor; Boris Pokrovsky, director, and Valery Levental, designer. Their stagings of Tchaikovsky's "Yevgeny Onegin" and Rimsky-Korsakov's "Mlada" (the third was of Tchaikovsky's "Maid of Orleans") showed them eager to break with dogged realism. But they also revealed a disregard for basic practicalities (the "Onegin" set that banished the chorus and a gratuitous instrumental ensemble backstage, requiring tinny amplification), a yearning for change for change's sake (Tatyana and Olga's offstage duet sung onstage) and a muddled lack of faith in the works they revived ("Mlada" as vaudeville instead of mythic spectacle).
The quality of the Bolshoi chorus and orchestra remains high, although Mr. Lazarev's absence during the first week left the conducting in presumably weaker hands. No one sounded as authoritative as Yuri Simonov did during the company's last New York appearance in 1975.
Vocally, the opening-night "Onegin" revealed a brightly penetrating young soprano in Nina Rautio and a handsome if bland baritone in Vladimir Redkin. But the squalling top notes of the company's leading soprano, Makvala Kasrashvili, were a trial in "Mlada," and except for the veteran Yevgeny Nesterenko in "Onegin," there was little of the grand sonority that once seemed to define Russian male singing.
In Berlin, the problem is less political and economic than personal and institutional. The Berlin Philharmonic long ago joined the ranks of top international orchestras, forswearing most of its specifically central European attributes but gaining a sumptuous polish. Herbert von Karajan's performances, especially late in life, were often criticized for substituting surface sheen for expressive depth (except in his always magisterial Bruckner). But my, did that surface shine!
It didn't last month. That may have been partly because Bernard Haitink, the conductor for these performances, sometimes favors stolid musical discourse over tonal beauty. But the indifferent music-making also suggested that this great ensemble is essentially rudderless: Karajan withdrew from Philharmonic affairs a decade ago, and Claudio Abbado, the new chief conductor, can still give the orchestra only limited time.
The Bolshoi's problems run deeper. Quite apart from the taste and talent of its current leadership, the company seems torn between ossified Eastern tradition and Western influences that hold the promise of revitalization at the peril of a leveling of Russian character. And it faces this momentous transition in a time of national unrest and economic privation. May the next Bolshoi visit to these shores come sooner than another 16 years. And may it reveal that this noble institution, along with the nation it epitomizes, has overcome the formidable challenges it now faces.

Nightly News Looks Beyond the Headlines

BYLINE: By Walter Goodman

 BODY:
Under pressure from cable news and local news and in hopes of stemming a ratings erosion, for some time now the main network news programs have been edging away from the day's headlines toward features and themes. That means, to get the disheartening aspect out of the way, that the number of soft stories, particularly about show business, have gone up markedly. In the first half of 1990, according to the Tyndall Report, a newsletter that monitors the evening newscasts, the programs gave an average of 68 minutes a month to arts and entertainment coverage, compared to 38 minutes in 1989 and 1988.
More emphasis on entertainers in a celebrity-saturated medium may not seem strictly necessary, but in their more sober moods, "ABC World News Tonight," "The NBC Nightly News" and "The CBS Evening News" have also been paying more sustained attention to such subjects as the jobless and the homeless, health care and education. To be sure, features on serious matters have long found a place on the tube, but not always in such a sustained way. (CNN is also pitching in, but the networks still have the big audiences.) But those of us who have criticized network news for soft or superficial coverage must welcome any indication of greater seriousness. One week last month offered an unusual opportunity to inspect the sorts of efforts that may signal a new direction for the nightly news. 
 For most of the week of June 17, "World News Tonight" led off with a report on what being poor means these days to children in Ohio. "The NBC Nightly News" carried a five-part series about middle-class America. And "The CBS Evening News" devoted its regular feature, "Eye on America," to such subjects as workers and retirees in danger of losing their pensions, a dispute over whether an 86-year-old woman in a vegetative state should be kept alive and the way tenants in a New York apartment building are helping their neighbors who have AIDS.
"Eye on America" (the title and format seem to owe something to ABC's "American Agenda") consists of nightly segments of about five minutes each on matters of moment. In the batch I monitored, five minutes -- though a sizable allocation by evening news standards -- could not do justice to the issue of political correctness now roiling America's campuses, but they were enough to catch people's feelings in the stories about pensions, AIDS and that comatose woman.
All the segments were well produced, making smart use of pictures to bring out issues and emotions. By following Carol Beck, the principal of Thomas Jefferson High School in Brooklyn, on her tireless patrols of the school's hallways, the camera affirmed what the reporter was saying about her reputation as "an equal-opportunity enforcer." This short-form journalism is of course no substitute for a full-fledged documentary, but in hands as professional as those of the CBS producers, it can explore manageable pieces of significant issues, one this week, another next week, another the week after, steadily broadening the viewer's perspective.
 By contrast, in the weeklong series "Caught in the Middle," NBC took on more than it could chew, much less digest in three-minute segments. The subjects included the economic pains of three families with little in common except "a fear of falling back"; a return to religion; the punishing costs of medical care; the expense inflicted on small business by shoplifters and crooked employees, and a tribute to family values. It was a random agglomeration that told less about the middle class than about the propensities of television news. Each of the subjects might have warranted a program of its own, but as presented here, they were like sideshows in a theme park, aimed more at grabbing an audience than informing it.
 The final segment, a success story, was merely a pass at an upbeat ending, and the piece about small businesses resembled a real-life crime show. The more interesting story on religion was in fact a look at the Second Baptist Church in Houston, which has 18,000 members to whom it offers aerobics, weight lifting, bowling and all manner of support groups as well as more traditional forms of worship. It might have served as an entry point for a sharp look at religion's attractions to young families today, but this try never got much past the starting line.
 The three-minute bites on joblessness and medical care focus on desperate cases: a child whose chronic illness has exhausted the lifetime insurance limit of $500,000 and a family that has to pay almost $500 a month for private insurance because a teen-age son has epilepsy. The program seemed to be competing mainly to up the stakes on the sort of sad stories that have already been heavily treated by television documentaries and discussions and the evening news programs themselves.
"Caught in the Middle" confirmed that a timely subject does not guarantee a fresh or significant report. If NBC News hopes to offer something more than viewers can get from the headlines, it might do better to forgo pretentions to take on all of middle-class angst in less than 15 minutes and concentrate on a slice of the subject it can dig into instead of exploit in passing.
The most ambitious of the week's efforts, ABC's "Children in Crisis," which was timed to coincide with the recent recommendations by the National Commission on Children on ways to help low-income families, did some digging. When Peter Jennings, who stayed at his desk in New York during the war in the Persian Gulf, spends a week in Ohio, and when "World News Tonight" leads off three evenings in a row with a report on a single subject that takes up from a third to a half of the broadcast, the audience is on notice that attention must be paid.
By focusing on the economic tribulations of parents and children in one area, the producers were able to shape a comprehensible and sometimes moving picture. The series reporters, Carol Simpson, Jim Wooten and Chris Bury, took their cameras into trailer homes, day-care centers and hospitals to show the grim legacy of generation after generation with little money, no education and babies being raised by one young parent.
The pictures of premature and underweight infants, of youngsters growing up without a book or adult guidance, of parents who seem unable to manage their own lives, much less those of their children, or who are battling the odds just to scrape by, brought home what Mr. Jennings said is the situation in which 12 million American children are trapped.
In the week following these extended reports, ABC News returned to the subject on its regular "American Agenda" series. It was advocacy journalism in a more explicit form than the networks usually permit themselves, but most viewers are likely to grant that it was justified by the sorry statistics that Mr. Jennings dropped in along the way.
 Strong though the series was, it demonstrated yet again that television is not a particularly good instrument for analysis; recommendations for action and where the money might be found were left vague. And Mr. Jennings's editorial asides tended to take the form of rhetorical gestures to fit every problem: If Washington can save Kuwait, why can't it try to save American children?
Caveats notwithstanding, "Children in Crisis" was an innovative effort to direct the nation's fitful attention and stir its conscience. If "World News Tonight" stays with the subject, and goes on to address other troubling conditions with comparable time and resources, it could be showing the way for network news of tomorrow.

To the Editor:
The Museum of Modern Art's exhibition "Seven Master Printmakers: Innovations in the 80's" and Roberta Smith's criticisms of it are ironically timely ["Narrow Notions of Greatness at the Modern," June 23]. In his retrospective downstairs at the Modern, Ad Reinhardt posthumously skewers art-world hype (and slick, salable images as a manifestation) through a series of hilarious and irreverent cartoons, then bathes the viewers in a real genius glow with his reductive "black" paintings. 
 After experiencing that and then utter deflation upstairs at the sight of the pretty printmakers Rosenquist, Stella, etc., one might keep one's artistic sensibilities intact only by pausing for air at Ellsworth Kelly's elegant and dynamic lithograph in the lobby -- a truly great print. It owes so much to the tradition downstairs and so little to the so-called masters of the last decade.

HEADLINE: Postings: SoHo Renovation;
A Business Pied-a-Terre

 BODY:
A home away from home is being built for out-of-town companies that need temporary quarters in New York City.
Under the name of Walden House, the project involves the renovation of a 119-year-old structure at 49 Mercer Street, between Grand and Broome Streets, in the SoHo-Cast Iron Historic District. Until recently, the six-story building was home to a textile company. 
 Its developer, Kari Walden, identifies himself as an artist and economist who has lived in the neighborhood for six years. The building, which is to reopen in September, will not have tenants as much as clients: corporations that use the space and services Mr. Walden provides.
"The space is part of the service," Mr. Walden said. "We can design a package for a company from the West Coast or Scandinavia or England or Germany. You come into our building for three months and we provide all consulting services. We construct a marketing event for you, do basic market research, do a search for business partners and devise the advertising program for you. Whatever we cannot produce ourselves in house, we subcontract -- for instance, legal services or accounting."
Mr. Walden bought the building last year for $3 million and expects to spend about $7 million on the project, which will yield not only new office space but a ground-floor gallery and 74-seat screening room. He said he was the sole investor in the project and had raised the money by selling "everything I have -- or had" in the way of real estate and securities, as well as obtaining financing from an international bank. Kapell & Kostow of Manhattan are the renovation architects. The original architect was Joseph M. Dunn.

Sharing The Land In Condos

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
AS midsummer approaches, many residents of suburban condominums are gazing longingly at their neighbors in one-family houses who are beginning to harvest produce from lush vegetable gardens.
 Though they may have been only too willing to give up backyard chores when they moved into a condo, they now feel a sense of loss. Ruth Price, for example, who moved four years ago from a one-family house in Guilford, Conn., to a condominium about 30 miles away, suffered such withdrawal symptoms that she now helps tend a friend's vegetable garden in the next town. 
 It does not have to be so. Any condominium or homeowner association can create a community garden by setting aside land in the common area and dividing it into individual gardening plots.
 "We've had one at Rowayton Woods for 10 years and the people love it," said Edward Nardella, president of Corporate Property Management of Norwalk, Conn., which manages some 43 associations. Rowayton Woods is a 206-unit town-house condominium near the center of Rowayton, Conn.
Some 34 million households tended vegetable gardens in 1990, up from 30 million in 1989, according to the National Gardening Association, and many community ownership residents were among them.
"This year we have a waiting list of about 40 people for garden plots," said Claudia Thompson-Deahl, environmental manager at Reston, Va., a planned community of 20,000 units where a community garden has been maintained for 20 years.
Among the growing number of gardeners, she added, are the community's Asian and Indian residents, who are eager to grow exotic vegetables and herbs that they cannot easily find in stores.
 Fairfield Glade, a homeowner association of some 3,000 year-round and time-share units on 12,500 acres near Nashville, Tenn., now has 66 garden plots, having added eight this year to keep pace with requests. "We just keep expanding," said Rick Dowswell, the recreation director.
 Nevertheless, a sampling of managers nationwide suggests that condominium or co-op community gardens are still relatively uncommon. One reason could be the mistaken notion that it is illegal -- or at least very complicated -- to set aside common lands for individual gardening plots.
 Not so, said Gurdon Buck of Hartford, supervisory council member of the American Bar Association's Committee on Housing and a leading authority on community association law.
The legal status of the plots is much the same as that of individual parking places, he said. Both are taken from common ground and may be assigned on a temporary basis according to rules set by the board of directors -- provided those rules are applied in a nondiscriminatory way and offer a reasonable method of access for any applicant. But plots cannot be permanently assigned to any individual or unit.
 A community garden can therefore be established at any time by the board without modifying the basic documents of the association or getting a two-thirds majority vote, Mr. Buck said.
A compelling argument for a community garden is to prevent illegal gardening in other areas. An alternative is to create a garden club and let members landscape and beautify parts of the grounds as a community project.
This was done four years ago at Sudden Valley, a 4,500-unit homeowner association in Bellingham, Wash. "Each year it's looking better and better," said Billie Thoreson, the general manager. Although this method limits gardening to flowers and shrubs, it also helps the association save on landscaping costs.
IF a complex is not yet complete it might be possible to persuade the developer to let part of the unused land be temporarily set aside for gardening, a technique appropriate in a recession when new construction is often placed on hold.
 This idea was used successfully by Carol Levey, a resident of the 180-unit River Walk homeowner association in Chesapeake, Va. Earlier this year, Ms. Levey obtained about a quarter of an acre for gardening on a sunny piece of adjacent land that the River Walk developer owned and planned to use for a strip shopping center.
 The best place for a community garden is a secluded area that is visible neither from the units nor the roadway so it does not mar the overall appearance of the development, said Doug Kleine, president of Professional Association Services of Reston, a consultant to community associations.
 Rowayton Woods, for example, has its garden tucked between a copse and a pond on the edge of the complex. At Reston the garden is on a strip of land that would have otherwise remained unused because of a gas pipeline easement.
Other good spots could be wetlands, open space that cannot be built upon or buffer zones between the complex and an unsightly neighbor, like a commercial complex, said Mr. Kleine.
 The most common method of assigning plots is first come first served, with prior garden-plot renters given preference. Seasonal rents range from $10 to $40. Some, like Rowayton Woods, give rebates to owners who clean out their plots in the fall.
 The rent normally covers the cost to the association of fencing the area (to keep out wildlife and vandals) and providing water.
 Areas are often divided into those where chemical fertilizers can be used and those restricted to organic gardening, "so as not to affect everyone else," said Cynthia Yee, who coordinates the community garden at Farmington Woods, a 969-unit condominium in Farmington, Conn.
 Community gardens can also provide a social opportunity and a chance for pooling resources for bulk purchases of seed and equipment. At Fairfield Glade, gardeners find new friends as they give away excess produce to their nongardening neighbors.
At Heritage Village, a 2,580-unit retirement condominium in Southbury, Conn., the end-of-season festival at which the vegetables and flowers are professionally judged has become "one of the most popular events of its type in the state," said Jack Lewis, senior vice president of the River Garden Club, which operates the Village's 750 plots.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Retail Condominiums;
For the Premier Locations, The Price Is Commensurate

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
TO put into perspective the price paid by Mitsui Real Estate Sales for a retail condominium at Madison Avenue and 66th Street, consider the amount of space taken by this paragraph. Had it been part of the recent deal, it would be worth $38.
Mitsui, the Manhattan-based subsidiary of Mitsui Real Estate Development Company of Tokyo, has paid $14.75 million for five stores at the base of a 10-story landmark apartment house at 45 East 66th Street. The stores, numbered 773 to 781 Madison Avenue, amount in all to 5,167 square feet. 
 That works out to $2,854.65 a square foot, which may work out to some kind of record.
"It's a vote of confidence in prime Manhattan real estate," said Lawrence A. Russo, a vice president of the Trump Organization, who represented the seller, Classic Properties of Manhattan. "There are other retail condominiums on Fifth Avenue and Madison Avenue, but this is a first, in that no deal has been closed at this level.
"It's a world-class location and they paid a world-class price," he said.
Mr. Russo said he believed the only retail deal that might come close was one done last year, also by Mitsui, also on Madison Avenue. It involved a five-store, 6,000-square-foot retail condominium in the Leonori apartment building, at 63d Street.
"While it is an astonishing price, it's a shrewd investment," said Peter Melnikoff, of Oval Grove Properties of Manhattan, who was the other broker in the deal. "As opposed to the office sector, you have a real constraint on supply. You have a limited area where upscale retail exists."
"The limited supply is creating a healthier situation, compared with office, hotel or condominium properties," said Masahiko Kawakami, executive vice president of Mitsui.
"I am not worrying about the future of New York City," he said. "You still have a great residential stock on Park Avenue and Fifth Avenue. A lot of the richest people are living there and they prefer to buy on Madison Avenue. A lot of tourists are coming to New York and they prefer to go to shop on Fifth Avenue and Madison Avenue. And other international retailers want to have some kind of showcase on Madison Avenue."
He said his confidence was bolstered by such impending developments as the Barneys store, at Madison Avenue and 61st Street; the Mitsukoshi store at Park Avenue and 57th Street and the Galeries Lafayette store, at 57th Street, near Fifth Avenue.
"We recognized that the high price per square foot might stir a lot of attention," said Christopher G. McManus, president of Offshore Asset Management of Westport, Conn., who advised Mitsui. "I hope it does. I hope other owners of premier properties will anxiously contact us and give us the opportunity to acquire other retail condominiums."
Not everyone was impressed by the magnitude of the Mitsui deal. "It's probably a record, but so what," said Benjamin Fox, executive vice president of New Spectrum Realty Services. "It doesn't mean anything -- dollars per square foot. That has meaning in midtown, where what happens at Third and 54th has a direct bearing on what happens at Lexington and 56th. But on Madison Avenue, these deals are so few and far between as to have no basis for comparison.
"Madison just defies what's going on," he said. "People who have a lot of money simply love shopping on Madison."
Remarkable as the price is, it may seem a little less breathtaking when considered as a factor of income rather than space.
"You can't look at retail space as '$2,800 a foot,' " said C. Bradley Mendelson, a managing director of the Edward S. Gordon Company and a specialist in retail real estate. "No one would pay that for land. No one would pay that for an office building. But if you're getting $275 a square foot in rent, you're buying at about 10 times rental. That's a 10 percent return. Would you buy a bond that yielded 10 percent? Of course. This is like buying a bond. It's not like buying real estate.
"When you're dealing with multi-use properties, you're looking at a major maintenance and repair investment that will fluctuate in value," he said. "But the buying of a retail condominium, which gets its service from the building, is very much protected. If the roof leaks, you're going to be the last to know it. You're not going to have a major maintenance nightmare on your hands."
BUT Mr. Fox pointed out that retail condominiums have their problems. "A lot of these deals have gone sour," he said. "The rent projections have not borne out the investment."
Indeed, no matter how the brokers tout the Madison Avenue site, the final price was about 18 percent lower than the deal that had been negotiated only five months earlier, reflecting the fact that no location is recession proof or trouble free.
Completed in 1908 to designs by Harde & Short, 45 East 66th Street was declared a landmark in 1977. From 1928 to 1973 and again from 1977 to 1987, it was owned by the Bing & Bing real-estate company. Along with numerous other Bing holdings, it was purchased in 1987 by a partnership controlled by Martin J. Raynes.
The Executive Life Insurance Company of Los Angeles was a limited partner in the transaction. Mr. Raynes, who gave up vast holdings to avoid financial collapse, "left the deal" last summer, said Gary Glatter, president of Classic Properties, which is now the sponsor of the co-operative conversion of the 33 apartments upstairs. Classic still owns about 15 of those apartments, Mr. Glatter said.
Taken together, the apartments compose a single residential condominium. There are also two professional-office condominiums in the building, which are to be combined as an art gallery.
CLASSIC also owned the retail condominium, whose tenants included the Fred Leighton jewelry store (No. 773), the Christian de Castelnau boutique (No. 775), the Alexon boutique (No. 777), the Bernardaud china shop (No. 779) and the Berk of Burlington Arcade cashmere store (No. 781).
Although Classic had not considered selling the retail condominium, it had been under scrutiny by Mitsui. "We have studied almost all the Madison Avenue properties," Mr. Kawakami said. "We pointed at that property."
"Some brokers said there were Japanese buyers who might pay a price that would interest us," Mr. Glatter recalled.
The first approach was in June. A contract was signed in November for $18 million. The closing was scheduled for Jan. 14. But that turned out to be the day before the deadline set by the United Nations Security Council for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait. The closing was postponed to Feb. 14.
"Unfortunately," Mr. Glatter said, "as luck would have it, between mid-January and mid-February, Christian de Castelnau decided to bolt in a midnight run. That's rather uncharacteristic for a Madison Avenue tenant, but that's what he did."
"The past year was not profitable," Mr. de Castelnau said, from his office in Los Angeles. "I had been talking to the landlord since December. We did not know what we were going to do. I was trying to get them to reduce the rent to where it would make sense to keep the store." He was paying between $225 and $250 a square foot.
That left Classic without one of its tenants. Since the deal with Mitsui was predicated on full tenancy, the agreement was opened for for renegotiation. In that process, the price dropped about $3.25 million.
Another closing was scheduled in mid-April but that was when California regulators seized control of Executive Life, saying the company was in a hazardous condition. The prospective sale then had to be reviewed by the California insurance commissioner and Superior Court. "Mitsui wanted to get comfortable that all the T's were crosses and all the I's were dotted," Mr. Glatter said.
The deal finally closed June 19.
As to the future, Mr. Kawakami said Mitsui would probably form a partnership and sell shares to other Japanese investors.
"Some" part of the proceeds "could find its way to Executive Life," Mr. Glatter said.
Mr. Russo said "major European retailers" had expressed interest in the retail space that Mr. de Castelnau vacated at No. 775 and had made offers ranging from $250 to $285 a square foot.
"We are basically investors," Mr. Kawakami said. "We are expecting to have long-term appreciation of the properties."

Pension Fund Plans Addition

 BODY:
The world's largest pension fund will be expanding its Manhattan headquarters to keep up with the size of its portfolio. TIAA-CREF, the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association-College Retirement Equities Fund, has seen its assets multiply five times, to $95 billion, over the past decade, requiring more space for its headquarters staff.
Accordingly, the pension fund will build a 20-story, 160,000-square-foot addition to its present headquarters at 730 Third Avenue on an adjacent lot on 45th Street that the fund owns. Demolition on the lot begins this month and construction will start in September, with completion planned for mid-1993.
The addition will match the current building's gray brick style. As part of the project, the present lobby entrance on Third Avenue will be renovated and given a two-story atrium partially clad in granite. 
 Besides creating space for the fund's growing staff of 3,800, the $30 million project also will permit the fund to take advantage of the slower pace of construction in the city, said Tom Fjellman, assistant vice president of the fund and the project manager.
"Because of the current recession," Mr. Fjellman said, "high quality workmanship is available at lower costs, making this an opportune time to build."
The Manhattan firm of Schuman Lichtenstein Claman Efron are the architects.

HEADLINE: Budget Said to Set Stage for Future Battles

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
BY relying on some one-time revenue sources to help balance the state's new $14.7 billion budget, Gov. Jim Florio and the Democratic-controlled Legislature may have made balancing next year's budget an even greater challenge.
The new budget includes between $500 million and $700 million in revenue that will not be counted on a year from now, and Dr. William C. Freund, a professor of economics at Pace University, said, "That reeks of a quick fix that can do some permanent harm." 
 Dr. Freund, who served on the Governor's Economic Policy Council under four governors, said, "If the New Jersey economy suddenly picked up and roared ahead, then the loss of the one-time revenues could be offset, but it doesn't look like that kind of a turnaround is in prospect."
Interviews with economists, lawmakers, state officials and fiscal watchdogs showed that most believe that the budget just enacted sets the stage for another round of fights over further job cuts, reductions in employee benefits, service rollbacks or new tax increases.
"What they did was politically expedient, but not economically sound or smart," Dr. Freund said. "And they know that in Trenton."
The final agreement on the budget for the fiscal year that started last Monday did not come until about noon the day before, when Senator Laurence S. Weiss, Democrat of Woodbridge and chairman of the Senate Revenue, Finance and Appropriations Committee, said that "an intense and tumultuous week of hard work, negotiations and compromise" was over.
But the compromise included about 3,000 layoffs of state employees and the one-time revenue raisers -- $400 million from the sale of a portion of Interstate 95 in Bergen County to the New Jersey Turnpike Authority; an acceleration of utility taxes that will yield $620 million this year but about $100 million less in the next fiscal year, and a change in Medicaid eligibility planned to attract $250 million in additional Federal Medicaid funds.
The sale of the 4.4 miles of highway to the toll road authority was not very popular with many lawmakers, and no one expects the state to continue to cannibalize its road system, even to stave off future budget shortfalls.
Although Mr. Weiss said he and others were uncomfortable with this "unorthodox" budget item, he said it was the best anyone could come up with to avoid even tougher choices, including more layoffs.
"With a budget that incorporates conservative revenue figures and is structurally sound, it is safe to include the roadway transfer to bridge the fiscal gap," he said.
Douglas C. Berman, the State Treasurer, said the national recession was the chief reason that the state's tax base, which was broadened by changes in both the state sales and income taxes last year, was unable to produce the revenue needed to keep pace with the costs of government. When the recession lifts, the underlying strength of the budget, which spends less for direct state operations and $2 billion more in state aid for schools and property tax relief, will become apparent, he said.
Mr. Berman is also relying on some $200 million in savings and productivity gains claimed for the current budget to grow next year and help offset the loss of the nonrepeatable revenue.
He said the budget departed from the recent past when state spending began outdistancing revenue growth, even during the economic boom of the 1980's.
 
Education Tied to Income Tax
 From now on, increases in state aid for education, for example, will be tied to the increase in income tax revenue, he said, which will prevent this aid program from consuming revenue needed for other parts of the budget.
A job freeze begun last December has resulted in a reduction of 1,900 state jobs, before the state begins to effect the layoffs required by the budget. An attrition program and early retirement offers are also expected to realize savings. In all, Mr. Berman said, the administration hopes to reduce the 76,000-member state work force by 10 percent in another year.
Assemblyman Robert D. Franks of New w Providence, the State Republican chairman, said he believed that the economies being claimed by the administration were overstated and that the one-shot revenue used to balance the current budget would spell trouble very soon.
"We face a big crisis next spring," he said, when the time rolls around to begin planning the 1993 budget. Mr. Franks predicts that his party will control one or both houses of the Legislature after this November's election, and he said the Republicans would have to clean up the budget mess created by the Democrats.
 
Increased Fees as 'Savings'
 Mr. Franks said the Florio administration was counting on raising fees charged by various state departments and has been picturing the increased fees as "savings" generated by the departments.
"These aren't savings but new taxes that are again being placed on the shoulders of the New Jersey taxpayer," he said.
Dr. Joseph J. Seneca, professor of economics at Rutgers University and another former economic adviser to New Jersey governors, said that relying on one-shot revenue to balance the current budget insured that revenue would continue to be a problem when the next budget rolled around.
Unless there is a "significant turnaround" in the economy in the near future, he said, the state will have to consider program cutbacks or find new revenue. That does not always mean new taxes, as the highway sale indicates. "In the genre of one-time revenue raisers, there may be a large number of clever and imaginitive sources to tap," Dr. Seneca said.
David Kehler, president of the Public Affairs Research Institute of New Jersey in Princeton, said, "It looks to me like we'll be dealing with a budget crisis for Florio's entire term."
 
Savings Depend on Unfilled Jobs
 Mr. Kehler said that even as the budget was being approved, not enough was known about the costs associated with some important programs. There is an early retirement program, but no one knows how many people are expected to participate, he said, or how long their jobs will be unfilled. "The real savings turns on the idea that the jobs remain vacant," Mr. Kehler said.
He said that in testimony before the appropriations committee Mr. Berman could only give estimates of the cost of the state's new homeowners' rebate program to assist those whose property taxes eat up a large part of their income.
"Some people may miss their first year of eligibility, and that could be another factor driving up costs in subsequent years," Mr. Kehler said.
 
$55 Million From Early Retirement
 Mr. Berman said the state hoped to realize $55 million from the early retirement program and had appropriated $710 million for the rebate program in the current budget.
He said the number of people eligible for the rebates could decrease in the future if the administration's efforts to curb the rise in property taxes were successful.
Mr. Kehler said he did not believe that it was realistic to expect an economic turnaround to solve the state budget woes in the near future, and he said the administration would have to aggressively pursue the economies identified by the Governor's Management Review Commission. The commission has identified more than $900 million in cost savings, productivity increases and other economies over the next two years.
Mr. Kehler also said public-interest organizations and the press would have to do a better job to keep the public informed on budget issues. He said there had been insufficient review of the last Kean administration budget, "which created problems that Florio had to address as soon as he took office."
"Those of us interested in this issue will have to delve deeply to see where we stand," he said. "And to see to it that the public isn't being blind sided."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Where the State Hopes to Save"
 
Here is a partial list of the $90 million in savings, revenue and productivity gains the Florio administration hopes to realize during the next two years.
 
Restructure health benefits for state employees to reduce medical costs: $75 million.
 
Reduce number of state garages to 29 from 71: $16.5 million.
 
Reduce workforce by about 10 percent: Up to $172 million.
 
Reduce sick-leave usage: $28 million.
 
Improve delinquent tax collections: $41 million.
 
Increase use of community-based corrections programs for nonviolent offendoers: $49.3 million.
 
Increase state fees, charges and penalties: $97 million. (pg. 4)

HEADLINE: Recession Inspires Innovative Approaches to Business

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
AS businesses, individuals and state and local governments struggle to weather the recession that has gripped the economy since the end of the 1980's, economic survival for some has been accompanied by employee layoffs, a paring down of personal and household budgets and cutbacks in services in the public sector, economists say.
And though recent statistics offer a glimmer of hope for recovery, they say, a rebound is likely to be gradual, with those groups hurt the most by the recession -- developers, contractors and bankers -- facing a particularly arduous climb. 
 But even in the worst of times, innovators prosper.
In West New York, for example, along a stretch of Hudson River waterfront unofficially dubbed the Gold Coast in the optimistic 1980's, a new enterprise has arisen from the ashes of scrapped plans for an ultra-luxurious multimillion-dollar residential development. In its place, people happily pay for the privilege of whacking golf balls by the basketful onto a grassy expanse in the shadow of the Manhattan skyline. Business is so good, the owner says, he is thinking of expanding.
 
Paying Rent by Selling Shrubs
 Two miles south in Hoboken, a contractor who ran a thriving construction business just a few short years ago now spends a good part of his time cultivating plants for his 7,500-square-foot nursery and garden center. While not quite as profitable as contracting, the owner says, selling shrubs pays the rent and at the same time provides him with some peace of mind.
And in Somerville, a modestly sized savings bank that had husbanded its resources during the good times of the late 1980's virtually doubled in size overnight by purchasing six branches of a prominent savings and loan that failed to survive the savings and loan crisis.
"There are always people around who can sail through anything," said Dr. Marilyn Marks Rubin, associate professor of economics and public administration at the City University of New York. "Even during the Depression, if you tried hard enough, you would find success stories," she said.
The current recession, she said, despite its depth and breadth, holds within it the seeds of success for those who are determined, either through necessity or desire, to find a niche and fill it.
"It's a matter of insight and luck," Dr. Rubin said. "Being in the right place at the right time."
For example, she said, because of the recession people are forgoing exotic vacations for activities closer to home.
 "The nearby-travel industry is doing extraordinarily well," she said, citing renewed interest in inexpensive outdoors activities and an increase in short-term rentals at the Jersey Shore and in the Poconos.
 
Fun Without a Lot of Money
 "People want to go out and do something that's fun and doesn't cost a lot of money," Dr. Rubin said. Businessmen who can capitalize on that, she said, will prosper.
Arthur E. Imperatore, the North Jersey trucking magnate and real-estate developer, is perhaps one such example.
Mr. Imperatore, who has systematically acquired hundreds of acres of Hudson River waterfront property, said he had spent "two years and millions of dollars" obtaining approvals to build an ultra-luxurious residential development along the waterfront in West New York just north of his restaurant, marina and Manhattan ferry service in Weehawken.
The project was shelved indefinitely, however, with the onset of the recession and the realization by Mr. Imperatore that the development would very likely be "too audacious for the American public." But undeveloped land costs money to keep.
 
Searching for Alternatives
 "If you have assets that are nonproductive, and if there are alternatives to utilizing those assets, you've got to be timely, imaginative and sometimes somewhat courageous," he said.
Searching for a way to make his unproductive land at least partly productive, Mr. Imperatore struck upon the idea of a golf driving range and miniature golf course -- uses that would generate income and cost relatively little to build. The idea worked.
"If we continue to generate the cash flow that seems indicated from the present results," he said, "then we can sit on this land indefinitely." Indeed, Mr. Imperatore said, the driving range is so successful that he is now considering expansion of the range to include a "pitch and putt" course and possibly a professional golf school.
At the same time, he said, he is also exploring the feasibility of increased recreational use of much of his waterfront land, as opposed to, or perhaps in conjunction with, the office and residential development he had originally envisioned.
"Once you start down the road of alternative uses, one's mind opens up very imaginatively and inventively," he said.
 
A Common Practice
 Finding interim uses for undeveloped land is a common practice among successful developers, said Edele Hovnanian, vice president of H. Hovnanian Industries, a Tinton Falls developer. Ms. Hovnanian, whose company has built more than 14,000 residential units in Ocean County alone, said that H. Hovnanian Industries owned property in Manchester Township that was currently being mined for zircon.
 "If you want to buy at the right price, you have to recognize that the right time to buy land is not always the right time to develop it," she said. Her company, she said, typically buys land years before it is "mature" for development.
Ms. Hovnanian said her company was using the slowdown in construction to move projects through the time-consuming process of applying for municipal and state land use approvals.
 
Best Time to Buy
 "My projects are very rarely ripe for development immediately," she said. "If they were, that means that I would have to pay market price for my land, and that would be very expensive."
Some savings banks have also found that the best time to buy is when everyone else is selling.
The New Jersey Savings Bank, a subsidiary of Bancorp New Jersey, a Somerville-based savings bank, for instance, recently doubled in size when it acquired six branches of the failed City Federal Savings and Loan Association from the Resolution Trust Corporation.
 Beatrice D'Agostino, chairwoman and president of both the New Jersey Savings Bank and Bancorp New Jersey, said the New Jersey Savings Bank was converted to a public company in 1987, when the economy was thriving.
"We raised an enormous amount of capital," Mrs. D'Agostino said. "We felt that capital would be king in the future."
 
Decline Yields Opportunities
 Mrs. D'Agostino said that by properly managing that capital, the bank was in the enviable position of being cash-rich at the right time.
"When there is a decline in the economy, there are more opportunities out there than you can look at," she said. One opportunity that was too good to miss, she said, was the Resolution Trust Corporation's sale of failed savings and loans institutions.
Another kind of of asset management is illustrated by Joe Taglieri, a Hoboken contractor.
"I'm squeezing every nickel out of every asset I've got," Mr. Taglieri said. "I'm going back to the basics."
Mr. Taglieri, who has been in the construction business for 20 years, said that the last couple of years were the most dismal he could remember. "A few years ago, I had 70 people working for me and more work than I knew what to do with," he said. But as the recession set in, he said, business fell off dramatically.
As a result, Mr. Taglieri decided to capitalize on his assets, the most prominent of which was his sprawling warehouse on Clinton Street.
"I found other ways of making money," he said.
Mr. Taglieri, who had never before considered horticulture as a vocation, found that residents were eager customers for the plants and shrubs he started selling on the sidewalk and in back of his warehouse. In fact, business was so good that Mr. Taglieri moved his construction equipment out of the way and created an open-air nursery to sell his plants.
In addition, he also rented out nearly 50 parking spaces in his garage and provided storage areas for space-starved neighbors.
 
'I Sleep Better Now'
 "I sleep better now," he said. "There used to be nights when I couldn't get to sleep because I owed out as much as $200,000. Now, if I owe somebody $2,000 over a weekend, it's a lot. I'm working real close to the bone."
Dr. Joseph J. Seneca, a professor of economics at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, said people like Mr. Taglieri were responding appropriately and cleverly to difficult economic times.
"Rather than try to sell the business, you are forced to innovate," Dr. Seneca said. "That's sort of natural in the economic process. In weak markets, alternatives are developed to keep costs under control."
Mr. Taglieri has another explanation for his ability to weather the economic doldrums of the recession.
"I'm following the advice my Uncle Louis gave me," he said. "He told me, 'Joe, if you're going to do something, you've got to do something that doesn't cost you anything.' "

HEADLINE: Telling the Story of Ethiopian Jews

BYLINE: By Roberta Hershenson

DATELINE: SCARSDALE

 BODY:
AMONG those greeting Ethiopian Jews at Ben Gurion International Airport in Israel last month was a woman from Scarsdale, Susan K. Stern. Mrs. Stern, the new chairwoman of the Women's Young Leadership Cabinet of the United Jewish Appeal, had been sent by the organization to witness Operation Solomon, the two-day emergency airlift of 14,000 Ethiopian Jews to Tel Aviv.
Within hours of returning home, even before catching up on the sleep she lost while aiding a stream of bewildered refugees, Mrs. Stern began telling the story of what she had seen. Storytelling is her job, an almost sacred responsibility, she said. 
 In the coming months, she will travel widely to share her impressions of "people from the 17th century coming off a plane into the 20th century." People with "beautiful, stunned black faces" who were "home now after 2,000 years of waiting."
According to legend, Ethiopia's first king was the son of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, and the country's small Jewish population is descended from one of Israel's lost tribes. In 1984, 20,000 Ethiopian Jews were airlifted to Israel. More than 1,500 Jews are thought to remain in Ethiopia and face persecution there, said Mrs. Stern, who added that their rescue is also being planned.
She was back in Israel last week, attending a leadership conference sponsored by U.J.A., which raises funds nationally for Israel and for mostly Jewish causes in 34 other countries. Its Women's Young Leadership Cabinet, which Mrs. Stern heads, is composed of 225 women under the age of 40 from all over the United States.
 
'Privilege of Watching a Miracle'
 The U.J.A.-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York, one of the largest local philanthropic groups in the world, sponsored Mrs. Stern's visit to observe Operation Solomon. The U.J.A.-Federation provides funds and services to 130 agencies in eight New York counties; some of its money is disbursed in Israel.
Mrs. Stern receives no salary for her two-year appointment. She said the rewards for traveling and lecturing for the group were "the privilege of watching a miracle" -- the airlift -- as well as such experiences as "watching Russians take their first steps of freedom, kiss the ground and pop the first bottle of champagne" upon arriving in Israel.
Her involvement with U.J.A. began after she and her husband, Jeffrey M. Stern, an investment banker, moved here from Chicago nine years ago. "I was just looking for friends and trying to meet people" by attending local U.J.A. meetings with a friend, she recalled. Then, one day the group visited a social center for Russian immigrants in Brooklyn that was financed by U.J.A.-Federation.
"A woman who came from the same part of Russia as my grandmother took my hand and said 'thank you' " for the center's activities, Mrs. Stern said. "She could have been part of my own family." She added that the visit had helped her understand where the organization's money was spent.
 
Focus on Human Needs
 Moved to participate further, Mrs. Stern headed the first $1 million fund-raising effort of the Scarsdale Women's Campaign for U.J.A.-Federation in 1988. Mrs. Stern now personally solicits for gifts up to $25,000. The work consists of "having a conversation," she said, and the contributions come.
In a daunting economic and political climate, the U.J.A. leader focuses on human needs. Her job is not to judge Israel, she noted, although she conceded that "some of what they do makes my fund-raising harder that day." She cited the "Who Is a Jew?" debate and Israel's activities in the occupied territories as issues that "all of us wrestle with."
Despite the fact that "Israel does lots of things we don't agree with," its collective people are "my hero," Mrs. Stern said. "They keep pulling off these miracles," she said. "The whole country mobilized for 14,000 people from another world."
Current U.J.A. fund-raising efforts are directed largely at absorbing the Ethiopians as well as the one million Soviet Jews expected to settle in Israel by 1993. Mrs. Stern said more than $1 billion had been raised in the United States this year to help pay for immigration costs and for other projects.
 
'Taking Care of Our Own'
 This is money that many people, including many Jews, would also like to see going to local causes. When asked why people should pay for housing in Israel when many Westchester families are homeless, Mrs. Stern answered that "no one else is going to help the Jewish people."
In that light, she added, the money contributed to U.J.A. is "not seen as charity but as taking care of our own," a tradition that developed since the Holocaust.
U.J.A. finances some nonsectarian projects abroad through the American Joint Distribution Committee, which has helped the Kurds in Iraq and victims of the Chernobyl disaster. U.J.A. fund-raising in Westchester benefits such institutions as Blythedale Children's Hospital in Valhalla, the Hawthorne Cedar Knolls School and the Pleasantville Cottage School, residential-treatment centers for emotionally disturbed children.
Some local U.J.A. funds are also used to support "Connections," a telephone program linking the homebound that is run by Westchester Jewish Community Services.

HEADLINE: Why So Many Children Need Extra Help

 BODY:
It was with dismay that I read the article on preschool programming for handicapped children. This article presented a somewhat negative, one-sided view of preschool for the handicapped. As an educator with 30 years' experience working with handicapped children, 15 of which are as a teacher-facilitator of a local school-district-based preschool program, I must take exception to the tone and content of the article.
For many years educators have been aware that when a child is diagnosed as having a handicap or to be at high risk for developmental disabilities, early intervention is indicated. Research has revealed that early experiences have a positive influence on functioning and that influence affects all areas of functioning. 
 As with any large, bureaucratic system there is no doubt that the system that delivers services to preschoolers has some drawbacks and/ or abusers. I would like to think that for the most part all parties involved are acting responsibly.
I can only speak for the practices of my school-district program. We do not provide services to preschoolers with lisps. Children that are recommended for a classification of speech-impaired have moderate to severe communication problems. This would include children with little or no language, unintelligible speech or a combination of delayed language and articulation deficits. Children with mild articulation problems or mild delays in language development are recommended for itinerant speech services, usually two times a week.
Our overall goal of the early intervention program is the smooth transition of all children into traditional kindergartens, with the realization that this is not always possible. While the child is enrolled in the preschool, service levels are reviewed approximately every 10 weeks.
We have brought both 3- and 4-year-old children back to the Committee on Preschool Special Education at the end of these 10-week periods, sometimes to reduce service levels, other times to declassify. Over the last 15 years it has been our experience that 40 percent of our preschoolers need continued special-education services in kindergarten, usually with speech as a related service.
We have further found that approximately 95 percent of these children are fully declassified by the time they reach second grade.
We have also found that those preschoolers who are recommended for the transition class, a special-education kindergarten, generally require an additional year in a full-time special-education class and are then declassified or receive a related service for another year or two.
The bottom line is does preschool make a difference in the lives of children? The empirical evidence points to long-lasting gains. If we examine the Perry Preschool Program in Ypsilanti, Mich., for its investment return and convert all costs and benefits into current values based on a 3 percent real rate of interest, one year of the program is an extraordinary economic buy.
It would be hard to imagine that society could find a higher yield for a dollar of investment than found in preschool programs for its at-risk children.
I would agree that cost-cutting measures are in order. One area that needs to be looked at is the cost of transportation. At the present time there are several other cost-cutting alternatives being considered, one of them being the use of parental insurance to help defray costs.
Another saving could be realized by eliminating the Committee on Preschool Special Education. There is no reason why the Committee on Special Education, which was already in place, cannot assume responsibility for preschoolers.
Let's not use the excuse of fiscal crisis to deny children educational programs. There are other ways to reduce spending. Park county and state cars and let the administration join the Civil Service workers on unpaid furlough.

HEADLINE: A Look at the City;
Holiday Haranguers

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
The other night my wife and I went to see "The Will Rogers Follies," a tedious Broadway musical about the great comedian's life. After the umpteenth playing of "Never Met a Man I Didn't Like," after the dog act and a leggy chorus line led by an unhappily bare-breasted young lady, Will's life came to the confluence of the Ziegfeld Follies and the Great Depression.
 Will noted the irony and expressed abundant sympathy for the millions of unemployed and starving, before the chorus line reappeared. The plumpish woman sitting behind us took umbrage at the sermon. 
 "This is ridiculous," she harrumphed to all. "This talk has no business being in this play, etc., etc."
 The power of the insight -- that Americans don't want social preachments intruding on their determination to think they're having a good time -- suggested that the harrumpher was a member of Congress or, more likely, a high-ranking official in the Bush Administration. On reflection, we agreed that she could not be a Washingtonian. No Washingtonian would have responded to a harangue with a harrumphing harangue.
 If Will had dared to speak of depressing things to a Washingtonian, the pros there would have neutralized him in no time. It's all technique.
 Liberals harangue President Bush about his nomination of Clarence Thomas to be a Justice of the Supreme Court. They hint that Mr. Bush selected Judge Thomas because he was black and not because he was the best man. Under the Kennebunkport sun, Mr. Anti-Quota stared into the cameras and said: "I resent that." (And who wouldn't?)
 Jack Kemp, the Housing Secretary, bothers the White House with ideas to combat poverty. He proposes to bypass the Washington bureaucracy with market incentives that don't require bundles of Federal money. He, too, has been easy prey. The White House unsheathed its bureaucratic scalpel and said: "We'll study your idea, Jack." (A trifle intellectual, but fail-safe.)
 Senator Jay Rockefeller harangues colleagues about 20 percent of America's children living in poverty and puts the repair bill at $50 billion yearly. From practiced lips flows a devastating riposte: "There's no money." (This technique can be used at home.)
 Then come the pests who yammer that there is money. They argue that we do not have to spend almost $300 billion annually on the Pentagon when the Soviet Union is in shambles and smaller forces can readily defeat the next Saddam Hussein. Others chime in that $7 billion yearly might be excessive to build nuclear warheads when we are presently halving our nuclear stockpile. To these nags, the pros give the unkindest cut of all: Silence. (That nailed me, too.)
 Then inevitably the let's-increase-taxes crowd resurfaces with its witches' brew of facts and logic. These tax hikers note that the industrialized world taxes gasoline at many times the American rate. They point to the fact that the tax burden in Germany and Japan is greater than here, and that their economic growth far exceeds ours. The winning Bushian counterthrust, unencumbered by reason, lives for all to revere: "Read my lips." (The classic mingling of scholarship and sex.)
 Vital morals can be learned here. First, harangues about foreign policy (like the Kurds) fare far better than domestic ones (like children). The foreign stuff, mostly words and an occasional war, is easier to understand. Domestic issues are too close to home.
 Second, nobody likes negative haranguers and problem-mongers. Everybody knows problems are a New York fetish and can't be solved anyway.
 Third, if negative haranguing can't be avoided, it has to embrace opponents tenderly as "baby killers" or "fat cats." Negative harangues laden with facts and complex arguments have no public place.
 Fourth, the shorter the harangue the better.
 Fending off legions of haranguers is hard work, but that's what political responsibility is all about. So Washingtonians need their July 4th vacation. Perhaps some came to New York City and took in "The Will Rogers Follies." And when Will interrupted the chorus line with his sentimentality about unemployed and needy Americans, Washingtonians surely disposed of him as they do all us haranguers. Final moral: Even astute haranguers can hope for little until the show is over.

HEADLINE: None of an Employer's Business

 BODY:
Imagine being fired from your job for smoking a cigarette or taking a drink in your own living room. Janice Bone and Daniel Winn don't have to imagine it.
Ms. Bone was fired from the Ford Meter Box Company in Wabash, Ind., when nicotine was found in her urine. The company policy: No smoking, ever. Mr. Winn was dismissed from the Best Lock Corporation of Indianapolis for admitting that he had had drinks several years earlier. Best Lock's policy: No drinking, ever. 
 Both are instances of life-style discrimination, a term rapidly entering the public vocabulary. Desperate to cap rising health care costs, employers are seeking greater control over employees' private lives. The least onerous of these interventions are economic incentives offered to those who lose weight, lower their cholesterol levels or quit smoking. More troubling are the penalties, puritanical and discriminatory, imposed on those who fail to meet company standards.
The pariah status of smokers provides a worrisome example. The cancer risks associated with smoking justify making public places smoke free. Yet those who wish to risk disease should be allowed to do so privately without fear of repercussion -- except, perhaps, the added insurance cost of belonging to a higher risk group.
It hasn't worked that way. At least 6,000 companies now refuse to hire smokers; some dismiss smokers they discover on the payroll. The Indiana Legislature, angered by what happened to Ms. Bone, passed legislation that protects the employment rights of smokers. A dozen states have such legislation. A dozen more are considering it.
The city of Athens, Ga., experimented briefly with discrimination on the basis of cholesterol level. In an effort to decrease the number of heart-related health claims, Athens declined for a time to hire even qualified employees with cholesterol levels that exceeded the city standard.
The program was junked under pressure from the American Civil Liberties Union, which argued that the law prevented recipients of Federal funds from discriminating on the basis of health. Private companies are free to do as they wish -- though, as in the Bone case, wary state legislatures are beginning to set some limits.
The Indiana Court of Appeals recently ruled in favor of Mr. Winn, who had sought unemployment benefits because, he claimed, his firing had been unjust. The unanimous decision said that the company had failed to demonstrate that its rule had a reasonable connection to business interests.
Companies are justified in providing employees with economic incentives to eat more healthily and to drink and smoke less. They may even be justified in assigning those who live less healthily to risk groups that pay more for their health insurance. But employers would do well to refrain from invading an employee's personal life with edicts that do not bear on fitness for work.

HEADLINE: The Best Little Bank in America

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

DATELINE: COLUMBUS, Ohio

 BODY:
From the troubled landscape of American banking, burdened with bad loans and falling profits, a new elite is emerging. A group of surprisingly vigorous banks, little-known outside their multistate bailiwicks, these so-called superregional banks are seen as the likely winners in the Darwinian winnowing that is now underway in the industry. They could eclipse the money-center banks like Citicorp and Chase Manhattan as the new powers of American banking.
When industry experts look for the best-run bank among these regional powerhouses, and perhaps the best bank in America, they usually end up here in Columbus at the 24-story mirrored-glass headquarters of the Banc One Corporation. Banc One has combined conservative lending, innovative technology, remarkable customer service and an uncanny ability to smoothly absorb a steady stream of acquired banks. Today, it is the nation's 22d-largest bank, but it ranks first in several key measures of financial performance like return on assets. 
 Banc One executives almost brag that they do little business with the nation's biggest 1,000 or so corporations, preferring higher-margin loans to smaller companies that their vast army of community bankers know so well. Eighty percent of the bank's commercial loans are to companies with sales of $50 million a year or less. "Our corporate lending ends about where Citibank's starts," noted George Meiling, Banc One's treasurer. The conservatism even extends to a few odd rules at the head office. Employees, for instance, are not permitted to drink coffee at their desks.
Yet Banc One has also been a pioneer in introducing new products and services, from one of the first automated teller machines in 1970 to an A.T.M. installed last week in a McDonald's restaurant in Mansfield, Ohio. Many of its branches are open on Saturdays and Sundays. "That's
when most people do much of their purchasing -- it only makes sense," explained John B. McCoy, Banc One's 48-year-old chairman.
Banc One even has branches that look more like mini-shopping malls than banks, with glass atriums, "boutiques" offering special services, signs of blue neon, comfortable seating areas and fresh coffee. One in a Columbus suburb, the Sawmill Financial Marketplace, was designed with advice from a Banc One director, Leslie H. Wexner, the founder of The Limited Inc.
"Anyone who doubts that you can make money in basic banking need look no further than Banc One," said Lowell Bryan, a director of McKinsey & Company. "It's a terrific bank. We need more like Banc One."
Since 1984, when Mr. McCoy succeeded his father as chief executive, Banc One has quadrupled in size, to $30.3 billion in assets by the end of last year. When its Federally assisted purchases of Texas banks are consolidated on the balance sheet, probably next year, Banc One's assets will total roughly $44 billion.
Buying other banks has been a big part of the Banc One formula and its success in bringing them into the corporate fold is being scrutinized by others in banking as economic logic and regulatory reform accelerate the concentration of the industry. Fewer, stronger banks would be better for the American economy and cheaper for the taxpayers, who have had to ante up to protect depositors at failed banks. The Treasury's proposed banking bill, which would allow banks to freely open branches anywhere in the nation, seems certain to speed the consolidation.
And the big regional players -- NCNB, Banc One, Fleet Financial, Norwest, PNC Financial, Wachovia and others -- will be the likely buyers. They avoided the once-trendy fields that proved so damaging to many of their banking peers -- loans to developing nations and those to finance corporate takeovers and to bankroll the 80's real-estate boom. Rather, they have moved into new markets as state laws against outsiders eased one by one. Today, they are the ones with the profits and the high-priced shares needed to buy other banks.
Two weeks ago, for example, NCNB Corporation offered to buy the C&S/Sovran Financial Corporation in a $4 billion stock swap that, if completed, would create the nation's second-largest bank, behind Citicorp. And just three days earlier, the Wachovia Corporation of Winston-Salem agreed to buy South Carolina National Bank for $800 million.
But making acquisitions work will be the key to which of the superregionals emerge as the industry leaders over the next several years. The Bank of New England, for one, was among the most ambitious superregionals before falling victim to bad acquisitions and reckless lending. Management skill displayed in handling growth, technology, product innovation and people will be more important than size alone.
At Banc One, there are clear-cut rules governing acquisitions -- rules that would presumably prevent it from trying a deal like the NCNB-C&S/Sovran Financial merger. Banc One will not buy a bank larger than one-third its size. "I don't believe in a merger of equals," the 48-year-old chairman explained. "We want to be sure that it is the Banc One culture that survives."
 
High-Quality Assets
 Banc One has moved beyond its Ohio stronghold to build up branch networks in Indiana, Wisconsin, Michigan, Kentucky, Texas and Illinois by making scores of smaller acquisitions, all friendly. It moved into Texas in 1989 with a $500 million deal with a failed bank, MCorp, but only after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation agreed to take the bad loans. Banc One then fashioned a retail network with additional purchases of troubled savings and loans in Texas.
Banc One has two purchases pending in Illinois: the $190 million acquisition of the Marine Corporation of Springfield, announced last March, and the $347 million purchase of the First Illinois Corporation of Evanston, announced last month. Counting the pending acquisitions, Banc One has 858 branches in seven states.
Despite rapid growth, the quality of Banc One's earnings has not slipped. Last year, it had by far the highest return on assets, at 1.53 percent, of the country's 50 largest banks. That performance has been appreciated on Wall Street. The market value of its shares outstanding, roughly $6.1 billion, ranks third among all banks. Only J. P. Morgan's and BankAmerica's are larger. Investors place a value on Banc One, for example, that is more than $1 billion greater than that of Citicorp, the nation's largest bank. Growth and high-quality earnings are crucial to Banc One because that buoys the price of its stock, which is the currency it uses to buy other banks.
Banking experts familiar with Banc One are hard pressed to find shortcomings. Even the move into Texas, which some viewed as a risky foray, appears to be turning out well. Thomas Hanley of Salomon Brothers Inc., who has been quite critical of major banks recently, admitted a bit sheepishly that the report he wrote on Banc One two months ago, entitled "Banc One -- A Dominant Competitor," was probably the most positive research report he had written in 23 years as a bank analyst. "I tried to find weaknesses, chinks in the armor, but I couldn't," Mr. Hanley said.
 
Casting Its Nets
 Banc One's management is constantly scouting for banks to buy. "One of the businesses we're in is the acquisition business," Mr. McCoy said. The point man in the hunt is William Boardman, an executive vice president, who was recruited from a Columbus law practice in 1984. Mr. Boardman glances at six deals a day, many of them from the inventory of failed institutions held by the F.D.I.C. or the Resolution Trust Company.
Mr. Boardman travels to one merger candidate a week. In fact, the Ohio company's reputation as a buyer is so well known today that news of one of its two corporate jets landing on a local airport can prompt a jump in the stock price of a community bank.
Mr. Boardman has just one full-time staff member, but he freely calls on experts from banks within the group. For big deals, the "due diligence teams" can be large and on assignment for weeks, with specialists poring over a prospective bank's retail lending and data processing, and interviewing senior executives and branch managers. The team in the MCorp deal was 22 people, who went to Dallas for two weeks in 1989.
Buying the MCorp banks was a departure for Banc One. The Texas banks did mainly corporate lending and had no retail branch system, Banc One's forte. Mr. McCoy was skeptical, despite the Federal assistance to make the deal financially attractive. But over dinner with his 22 colleagues, he was won over. "We liked the people," explained Mr. Meiling, who was part of the Texas team. "They were motivated. There had been no brain drain." And today, the senior people at the acquired MCorp banks are mostly still in place.
The atmosphere was very different when a second Banc One team of 55 people had cocktails and dinner at the hotel in Boston last February to discuss whether the bank should bid for the Bank of New England. Banc One chose not to bid, scared off by the state of the bank and the prospect that the Northeast economy would not rebound soon.
Banc One pursues good banks and makes them better in states where it can build a strong market position. The neighboring state of Pennsylvania, for instance, might seem a natural place to expand, but already has three large companies -- PNC Financial, Mellon Bank and CoreStates Financial. "We'd be a pimple there," Mr. McCoy explained.
It leaves existing management in place. Banc One is structured as a multibank holding company, with each affiliate bank having its own chief executive and board of directors. The local management makes its own decisions, from salaries to charitable donations. "The power is where the money is made -- at the banks, not at headquarters," said John Russell, a corporate vice president.
But all 51 affiliate banks have standardized products, the same technology and prepare similar monthly reports. The standardization is designed to cut costs by creating companywide economies of scale for functions like data processing. New conscripts to Banc One are often impressed by the rigor of the monthly reports, which track hundreds of categories of revenue and expenses, measuring performance against monthly forecasts made by the managements of each bank. "Banc One has the best management reporting system I've ever seen in the banking industry," said Harvey Mitchell, a veteran Dallas banker who is now chairman of Bank One, Texas.
The reporting system is less a means of corporate control than a management tool. Each bank's performance is measured alongside comparable institutions in the Banc One system. These "peer" banks then share tips to improve profitability. For example, Chuck Sulerzyski recalled that as head of retail banking for 40 branches in the Columbus area a couple of years ago, his expenses were much higher than at the Dayton affiliate. Mr. Sulerzyski and a group of his managers inspected the Dayton office and found the difference: they used a higher proportion of part-time tellers and had streamlined the handling of some transactions. Those techniques were copied in Columbus at a savings of $3 million a year, explained Mr. Sulerzyski, who is now the vice president for Banc One's retail banking throughout Ohio.
Why do healthy banks sell out to Banc One? Because they see the industry concentrating into fewer hands and want to combine with a winner to protect and expand their grip on local markets. The Marine Corporation of Illinois is a Springfield-based holding company with four banks, 16 branches and $1.2 billion in assets. It wants to buy smaller banks with the valued and liquid currency of Banc One stock. "We want to put Banc One's muscle behind us," said John Staudt, Marine's president. (The affiliate banks typically hunt for smaller banks, with less than $1 billion in assets.)
 
Distinctive Touch
 Banc One's distinctive approach to consumer banking is on display at its branch in Dublin, a Columbus suburb. In the Sawmill district of Dublin, it is not called a bank but a "financial marketplace." It is a prototype, but several others have been built since it opened in the winter of 1988.
Walk into the red-brick building with a peaked glass atrium and a woman seated behind a curved counter asks, "Hi, can I help you?" Along the sides are the bank's service areas, set off by partitions and glass, boutique-style, and labeled overhead with signs in blue neon script -- Home Equity, New Accounts and so on. The boutiques include a travel agency and relocation service, both run by Banc One personnel, and an outside realtor.
The center of the branch has low, modern couches for customers. Magazines are neatly stacked on a glass table, with fresh coffee nearby. Just below the glass atrium is a border of color pictures of local scenes, a high-school graduation, a business meeting, a Cub Scout and the best local golfer, Jack Nicklaus.
Michael Bradley, manager of the Sawmill Financial Marketplace, speaks like a marketing specialist. The average age of customers is 31.2 years old, 80 percent of his customers come from within a four-and-a-half-mile radius, there are 18 nearby competitors, and none of them come close to matching his volume. His branch has accumulated deposits of roughly $50 million and handles 50,000 transactions a month, unusually high figures in the banking industry.
There are no banker's hours here. The branch is open from 9 A.M. to 7 P.M. Monday through Friday, 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. on Saturday, and noon to 5 P.M. on Sunday. The late hours clearly appeal to Mr. Bradley's busy suburban customers; 37 percent of the branch's new accounts are opened from 5 P.M. to 7 P.M.
On July 27, the Sawmill branch will hold its third annual "sidewalk sale." The bank moves outside. Mr. Bradley grills hot dogs and hamburgers. Some animals are rented from the local zoo. And there are one-day bargains like a quarter percent added to the prevailing rate on six-month certificates of deposit. "Is that innovative?" Mr. Bradley asks rhetorically. "No. Hell, retailers have been holding sidewalk sales and midnight madness sales for decades. It's just unusual for the banking industry."
 
 
 
BOOT CAMP FOR BANKERS
 The management culture at Banc One is constantly and carefully nurtured. Senior officers of acquired banks are sent to "Bank One College," a two-week, 18-hour-a-day indoctrination, with speeches, small group meetings, dawn aerobics sessions and Outward Bound-like excursions. John McCoy, a Stanford M.B.A., and his team of young executives are constantly sampling the latest in management thinking with well-known practitioners, from the consultant Tom Peters to the Harvard Business School's Rosabeth Moss Kanter, who are brought in for lectures.
But there is another vital ingredient in the Banc One culture: cash. More than 600 officers are in the "key manager incentive compensation" program, intended to give senior managers an incentive to push for earnings growth -- and high-quality earnings. "It's a real strong part of the culture," said John Westman, Banc One's chief financial officer.
It means that the president of a smallish bank with $300 million in assets might get a salary of, say, $100,000. Yet he could make $175,000 if he exceeded his profit targets for the year. But should a bank's return on assets fall below 1.1 percent, the executive gets no bonus at all. Only five of America's 50 largest banking companies had returns above 1.1 percent last year, according to Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc., a banking research firm.

 
 
Targeting Gets Personal
 Behind Banc One's retail banking stands an impressive array of technology. For example, most Banc One tellers in the Columbus area have computers linked into a master file with information like age and income of customers. When a customer steps up to the counter, the employee can hit a button and pull up a list of the four products -- C.D.'s or I.R.A.'s, say, -- that person is most likely to buy. Banc One is working on a system that would add far more data. A new customer might be asked about his or her family, for example. "And when your daughter turns 6, you might receive a letter saying you should think about saving for her college education, " explained David Van Lear, president of Banc One's $220 million-a-year services subsidiary.

Showdown in the Gas Patch

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
In the San Juan basin of northwest New Mexico, a handful of energy companies have sold natural gas from an unlikely source, underground coal deposits, for $1.50 or more per 1,000 cubic feet in the last few years.
Spot prices routinely vary widely depending on the heating season, but an unusually warm winter and recession sent prices tumbling to their lowest levels in 20 years this spring, below $1.20. When big gas buyers in southern California bargained last week for a deeper cut, to 95 cents, J. Larry Nichols balked. 
 Mr. Nichols, operator of the region's biggest coal gas alliance, which includes Amoco, Burlington Northern's Meridian Oil, Conoco, Texaco and his own Devon Energy Corporation, cut daily production of the partnership nearly in half, to 65 million cubic feet a day for the month of July.
The maneuver meant stopping or curtailing production at 50 wells of the group's Northeast Blanco unit.
Many gas buyers had believed coal gas producers like Devon were in a bind and would have to produce at any price because of potential problems with water draining back into inactive well bores in the coal layers. Mr. Nichols, Devon's 49-year-old president and chief executive, said the shutdowns ordered last week sent a message that those buyers were wrong: wells in the region can be water-proofed.
Meanwhile, he said, Devon and its partners have the financial strength to wait for higher prices in the winter.
Low prices forced Devon to take a $25 million writedown in the first quarter, resulting in a loss of $17.8 million. But Devon has staying power, Mr. Nichols said, adding that its debt was a moderate 32 percent of equity at the end of March, and production costs were cut to 60 cents a 1,000 cubic feet from $1 two years ago.
"We needed to draw the line somewhere to tell buyers that we weren't going to be traded down forever," Mr. Nichols said.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
The French Market as a Temptress

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
The sudden decline in the French stock market is making it attractive again -- at least for the investor who has a tolerance for the political risk that arrived with Edith Cresson, France's new Prime Minister, and the patience to wait for a hoped-for interest rate cut.
The market's fall has been quick. From a 1991 high of 1,874.81 on June 11, the CAC-40 index of leading blue chip French stocks has dropped more than 8 percent in three weeks, closing at 1,723.14 on Friday, This is the lowest it has been in four months. The decline is now eating into the spectacular gains made in the rally that began in January when the Persian Gulf War started. 
 Taking their toll on the market have been worries about Mrs. Cresson, whose popularity has declined since her appointment May 15, signs of a further slowing of the French economy and the growing expectations that any interest rate cut will be delayed.
Just a few weeks ago, summer was expected to bring good news for the French market, which has been the favorite of many European analysts this year, especially as an alternative to Germany.
The July inflation figures are expected to show prices rising in France at a slower rate than in Germany for the first time in years. This reversal should give some lift to the French franc, which is one of the weakest currencies in the European Monetary System. And in the way things work in monetary policy, this lift from the bottom for the franc is supposed to give the French central bank the leaway it needs to lower interest rates without damaging the currency.
But other things have not gone as they should.
For example, Japan's unexpected interest rate cut last week is not likely to have a salutary effect in Europe, where Germany sets the pace on interest rates and monetary policy.
In fact, the dollar rally this year makes it more likely that the Germans will raise their interest rates to fight inflation and defend the mark, which is at its lowest level since October of 1989. This will likely limit the French Government's maneuverability regarding rates. Analysts like Stephane B. Michel, president of Bertrand Michel Securities in New York, and Nicola Mann at Salomon Brothers in London now think the French rate cut will be delayed until the fall when German intentions might be more clear.
In recent months, Acadian Asset Management in Boston has found the stock markets in Belgium and Italy to be preferable to France's. Ronald D. Frashure, the firm's executive vice president, said Italy and Belgium were better values because the ratios of prices to cash flow and other measures of reltive cost and value have been more attractive.
The firm has had no investment in France in some of its global portfolios that include stocks, bonds and cash, and a lower than normal French investment level in its all-equity portfolios for institutional investors. These include state pension funds, including that of Massachusetts; universities, including Harvard, and companies like International Paper.
But Mr. Frashure had said that a drop in the market or a further slowdown in the economy would make France more attractive. Both those shifts are now underway.
At Salomon Brothers, Ms. Mann and Danielle Kadeyen have just come around to a more favorable view of France -- but with caveats. "Spain and Italy still look cheaper," said Ms. Mann. "But we are beginning to tell investors to take some advantage of weakness but not to take an aggressive stand."
Mr. Michel said that the worst news on France may not have been heard yet, that it will come if the Germans raise interest rates. "That will be a good time to buy," he said, adding that eventually with both the German and French economies slowing, some easing of interest rates will follow.
With Salomon Brothers predicting a rise in the CAC-40 to 2,000 by year end and Bertrand Michel looking for a jump to 1,950 if there is an interest rate cut, there is a potential gain of 14 percent to 17 percent. So the French slump, especially if it deepens a little more, could make the wait for the interest rate cut worth the price. "France may not be the best bet but it is a reasonable bet today," said Mr. Michel.
Elsewhere, the Bank of Japan surprised most analysts last week by suddenly cutting its official discount rate to 5.5 percent from 6 percent. But instead of providing a hoped-for boost, it gave the Tokyo market just a one-day rally. And if it was an attempt to bolster a market hurt by the latest scandal involving the top brokerage firms, it did not work. After rising 817.80 points or 3.51 percent on Monday, the day of the interest rate cut, the Nikkei 225 fell each day for the rest of the week, wiping out all of the gains and more. On Friday, the Nikkei 225 closed at 22,898.34, down 1,210.42 points from Monday's close and at its lowest level since Jan. 16.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index surged 96.14 points or 2.5 percent on Thursday and Friday, closing at 3,892.71. The move came as the British and Chinese governments reached broad agreement on a financial plan for a new airport. But there still could be problems if China balks when it is consulted on the details of the airport plan.

Goliath Joins Goliath in the Computer Wars 

For the computer industry, this is the deal of the decade. Apple Computer Inc. and the International Business Machines Corporation, the two largest personal computer makers, agreed last week to share their technology, develop new technology jointly and even sell each other's products. New high-end personal computers and work stations are expected to emerge from the match. But it will take years before any brand new products make it to market. The deal gives Apple use of I.B.M.'s superquick RS/6000 chip, which would be made under license by Motorola Inc. It gives I.B.M. access to Apple's nifty new operating software, code-named "Pink." The alliance also leaves some powerful players out in the cold. Microsoft Inc., which developed I.B.M.'s current software standard and is increasingly seen as a rival to Big Blue, has no part in the deal. Also in doubt is the future of Apple's host of Japanese suppliers like Sony that produce everything from memory chips to disk drives for the company. All those parts are also made by I.B.M.
 
A Farewell to Power Master
 
The message from the government was clear: You can sell high-test malt liquor, you just have to give it a meek-sounding name. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said as much when it told the G. Heileman Brewing Company it could not sell a new malt liquor under the Power Master label. Power Master sounds, well, a little too potent, the bureau said. And it is. The brew has 5.9 percent alcohol content versus 5.5 percent for regular malt liquor and 3.5 percent for beer. Activists like the Rev. Calvin Butts in in Harlem also contend that Power Master, like the malt-liquor category in general, is aimed at poor, young black men. But the company takes exception, arguing that Power Master was supposed to be an upscale drink. Whatever its new name, the drink must fight for shelf space with meekly named rivals like Colt 45, also from Heilman; Red Bull, from Stroh Brewing Company, and Old English 800, from the Pabst Brew Company -- which is still being advertised, unchallenged, as "Eight Ball."
 
Shell Oil, Gentle With the Knife
 
After a delay of almost five years, the recession in the oil patch has finally caught up with the Shell Oil Company. Most other oil companies began dismissing workers way back in the mid-1980's. Shell was able to retain most of them and continue expanding production in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico because it was more efficient than its rivals. No more. Hurt by falling natural gas prices and lackluster profits, the company announced last week that it would trim its work force over the next 12 to 18 months by 4,650 people. But it will leave its $2.3 billion capital budget intact. Shell, which is a unit of the Royal/Dutch Shell Group, has a total work force of 31,000 in the United States. The company has said it will be gentle when it cuts. Voluntary severance, attrition and a lot of counseling will accompany the knife.
 
Truth in Juice
 
The Food and Drug Administration is cracking down. First it was the word "fresh" -- you can't use the word unless your product really is. Then it was the "no cholesterol" claims that are pasted on everything from salad oil to spaghetti. Last week it was juice. The F.D.A. wants Americans to know what they are drinking. By November, beverage makers will have to list not only the total amount of juice in such things as soft drinks but specific percentages of each juice used in a blended drink. Previously, "100 percent juice," could be used on a product sold as raspberry juice, even if only a drop of the expensive stuff was blended into cheaper apple juice. Companies will have to rewrite about 2,500 labels and even rename products. The industry is begging for more time.
 
Soft Spots in Boeing's Backlog?
 
The Boeing Commercial Airplane Company may be doing fine, but its customers are going broke. Take America West Airlines Inc., the Phoenix-based carrier that two weeks ago filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11. It is the fourth American carrier to file since December. America West had ordered $1.5 billion worth of new airplanes from Boeing. Those orders are now being re-evaluated, America West said last week. Because of the airline industry's slump, Boeing has been quietly stretching out delivery dates for its planes. So far there have been no outright cancellations, but analysts say it is just a matter of time before some of Boeing's backlog of orders dissappear.
 
One More Banking Loss
 
Bank performance across the country has been nearly uniform -- losses everywhere. Last week, First Interstate Bancorp, California's fourth-largest bank holding company and a powerhouse in the West, joined the growing list. The bank said it would report losses of about $80 million for the second quarter, would increase its provisions for loan losses and planned to cut its dividend to 30 cent from 75 cents. The announcement surprised the analysts. First Interstate has been regarded as a well-run bank with a good deposit base. On the news, the stock fell $5.375 to $26 a share and closed the week at $26.875.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Tokyo Lifts the Dow
 
Who says the world is not one big market? Last week, Japan's central bank lowered its discount rate a half-point to 5.5 percent in an effort to get its rapidly rolling economy rolling even faster. The Bush Administration has been urging Tokyo to do that for almost a year. On the news, the Dow Jones industrial average shot up 51.66 points to 2,958.41. Why the spillover from Tokyo to New York? Japan's lower rates, analysts think, will make investments in America more attractive. And a faster-running Japanese economy is certain to suck in more American exports. Japan as the world's economic engine is something new. Traditionally, that job (and the inflation that goes with it) was America's.
 
Going Private, Soviet Style
 
Last week, when the Soviet Parliament approved a law allowing private ownership of property, it stood to make a bundle: Selling state-owned properties to Soviet citizens and to foreigners could bring the central government as much as much as 450 billion rubles, some economists say. That is about $250 billion, at the commercial exchange rate. But the new law comes with a catch -- and it is a big one. It exempts certain industries and properties from the law's provisions. Just which industries? The law doesn't say. "This law is primarily a denationalization law and privatization is only a minor part of it," explained Anatoly I. Lukyanov, chairman of the Parliament. That distinction, too, could use clarifying.
 
A Well-Tarnished Bank
 
The Luxembourg-based Bank of Credit and Commerce International has long been suspected of doing nasty things. Money laundering, for instance, to which it admitted in January when it paid Washington $15 million in fines and was told to sell its controlling interest in First American Bankshares. Last week B.C.C.I., which has more than $20 billion in assets and operates in 69 countries, was shut down by the Luxembourg Monetary Institute and the Bank of England. Its problems tarnished the reputation of former Defense Secretary Clark Clifford, who served as chairman of First American and whose law firm represented B.C.C.I. in the United States.
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY

 
Don't Count on Construction
 
The real estate recovery is more crab than jack rabbit. Every step in one direction comes with a slow step in another direction. Just consider spending on new construction. It dropped by 0.9 percent in May following a sharp increase of 1.2 percent for April, according to the Commerce Department. "In total dollar volume, the increase in residential single family homes was $88 billion," said Richard Peach, an economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association. "But there was a decrease of $120 billion on the commercial side." The decline was a disappointment, and Mr. Peach expects that slump to continue for five years to a decade.
 
Weighing Those Jobless Figures
 
Unemployment usually rises slightly even after the economy has bottomed out. Businesses typically wait until they are sure a recovery is in place before they hire. But unemployment during this recession has been rising a little too long for some economists. Last week the Labor Department reported it reached 7 percent in June, higher than at any time since last October. "It is a tricky report," said Alan Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Company. "Fewer people are working, but they are working longer hours," he said. If it were not for all that overtime, Mr. Sinai said, "the report would seriously damage the notion that we're in a recovery."
 
The Auto Sales Data
 
Are auto sales finally rebounding? It depends on how you read the numbers. Most analysts compare sales last month to sales for the same month a year earlier. From that perspective, things are bad, with sales down 10.1 percent in June. But if examined as a continuum, the picture is brighter: month-to-month, sales have been improving since April.
 
On the Bright Side
 
Not all the messages about the economy are mixed. The National Association of Purchasing Managers reported last week a surge in its monthly index. The index, which uses a complicated formula to determine how many of the nation's businesses are increasing their orders for goods, rose to 50.9 percent for June from 45.9 percent in May. Readings above 50 indicate that the economy is expanding.

Even B-Schoolers Say It's a Bummer

BYLINE: By JEFF MADRICK; Jeff Madrick is a New York-based business correspondent for NBC and an author.

 BODY:
I had braced for a showdown at my 20th Harvard Business School reunion last month. Asked to speak on a panel about leveraged buyouts -- had they helped or hurt American competitiveness? -- I came prepared to denounce them to an unbelieving, unrepentant audience.
After all, when I was at the B-school, critics called it the West Point of Capitalism. I didn't expect more than a few supporters -- maybe Mark Drucker, who still sports a bump on his head from the Columbia University demonstrations of 1968, or Art Marks, who traveled to the Deep South to fight for desegregation in the 1960's, or Archie Edwards, a former art student at Harvard College. 
 I was wrong. From all around the room came expressions of doubt and concern -- and this from successful business executives in their 40's who have little reason to be bitter about Wall Street. What became very clear very fast was that these men and women are deeply worried about what's coming next. Concerns have trickled up: These people, who mostly have it all, were sounding very much like people who don't.
The panel discussion brought surprises from the beginning. The first speaker was a classmate, now a partner at one of Wall Street's most respected investment banks. Almost immediately, he conceded that leveraged buyouts had gone too far and so had the size of fees paid to bankers like him. Then he polled the group of perhaps 75 classmates. More than half said they believed that L.B.O.'s were bad for the economy.
Next came my turn to speak. I couldn't help but point out that my investment banker colleague was "mea-culpa-ing" all the way to the bank, a phenomenon common among my acquaintances on the Street.
I presented my case against L.B.O.'s -- data demonstrating the sorry state of productivity in America, the unprecedented growth of debt, the standstill in business investment and the freeze in the standard of living over the last decade. I received a far warmer reception than I anticipated. When Sam Hayes, a Harvard finance professor, followed me on the panel, he also criticized L.B.O.'s, albeit more mildly.
I began to wonder if L.B.O.'s were simply an easy target. But during the question and answer period that followed, it became clear there were deeper concerns about the economy, even anger over who was responsible, among these men and women who came from Dallas and Houston and Atlanta and Los Angeles and from all points of the Northeast. These were not the optimists I went to school with.
How will we unwind all this debt, asked one. Isn't it possible we might not come out of this recession for many years because of this level of debt, asked another. Why was it that minorities did not get their share of the economic pie in the 80's? Did too much of the investment in L.B.O.'s go to the wrong place? What about investment in education? There was even some antagonism among these generally conservative business executives toward unbridled market deregulation.
In my reporting for NBC, I have run across anger and confusion among all kinds of investors and workers who have had a pound or two of flesh taken out of them by the buccaneers of the last decade and the recession of this one.
There have been owners of insurance policies at the failed Executive Life and frightened retirees whose money was managed by First Capital Life, both insurance companies that invested heavily in "junk bonds." There have been elderly people who had bought junk-bond mutual funds without knowing it and are now sitting with hefty losses. There have been doctors and business executives seething over failed investments in limited partnerships sold to them by the cream of Wall Street brokerage firms. There have been jobless workers selling the family car because their unemployment compensation has run out.
Add to this list my former classmates from the Harvard Business School. Perhaps that should not be so surprising. But these are successful men and women who have more than their share of influence in this country, and the extent of their concerns says something about how deep the trouble is -- and how possible a serious political backlash is. These people believe that relief of our many economic ills is not waiting for us around the corner. And the undercurrent of anxiety about the economy stands in sharp contrast to the pious assurances from Washington that all is well. Many from the B-school think it is not. And that -- from the West Point of Capitalism -- is a telling sign.

HEADLINE: Israel Not Budging on Settlement Expansion

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, July 6

 BODY:
The Israeli Government is convinced it faces a tough choice between continuing its expansion of West Bank settlements or getting aid from the United States for the absorption of Soviet Jews. And it has made a clear decision: settlements will continue.
Israel greeted President Bush's latest criticism of its West Bank settlement expansion program, last Monday, with a low-key response that masked a deep and growing concern that the state may be forced to pay a heavy price for its settlement drive.Even though Mr. Bush softened his criticism by saying he did not believe there should be any quid pro quo between settlements and additional aid, officials here are convinced that Washington may refuse Jerusalem's request for $10 billion in loan guarantees for immigrant housing -- if Israel does not stop building new West Bank settlements or does not show more flexibility in the peace process. 
 Every day, ministers and members of Parliament publicly debate what Israel should do. Economists offer draconian predictions of what will happen if the money does not come.
And Finance Minister Yitzhak Modai has made it clear that Israelis should be ready for a contingency plan of huge tax increases and deep cuts in social services if the American aid is not granted.
All this comes two months before Israel even intends to present its formal request for loan guarantees -- and before anyone in the Bush Administration has publicly made any connection between settlements and the peace process or the request for aid.
Still, said a senior aide to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir: "We've learned not to take anything for granted here. If they're unhappy with us, we could have problems even if there is no direct linkage made."
Asked to analyze the situation on Tuesday, Oded Ben Ami, Israeli radio's correspondent in Washington, said, "One must be blind to think there will not be a linkage; there will be one."
But the settlement activity continues nonetheless. In fact, Housing Minister Ariel Sharon dedicated a new neighborhood in a northern West Bank settlement the very day President Bush's latest remarks were reported here, saying: "The settlements are not an obstacle to peace. The settlements are the best obstacle to war."
At the same time, his office has hired architects to create master plans for new Jewish cities in the West Bank that could accommodate 500,000 people or more, although formal Government approval and funding would be needed to carry out those plans.
The request for the $10 billion was first made during the Persian Gulf war, but at Washington's request the formal submission was put off until September. When Mr. Modai first raised the question, Israel was still being praised for its restraint during the gulf war.
But last Monday Mr. Modai complained that the expected recompense for that restraint had not come.
"I have a very uneasy feeling about the expectations that we had because, up to this very moment, I do not see that the position taken by the state of Israel, which was the key at the time, is being rewarded in any way," he said.
But Mr. Modai, like others in Government, said Israel would not change its policies or budge an inch, even if the price was a rejection of the aid request.
 "We're a stiff-necked people," Mr. Modai said. "Whoever doesn't remember that should read the Bible." Mr. Shamir and other officials have said essentially the same thing.
But Michael Bruno, governor of Israel's Central Bank, warned that "there's no way to absorb the massive immigration without help from the United States."
And as he announced his contingency plan, to be carried out if the aid is not approved, Mr. Modai said: "If we have to implement the plan, a very heavy burden will fall on the shoulders of the Israeli citizen, both present and the future. If, God forbid, we have to implement it, it will be very tough."
Mr. Shamir said: "I hope the pressures and conditions will stop. I hope the U.S. aid for immigrant absorption will come, just as it has in the past."

HEADLINE: Weicker and Legislative Leaders Resolve Little in a Short Meeting

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, July 6

 BODY:
Legislative leaders met with Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. for only 45 minutes today in their fourth day of talks to come up with a tax plan to end the budget impasse here and enable 20,000 furloughed state employees to return to work.
Democratic leaders continued their discussions after Governor Weicker left their offices for the day at 1:45 P.M. Another session with Mr. Weicker was scheduled for Sunday at 9 A.M.
Little was said today as the short session broke up and Governor Weicker walked from the Legislative Office Building back to the Capitol, surrounded by television crews and news photographers.
There had been few expectations that today's meeting would resolve the divisions between income-tax advocates and opponents.
 
A Partial Shutdown
 But even without progress in the talks, it appeared likely that Monday could be the last day of the partial shutdown of state government ordered by the Governor. Mr. Weicker has until then to sign or veto a temporary budget resolution passed by the House and Senate at the start of the week or it will take effect without his signature. And any veto, legislators say, would immediately be overridden.
Governor Weicker has said that once the resolution takes effect, authorizing state spending for 14 days, he will end the partial shutdown of state offices that has furloughed nearly 40 percent of the work force.
Mr. Weicker said he would announce his intentions on the resolution Sunday morning, before the talks resume.
Connecticut has been without a budget since Monday, the start of the new fiscal year, prompting the Governor's shutdown of offices. Mr. Weicker said he had no choice but to suspend nonessential services, because laws require the state to have a balanced budget, and he had no budget at all.
 
Long-Term Source of Revenues
 Mr. Weicker, however, had vetoed two budgets approved by the House and Senate that relied on a broad expansion of the state's 8 percent sales tax to cover currently exempt goods and services.
The Governor insists that the budget provide a reliable long-term source of revenue while stimulating the economy by cutting the state's high sales and corporation taxes, and he says he cannot see how to accomplish those goals without an income tax.
The meetings between Mr. Weicker and the Democratic and Republican leaders of the House and Senate began Wednesday, the day after the Senate killed an income-tax plan that the House had approved and Mr. Weicker had said he would sign. It was the second income-tax plan to die in the legislature.
In the last two days the pace and length of the sessions between the Governor and the legislative leaders has slowed, as the legislative leaders have begun talking with their members and consulting on their negotiations.

HEADLINE: James Pie, Parochial-School Advocate, Dies at 69

BYLINE: By MARVINE HOWE

 BODY:
James L. J. Pie, an advocate of state funds for private and parochial schools and a lawyer who wrote legislation that created the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transit Authority, died on June 30 at his home in Philadelphia. He was 69 years old.
He died of heart failure said his wife, Mary. 
 Mr. Pie joined the Philadelphia Solitictor's office in 1957 and retired in 1979 as a deputy solicitor. Specializing in mass transit issues, he drafted legislation for the transit authority and assisted in the development of the city's commuter tunnel and airport high-speed rail line.
In 1959 he founded the Pennsylvania Federation of Citizens for Educational Freedom, a nonprofit advocacy group seeking refunds for parents of children in private and parochial schools.
In the late 1960's, Mr. Pie wrote legislation for the State of Pennsylvania that authorized state funds for private and parochial schools and the refunds to parents. In 1973, the United States Supreme Court declared the legislation unconstitutional.
Mr. Pie, a native of Philadelphia, graduated from La Salle College and earned a law degree from the Catholic University of America in 1950.
In addition to his wife, the former Mary Frances Hensler, he is survived by four daughters, Maureen Pie-Bruno and Christina Pie O'Keefe, both of Philadelphia, Maria C. Hughes of Westmont, N.J., Elena C. of Philadelphia; five sons, Thomas, of St. Clairsville, Ohio, Joseph, of Philadelphia, Christopher, of Hatboro, Pa., John, of Wilmington, Del., and Paul, of London; a brother, John of Cherry Hill, N.J., and 10 grandchildren.

HEADLINE: IN NOTE TO SOVIETS, BUSH URGES ACCORD ON STRATEGIC ARMS

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 6

 BODY:
In a move to prepare for a superpower summit meeting this summer, President Bush sent President Mikhail S. Gorbachev a message today asking the Soviets to show more flexibility in negotiations on a treaty limiting long-range nuclear weapons, Administration officials said.
Mr. Bush suggested that Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and the Soviet Foreign Minister, Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh, meet as soon as next week in Washington, if it would help seal agreement on a strategic arms reduction treaty, the officials said. 
 The failure to agree on such a treaty has delayed a summit meeting between the superpowers.
 
Meeting Deemed Helpful
 In his message to the Kremlin, Mr. Bush, who is spending the weekend at the Presidential retreat at Camp David, Md., suggested that a Baker-Bessmertnykh meeting might be helpful, but only if the Soviets were ready to do business and if Mr. Bessmertnykh had full authority to deal.
A White House spokesman, Roman Popadiuk, confirmed that the United States Ambassador in Moscow, Jack F. Matlock Jr., delivered the message to Mr. Gorbachev today. Tass, the Soviet press agency, said Mr. Matlock's message was "urgent." Mr. Popadiuk said he had no details about the message. But those details were obtained from other Administration officials.
One such official said Mr. Bush's message was an attempt "to keep the Start process moving" after meetings over the last two weeks in Geneva, where the chief American negotiator, Under Secretary of State Reginald Bartholomew, made little progress in arms talks with a delegation of Soviet officials led by Aleksei Obukhov, a Deputy Foreign Minister.
 
Lack of Flexibility
 In today's message to Mr. Gorbachev, President Bush said that he had sent the American team to Geneva with a good deal of authority and flexibility to do business, but that the Soviet negotiators apparently did not have similar flexibility.
The American team included senior arms control officials from the State Department, the Defense Department and the National Security Council. By contrast, Administration officials said, the Soviet team included no high-ranking officials authorized to approve or initiate new positions.
A White House official said Mr. Bush's message was meant not as a threat but as a realistic statement of what remains to be done in arms-control talks if a summit meeting is to be held this summer, as the two Presidents have indicated thay they want.
"Both leaders would like to have a summit," said a White House official. "But I don't think either of them is so seized with the notion of a summit that they would make compromises on a Start agreement that they would not otherwise make. We want a good Start treaty, a treaty that you can defend and get approved by the Senate."
The treaty, intended to reduce United States and Soviet stockpiles of long-range nuclear missiles, bombers and submarines by 30 percent, has been in negotiation on and off in Geneva for more than nine years. President Reagan announced the opening of talks in May 1982. The talks began a month later, broke off in December 1983, when the Soviet Union walked out to protest American deployment of intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe, and then resumed in March 1985.
 
Bush's Conditions
 Speaking with reporters today on the golf course at Holly Hills Country Club in Maryland, Mr. Bush offered no further details on the contents of his note to Mr. Gorbachev, other than to say, "I want to get their team moving as forward as fast as ours is."
 "I think he's very interested ," Mr. Bush said of Mr. Gorbachev. "What I want to do is be sure he energizes his bureaucracy just as we've energized ours. It's that kind of message that went to him. It's normal diplomacy."
 Mr. Bush, standing beside Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d on the ninth green, seemed to indicate that he wanted to hold a summit session before the end of July. Mr. Gorbachev said on Friday that this was also his target.
 Mr. Baker told reporters that he thought it was possible to hold a summit meeting this month. "The idea is that we're getting short on time if we're going to have a summit before the end of July," he said when asked why Mr. Bush sent Mr. Matlock to see Mr. Gorbachev on Saturday.
 President Bush has made completion of the treaty a condition for his next full-scale summit meeting with Mr. Gorbachev. Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev are expected to discuss the treaty negotiations, along with many other issues, when they meet in London for a two-hour session over lunch on July 17, after a conference of the seven leading industrial democracies. Mr. Gorbachev is expected to repeat his plea for large-scale financial or economic aid at that time.
 
Timing of Sumit Meeting
 The State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, said this week that "important work remains to be done" after Mr. Bartholomew's latest talks with Soviet officials in Geneva. The United States' position on timing of a summit meeting has fluctuated with the ups and downs of arms negotiations. In February, Mr. Baker said he hoped that the talks could be held in the first half of the year.
Last month senior American officials passed the word to journalists that the summit session might be held in June. They then hinted that Mr. Bush might go to Moscow in July.
Mr. Gorbachev sees a summit meeting as a chance to impress Mr. Bush with his determination to revamp the Soviet economy. Hard-liners in the Administration have seized on that opportunity to press the Soviets for concessions on the treaty limiting long-range nuclear weapons.
 
Agreement in Phases
 The United States and the Soviet Union have agreed to reduce their arsenals of long-range missiles and heavy bombers in three phases over seven years, and they have also agreed on numerical limits for nuclear warheads. But four major disputes have blocked agreement on a treaty for months.
The four disputes, as described by American officials, concern procedures for inspecting missile factories; ways to distinguish new types of strategic ballistic missiles from modified versions of old ones; methods to limit the encryption of engineering data broadcast from missile test flights, and formulas to reduce the number of warheads on missiles not being dismantled.
The disputes all involve technical issues, but are important in the effort to insure that neither country cheats on the treaty, which would produce the most significant reduction of superpower nuclear arsenals since the beginning of the arms race.
The delays in concluding an arms treaty and scheduling a summit meeting may exasperate Mr. Gorbachev, but actually seem to have some domestic political benefits for Mr. Bush. In the last few weeks, Republican and Democratic members of Congress have said the Administration seemed to be rushing too fast to complete a strategic arms agreement, with the result that negotiators might make "mistakes."

HEADLINE: Connecticut Fumes Over Budget Impasse

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OCCUM, Conn., July 5

 BODY:
Behind the counter at the Occum Package Store in this small eastern Connecticut village, Dawn Raymond does the work bartenders usually do. She listens.
The last few days she has been listening to short-tempered talk from the people here, much of it about Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. and his order on Tuesday to close much of Connecticut's government because of the budget fight in Hartford. "They're basically talking about the shutdown, that's all," Ms. Raymond said. "They're afraid of losing whatever they have." 
 Near the end of the first week of closed Thruway toilets, shuttered Motor Vehicle offices and barricaded public parks, the mood in Connecticut is irritable. People across the state are annoyed at its budget troubles and are beginning to let loose a new fury at the politicians whom they blame.
The growing anger did not allow much room for careful analysis, and some of those who raged loudest against the lawmakers' inability to agree on a budget did not acknowledge that legislators often cite public pressure to explain their votes. Many who disagreed vehemently with Mr. Weicker's support for an income tax said they had not supported his independent candidacy in the first place.
In interviews across the state today, some people were puzzled about why they needed a state government at all. Many said that after a lot of thought, they were sure of one thing: the trouble in Hartford will mean trouble at home, from higher taxes to layoffs of state workers, ever-shrinking state services and the ripple effect of fiscal austerity.
Governor Weicker came in for a large share of the blame because of his push for an income tax and his inability to control the legislators. "He doesn't really care about us," Ms. Raymond said as she rang up a quart of beer.
At Dom's Holiday Gulf Station on Union Street in Waterbury, Jim Norkus, who was pumping gas, said of the Governor: "It's almost like he's trying to punish everybody."
Over lunch at the Valley Diner in Derby, Angela DeGregoria, a bookkeeper, said Mr. Weicker seemed to like the power of his new office too much, and she suggested a few layoffs on the executive staff. The Governor, she said, moved too fast in proposing a broad new income tax just when people can afford it least.
"I know he's trying to fix the state finances," she said. "But he's trying to make us bite off more than we can chew. Taxpayers have enough to worry about."
In Danbury, Elaine Gerrish took a minute off from shopping with her infant grandnephew. The mention of Mr. Weicker, she said, was just enough to get her blood boiling. And she wanted to make clear that she was against the income tax proposed by the Governor, who inherited part of the Squibb pharmaceutical fortune. "It's the middle-class person that's going to suffer," she said. "Not Mr. Weicker's friends in Greenwich, that's for sure."
But Mr. Weicker, an independent who was elected without support of either major party, was was hardly the only politician who was singled out. The Governor's predecessors, other state officials and the legislators with whom Mr. Weicker is at war were also the objects of verbal abuse.
Richard Bimonte of Ridgefield called the current budget impasse the latest example of the hypocrisy in state government, saying politicians regularly ignore hard fiscal decisions until it is too late. "It's indicative of the fact that the politicians go their own way," Mr. Bimonte said as he waited for a bus in the rain. "They're always talking about fiscal responsibility, but they don't practice it themselves."
 
Lack of U.S. Aid Blamed
 On Ella T. Grasso Boulevard in New Haven, James A. Thompson, a city Parks Department supervisor, was also angry at politicians. But his targets were a little farther from home. The Federal Government, he said, can no longer afford to keep sending money off to help people in other parts of the world as the problems at home grow out of control.
Connecticut's problems, Mr. Thompson said, are beyond repair by local officials. "We just can't come down on the local politicians -- the governors and the mayors -- because it's happening in too many places," he said. "What we need at this point is Federal funds. If we don't have the money, the governors and the mayors can't balance the budget. The Federal Government is at fault."
Some of those interviewed suggested that the closing of much of the state government might prove a worthwhile experiment. One Fairfield County man, who declined to be identified, described how he broke the news of the budget impasse to his wife. "I said, 'They shut the state down.' And she said, 'What does that mean?' And I said, 'I can't think of anything.' "
But others are confronting the effects of what is already shut down as well as what may be coming. Although the state has not stopped public assistance payments, Lisa Brown, a social service worker for the town of Ansonia, said welfare recipients were overloading her office's phone lines with their worries about what might happen if the benefits do stop. And Ms. Brown said too little attention had been paid to people like her sister, a state worker who had been furloughed and was temporarily without the paycheck that helped support her family.
 
Gas Sales Drop Near Offices
 Dominic Rio, for the last 25 years the Dom of Dom's Holiday Gulf in Waterbury, said he detected a decline in gas sales since the workers in the state offices near his station were placed on unpaid leave. His station attendant, Mr. Norkus, said he had his own worries. After five and a half years of working toward a college degree he decided it was time to finish his schooling.
But when he took his financial aid application to the University of Connecticut at Storrs last week, he said, he ran into an unexpected roadblock. Because of the budget crisis, the financial aid office was closed. "I just worry about what's going to happen," he said.
Here in Occum, Dawn Raymond said, the shutdown provided a little lesson in economics. The package store, she said, relies on the state garage down the road for a good bit of its business. At the end of a long day, she said, state road workers assigned to the garage like to stop by for a package to bring home with them.
"Let's put it this way," she said: "Five days a week after they get out, they come here." At the end of this week, the road workers did not get out of work because they never went in to work, and the revenues of the Occum Package Store suffered.
 
Some Call Fears Overblown
 Some of those who have been watching the machinations over the budget from afar said politicians' warnings of dire consequences could sometimes be taken too seriously. Klaus J. Abstoss, who was born in Germany and moved to the United States five years ago, raised this possibility at the Greenwich train station while waiting for the Metro-North train to Manhattan, where he works for an international trading company.
In Europe, he observed, tax increases are imposed with much less debate.
"Maybe," he said, "it's -- What do you call it in the States? -- a power play. It's like baseball. It's like football." In the end, he said, somebody will score.
For others, the Hartford embarrassment is an unusual, if not always scintillating, glimpse of how government works. Chip Waterman, a 17-year-old who is spending the summer working at Brenner's Florsheim shoe store in the Danbury Fair Mall, is opposed to the income tax. Mostly, he said, because his father is opposed to it.
This weekend, he saw one effect of such political battles. His Boy Scout survival club had to cancel its monthly camping trip. The state park where it had been scheduled was closed.
But that did not diminish his interest in politics. From time to time, he said, he turns on the television to check on developments. But, he noted, there are not that many developments.
"I turn on the news to see if something happened," Mr. Waterman said. "Then I turn it off: It's all the politicians sitting around not doing anything."

Thompson, a city Parks Department supervisor in New Haven. "If we don't have the money, the governors and the mayors can't balance the budget. The Federal Government is at fault."

Here's Where It Began For Four Ninja Turtles

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NORTHAMP TON, Mass.

 BODY:
There was a time when talk about sewers in this New England city drew little more than a sniff from buttoned-down residents.
But eight years ago, all that began to change. 
 Four crime-fighting turtles, armed with karate chops, wacky weapons and adolescent wisecracks crawled from the storm drains into comic books aided by two local cartoonists. And, dudes, the rest has been Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtle history.
As the story goes, the Turtles were mutated to human-size by contaminated sewer ooze, then trained as Ninja warriors by a similarly afflicted rat with an Asian background. Named for Renaissance artists, the slime-green warriors have gone international with astounding success. The Turtles, and related paraphernalia like Pizza Thrower tanks and Flushomatic torture chambers, are now the nation's top-selling toys. Sales hit $1 billion last year.
For Northampton, a city of about 30,000 people in central Massachusetts, being the birthplace of Turtlemania fits somewhere between its claims to fame as home of President Calvin Coolidge and a large annual homosexual-rights parade.
Once a working-class mill town, many residents refer to Northampton as "little San Francisco" because of its eclectic mix of artists, writers, liberal-minded academicians, shopkeepers, executives and old-line Yankees. The invasion of the highly commercial Turtles has come as a shock to some, and a delight to others.
In a time of local budget difficulties, the Turtles and their creators, Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird, have also been a source of economic salvation for the area.
"We're hurting like every other Massachusetts community," said Mayor David B. Musante Jr., who has seen state aid to the city drop for three straight years. Earlier this year, he asked Mr. Eastman and Mr. Laird for $6 million to set up a trust to support art and music programs at Northampton's schools.
That particular request, one of hundreds the cartoonists have received since their success, was not granted. But other gifts from Mr. Laird and Mr. Eastman to the cities and towns here in Pioneer Valley have been generous.
In the past year, the two have donated money for a playground in Westhampton, a library and playground in Worthington, and projects for the Northampton Recreation Department.
In February, Mr. Eastman gave $48,000 and permission to use the Turtles' carefully guarded and copyrighted name and image, for the environmental education of elementary school students in Maine, his home state. He has also leased space in Northampton's historic Roundhouse building for a comic art museum that will be free. It is expected to open later this year.
The two low-profile creators own homes here and say they plan to remain in Northampton. Local officials, who say the two have pumped $2 million to $3 million into the local economy with their public and private investments, are jubilant.
"They fit in really well here," said Mary Ford, president of the Northampton City Council. "And the people in the arts and human services are glad there's someone around with money."
But the embrace of Turtlemania here in the valley has not been unanimous.
Some critics object to the commercial saturation of the Turtles, whose faces are on more than 2,000 products from bedsheets to baby shoes. A handful of local schools in the region recently banned "Turtle play" after children repeatedly karate chopped each other. And some parents have boycotted the Turtles altogether.
"The Ninja Turtles were not designed for children," said Elizabeth Miller Austin, a child psychologist who has banned Turtle play at her preschool in South Deerfield. "They were designed for people who think that turtles as superheroes are funny."
Still, the Turtles are likely to continue to get red carpet treatment here, at least until the economy improves or some child does irreversible damage with a karate chop, say most residents.
In addition to their warrior skills, "the Turtles also convey positive messages, including the importance of friendship and the need to protect the quality of our environment," concluded an editorial printed last spring in the local newspaper, The Hampshire Daily Gazette.
"Eastman and Laird, by their own actions, are sending similar messages to area residents," the editorial said. "Thanks dudes."

HEADLINE: Gang Investigated in Tourist Slaying

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
Detectives investigating the stray-bullet slaying of a young woman tourist in Chinatown said yesterday that they had found two bullets and several witnesses in the shooting and had focused the hunt for a killer on members or former members of the notorious Ghost Shadows gang.
There were no arrests and no suspects were identified, investigators said, but accounts by eyewitnesses indicated that the shooting of Rhona Lantin, a 26-year-old visitor from Silver Spring, Md., was an accident, the result of a tragic random shot fired in a violent street gang's internal dispute. 
 "This is not a guess -- witnesses have led us to say it," Detective Sgt. Brian Kennedy of the Fifth Precinct said yesterday as investigators continued to canvass Chinatown's byways for witnesses and associates of a gang long entrenched in extortion, robbery, murder and illegal gambling.
As friends and relatives grieved for the slain woman, new details of her life in the United States and in the Philippines, where she grew up, emerged in interviews. They spoke of academic achievement and a career of great promise, of plans for marriage and a family -- and of the senseless death of a thoughtful, kind and popular woman.
 
Fatal Bullet Recovered
 Reconstructing the crime from witness accounts and forensic evidence, detectives said the gunman apparently stood on the northeast corner of Mulberry and Bayard Streets and, amid a barrage of exploding holiday fireworks at 11:30 P.M. Thursday, fired at someone who was either on the same corner or across on Mulberry's west side.
One bullet hit the iron grating of a store on the northwest corner and fell to the pavement, where it was found by the police. Another crashed through the windshield of a car carrying six young people north on Mulberry Street, and struck the right temple of Ms. Lantin, who was in the front passenger seat.
The woman, a graduate student at the University of Maryland and an agricultural economist for the United States Department of Agriculture in Washington who had come to New York for a reunion of classmates and friends and for a late-evening meal in Chinatown, died nine hours later at St. Vincent's Hospital.
The fatal bullet was recovered yesterday by the Medical Examiner's Office, the police said. But investigators said the caliber of the gun from which it was fired was not immediately determined; ballistics tests were expected to be completed tomorrow.
 
Memories of Another Killing
 As Ms. Lantin's friends and family canceled reunion arrangements and made plans for a funeral in the Philippines, New Yorkers reflected again on the random killing of a holiday tourist, evoking memories of Brian Watkins, a visitor from Utah, who was stabbed to death last Labor Day weekend in a midtown subway station by a gang of youths who had robbed his parents.
Amid intense pressure for progress in the case, the police assigned dozens of detectives from the Elizabeth Street Precinct, the Manhattan South Detective Task Force and the District Attorney's Jade Squad, which focuses on Asian-American crime. They conducted hundreds of interviews in Chinatown.
But faced with the traditional fear of violent Asian street gangs, detectives in the early hours of the investigation found no one who knew anything about the killing, which occurred on a crowded corner during one of the busiest nights of the year in the district.
Yesterday, however, investigators said the intensive canvassing had begun to yield results. They found several witnesses who, while unable to identify the gunman by name, provided enough information to narrow the search to members or former members of the Ghost Shadows.
The information was specific enough for investigators to say the shooting was not related to a dispute between Ghost Shadows and some other gang, but appeared rather to be part of an internal dispute among gang members or former members.
 
'Very Helpful Person'
 It was unclear how many shots were fired, or whether the shooting was a gunfight or the work of only one gunman. "Witnesses couldn't tell how many shots were fired because of all the firecrackers that were going off," Detective Kennedy said. Anyone with information in the case, he said, was urged to call (212) 598-0071.
Meantime some of Ms. Lantin's closest friends recalled yesterday how she strove for academic and professional excellence and yet had found time to be helpful to others.
Agnes Perez, 26, an agricultural economist who, with her twin sister Frances, had been Ms. Lantin's roommates at College Park, Md., said the slain woman -- to whom she could only refer in the present tense -- had been almost like a mother to her.
"She's a very, very helpful person," Ms. Perez said. "We always call her mother here because she acts like our mother." Asked what kinds of helpful things she had done, Ms. Perez said: "I don't want to think about it anymore."
Ms. Lantin's cousin, Rico Carpio, an airline customer service representative who lives in Derwood, Md., said she was "a lively, vivacious person -- she befriended everyone."
 
Magna Cum Laude Graduate
 His wife, Zita, added, "If there are perfect people in this world, she was one of them."
The Carpios and others said Ms. Lantin was born in Ames, Iowa, where her parents, Renaldo and Rhoda, were students at Iowa State University in the mid 1960's. The couple returned to their home in Los Banos, near Manila in the Philippines, when Rhona was three.
Her father became a professor (he is now a consultant for a United Nations agricultural development program) and her mother a biochemist. Rhona and her brother, Ryan, attended the University of the Philippines Rural High School in Los Banos.
In 1985, Rhona graduated from the University of the Philippines, magna cum laude, with a degree in agricultural economics. Two years later, she returned to the United States, enrolled in graduate school at the University of Maryland and got a job with the Department of Agriculture. Her brother also moved to the United States, and is now a postal worker in Irvine, Calif.
Zita Carpio described Ms. Lantin as a deeply religious Roman Catholic, an avid reader and student and a conscientious worker. Last fall, Ms. Lantin became engaged to 29-year-old Patrick Canning, a fellow student at Maryland. They were to have been married next May in Maryland.
Ms. Lantin, who visited New York City several times a year to see friends and Broadway plays, never expressed fears about coming to the city, which she saw as a place of lively arts and culture, according to Mrs. Carpio.
Last Wednesday, she and a dozen friends from high school in the Philippines were reunited at the Jersey City home of Christopher and Lillian Tan. Mrs. Tan was one of her closest friends and classmates. That night, most of them attended "Miss Saigon" on Broadway, one of Ms. Lantin's favorite productions.
"She liked Broadway plays," Mr. Tan said. "Whenever she was here, she made it a point to see a Broadway show." After the show Thursday night, she and the others were happily singing tunes from the musical, he recalled.
On Thursday the group attended a jazz festival and fireworks display at Liberty State Park in Jersey City, Mr. Tan recalled. In the evening, Ms. Lantin and five of her friends went to Chinatown for a meal.
"I don't think they had any particular restaurant in mind," Mr. Tan said. "They just wanted to get something to eat after the fireworks."
They were driving up Mulberry Street in a 1991 Ford Explorer, looking for a restaurant amid the uproar of exploding fireworks and the sprawling Chinatown holiday crowds, when the bullet crashed through the windshield and struck Ms. Lantin in the right temple.

HEADLINE: From Homemaker to Wage Earner in Appalachia

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PAINT LICK, Ky.

 BODY:
Five years ago, Katie Rollins left her kitchen and barnyard for a regular paying job, as a clerk in Uncle Tom's Grocery and Restaurant here. Her husband, Doug, used to work in a coffin factory, but it closed in 1984; he then lost a second job as a part-time handyman. Now Mrs. Rollins says he is too depressed to look for work.
The economic crunch came when Mrs. Rollins had a miscarriage late in pregnancy five years ago. "I got this bill for $1,700 for 11 hours in the hospital," she said. "We had no insurance. That's when I started making my own decisions." 
 Katie Rollins's story differs only in the details from those of many other Appalachian women. Pushed by their husbands' unemployment in the region's chronically ailing economy, by family health crises or by their children's leaving home, these women are abandoning the roles of their venerated mothers and grandmothers and joining the labor force.
Such shifts have been going on for two decades elsewhere in the nation, as paychecks have failed to keep up with inflation. But nowhere in this country is the tradition of breadwinner husband and homemaker wife more entrenched than in Appalachia, and nowhere is it under more strain.
Jobs in the region's predominantly he-man economy of mining and logging have been giving way to automation and to diminishing supplies of coal and wood, leaving a growing number of unemployed and broken-spirited men. And the customary domain of women, the family farms that produce tobacco and corn for market and chickens and vegetables for the table, cannot fill the void of the husband's lost paycheck.
People who work with the women say most fear the humiliation of going on welfare, the loss of support when husbands die, become disabled or leave them for other women, or the tedium of the home when the children are grown. When forced to choose between homemaking and survival, they opt for fewer children, getting jobs and, when pushed, divorce.
In Appalachia, unlike much of the rest of the nation, women are displacing men in the workplace as well as joining them. Throughout Kentucky, according to a study covering 1979 to 1986, the number of working men fell about 1 percent while the number of working women grew 12.5 percent. As men's jobs disappear, women take the new jobs that men spurn, mostly in hospitals and nursing homes, in stores and fast-food shops and government offices. Many of the women say their husbands sulk and turn hostile as they grow dependent on the wives' salaries.
 
Needing a Husband, But 'He's Afraid'
 At Uncle Tom's, Mrs. Rollins, 36 years old, works a 40-hour week and earns $4.35 an hour, a dime more than the minimum wage. She earns $8.96 an hour when she occasionally fills in for the Paint Lick postmistress. She is also taking local extension courses from Eastern Kentucky University, about 10 miles to the north, so she can become a social worker.
"She's a whirlwind," said John Thomas Clark, manager of Uncle Tom's. "She can do, and will do."
Exhilarated by having proved herself on the job, Mrs. Rollins said, "Right now, I'm in the ball park and I'm going to throw the ball."
Of her husband, she said: "I love him. I need him and he needs me. But we're growing apart. He's at a point where he's afraid."
Mr. Rollins, like most of the husbands of these working women, declined to be interviewed.
At Berea College, 20 minutes from Paint Lick, Jane B. Stephenson runs a tuition-free, three-week program that has helped nearly 100 middle-aged women, among them Mrs. Rollins, make the transition from home to work. She established the foundation-supported program four years ago after her husband, John, a sociologist, left the University of Kentucky in Lexington to become president of Berea.
"The big difference between these women and women in a city like Lexington is that women in Lexington seemed to know where to get help," Mrs. Stephenson said. "These women, from rural areas, don't have anyone to turn to, and in many cases they have no conception of what they can do. They keep saying, 'I don't have any skills; I can't do anything.' "
Sonja Rogers participated in the Berea program in June. Her family lost its main source of income a couple of years ago when the Federal Government, concluding that her husband could work, cut off his $780 monthly Social Security disability payment.
"He would have to have a job that lets him stand for two hours and sit for two hours," Mrs. Rogers said, "and they think he can find one, which he can't."
Mrs. Rogers, 52, still gets a $426 disability check every month because she has an emphysema-like disease. But she wants a job teaching adults how to read.
The struggle for survival drives these women, not the pursuit of equal opportunity or the struggle to maintain a middle-class life style. Of a score of newly employed women interviewed, none spoke of wanting big-money jobs or the ability to buy expensive things.
"These women are filled with courage," said Anita Barker, director of counseling at Berea College. "Most are suffering from poverty, and they are absolutely scared to death."
The women said they wanted jobs helping people, particularly in hospitals and schools. They make little of the more cosmopolitan world's feminist orthodoxy. To get out of the home to work, some turn to their daughters to take over the household chores of cooking and cleaning.
"I'm not a women's libber," Mrs. Rollins said. "I intend one of these days to have someone support me."
Once renowned for large families, Appalachian women still have more babies in their teen-age years than do other women, said Ron Crouch, director of the Kentucky State Data Center at the University of Louisville. But then they stop having them.
West Virginia now has the nation's lowest fertility rate, Mr. Crouch said, and Kentucky, with about a quarter of its population in the eastern, Appalachian, half of the state, ranks next.
Linda Linville, 36, a mother of three, grew up in a family of seven. A graduate of the Berea program who then took courses at a vocational college, she is happily married to a working husband. She has penetrated the middle class with a $10-an-hour job as a hospital respiratory technician. But the road getting there was an arduous one.
Before her current marriage, she was married twice, first to man who she said abused her and second to "a real ugly, mean person."
During her second marriage, she said, "I held two jobs then, in a laundromat from 3 to 10 in the evening and in the morning at a factory where they made kayaks," Mrs. Linville said. "I didn't have transportation. I didn't have a telephone. The lady who owned the laundromat would pick me up at the factory, and then she would pick up the kids and bring them" to the laundromat.
 
A Growing Network of Self-Help Groups
 Women who enter the Berea program have a high school diploma, or later in life they have obtained the equivalent, a general educational development certificate, known as the G.E.D. Others are steered to get G.E.D.'s by church groups and small grass-roots institutions that have cropped up throughout Appalachia.
Here, there is Friends of Paint Lick Inc., an organization begun two years ago by a 73-year-old widow named Harold Dean Sarah Virginia Quinn Cornett. For $12,000 she bought a building next to the post office, having raised the $500 down payment from pennies that people put in a gallon cider bottle.
With help from church groups and the public, Mrs. Cornett provides free clothing, food, books, counsel and space for the University of Eastern Kentucky to teach courses in Paint Lick. Men are welcome, Mrs. Cornett said, but they rarely come.
But plenty of women do. Tabatha Gullette, an 18-year-old who has four younger brothers, burst in one day to show Mrs. Cornett her graduation report card from Rockcastle High School. Mrs. Cornett hugged Miss Gullette and heaped her with praise. "Her mother wants to keep her home and take care of the boys," Mrs. Cornett said. "I want her to get into college. She's got a brilliant mind."
Among a few men in Paint Lick, the axiom that many preach -- a woman's place is in the home -- seems to be under review. "Basically, it's a very good statement," said Mr. Clark, 59, the Uncle Tom's manager. "I think it's in the Bible. The woman bears the children; it's her responsibility to take care of them.
"But Katie, with her son grown, there's not all that much reason for her to be in the home. And we have to give consideration to equal rights to people."
Dennis Vaught, the 25-year-old manager of the small People's Bank of Paint Lick, goes further. His wife, Traci, 24, is an assistant at the county office of the Federal Farmers Home Administration, and they use day care arrangements and sitters for their two children, boys aged 4 and 5. "My ideal is, a woman's place is where she wants it to be," Mr. Vaught said.
 
Feeling the Pressure To Stay at Home

But many husbands, whether they are employed or not, fight their wives' efforts to work.
Betsy Van Winkle's husband worked during their marriage, but when she got a job first in fast-food restaurants and then in nursing homes, she said, he "objected very, very strongly."
"I would get so tired I couldn't keep up with everything that he wanted to do," said Mrs. Van Winkle, 49, who is now divorced. "He accused me of sleeping with my patients. Patients in a nursing home. Then in the last year and a half of our marriage, he encouraged me to work. We didn't know about this other woman then."
Kathy Hamblin, 38, weeps when she is asked about looking for work. "When they saw you hadn't worked for 16 years, they threw your application in the reject pile," she said.
Now considering training to become a hospital technician, Mrs. Hamblin was divorced last year after 16 years of marriage. She has two children.
Her husband worked throughout their marriage, she said, but "he didn't want me to work for all those years."
"And I never cleaned house as well as his mother did," she said. "His mother washes the walls once a month. That's the way he controlled me. He made himself feel better by putting me down."
Linda Gadd was one of 10 children raised in a coal-country home that she called "pretty much an open bar for the neighborhood." Her parents would disappear for as long as five days. She married at 13 to a 21-year-old farmer who stopped in to restore the electricity when the fuses blew. She had all her five children by the time she was 20.
Now 38, Mrs. Gadd said she became alarmed about what she would do now that her children were grown. She got a G.E.D., joined the Berea program, became a social worker and is studying to become a registered nurse.
"What I realized at age 34 was that I had never gotten a chance to grow up," Mrs. Gadd said. Having a baby at 14 was just an extension of the only role she knew, helping to raise her six younger brothers and sisters when she herself was a child.
"My husband is a good provider and a good father," she said. But since she began working and bringing home textbooks, she said, a week can go by when they don't speak.
"I had taken the role of him being my father," Mrs. Gadd said. "He didn't know how to deal with me being a grown-up. His words were he wanted his Linda back."

At right was Peggy Brock, another participant; on the last day of class, participants, including Sonja Rogers, left, and Betsy Van Winkle are encouraged to take their pick from a closet of donated suits; "Right now, I'm in the ball park and I'm going to throw the ball," said Katie Rollins, a graduate of the program, who works at a grocery store in Paint Lick, Ky., and as a substitute postmistress.

HEADLINE: THE NATION: Symbolic Justice;
Capturing an Era's Racial Conflicts And Ironies

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A PRESIDENT'S choice for the Supreme Court often captures a political moment; it did 24 years ago with the selection of Justice Thurgood Marshall, and again last week with the nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to replace him. Both acts spoke volumes on the state of race and politics.
Last week, liberals and civil rights advocates looked back on the Marshall nomination with some poignance; it came in a tumultuous time, but the movement was riding a powerful national consensus that it was wrong for anyone to be denied the right to vote, the right to use public facilities, or equality of opportunity simply because of race. This consensus was codified in the civil rights and voting rights acts of 1964 and 1965. 
 The appointment of Mr. Marshall, who spent much of his career litigating for those rights, signaled the triumph of that stage of the civil rights movement, recalled Harry McPherson, a longtime aide to Preaident Lyndon B. Johnson. On June 13, 1967, the President said, simply, "It is the right thing to do, the right time to do it, the right man and the right place."
Twenty-four years later, the politics of race is, in many ways, far more subtle, far more complex and often far more partisan. And President Bush's nomination of Judge Thomas, who grew up poor and black in segregated Georgia and became a fierce critic of affirmative action, captures many of the nuances and ironies of the era.
It comes amid a growing debate over the policies of affirmative action and racial preferences. The political consensus supporting those policies, increasingly fragile in recent years, seems frayed, and civil rights groups and their allies are increasingly on the defensive, both in the courts and in the political realm.
A New York Times/CBS News Poll, conducted June 3-6, asked, "Do you believe that where there has been job discrimination against blacks in the past, preference in hiring or promotion should be given to blacks today?" The response of 61 percent was no, while 24 percent said yes. That opposition has steadily risen in the last six years. Against this backdrop, the Democratic-controlled Congress and the White House have engaged in a year-long, enervating struggle over new civil rights legislation, intended to counter recent court decisions that make it harder to sue and recover damages for job discrimination. President Bush accuses the Democrats of favoring racial quotas, a charge they vehemently deny. For their part, the Democrats accuse Mr. Bush of pandering to racial fears.
Many Democrats have charged the Republicans with seeking to create another racially divisive issue to attract white voters; Democrats saw the power of the quota issue in the 1990 elections, when it helped Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina beat back a determined challenge from Harvey Gantt, who had risen to political prominence as the first black Mayor of Charlotte. President Bush was clearly rankled by the charge that he was using a highly sensitive issue for partisan gain, a charge that has haunted him after his 1988 Presidential campaign, with its emphasis on the case of Willie Horton, a black murderer who escaped on a prison furlough, raped a woman and stabbed a man.
In such a climate, Judge Thomas becomes a powerful symbol for the Republicans, a seeming exemplar of bootstrap conservatism whose nomination helps defend the party from charges of racial insensitivity.
"Remember how Ollie North changed the whole terms of the debate during Iran-Contra, because the average American listened to him, and he made sense in a way that attorneys for the committee couldn't?" asked Representative Newt Gingrich, the Republican whip and conservative strategist. "Clarence Thomas is going to validate the idea that there's more than one opinion in the black community."
In fact, there has been sharp debate among blacks in recent years on the issue of affirmative action. Some, like the economist Thomas Sowell, have argued that race-based remedies do more damage than good. Others simply raise the question of whether such remedies are still needed, saying that long-standing laws against racial discrimination, properly enforced, are enough.
But some Democrats see a deep cynicism in the Bush Administration's embrace of a black conservative nominee to the high court. "It's calculated, it's deliberately racial, and it's meant to mute the expected reaction to yet another very conservative nominee," asserted Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton, the Congressional delegate from Washington, D.C., and, like Judge Thomas, a former head of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
Still, some Democrats acknowledged that the Thomas nomination seemed a deft political move. "When Johnson appointed Marshall, it was a bold political statement done at some political risk," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic polltaker. "This seems more like a chess move."
Thomas Mann, the director of government studies at the Brookings Institution, said, "A vigorous opposition to Thomas reinforces the Democrats' racial predicament." There is an Alice-through-the-looking-glass quality to it: Democrats seeking to hold the line for affirmative action face the prospect of fighting against the second black person ever appointed to the Supreme Court.
Much of the early opposition to Thomas seemed to be building on the issue of abortion. His comments in 1987 praising an anti-abortion essay raised alarms among abortion rights groups and their allies, including the National Organization for Women.
The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, a coalition that played a key role in keeping Judge Robert Bork off the Supreme Court, reserved judgment on the Thomas nomination but was clearly concerned, particularly about his record as chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in the Reagan Adminstration.
Some who came out of the civil rights movement seemed less bemused by Judge Thomas than pained. Representative John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat and veteran of some of the bloodiest campaigns, said with some exasperation, "If anything, he should be more progressive than I am, because he benefited from the struggle we engaged in."
But some conservatives accuse Democrats of having stifled debate on such issues and say a discussion is overdue. "Issues of racial preferences have been shrouded in a kind of taboo," said Dinesh D'Souza, a research fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a conservative author. "It has been politically incorrect bordering on blasphemy to bring them up in polite company. I think we've having an overdue conversation about a transformation in our understanding of civil rights, and the Thomas nomination will help air those issues."
While some see the issue as dangerously polarizing, even an aid to politicians like David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader and Louisiana state legislator, Mr. D'Souza argues that silence is most perilous. "Guys like Duke depend on the public sentiment that they are articulating secret truths," he said.
By week's end, the Thomas nomination was already fueling this fractious, often painful debate. Some, like Mr. Lewis, also found time for another engagement, the dedication of the national civil rights museum in Memphis, on the site of the Lorraine Motel, where in 1968 the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was slain. It was a week that spoke to the enduring power of race in American politics, but also to its complex permutations.

HEADLINE: The World;
A Rising Sense That Iraq's Hussein Must Go

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WHILE President Bush is going through the diplomatic motions of trying to get the Iraqis to peacefully surrender their nuclear weapons-making equipment, many Administration officials are beginning to come around to the view that there is no diplomatic solution for their Iraq problem. The only solution, in this view, is the removal of President Saddam Hussein.
Wars do not usually end with the defeated general still in power in his capital, but for a variety of reasons the Bush Administration was prepared to live with the Iraqi leader. But that decision is now under review. Mr. Hussein's relentless efforts to retain his nuclear bomb components are making it increasingly difficult for Washington to justify having left him in power. In fact, many officials now acknowledge, as long as he is there the gulf war will never really be over. 
 Few in the Administration, though, want to admit that stark conclusion publicly, because to speak the words aloud would require doing something about them, and the fact is that President Bush has been ambivalent about Mr. Hussein's fate since the day the war ended. Mr. Bush inadvertently acknowledged the source of that ambivalence last week when he was asked whether he was disappointed about the lack of democratization in Kuwait. "The war wasn't fought about democracy in Kuwait," Mr. Bush bluntly retorted.
The war was, instead, fought to restore the status quo. And, as every American policymaker knows, before Mr. Hussein invaded Kuwait he was a pillar of the gulf balance of power and status quo preferred by Washington. His iron fist simultaneously held Iraq together, much to the satisfaction of the American allies Turkey and Saudi Arabia, and it prevented Iranian Islamic fundamentalists from sweeping over the eastern Arab world. It was only when the Iraqi dictator decided to use his iron fist to dominate Kuwait and Saudi Arabia that he became a threat. But as soon as Mr. Hussein was forced back into his shell, Washington felt he had become useful again for maintaining the regional balance and preventing Iraq from disintegrating.
That was why Mr. Bush never supported the Kurdish and Shiite rebellions against Mr. Hussein, or for that matter any democracy movement in Iraq. The President felt that Mr. Hussein and his army were broken and no longer represented any external threat, especially since Mr. Bush contentedly assumed that his intelligence reports were correct and that all of Mr. Hussein's nuclear capabilities had been destroyed. Sooner or later, Mr. Bush argued, sanctions would force Mr. Hussein's generals to bring him down, and then Washington would have the best of all worlds: an iron-fisted Iraqi junta without Saddam Hussein. In the meantime, the foreign policy expert in Mr. Bush said: Ignore him.
But Mr. Hussein and his generals are not following the scripts Washington handed them. The generals have not ousted Mr. Hussein, and he is refusing to play the chastened and defeated foe ready to tacitly preserve a Pax Americana in the gulf. The April 3 gulf war cease-fire resolution enjoined him to turn over for destruction all of his large ballistic missiles and chemical-, biological- and nuclear bomb-making equipment. In order not to make himself an easy target, and to lull the West into forgetting him, he has cleverly cooperated in all these areas -- except the nuclear. There, he has played cat and mouse for three months, hiding from United Nations inspectors, right up to last week, secret nuclear bomb-making equipment he managed to preserve, and perhaps enough enriched uranium for two Nagasaki-size bombs.
By refusing to turn over his remaining nuclear equipment he is both resurfacing as a potential strategic threat and noisily taunting Washington, swaggering out of his bunker and firing his pistol into the air. "You see, there are two Saddams," said Fouad Ajami, a Middle East expert at Johns Hopkins University. "The man in power with whom we were ready to live because we thought he was diminished, and keeping him around seemed convenient, and the symbolic Saddam -- the man whom George Bush turned into a devil to mobilize the American public in a national crusade against, and whose continuing presence still taunts the victor."
Mr. Bush was ready to ignore the symbolic Saddam Hussein, taunts and all, as long as the real one was a strategic asset, not a threat. But those days may be over. Mr. Bush has begun hinting at a military strike to knock out Mr. Hussein's remaining nuclear equipment, while leaving him in power. But some officials wonder whether he won't just try to build another bomb. The problem is not his capabilities but his intentions. Mr. Hussein's willingness to risk the continuation of economic sanctions in order to preserve his nuclear program suggests that he remains more interested in personal aggrandizement and revenge than in rebuilding his country.
Indeed, Mr. Hussein has a unique personal incentive to continue trying to obtain a nuclear weapon quickly: It would deter the West from coming after him; it could be the vehicle for his revenge, blackmail, or intimidation against Israel or those Arab states who opposed him; it would be of enormous value for his own political resurrection in the Arab world and, symbolically, it would be the ultimate thumb in the eye of George Bush. Moreover, given Mr. Hussein's own grandiose self-delusions, he finds it very hard to take orders from the United Nations, said Laurie Mylroie of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Defiance is an essential part of his strategy; to appear to be taking orders from the United Nations is to appear weak, and weakness in his habitat -- the snakepit of Iraqi politics -- will be exploited.
Mr. Hussein's continued rule in Baghdad is not only becoming a strategic problem for Mr. Bush, but a political one. Certainly one reason that the Syrians have not responded to American efforts to entice them to the conference table with Israel is because President Hafez al-Assad is afraid that Mr. Hussein would depict him as a lackey of the Americans. Moreover, the longer Mr. Hussein is in power, the more incentive his Arab neighbors will have for doing business with him again and reintegrating him into Arab politics. Business is business and there is a lot of reconstruction business to be done in Iraq. Already, one can hear murmurings from Egypt that Iraq has been punished enough.
In the Middle East, "the hand you cannot cut off, you kiss," said Elie Kedourie, the Iraqi-born historian. The Arab leaders, he added, know well the rules of their world, which Mr. Bush too may soon have to confront: "Either you cut a deal with Saddam or you kill him, but there is no third way."

In New York City, a Budget Of Dreams Deferred

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
IN adopting its grimmest municipal budget in years, New York City danced up to the edge of doom last week, and then did what it always does: it kept going. Now the question is whether it can improve upon the new budget's painful blend of deep service cuts and higher taxes, or simply continue the trend.
Street lights will not be shut off to save money, as Mayor David N. Dinkins warned they might when he proposed the budget in May, and the city's larger swimming pools will not close. But they will be open fewer days this summer, and the Mayor, municipal labor unions and the state are still struggling to save what they can of the city's services and amenities. 
 The new budget means thousands of layoffs for city workers, and cuts in street cleaning, library hours and health programs. But for the politicians who passed the $28.5 billion spending plan, it also meant something else: a new era of power and influence for the City Council, which used its authority under a revised City Charter to force the Mayor to yield or compromise on a number of his spending and taxing initiatives. It also brought a wary new pledge of cooperation between Mr. Dinkins and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in addressing the city and state's mutual long-term problems.
The city put together a balanced budget on time as required by law, but it is built on shifting sands. Its revenue assumptions may be even farther from reality than usual, given a local economy that has put budgets throughout the region badly out of whack. The Mayor hopes to undo the worst of the cuts and layoffs by gaining concessions on wages or benefits from the city employee unions, and by getting hundreds of millions of dollars in help from the Municipal Assistance Corporation, the state body set up to bail the city out after its brush with bankruptcy 16 years ago.
The corporation's chairman, Felix G. Rohatyn, has said M.A.C. could help, using money raised by refinancing some of the corporation's bonds, stretching out the payments, but only if the city permanently cuts its costs through labor concessions and a reshaping of its complex relationship with the state. Under the current arrangement, the city is forced to finance a large share of programs like welfare and Medicaid through local taxes, enabling Albany to hold down state taxes.
 While they have not agreed how it should be done, the Governor and Mayor each cite the need to restructure the Medicaid, hospital and justice systems -- "All the places," Mr. Cuomo said last week, "where costs are so far outweighing our capacities that unless contained, they may crush our ability to help people."
For Mr. Dinkins, elected on a platform promising social change, the fiscal problems have become the all-consuming daily reality, forcing him to disappoint his supporters, on whom many of the cuts would fall most harshly. Even as the State Financial Control Board expressed skepticism about Mr. Dinkins's ability to carry out the cuts, a caller on a radio program exhorted him not to bow to Wall Street, and not to forget his roots.
 
Ducking and Dodging

 Caught in an unending crossfire, the Mayor measures his successes these days mostly by his ability to stand and take it, or to duck. The Control Board, set up to monitor the city's finances in 1975, could reassert power over city spending if the budget went out of balance, which Mr. Dinkins has vowed to avoid at any cost.
But it makes him bitter and tired. And though he seldom speaks of them, he can never forget his special burdens as the city's first black Mayor. Then too, Mr. Dinkins is also the first modern New York City Mayor to have to share so much power with a City Council. With this budget, the Council flexed its newfound muscles to put him on the defensive, pledging to restore some of the deep cuts he had proposed to prompt union givebacks and higher taxes, and leaving him to defend the city's vital but uncompelling bureaucracy. In the end, Mr. Dinkins and the Council largely split their differences, impelled by the Mayor's sole power to set the revenue estimates. But, as one senior mayoral aide said, "It is a different world."
Mr. Dinkins likes to say that the city's problems are primarily the result of a cyclical recession, and will pass when the economy improves. He might take comfort from the budget battles of 50 summers ago, as explained in August Heckscher's book, "When LaGuardia Was Mayor."
Mr. Heckscher wrote that as revenues failed to keep pace with the city's needs, "political and civic leaders raised questions about the adequacy of the city's tax base resting so largely upon real estate assessments; about the charges for debt service, greatly increased as a result of recent capital improvements; about the city's pension system; and most of all, about the growing costs of such social programs as relief."
Those problems remain today, and with the Real Estate Board warning that financial service firms will flee to New Jersey, no one knows what economic engine will keep the city running. But as Mr. Heckscher said of LaGuardia, Mr. Dinkins knows "that his own record as Mayor would be judged in no small measure by the degree to which he kept the financial house in order."

Why La Dolce Vita Is Easy for Europeans . . .

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
HOW is it that Europeans sit around all day drinking coffee, spend long evenings over dinner, dress elegantly, get up late, take long vacations, drive new cars -- and they can still afford the exorbitant prices charged for everything from Stockholm to Seville?
Why, in short, do Europeans seem to live so much better than Americans? 
 Well, it isn't quite like that. No one pretends that Germans do not work hard or that most Portuguese do not struggle to make ends meet. On a damp December day, Europeans also look a good deal less cheerful than they do on their long summer breaks. And there is poverty too, less visible than in, say, New York today, but no less real.
But, yes, there is a certain bucolic quality to life in the Old World -- particularly in sunny, Latin, Catholic southern Europe -- that stirs envy among many Americans. Perhaps this was always Europe's appeal. Yet, to Americans who can afford to visit Europe, the gap between their living standard and that of their European counterparts seems to be widening. And they ask, how do the Europeans do it?
Money helps. In the late 1980's, while the sliding dollar made Europe ever more expensive for Americans, Europe experienced an economic boom. In France and Britain, the rich grew a lot richer -- and this added glitter. In northern Europe, the good life seemed entrenched. Spain and even Portugal began to expand rapidly and Italy, above all, suddenly joined the ranks of wealthy nations.
Indeed, Italy is the best example of this change. "L'America sta qui" -- America is here -- Italians boast, because the prosperity their grandparents once sought across the water can now be found at home. "I think at times they wake up in the middle of the night and say, 'Goodness, we're terribly rich. How did this come about?' -- and then they go back to sleep," Franco Ferrarotti, an Italian sociology professor, said.
Yet capitalism still lives alongside quasi-socialist structures. The welfare state has lost ground in Britain during 12 years of conservative rule, but elsewhere in Western Europe, in exchange for higher taxes, governments are still expected to provide care from cradle to grave. And where they falter, in southern Europe at least, strong trade unions survive to nudge them along.
In France, for example, women are allowed 22 weeks of paid maternity leave plus one year of unpaid leave. Free medical attention is the norm in most countries. Higher education is no burden because college tuition fees are minimal. And then there are vacations: four weeks per year is the minumum but six weeks is no longer unusual.
 In fact, over the next two months, close to 100 million Europeans will be flocking to the Mediterranean, lodging in everything from luxurious mansions in Marbella to camp sites in St. Tropez. In France, the exodus began this weekend and already many economic decisions and political debates have been cheerfully put off until September.
Yet quality of life is a more elusive concept. For the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, for example, purchasing power parity is more accurate than per capita income -- and, according to this gauge, Americans are better off than Europeans. But the United Nations Development Program has a human development index that includes many social variables -- and this shows Americans trailing most Europeans.
In the end, though, many Americans measure things simply by what they see in Europe. In southern Europe in particular, they are attracted by a different way of life, one that is tied to the family and rooted in peasant traditions, one that gives enormous importance to the rituals of eating and drinking and prides itself in stylish clothes and good conversation, one in which the work ethic does not reign supreme.
This is not, of course, a description of Frankfurt or Glasgow, but it certainly fits the bill for Provence and Tuscany or even Paris and Rome. "In the United States, individual self-sufficiency is idealized," Mr. Ferrarotti said. "Here, whether you sink or swim depends on your family ties."
In southern Europe, children rarely leave home before they are ready to marry. Families routinely gather around the dining room table on weekends. Extended families often vacation together. And in times of need, it is the family that first provides help.
For this reason, Europeans seem less inclined than Americans to uproot themselves and move to another city. In France, Italy and Spain, there has been a dramatic exodus from the countryside since World War II, yet the sense of regional identity remains strong. In fact, while the United States became more alike as it developed, Western Europe's economic integration seems to be stimulating regionalism. And this augurs well for the survival of the local cuisines, wines, breads, cheeses, sausages, pates and the like that give much of Europe its special character.
It is of course no novelty for Americans to be drawn by Europe's ancient cities, its cultural traditions, its food and drink, its quality of life. Earlier this century, writers and painters felt the pull. Today, more than two million Americans make the trip each year. But there is definitely a new twist. Until the 1970's, Americans could afford the full experience. Now, they often feel the party is going on without them.

Why La Dolce Vita Is Easy for Europeans . . . As Japanese Work Ever Harder to Relax

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
BEFORE sunrise last Monday, a group of hearty trekkers made their way to the top of Japan's most instantly recognizable symbol, Mount Fuji, raised their arms in a cheer of "Banzai!" to welcome the rising sun, and then did the only prudent thing. They scampered off the mountain before they were overrun by the hundreds of thousands of climbers who will follow them to the majestic volcanic crater this summer, marching toe-to-heel up the same path, past the same trinket stands, to see the same sun rise.
Leisure has its martial moments in Japan and the Mount Fuji climb -- everyone should do it once, the saying goes, and only fools do it again -- may be Japanese group recreation at its most regimented. And it is a mentality that the Government hopes is part of a passing era. Even before France's Prime Minister, Edith Cresson, declared the Japanese relentless "economic animals" seeking to "dominate the world" with their workaholic habits, a halfhearted campaign began here to convince the country to relax. To a younger generation that questions the merits of working 9-to-9 and then drinking with colleagues until the last train home, the new push for shorter hours and longer vacations is welcome. To many over 50 it is evidence that the tough stuff that made Japan a great competitor is lost. 
 "Taking holidays was regarded as nearly sinful when Japan was poor," said Ikuro Takagi, a professor at Japan Women's University and an expert on the country's over-long hours of labor. "Working hard was a universal virtue until very recently." It is a virtue reinforced in the language. Literally translated, the Japanese word for free time, yoka, means "time left." That is evidence, Professor Takagi says, that "free time is just not regarded as equal in value" to working.
The Government has set a national target of 1,800 work hours a year by 1992 for the average Japanese worker. But the goal is elusive: in 1989, the Japanese figure was 2,088 hours and barely budging. That compares with 1,957 hours in the United States and 1,646 hours in France. In truth, Mrs. Cresson's contention that it is unfair for the Japanese to work so hard falls on deaf ears here. "Maybe," an executive of Toyota suggested, "another way to look at it is whether the Europeans are working hard enough."
Officially the policy at Japan Inc. these days is that all work and no play makes Noboru a dull "salaryman," to use the adapted-from-English word for salaried workers. Japan's big companies court young people on the college campuses with tours of corporate recreation facilities and offers of spiffed-up vacation policies. Akio Morita, the white-haired founder of Sony who is only slightly less a national icon than Mount Fuji, told his employees last year that they had no choice: they must get out of the office for at least two weeks. The Asahi Shimbun, the giant newspaper with a circulation of 8 million and caffeine-driven reporters, has papered its offices with a poster showing a fierce-looking boss shrieking into a telephone: "If you come to work, you're fired!"
But do the companies really mean business when they say relax? There are still widespread fears that taking a long vacation will hurt one's chances at promotion. Most executives limit themselves to the holidays when Japan shuts down -- "Golden Week" in the spring, a few days in August when apartment-dwellers traditionally return to their hometowns, and a long New Year's holiday. Resorts and bullet trains are so jammed, however, that returning to work seems like a pleasure. "It is hard to even call it a vacation," the "White Paper on Leisure," a study published by a semi-governmental leisure-promotion organization, concluded last year.
If language barriers and Japanese formality convey an image abroad of overly serious grinds, the view on Japan's home turf is something else. Restaurants are filled with laughter, Tokyo Disneyland is always jammed, and travel overseas is now taken as a given. Ten million Japanese took trips abroad last year, including huge numbers of Japan's most dedicated fun seekers, the "O.L.'s," or young office ladies. Most live with their parents, delay marriage until their late 20's or later, and have lots of disposable income. They travel so much and consume so fiercely that their adventures have become the stuff of television parodies.
Their opposites, older men who sometimes seem at a loss about how to deal with free time, are ridiculed, too. When the Government moved to a five-day work week more than a year ago, many spouses opposed it. The last thing they needed, they said, was the "sodai gomi" -- or "big garbage" -- puttering around the house, looking for entertainment. For the same reason, many parents object to canceling Saturday classes and reducing the school week to five days.
And then there's the argument that seems most convincing to the Japanese: Play has its place, but the country didn't become the world's second biggest industrial power by spending long weekends at Mount Fuji.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
As Doctors Become More Specialized, and Numerous, Turf Wars Erupt Over Body Parts

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
THE brain surgeons are jousting with the bone surgeons, the dermatologists are rubbing plastic surgeons the wrong way, and the radiologists are fighting with nearly all of their medical colleagues.
Turf wars among doctors are nothing new. But now, as a growing supply of highly trained specialists confronts a stingier flow of fees, competition for the right to perform -- and bill for -- lucrative medical procedures is growing more intense. 
 The arenas of conflict are proliferating along with new technologies for inspecting or repairing the body. Underused cardiologists and cardiac surgeons fight for the right to insert pacemakers. Gastroenterologists, who refined the art of peering into the upper and lower digestive tracts with scopes, now watch in dismay as surgeons begin to do the peering themselves. These same two groups are also arguing over control of the new laparoscopic technique for removing gall bladders without open surgery.
The big money in American medicine is now in diagnostic and surgical techniques. The Government and insurers are just starting to bear down on the traditionally high cost of these procedures, the way they already have on fees for office visits and hospital stays. "The proceduralists are well paid, in many instances wildly overpaid," said Dr. Edwin Maynard, an internist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and past president of the American College of Physicians.
On top of that, specialists are in oversupply in many parts of the country, in the view of many experts. Expensively trained hands and minds will not long remain idle. And who best can read a scan, insert a scope into a colon, or repair a slipped disc but a doctor from one's own specialty? "It's a matter of power, ego and money," said Dr. John C. Hobbins, an obstetrician at Yale University.
The proliferation of new imaging techniques has left radiologists especially vulnerable to professional poaching. They long since lost their monopoly on X-rays, as more doctors put machines in their offices. They have faced more recent onslaughts with the spread of magnetic resonance imaging, or M.R.I., ultrasound, nuclear diagnostics and other methods.
One major dispute concerns who can interpret, or "read," M.R.I. scans, for fees that range from $150 to $250. Guerrilla warfare over this is simmering around the country, mainly between radiologists and neurologists, since M.R.I. is often used for brain and spinal disorders, but also between radiologists and cardiologists as methods for scanning the heart are developed.
The discourse follows Rule No. 1 of the turf wars: All salvoes must be fired in the name of patient welfare.
"There are many neurologists reading M.R.I. scans who shouldn't be," said Dr. James M. Moorefield, a radiologist in Sacramento and chairman of the American College of Radiology. Neurologists involved in reading scans reply that they have obtained the requisite training and that their personal interpretation of scans is vital to good care.
One hospital in Atlanta negotiated a truce by granting radiologists and neurologists the right to interpret M.R.I. scans on alternate days. The unknowing patients get their scans read by one or the other specialist simply according to when they show up. (No ill effects on one set of days or another have been reported.)
Another important area of encroachment, Dr. Moorefield said, involves use of ultrasound, especially by obstetricians with machines in their offices. Fees range from $100 to more than $300. "I am sure there is a lot of unqualified work going on," he said. "Not to say every one, but very many obstetricians have acquired these instruments with little or no training." The danger, he said, is that correctible conditions in the fetus, or hazards for the mother, will be missed.
Undoubtedly there are unqualified obstetricians conducting fetal ultrasound, said Dr. Richard L. Berkowitz, chairman of obstetrics at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York. But many more have excellent training and experience in fetal sonography. "Just because you're a radiologist doesn't mean you are well trained in this either," he said.
"There's no reason in the world an obstetrician can't learn to read ultrasounds if he is trained," said Dr. Hobbins of Yale, who as president of a national inter-specialty group on ultrasound is trying to quell the conflict, shifting the focus to qualifications rather than specialty. Some obstetricians, on the other hand, have said that a trans-vaginal scan, in which a probe is inserted into the vagina, is an "extension of a pelvic exam, and thus should be in the realm of obstetrics and gynecology, not radiology," he said. "That's also baloney."
And now a new player in the ultrasound game, the emergency room physician, is stirring up both the radiologists and the obstetricians. "Everyone is somewhat concerned about the training of this whole new group of physicians," Dr. Hobbins said. "But there's no reason they can't do it too."
 
Advertising Their Wares
 Plastic surgeons complain that other specialists are horning in on the performance of rhinoplasties, better known as nose jobs. The debate follows Rule No. 2 of the turf wars: Any surplus must be in someone else's specialty.
"There aren't too many plastic surgeons," said Dr. John E. Christ, a plastic surgeon in Houston who advertises aggressively. "The problem is that other specialties are encroaching into the realm of plastic surgeons."
Not content to take on nose jobs and face lifts, some ear, nose and throat specialists are now "moving down the body," Dr. Christ said. "Some here will do fat suctioning and breast augmentation, and they are advertising heavily."
Dermatologists and even general surgeons are now doing cosmetic surgery, he said, adding, somewhat ominously, "All these people are wanting a slice of the pie."
Dr. Christ does not believe that the poaching and the resort to advertising indicate a surplus of specialists. "We're servicing a need, and advertising helps the public find who offers these services," he said.
To experts in medical economics, the battle for patients indicates more than a redivision of the money pot. If too many specialists have been trained, then resources have been wasted. And if they have to search for things to do, they may promote the costly overuse of procedures.
"When doctors are as busy as they ought to be, they are much less inclined to do things of marginal medical value, or to seek patients for elective, cosmetic services," said Dr. Arnold S. Relman, former editor of The New England Journal of Medicine.
But whether a procedure is marginal, or a specialty is in surplus, is a matter of perspective.
Taking Rule No. 2 to its logical extreme, Dr. Byron C. Pevehouse, a retired neurosurgeon in San Francisco, said his field suffered from scarcity: "We may have been remiss in not training enough neurosurgeons to treat all the cases."
"Since there are not enough neurosurgeons, the orthopedists, who produced too many, began doing neurological procedures," said Dr. Pevehouse, a past president of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons.
In many regions, he explained, there are too many orthopedists in relation to the number of broken bones that need setting or hips that need replacing, the standard work of orthopedists. And so, like Dr. Christ, the plastic surgeon, he described how interlopers are creeping across the human body, invading one neurosurgical site after another.
First, orthopedists started doing peripheral nerve work, on the arms and legs. "Now they think their scope of practice should include disc problems and nerve root paralysis," Dr. Pevehouse said. "Some even want to do spinal tumors."
This is bad news for patients, Dr. Pevehouse said (Rule No. 1). "Orthopedists are not trained to the same extent to handle nervous tissue."
Orthopedists, of course, beg to differ.

HEADLINE: At Home in Tuscany

BYLINE: By SUSAN ROWLAND; SUSAN ROWLAND is a painter who lives in Brooklyn.

 BODY:
OUR trips always involve a conflict between nature and civilization. My husband, Tony, is happiest on a remote island looking for mussels, and I prefer to be carried from one fabulous building to the next, while being fed labor-intensive meals I could never make myself. Common to us both is a desire to see plants, people, animals and art in situ. We are lucky to live in New York City where the world comes to us, but it arrives detached from its original place: meaningless, dispirited, deconsecrated. Where does it come from? Before it gets transplanted, assimilated, cooked and catalogued, what is it? We travel to find out.
What we wanted to find on this trip was the world we saw in "Painting in Renaissance Siena, 1420-1500," a show that gave us a winter of pleasure at the Metropolitan Museum of Art three years ago. A relatively small show, it drew many people for a new look at paintings that for me at least had been an obscure part of Art 105. My favorite artist here, and I was hardly alone, was the Master of the Osservanza. His "Life of St. Anthony" and "Passion Predella" pictured a vibrant and detailed contemporary environment embracing anachronistic biblical scenes in the foreground. 
 Because Osservanza's landscape of twisted trees, black hills and brightly colored buildings was unfamiliar to Tony and me, we decided to make a pilgrimage to Siena to find his world. We wanted to spend time in a house in the country rather than in hotels, but without chores and responsibilities. Our whole trip was arranged by a rental agent in San Francisco, Daniel Morneau. I first called him with a vague plan which he transformed into an itinerary that combined interesting places to stay in Florence and Rome with a central week of rural life near Siena. Many photographs, brochures, letters and phone calls between coasts went into our decisions, but Daniel was always ready to gossip and advise, as well as to make all financial arrangements for the house. So we were carefree when we set out from Florence in our rented Eurocar to find Osservanza.
Route 222 south of Impruneta is in Chianti country, a rolling, green, highly cultivated land marred only by billboards advertising vineyards and urging us to "Vendita Diretta," buy directly. It was about an hour's drive to Siena, not including our stop for lunch at Castellina, one of the hill towns en route. Following printed directions from the agency, we left the vineyards for the Siena ring road to the two-lane Arezzo Road. Once on the Arezzo Road we were among blackish brown hillocks topped with spindly trees and square yellow houses. These were the "dreary mud-covered hills . . . the source of the pigment burnt Sienna" that the faithful Blue Guide to Northern Italy described. Wonderful and strange that these sere fields and hills, plowed and stripped, rather than the verdant and cultivated vineyards, were Osservanza's choice to paint.
There was one misstep when we drove into what looked like a castle to our American eyes, but was only the carabiniere headquarters deep in the country. Two miles beyond that, on the same wooded dirt road, came a sudden clearing and a real castle, turreted, surrounded by green fields, a misty valley beyond and our own cottage in front of the walls of Montalto. Diana Coda Nunziante, the owner, greeted us speaking English, as well she might being from San Francisco, where she met her Italian husband, Giovanni, at the University of California at Berkeley. She showed us our cottage, La Scuola, and gave us the essential information that the bread man would be arriving soon and to write our order, bianco or nero, on the list under the arch, and pay later. Also, if we wanted eggs, herbs, honey, olive oil, tomatoes or firewood, all from the farm, vendita diretta, write it down. Our daily chore.
Our cottage, big enough for only two, was the smallest of the various accommodations at the castle. Stone walled, brick floored, clean and old, it was charming. The kitchen, in a corner of the living room, opposite the fireplace, was like a galley on a small boat, and the furniture was summer-house minimal, but the bedroom had good reading lights, a big comfortable bed, and an amusing Murano light fixture hanging from the ceiling. There was plenty of hot water in the good shower and a washing machine that turned everything gray. I hung the clothes on a line in the private backyard, hiding my laundry shame. Tall windows had heavy wooden shutters that blocked out both light and the chug of the tractor starting for the fields at dawn.
We felt a part of the farm life which was what we wanted, but in the grander tower apartment, Vescovo, which has a separate entrance to a wing of the castle, five people could live a lord's life with a secluded terrace, antiques, piano, baronial fireplace and housekeeping services. For a bigger group this tower can be joined to the guardhouse apartment. There are two other houses within the castle walls and two out on the estate. Prices vary from about $500 a week for La Scuola in low season to $2,000 a week for Torre Vescovo in high season. Everyone can use the one tennis court and the 40-foot pool, which has a slight smell of basil from the nearby vegetable garden wafting over it. When we were there last fall, we rarely saw the few other guests, an Irish family and a German couple, but it must be lively in August. At the most, there can be 30 guests, usually two-thirds of whom are European.
That evening we did what we did every evening, walked around the thousand-acre farm among orchards, Etruscan walls, and stone buildings -- many abandoned -- swam in the pool and made a fire and dinner before collapsing after days of touring. The Tuscany nights were deep black except for star glow and silent after we turned off the tiny fridge, which made the only mechanical noise we could hear after dark.
Sometimes we rode around the farm on mares with a history. Familiar from paintings and statues everywhere in Italy, they are Ghibelline horses and were on the side of the Emperor against the Guelphs, who supported the Pope in the 12th century as Italy was emerging from the Holy Roman Empire. You can see them carrying kings through the snow in Sassetta's "Journey of the Magi" at the Metropolitan. These mares are in foal to a stallion from Arezzo where their ancestors pose in Piero della Francesca's great frescoes. Stocky, black and gentle, they were the only export from a town called Murga, in the south; therefore, they were known as murgese. Born to carry armored soldiers into battle, they are now bred in Tuscany for dressage. The procedure for riding at Montalto is simple: go to the tack room in the castle courtyard near the chapel for a saddle, take it to the woods by the barn and catch a horse. No running them while they are pregnant. Be careful which ones you get; they all look alike and come up affectionately, but two have never been ridden. Once we went to get them, but Diana's daughters had taken them on a fig picking expedition.
 We had already found that laden fig tree, filled with fruit the color of the landscape, black, green and terra cotta. The figs were great to eat with sheep's cheese (pecorino), and prosciutto from the one-room grocery down the road by the carabiniere quarters. In fact, all the food from the farm and the markets in Siena and nearby towns was so good and fresh that we barely cooked in our little kitchen but just dribbled vintage olive oil on produce and cheese and ate it raw, which was a change from our restaurant lunches of Tuscan specialties like game, porcini and fagioli in fiasco (cooked in a stone bottle).
One afternoon we heard some of the convoluted history of the castle when Diana invited us for tea, which was strictly blue jeans, Lipton's and crockery in the dog-filled family living room. This is no snooty Henry James contessa from America. There are no pretensions at Montalto, although we were next to the great hall covered with frescoes and crossed pikes, and we looked over the valley where pickers were leaving the tobacco fields. The first castle here, now buried below where we sat, was built before the 11th century and became a fortress guarding the Sienese border against the bossy Florentines. Always tangled in the vicissitudes of Sienese politics, even though out of sight of the duomo, the isolated castle was exposed to wars and sieges and considered a hardship post. Diana told us legends of crimes of passion and politics. It's an ancient place and feels like it, almost as big as New York's Cloisters; the castle and farm were home to 150 people until the end of World War II.
The walled city of Siena is 20 minutes from the farm. It is easier to drive into than most of the towns we visited, but one day we went first to the Church of the Osservanza north of town, came in through Porta Ovile instead of the Porta San Marco and, after winding uphill through skinny medieval streets in first gear, found ourselves in the center of the Campo, a car-free zone. Siena is better for walking. We returned to the cathedral many times to admire the black and white stripes of the interior which is often seen in Sienese pictures, including Osservanza's "St. Anthony at Mass." From the duomo we looked out over the land and could understand the economic interdependence of city and castle.
It was disappointing but not surprising that we found most of the paintings we were looking for in Siena in a museum, the Pinacoteca, safe from the damp and thieves that chased them from their original sites. Only the Piero della Francesca paintings in Arezzo, an hour east of us on the hill road, and San Sepolcro, another half hour beyond that, lived up to our hopes of finding great paintings in their intended space. But within about an hour's radius there were many wonders we had not expected: cloisters, churches, gardens, and every wall and sculpture in the cathedral, not to forget pan forte and vin santo. We were even pleasantly surprised by the prices, which were no higher than home. The rate of exchange was 1,100 lire to a dollar, and lunch for two at Mugolone was usually $63. Chianti cost the same in Chianti as on West Broadway, as did parmesan and Italian clothes. But English paperbacks were $20, and museum admissions doubled to 8,000 lire on Oct. 1. We paid about $500 a week for our cottage.
Montalto itself was the major work of art we found was a thousand years old and in situ. We experienced it as it was known in the Master of Osservanza's time. We rode down to the orchard and saw the branches heavy with green olives, just beginning to turn purple. We saw the grapes ready to pick, and we caught war horses in the woods. For a minute we not only saw the picture, we were part of it, little figures in the far right panel of an altarpiece, walking through a field near Siena.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Hoping Japan's Rate Cut Lifts Stocks Here

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
Markets around the world are used to dealing with conflicting monetary and fiscal policies. But in Japan these days, the markets are being torn between happiness over newly friendly central bankers and worry about suddenly hostile cops. For the moment, fear of cops seems paramount.
 To Occidental ears, the scandal sounds a bit odd. What the big brokers seem to have done is to bring to securities sales the policy that once made Sears this nation's leading retailer: "Satisfaction guaranteed or your money back." The brokers are accused not of defrauding customers, but of refunding their losses. 
The refunds went only to the biggest and most powerful clients, and shock is being voiced at the idea that some customers are treated better than others. It is reminiscent of Claude Rains's professed surprise at gambling in Casablanca, and speculation is rampant that something more must be going on. Francis Scotland, who runs the Bank Credit Analyst in Montreal, suggests that perhaps the brokers, in effect, turned themselves in to the Government, hoping it would force them to welch on their promises to customers.
 "The real risk" to the markets, suggested John Lipsky, Salomon Brothers's director of international research, "would be if there was a direct political connection, as there was in the Recruit scandal." The fact that Japanese brokers were offering guarantees against loss is an obvious sign of complacency and is the type of excess that Yashushi Mieno, the governor of Japan's central bank, had vowed to wipe out. So it came as a big surprise to nearly everyone when Mr. Mieno began last week by cutting the discount rate.
 The initial reaction was bullish, not just in Japan, where the Nikkei 225 index soared 3.5 percent on Monday, but around the world. "Mr. Mieno is showing himself to be not impervious to the actions of markets," said Lewis E. Lehrman, the chairman of Lehrman Buell Mueller Cannon Inc. and one-time candidate for Governor of New York. "This is the first step in the move of the entire Japanese establishment to a 1992 expansion."
 But the enthusiasm soon faded. The Nikkei ended the week at its lowest level since January. In the United States, the Dow Jones industrial average slipped late in the week, although still ending with a rise of 25.72 points, to 2,932.47.
 Optimism about the world's economic growth has generally grown in the last six months, but that confidence may be wider than it is deep, and it soon occurred to many that the Bank of Japan's reversal of course could signify it was newly alarmed about the possibility of a recession in that country. The slight rise in American unemployment in June, the month after the recession was supposed to have bottomed out, added to nervousness.
 Still, markets generally do better if central bankers are friendly, and cops eventually go back to chasing other kinds of crooks. Mr. Scotland thinks Japan's discount rate cut is the "beginning of a major change in central bank policy" that will eventually aid American stock prices.

HEADLINE: Savoring Maine's Unspoiled Nature

BYLINE: By ROBERT ANDERSEN; ROBERT ANDERSEN lives in Kittery Point, Me.

 BODY:
JUST when you're ready to concede southern Maine to the fate of a development rampage in the likeness of Cape Cod, the sign for the Wells Reserve appears, and what was the flotsam and jetsam of a vacationland stupor becomes instead the flora and fauna of a seaside rapture. The contrast is as sharp as it is improbable. Having glazed the eye with its commercial stock in trade, Route 1 at the northern end of Wells delivers up one of the unremarked splendors of the Maine coast. Quite suddenly one is afield in a landscape pastoral and pristine, an unexpected domain of woodland and saltmarsh, fallow pasture and barrier beach.
From the high ground at the Laudholm Farm, the 1,600-acre reserve falls away to the Atlantic, revealing the lay of the land and the sweep of the coast. In the near view, on either flank, two glinting rivers curl and oxbow through the marsh to empty into the ocean, while in the distance the singular bulge of Mount Agamenticus rises as a lone sentinel. Overall the effect is to reclaim, in the mind's eye, an identity, indeed an integrity to this coast. One hikes the reserve's trails, inspects its forests, marsh and estuary ecologies, basks on its beaches and absorbs its serenity, and exults in its hard-won exemption from the flanking rampage. Somehow not even the condo clusters and beachfront subdivisions looming to the south can detract from the experience of seeing southern Maine in a salubrious light, as a natural wonder of distinctive if imperiled character. 
 A hike through the Wells Reserve and Brave Boat Harbor, to the south, is a reassurance that all has not yet been lost. The Wells Reserve is a singular environmental enclave whose variegated topography includes the watersheds of the Little River and the Webhannet River, together with the complete inventory of wetland habitats, from the evergreen forest of the upland edge to the saltmarsh, barrier-beach complex at the estuary mouth. With 1,200 of its 1,600 acres made up of marshland and a river system that is reputedly the cleanest in New England, the Wells Reserve is as pristine as one finds on the southern Maine coast. It is also a pastoral gem, preserving, in the imposing buildings and fields of the old Laudholm Farm, a reminder of a 300-year-old tradition of saltwater farming.
Acre for acre more fecund than the richest Iowa cornfield (generating up to 10 tons of plant matter per acre per year, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) the wetlands of southern Maine act as a bourse and buffer, hatchery and habitat, prodigy and progenitor. They also act, in their recent incarnation as a fragile and stressed environment, as a bellwether of a silent spring.
The wetlands, extending from Kittery Point to Cape Elizabeth, a distance of nearly 50 miles, originally comprised a vast interlacing ecosystem, a veritable aquatic empire. Formed some 12,000 years ago, they remained intact well into the 20th century. But their siting at the northern end of the Atlantic barrier beach system only insured their eventual demise, with the rise of Maine's so-called Gold Coast, an area that has been developed for tourism. The onslaught on "vacant" land has intensified in the past two decades, the consequence of a dramatic population influx into York County. In very short order what was once an empire has become a mere effigy of one, a fragmented remnant. Indeed, once the source of the fabled fisheries of the Gulf of Maine and the renowned saltwater farms of the York coast, the wetlands of southern Maine have been relegated to the fragile status of a "protected" environment. Shadowing Route 1 in a vestigial counterpoint, the marsh has become alien to the coastline that once so richly favored it.
The bulk of the Wells Reserve, a unique concatenation of local, state and Federal jurisdictions, is made up of most of two divisions of the Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge, and the plight of the refuge tells the story of wetland decimation. Responsible for preserving 3,400 acres situated in 10 divisions along 45 miles of coast, the Rachel Carson is woefully understaffed, underfunded and undersized. At the refuge headquarters three full-timers cope with managing a far-flung island chain, while a sorry budget for additional acquisition leaves the refuge stranded, 4,000 acres short of its federally mandated goal, in an area where land is much coveted by developers willing to pay top dollar. Indeed, several divisions are virtually ringed by construction. A bare bones operation since its founding in 1966, the refuge has become, for too many intents and purposes, not much more than a waterfowl logo found on the occasional boundary post. No small irony for a sanctuary dedicated to the memory of the author of "The Sea Around Us" and "Silent Spring," seminal works in the advancement of ecological awareness, the Rachel Carson Refuge bids to become a crude caricature of environmental concern.
Precisely because it encapsulates the estuarine environment in its manifold diversity, the Wells Reserve is a National Estuarine Research Reserve, one of 18 in the country and the first to be established in the Acadian biogeographical region (Calais to Cape Cod). Dedicated in 1986, the reserve exists primarily to support the research and conservation mandate of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and to educate the public about estuaries, with programs aimed at schoolchildren. But though the reserve is a natural field laboratory, to which public access is conditional (visitors are requested to register with the office), that access is not inconsiderable, given the completion, in 1989, of seven miles of nature trails, after Acadia National Park the largest trail system on the Maine coast.
From the trailhead at the Laudholm Farm, one can hike the reserve in a few hours. Trails lead to the Laudholm Beach, the estuary and marsh overlooks, and across pasture and "old fields" (first cleared in the 17th century) to the evergreen forest of the upland section. There are five main trails, each posted, none more than two miles long.
The place to begin walking, however, is at the Rachel Carson headquarters, on Route 9 half a mile from the Route 1 junction. There, an ecosystem overview is provided by a one-mile interpretive nature trail that is accessible to the handicapped. Though parking is tight (nine spaces), this trail is not to be missed, not least because it enters a beautiful hemlock and white pine forest. This forested section of the upland edge juts into the expansive marsh in headland fashion, enabling one to follow the meanderings of the Branch Brook on one side and the lazy current of the Merriland River on the other. These freshwater streams become tidal conduits that twice daily replenish a nutrient-rich "broth" from the detritus of the enveloping marsh. One learns, from the Carson Trail Guide, that the tidal zone is determining, and that the marsh grass found above the high tide mark, so-called salt hay (spartina patens), is quite different from the saltwater cordgrass (spartina alterniflora) subject to daily immersion. One also learns to distinguish salt pans, salt-laden tidal ponds, from their freshwater analogues. Salt pans are important feeding sites for the myriad waterfowl and shore birds that winter in the marsh, or flock there in the spring and fall migrations. At last count about 200 species of birds had been sighted in these marshes. (The brochure "Birds of the Rachel Carson," available at the kiosk, catalogues the sightings by frequency and season.) The ominous decline in songbird populations over the last 30 years makes the refuge all the more critical as a last bastion on the Atlantic Flyway.
From Route 1 the Laudholm Farm is about a mile, or, in terms of time, a distance of roughly a hundred years. Perched in august fashion atop a treeless knoll with a commanding view of the flatland to the south, the farm stands much as it did when the railroad magnate George Lord bought the property from the Clark family, in 1881, and transformed the Federal main house into an imposing Greek Revival mansion, with 32 rooms and a splendid wrap-around porch. Until 1952, when the Guernsey herd was sold at auction, the Laudholm Farm was a showcase operation, one of the largest and most productive saltwater farms in Maine. It was also the oldest, dating the clearing of the forest for pasture to 1643.
Indeed, for nearly 300 years the four families that held successive title to the land harvested salt hay in the upper marsh and clammed in the tidal flats of the Little River estuary. When a local environmentalist, Mort Mather, led the fight to save the farm from impending development, in the late 1970's, the forest had returned, the mansion had become a rundown old manse, and the lore of saltwater farming had been consigned to the archives as oral history. By the mid 1980's, however, an extraordinary grass-roots campaign mounted by friends of the Laudholm Farm, who had grown to 2,407 by 1986, succeeded in wresting the 245-acre property from Gold Coast designs, making it instead the cornerstone of an inviolate Wells Reserve. Today the beautifully restored Greek Revival edifice serves as a Visitor Center, and the farm has become a showcase of volunteerism. The envy of the reserve system and an object lesson in environmental insurgency, the Laudholm Farm contrasts with the beleaguered status of its next-door neighbor, the Rachel Carson.
It is not difficult to understand why there are now 2,800 members of the Laudholm Trust, the fund-raising arm of the reserve; or why firms and individuals donate thousands of hours of labor renovating and restoring; or why 51 docents and some 200 to 300 volunteers commit the flora and fauna of the reserve to memory. Clearly the farm is a labor of love, and the brief drive from the gate to the parking lot at the foot of the knoll puts this communal spirit in perspective. Acting as a grand proscenium, the sloping pasture culminates, at the crown of the knoll, in the dramatic lines of two magnificent buildings, the 120-ton barn and the Greek Revival farmhouse. Each is newly resplendent in the yellow facade and green roof of a prosperity well met, if radically redefined. The Laudholm Farm becomes the Farm-on-the-Hill, the emblem of New England proportion and harmony and the icon of Maine primitivism and heroism.
From the Maine coast to interior New England is two miles, if one reckons by the Laird-Norton trail, the longest and loveliest trail in the Reserve. Beginning on a boardwalk by the edge of the marsh, it proceeds from the lowland bog of a deciduous forest -- red maple, birch, alder -- to the upland meadow of an evergreen forest: pine, hemlock, spruce, birch, oak and maple. Along the way there are two platforms that invite closer scrutiny of the estuary and the marsh. The overview of the Little River estuary is especially mesmerizing. A broad open field acts as a buffer zone, linking lowland to upland, its thickly matted, spongy grass a natural futon from which to observe the passing cloud formations. The upland meadow, encircled by tall pines, is another world. Indeed, on Lord Road just this side of Route 1, tall trees have muted the insistent clamor of the surf line, enough to sustain the illusion that one is much farther inland. But backtrack a hundred yards and the Atlantic resumes its rhythmic noise, keeping this polyglot landscape in thrall. Indeed, what unites these disparate sections, these diverse habitats, is precisely that oceanic roar.
Of the 10 divisions in the Rachel Carson, the one that is most evocative of the woman and her writing, indeed, the one that can be said to manifest her spirit and her legacy, is Brave Boat Harbor, on Cutts Island in Kittery Point, at the very beginning of the Maine coast. Nearly 430 acres, going on 560 with the recent donation of the Raynes Property, Brave Boat Harbor is the least disturbed, most "indigenous" of all the wetlands in southern Maine, the only division, for instance, that permits the harvesting of shellfish.
Dominated by a surging tidal inlet that sluices through the expansive marsh along natural irrigation channels, Brave Boat cuts out the estuary middleman to effect a direct merger with the sea. Here the aquatic economy flourishes in simplified fashion, in the midst of a forest backdrop unimaginably distant from the mall economy scarcely four miles away. For those willing to brave mosquito swarms, black flies in attack formation, and a carpeting of poison ivy, the trek through the splendid pine, oak, maple, birch and ash forest that has sprung up on the site of the old pasture brings one to the edge of the marsh.
The quiet resolve and poetic grace of this place is remarkable, as if the pen of Rachel Carson had created it in the first place.
 
 
 
IF YOU GO

 
Wells Reserve
The sign for the Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve, (207) 646-1555, is on Route 1, about a mile and a half north of Wells Center. To avoid Route 1 take the Maine Turnpike north to exit 2, turning left after the toll gate onto Route 9. Proceed to Route 1, turn left at the stoplight and go north to the second blinker light. Take a right onto Laudholm Farm Road, and follow the sign to the gate (on Lord Road). The gate is open every day from 8 A.M. to 5 P.M.
 
Visitor Center
 From July 1 to Oct. 31 the Wells Reserve Visitor Center is open from Monday to Saturday from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. and on Sunday from noon to 4. General and special tours are given; check the schedule for such docent-led tours as bird walk, sky watch and wildflowers. Each tour is $2.50 per person or $5 for a family. Admission is free if visitors do not take a tour. In July and August, however, there is a parking fee of $5 per car, which is waived if visitors take a tour. There is a 70-car parking limit.
 
Rachel Carson
 The Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge headquarters at the Upper Wells Division, (207) 646-9226, can be reached by staying on Route 9 for about a half mile past the junction with Route 1. Parking is severely limited. Built by volunteer labor in 1988, this handicapped-accessible trail constitutes the refuge's only formal public access.
 
Brave Boat
 The Refuge at Brave Boat Harbor can be reached by way of Route 103 and Chauncey Creek Road, in Kittery Point. The Raynes Property is on the left side of Seapoint Road on the way to Seapoint Beach. Just across from the tidal inlet from Cutts Island Lane is a small turnout. The trail to the left will take the hiker to the site of the old trestle, overlooking the marsh, a distance of about two miles.
 
Where to Stay
 Following are close to the Rachel Carson Refuge::
Gundalow Inn, 6 Water Street, Kittery, Me. 03904; (207) 439-4040). Six rooms, each with bath, in faithfully restored 1889 Victorian house. The inn has a no-smoking policy. Situated just the other side of Memorial Bridge from Portsmouth, N.H. (local Route 1), the Gundalow is five miles from Brave Boat Harbor.

HEADLINE: State Is Trying to Protect Its Endangered Species

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
MARGARET ARDWIN was turning over rocks in a small stream that feeds a reservoir outside Hartford, when she spotted a salamander. Ms. Ardwin, a botanist, said she might have found a spring salamander, considered a threatened species in Connecticut, and she went scrambling over the moss-covered, water-slick rocks for a better look.
A few days earlier, another member of her team, Adam Fry, had discovered a previously unknown site for the grasshopper sparrow, considered endangered in the state. To find a spring salamander would have been another conservationist's coup. 
 It was only a dusky salamander, though, which is not the focus of any special attention. Ms. Ardwin seemed cheerful anyway.
"Remember doing this as a kid?" she asked over her shoulder as she halfheartedly turned over a few more rocks. "I guess we never got over it."
 
One Endangered Mammal
 Many biologists like Ms. Ardwin and Mr. Fry are excited about finding new locations for rare species in the state, because of the promised protection of some new regulations. On Wednesday evening the State Department of Environmental Protection will conduct a hearing in Hartford on its draft regulations to implement a law passed three years ago to protect species considered endangered, threatened or of special concern.
The department is not handing out these designations lightly. Of 77 mammalian species in the state, only one is officially endangered -- the least shrew. No mammals are listed as threatened, but 12 are considered of special concern.
In all, 85 of 469 vertebrates were listed, along with 100 among an unknown number of invertebrates and 313 of the state's 1,644 plant species.
Each listing includes both the scientific and common name, so people can tell, for instance, that Alasmidonta heterodon, proposed for the endangered list, is really the dwarf wedge mussel.
Some developers say the law is making them the latest endangered species.
"There is a concern that it will be another level of regulation, which would add to the development cost of housing in the state," said Michael G. Lauzier, director of governmental affairs for the Connecticut Home Builders Association. "And right now, with the economy the way it is, we can't afford to do that."
He said his group was considering hiring an expert to examine the list for accuracy. "It's very hard to determine whether every listing is legitimate," Mr. Lauzier said.
 
Unanimous Decisions
 Dr. Kent E. Holsinger, a botanist in the department of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Connecticut and a member of the committee that helped draft the list of rare plants, said only species that are clearly rare made the preliminary list.
"In most cases, there wasn't even a lot of discussion," Dr. Holsinger said. "There were no cases where there was even strongly divergent opinion. And in all cases, even where some members had some questions initially, the decisions were reached unanimously."
Dr. Holsinger said that the draft regulations do not go far enough. "As they are written, they only really affect state-owned land," he said. "There's relatively little state-owned land in Connecticut, so in that respect it will have little impact in terms of legal protection.
"The law's main impact will be largely raising the consciousness of the public that there are rare species in the state."
Leslie J. Mehrhoff of the Department of Environmental Protection's natural diversity database staff, said private developers would be almost unaffected by the law. But some of its provisions would affect everyone, he added.
The regulations would make it illegal to take endangered or threatened species from state land or to collect them for sale or export from any land in the state, a provision that Mr. Mehrhoff said could cause some problems.
 
Refinements Ahead
 A person trying to drive a truckload of balsam fir, considered endangered, through Connecticut, could be liable for arrest. So could an entomologist who collects a Persius dusky wing butterfly.
"Right now, as the law reads, you can't collect anything that is threatened or endangered," Mr. Mehrhoff said. "Obviously, it is going to have to be refined."
But Mr. Mehrhoff was one of the earliest and most ardent supporters of the legislation. He recalled once taking a group on a botanical tour, pointing out species like the rare whorled pogonia, an orchid native to Connecticut. A few days later he returned to the site and found a hole where the pogonia had been dug up for some collector's plant window.
Enforcing the law will be difficult, since the enabling legislation provided no staff.
"More conservation officers are needed just to enforce existing regulatory provisions, and this will be more on top of that," said George Brys of the department's wildlife bureau.
 
Slimy Salamander Found
 Aiding the state are private conservation organizations that report sightings of rare species to add to the natural diversity listing, including the Nature Conservancy, the most aggressive of the groups.
Two years ago, soon after the legislature enacted the law, the Conservancy put together a team that surveyed Fairfield County, where it found 30 new locations of rare species like the slimy salamander and the northern metalmark butterfly.
Last year the team surveyed the lower Connecticut River Valley, and this year it is surveying the upper river, said the executive director of the Conservancy, Leslie N. Corey Jr.
The surveying costs about $75,000 a year, he said, and while the group would like to do the entire state, it must finance those studies privately. Connecticut is the only state where the Conservancy has undertaken the job without state assistance.
"The survey is the tool we use in applied science to determine which areas should be protected," Mr. Corey said. "And now is a good time to be trying to protect some of these areas, while the economy is slow, and land prices are down, and there is very little development."
Mr. Corey said, however, that in a time of tight budgets, it is difficult to justify spending on surveys or conservation.
 
'Richness Indicators'
 "If you've got something that's coming out of a pipe, people agree you have to do something about it," he said. "But when you're talking about the erosion of our ecological diversity, that's not something you can see. Social needs are so overwhelming, they inundate the system. But the environment is not a frill."
In a forest within a few miles of downtown Hartford one day recently, a Conservancy team leader, Juliana Barrett, explained that the group looks for "richness indicators," things like maidenhair fern and blue cohosh, that tell an observer whether the soils are of a type where rare plants would live.
With her canvas knapsack overflowing with field guides, notebooks, maps and pencils, and with field glasses strapped around her neck, Ms. Barrett began walking along a well-blazed trail, keeping a running map of the vegetation types she saw along the side. Then she struck away from the trail, hiking up a steep, rocky hill, where she found patches of hepatica, a small woodland flowering plant, and rattlesnake plantain, an orchid found in dry oak woods.
"You have to get off the trail, away from where everything has been trampled," Ms. Barrett said. "But even so, it's a real needle-in-the-haystack kind of thing.
"Just because we don't find something doesn't mean it isn't there. We have to cover a lot of ground very quickly, so we're bound to miss some things."
After scrambling along the flood plains of the Connecticut River once recent hot afternoon, wading through stinging nettles and playing pincushion to hordes of mosquitoes, the team from the Nature Conservancy found a green dragon.
That plant, related to the jack-in-the-pulpit, was the best find of the day, even though it is designated only of special concern, not even rare enough to warrant threatened, or endangered status.
Often, the group will not know whether a truly rare species has been found until the sample has been collected, mounted and examined under a microscope back in the office.
"It can be anticlimactic," said Ms. Ardwin. "There are very few of those exciting moments when you're sure you've found something. It's sort of a gradual realization as the evidence accumulates."
As the group works its way up the Connecticut River, its members are keeping careful maps that will be copied for the state's natural diversity database. And with the legal protection of the new regulations, and the growing public awareness of the need to preserve ecological diversity, the biologists of the Conservancy and other organizations said they were hoping those species will get a second chance.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Q&A: George E. Hill;
Municipalities Face Some Tough Times

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
FOR the past 25 years, George E. Hill has been a professor in the Institute of Public Service at the University of Connecticut, which provides training for municipal officials and does research on issues of interest to municipalities. Mr. Hill is also the Mayor of Mansfield, president-elect of the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities and a member of the State Municipal Finance Advisory Committee, which is monitoring the financial problems of Waterbury, Stratford and New Haven.
Mr. Hill has been involved in municipal government issues since the mid-1960's, when he served as budget director in Hartford. 
 In an interview at his office at the Institute of Public Service in Storrs, Mr. Hill answered questions about the problems facing Connecticut municipalities. Here are some excerpts from the conversation.
Q. How has the Municipal Finance Advisory Committee's work evolved over the years?
A. It started in 1977 with the virtual bankruptcy of New York City, Cleveland and Yonkers. And there were some problems with the City of Waterbury. The legislature thought it would create a purely advisory board to advise the Governor and the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management how to proceed when municipalities did get into fiscal distress.
In all of the years I've served on it, close to 10 years, the main area of interest was reviewing the audit reports of municipalities. Once in a while we'd send out a letter saying, "Your audit needs to be improved in these areas," etc., etc. We never got into the issues we're facing today.
But the 1980's were a period of affluence for tax-receiving organizations. There was the expansion of the sales tax for the state and increases in grand lists on the local level. So we were able to do tremendous program improvements. The problem is perhaps some of those improvements shouldn't have been made, because when the bottom fell out of the economy, the state government told towns and cities it couldn't fulfill its statutory obligations and it was cutting back grants.
At the same time people weren't building, which meant grand lists weren't increasing, which meant municipalities had to raise taxes or cut services, and most towns had to do a combination of both.
For the first time in my memory we've actually been charged by the Secretary to review the financial condition of three cities. Bridgeport is being reviewed under a special agency. And there are several other communities heading towards a review by the Municipal Finance Advisory Commission.
Q. What are some of the signs you look for in deciding which towns to monitor?
 A. They're having a reduced property tax collection rate; no growth in the grand list; high debt per capita, which means they're bonding too much; low grand list per capita, which means the resources aren't there to pay for the services they want to provide. We look at whether they've met their budget goals for expenditures and revenues for the past two years -- a lot of towns have not. All of those indicators show next year may be even a busier year for the municipal advisory board.
Q. Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. has proposed a new panel that would have significantly more power over communities in fiscal distress. Do you think that's necessary?
 A. I have some problems with the bill. I thought it could be improved by having a majority of the membership made up of municipal officials, so that when a mayor gets in fiscal distress and comes to the board, his peers are saying: "Hey, you've got problems. How are you going to work it out?" It's a much easier process to have someone who's been in your shoes advising you on how to proceed. The Governor's board, the majority would be state officials, which I think would be a terrible mistake.
It also has provisions for, once a town is cited as being fiscally distressed, it gives the board the power to negate collective bargaining agreements. I don't see it passing the legislature in that form. And there should be some sort of administrative appeals process. As it is now it leaves too much discretion in the hands of state officials, who have not exactly done a wonderful job on the finances of the State of Connecticut.
 Q. How would the commission handle it if one of the member's towns got into fiscal distress?
 A. Obviously, they would be prevented from participating in any board action. Several members of the board have professional relationships with some of these cities that are in fiscal distress and have excluded themselves. We make sure there is no conflict of interest.
 Q. Why has Hartford, which has the same sort of problems as Bridgeport and New Haven, so far escaped the commission's scrutiny?
 A. Most people point to Hartford as having a very efficient form of government; they've had a series of very professional city managers, and their charter is a very strict charter. It doesn't allow them to manipulate the property tax collection rate projections, which has happened in other cities. Some have had very high estimates of collection rates to balance their budgets.
Hartford's charter requires it to use an average of the last three years, which prevents the council from saying, "Well, we're collecting 88 percent of taxes, let's predict 94, so we can balance the budget," which some municipalities have done. They have never run a deficit in Hartford, which shows you strong management, if given the political support, even in a New Haven or Waterbury, can make it, but the decisions are very difficult ones.
It means saying to the unions, "We're having givebacks or layoffs." It means saying to the Board of Education, as they did in Hartford: "You know that 3 or 4 million dollars you wanted? You're not getting it."
 Q. How are the towns that are being monitored by the commission responding?
 A. Stratford seems to have a plan to bring it out of trouble. I have talked with the Mayors of Waterbury and New Haven, and they're making decisions that you would normally never see a mayor make in an election year. You're going to be on the ballot in November, and you're laying off firemen and policemen and teachers and cutting recreation programs?
They are making decisions I haven't seen since the 1977-78 recession. This is the worst I have ever seen municipalities, financially.
 Q. Waterbury has come up with an interesting plan to reduce its deficit. What's been the reaction?
 A. The board is examining it. It's called a leaseback, where they're leasing their delinquent taxes to a financial institution who will loan them $10 million, then give them back to the city, which will collect the taxes and pay off, over a five-year period, the $10 million. Very creative. State law prohibits bonding for debt for municipalities. This new financial device, of leasing their accounts receivables, gets around that prohibition because it's under the general powers clause of the statutes, which allows cities the power to lease, and they've got tentative approval from a highly respected bond counsel. But this may be an area the General Assembly would like to look at.
 Q. If they are successful, will other towns try the same thing?
 A. Every town is going to be in serious financial condition if the economy doesn't turn around, not just the Waterburys and New Havens. What Waterbury is banking on is that the economy will turn around. Right now they've got a mass of delinquent accounts, and they're foreclosing on properties, but they can't find a buyer, there is no market for foreclosed properties in Waterbury, or anywhere in this economy.
If they sell them now, they may get 10 cents on the dollar, and then other taxpayers are going to go in an ask for a reduction in their assessment, based on those sale prices, so the effect would snowball.
They're banking that the economy will regenerate, start producing more jobs, higher property-tax collection rates, and let them gradually sell off their liened properties, and receive fire-sale prices. I think it's not an unfair assumption.
 Q. As a mayor, how would you feel about the commission, or an even stronger panel, looking over your shoulder?
 A. As a mayor, I would try to make sure we never get to that point. I would insist on being in control of my own financial destiny. But the problems of Mansfield are so insignificant compared to the Hartfords and Waterburys and Bridgeports. The poverty and the crime and the other problems are beyond the control of any municipal officials. We in small towns are not faced with those tremendous societal ills. We can get by tough times, without facing deficits, by making a few tough decisions. In large cities, without massive state or Federal intervention, the condition is not going to change unless the economy turns around very quickly.
 Q. How are Connecticut towns faring compared with others in the Northeast?
 A. I'll give credit to Governor Weicker and the General Assembly, they're not dismantling state and local government the way they are in Massachusetts under the Democratic party. I have to give Governor Weicker and the legislature accolades.
They may not be giving us all we think we need in grants, but they're not drastically dismantling a fine state-local cooperative effort as they are in Massachusetts.
In New Hampshire they're cutting $40 million in state grants to towns and cities. Massachusetts has a $300 million reduction.
In Connecticut we're basically maintaining the status quo. All in all, we're pretty fortunate.

HEADLINE: Focus: Proposition 13;
California's 'Tax Revolt' Faces Challenge

BYLINE: By MORRIS NEWMAN

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
A CASE challenging Proposition 13, California's "tax revolt" law, is wending its way toward the U.S. Supreme Court. If the court agrees to hear the case, its decision is likely to affect every homeowner in California.
At issue is the law's way of taxing property. Its critics say it lets homeowners of long standing pay far less in property tax than newcomers. Stephanie Nordlinger, the Los Angeles lawyer who is asking the High Court to hear her case, says the law creates enormous disparities in property taxes. 
 Ms. Nordlinger bought a two-bedroom tract house in suburban Baldwin Hills in 1988 for $170,000. Under Proposition 13, which limits property taxes to 1 percent of the purchase price plus negligible annual increases, she pays about $1,700 a year in property taxes.
But some of her neighbors, who live in identical houses that they bought years before, pay a fixed tax of little more than $300, reflecting the lower prices then.
"I'm paying the same tax as the owner of a $2 million house in Malibu," an exclusive beachfront area, she said.
Her situation is common among home buyers. A survey of 10,000 recent property buyers in Los Angeles County shows that the new homeowners commonly pay 5 to 17 times the property tax of their neighbors, according to a study commissioned by Ms. Nordlinger's lawyers, Hall & Phillips of Los Angeles. The study was prepared by an economist, David Gold.
Ms. Nordlinger acknowledges that she has "always been against Prop 13." She voted against the measure in 1978, and, as a Los Angeles County public defender in the late 70's, participated in an earlier, unsuccessful suit brought by county employees denied promotions and raises because of budget cuts prompted by Proposition 13.
Yet Ms. Nordlinger said she did not set out to make a test case of Proposition 13 until she discovered the difference between her tax payments and those of her neighbors while perusing public records.
After the Center for Law in the Public Interest, a local nonprofit advocacy group, agreed to pay the legal fees for the challenge, Ms. Nordlinger sued Los Angeles County and County Supervisor Kenneth Kahn, seeking declaratory relief under the equal-protection clause.
Her case lost in both Superior Court here and on appeal; in both cases, judges cited a 1978 decision by the State Supreme Court upholding Proposition 13. In June, Ms. Nordlinger asked the United States Supreme Court to hear the case, since the justices had agreed to hear R. H. Macy & Company's challenge to the same law this spring. Macy's later withdrew the suit, saying other California taxpayers could suffer ill effects if the law were overturned.
Before Proposition 13, property taxes set county by county were 2 to 3 percent of assessed value, high by California standards, and varied with location. Those high rates posed hardships for the two most vulnerable classes of homeowners -- first-time buyers and retirees on fixed incomes, said Mack Powell, a Sacramento broker and president of the state's Association of Realtors.
"Taxes were becoming outrageous," Mr. Powell said. " Some homeowners were not able to hold onto their properties."
Antitax and antigovernment sentiments prevailed in 1978, when Howard Jarvis, who has since died, rallied California voters with his slogan, "I'm mad as hell." The proposition passed with the approval of 66 percent of the electorate.
The law "gave people security in keeping their property, and continues to give them certainty on their tax payments," said Joel Fox, president of Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, a local nonprofit advocacy group.
AMENDMENTS to Proposition 13 have enlarged the powers -- and the loopholes -- available to taxpayers. Under one amendment, tax rates can be passed on from generation to generation by allowing parents to transfer their tax rates to their children along with property.
"We are creating this feudal class of people who will go into the next century not paying any higher taxes, simply because they were lucky enough to own property at the right time," said Ms. Nordlinger.
The biggest beneficiaries have been homeowners who bought their houses in 1978, when tax levels were rolled back to 1975 levels. Carlyle Hall, the lawyer who represents Ms. Nordlinger, called this the "welcome stranger" provision of Proposition 13.
"The entire tax increase is being carried on the backs of the newcomers," he said. "Everybody who was fortunate enough to own a house in 1975 pays very little more than they did in that base year."
Mr. Fox of the Jarvis group defends the wide tax differentials. "When newcomers come in, they enjoy the schools and infrastructure paid for by the taxes of those who have been there for a long time," he said.
Proposition 13's effect on consumers is difficult to gauge. Some people say they are reluctant to sell their current home and buy a new one, fearing a heavier tax burden, said Richard Peiser, director of the Lusk Center of Real Estate Development at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.
Empty-nesters, he said, are "holding onto their houses when their kids have moved, and are 'consuming' more housing than they need, because if they move their costs will go up, even if they go to smaller housing."
Yet Proposition 13 has not led to the same grassroots protest as did high taxes in the 70's. The promise of fixed tax rates has lulled many taxpayers "into accepting an inequitable tax structure," said the Report of the Senate Commision of Property Tax Equity and Revenue to the California State Senate, which appeared in June.
The study says the new property owner "may wince at learning that her neighbor in an identical house pays significantly less in property taxes," yet may acquiesce to the tax rate when she realizes that she will be "paying relatively less taxes as time passes."
Many California home buyers, indeed, seem unaware that they are paying a disproportionate amount of property tax. Mr. Powell said he finds it "amazing" that home buyers rarely quiz him on taxes when viewing homes for sale. Ira Norris, an Orange County home builder who specializes in the first-time market, said buyers are primarily concerned about price, not taxes. Instead, he said, when he talks to buyers, "they ask only, 'Is this the place I want to live? Does my builder have a good reputation? How much do I have to put down, and how much do I have to pay a month?' "
Home sales agents are nervous about what may happen to the home market if the court or the legislature changes Proposition 13. If taxes are to be based on market value rather than original purchase price, "older people on fixed income will be forced to move out of their homes," said Barbara Baerg, a sales associate with First National Realty-Gribin Von Dyl of Sherman Oaks. Buyers, on the other hand, may feel some anxiety about their inability to predict the future costs of homeownership.
If the Supreme Court strikes down Proposition 13, the Senate Commission offers several possible remedies to be enacted by the California legislature.
ONE is to slowly raise property values to market level while protecting against overall tax increases by lowering local tax rates, county by county. To shield low-income homeowners from a crushing tax burden, the study would raise the property tax exemption to $50,000 from the current $7,000. Owners of income property would pay a higher rate than homeowners, to redress the current tilt on the tax rolls toward new homeowners. And children would no longer be allowed to inherit tax rates along with property.
Mr. Powell of the realtors' group said he had no opinion on the choice of remedy but wants to preserve at least the predictability of Proposition 13. Ms. Nordlinger, however, rates "fairness" above predictability.
"People ask for certainty, but life is uncertain," she said. "The most important issue is equitable taxation."

CORRECTION-DATE: August 11, 1991, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An arcticle on July 7 about a suit challenging Proposition 13 in California misidentified a defendant and his office, and omitted the identity of a second defendant. A recent letter from the plaintiff, Stephanie Nordlinger, notes that the defendants are Kenneth E. Hahn, the Los Angeles County Tax Assessor (not Supervisor), and the county itself.

California's Tax 'Revolt' Faces Challenge

 Antitax and antigovernment sentiments prevailed in 1978, when Howard Jarvis, who has since died, rallied California voters with his slogan, "I'm mad as hell." The proposition passed with the approval of 66 percent of the electorate.
 The law "gave people security in keeping their property, and continues to give them certainty on their tax payments," said Joel Fox, president of Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, a local nonprofit advocacy group.
 Amendments to Proposition 13 have enlarged the powers -- and the loopholes --available to taxpayers. Under one amendment, tax rates can be passed on from generation to generation by allowing parents to transfer their tax rates to their children along with property.
 "We are creating this feudal class of people who will go into the next century not paying any higher taxes, simply because they were lucky enough to own property at the right time," said Ms. Nordlinger.
 The biggest beneficiaries have been homeowners who bought their houses in 1978, when tax levels were rolled back to 1975 levels. Carlyle Hall, the lawyer who represents Ms. Nordlinger, called this the "welcome stranger" provision of Proposition 13.
 "The entire tax increase is being carried on the backs of the newcomers," he said. "Everybody who was fortunate enough to own a house in 1975 pays very little more than they did in that base year."
 Mr. Fox of the Jarvis group defends the wide tax differentials. "When newcomers come in, they enjoy the schools and infrastructure paid for by the taxes of those who have been there for a long time," he said.
 Proposition 13's effect on consumers is difficult to gauge. Some people say they are reluctant to sell their current home and buy a new one, fearing a heavier tax burden, said Richard Peiser, director of the Lusk Center of Real Estate Development at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.
 Empty-nesters, he said, are "holding onto their houses when their kids have moved, and are 'consuming' more housing than they need, because if they move their costs will go up, even if they go to smaller housing."
 Yet Proposition 13 has not led to the same grassroots protest as did high taxes in the 70's. The promise of fixed tax rates has lulled many taxpayers "into accepting an inequitable tax structure," said the Report of the Senate Commision of Property Tax Equity and Revenue to the California State Senate, which appeared in June.
 The study says the new property owner "may wince at learning that her neighbor in an identical house pays significantly less in property taxes," yet may acquiesce to the tax rate when she realizes that she will be "paying relatively less taxes as time passes."
 Many California home buyers, indeed, seem unaware that they are paying a disproportionate amount of property tax. Mr. Powell said he finds it "amazing" that home buyers rarely quiz him on taxes when viewing homes for sale. Ira Norris, an Orange County home builder who specializes in the first-time market, said buyers are primarily concerned about price, not taxes. Instead, he said, when he talks to buyers, "they ask only, 'Is this the place I want to live? Does my builder have a good reputation? How much do I have to put down, and how much do I have to pay a month?' "
 Home sales agents are nervous about what may happen to the home market if the court or the legislature changes Proposition 13. If taxes are to be based on market value rather than original purchase price, "older people on fixed income will be forced to move out of their homes," said Barbara Baerg, a sales associate with First National Realty-Gribin Von Dyl of Sherman Oaks. Buyers, on the other hand, may feel some anxiety about their inability to predict the future costs of homeownership.
 If the Supreme Court strikes down Proposition 13, the Senate Commission offers several possible remedies to be enacted by the California legislature.
 One is to slowly raise property values to market level while protecting against overall tax increases by lowering local tax rates, county by county. To shield low-income homeowners from a crushing tax burden, the study would raise the property tax exemption to $50,000 from the current $7,000. Owners of income property would pay a higher rate than homeowners, to redress the current tilt on the tax rolls toward new homeowners. And children would no longer be allowed to inherit tax rates along with property.
 Mr. Powell of the realtors' group said he had no opinion on the choice of remedy but wants to preserve at least the predictability of Proposition 13. Ms. Nordlinger, however, rates "fairness" above predictability.
 "People ask for certainty, but life is uncertain," she said. "The most important issue is equitable taxation."

HEADLINE: Prosperity Born of Pain

BYLINE: By Jonathan Kandell; Jonathan Kandell, author most recently of "La Capital: The Biography of Mexico City," writes frequently about Latin America.

 BODY:
It's a few days before the traditional summer break, and just about every Chilean with a savings account is packing for a long holiday on the Pacific beaches. Hyperinflation and recession, self-doubt and pessimism are worries for the rest of Latin America. In Chile, opinion polls register confidence, optimism, even a touch of smugness.
An economic miracle has been under way here for some time. In five of the last six years, the gross national product surged by at least 5 percent, and will probably climb faster in 1991. There is no debt crisis. Foreign investment is pouring in at an annual rate of $1 billion, and middle-class income is rising. Salaries have lagged among the poor, but unemployment rates are near historic lows. 
 And while the miracle has been tarnished by its association with Gen. Augusto Pinochet's harsh dictatorship, the country's image has soared over the last year, thanks to a new, elected president, Patricio Aylwin. With democratic stability and the promise of prosperity, Chile has become a model for the third world. "The admiration would have come sooner if the country had not been governed by such a repressive dictatorship," says Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard professor who advises governments in Latin America and Eastern Europe that are eager to carry out Chilean-type economic policies.
True, as vacations approached there was some unfinished business with General Pinochet, who has insisted on remaining army commander in chief until 1998. With the National Commission for Truth and Reconciliation -- a nonpartisan group appointed by President Aylwin to investigate all the killings carried out under the general's 17-year reign -- poised to release its findings, even Pinochet's admirers were hoping he would make a quick and quiet exit.
The general, however, wasn't following the script. Early on a Wednesday evening before the great summer exodus, he placed his troops in a state of alert. Panicky rumors of a coup in progress swept Santiago during the 17-hour military exercise. After the alert ended, General Pinochet agreed to meet with an enraged President Aylwin. But his point had been made: If Chileans want to enjoy the capitalist virtues of his regime, then they better accept and forgive its human rights sins.
Those sins were numerous, according to the National Commission for Truth and Reconciliation. Its report, since released, cites the dictatorship's victims by name, and describes the ghastly circumstances of their deaths. In all, more than 2,000 executions and disappearances are attributed to the state's security forces.
The fortunate among the doomed were simply executed by firing squads. The unlucky were beaten, mutilated, half-drowned or electrocuted before their bodies were ripped by bullets. Most of the victims were urban workers and peasants, but intellectuals, small-business men and politicians also perished. Leftists predominated, though many of the dead had no known political affiliation.
The randomness of the killings was especially evident in the early days of the Pinochet regime:
 In Santiago, on Sept. 23, 1973, army troops detained three young workers at the Sumar textile factory. Their bullet-riddled corpses were later found on a highway.
 In Paine, an agricultural community south of Santiago, 22 peasants ranging in age from 20 to 54, were taken away by police officers and army troops on Oct. 16, 1973, never to be seen again.
 In San Bernardo, on the outskirts of Santiago, three factory workers -- brothers still in their teens -- were seized at home by soldiers on Oct. 21, 1973, driven to an isolated hillside and placed before a firing squad. Miraculously, one of the brothers survived and was carried by sympathetic civilians to a hospital, where he recounted the tragedy to his doctors. The next day, police kidnapped him from his bed. He became a desaparecido -- a disappeared one.
President Aylwin's promise of financial reparations for the victims' families enjoys broad public support. Yet, surprisingly to many outsiders, there is little pressure for bringing the torturers and assassins to justice. Chileans seem reconciled to the reality that the most brutal dictatorship in their history presided over the creation of the soundest economy in Latin America.
None of the luster of Chile's economic miracle seems to have improved General Pinochet's wretched image abroad; virtually no foreign government will receive him officially. Nevertheless, to most Chileans his regime's atrocities are a thing of the past. Almost nobody wants to risk derailing economic growth and democratic government by punishing a few hundred culprits. The significant exceptions are three small left-wing terrorist factions that have assassinated several police officers, an ex-military physician, and most recently, a prominent right-wing senator, Jaime Guzman. The groups say they are seeking to avenge General Pinochet's victims.
 To an overwhelming degree, however, pragmatism now rules in Chile. "The truth is important in order to publicly vindicate the victims and fill a black hole in our history," says Jose Zalaquett, a lawyer who wrote much of the report of the Commission for Truth and Reconciliation. "But before the country decides on punishment, it has to ask whether or not it can afford to do so. Don't forget, Pinochet still heads the army, and he keeps saying, 'None of my men will be touched.' "
The general seized power in a 1973 coup because under the democratically elected, Marxist Government of Salvador Allende the country was sliding into chaos. Agrarian reform devastated agriculture. Factories were occupied by workers. Inflation reached three, then four digits. Demonstrations rocked Santiago almost daily in protest over shortages of food and other essentials. Washington did its utmost to cut off Chile's access to foreign credits and markets, and the Central Intelligence Agency helped finance major Allende opponents. Long a middle-level Latin American country -- with living standards somewhere between Argentina and Mexico -- Chile was descending into the poverty of Peru and Bolivia.
So the coup was no surprise. Neither was General Pinochet's promise "to extirpate the Marxist cancer," nor the savage way he went about it. But few people took seriously his vows to dismantle the state's dominant role in the economy, unloose private enterprise and "change the mentality" of Chileans. Those were goals that would require a generation of iron-fisted rule, both skeptical supporters and opponents said. The general, it seems, took heed and stayed in the presidential palace for almost a generation.
Even today, it's impossible to speak of Pinochet in the past tense. His military firepower remains intact. The Supreme Court is packed with his appointees. So is the Central Bank, whose directors share his obsession with fiscal prudence.
Most of all, it is the economy that bears his stamp. Long before the rest of Latin America rediscovered Adam Smith, Chile sold off its state companies, removed protectionist barriers to foreign goods and investment and encouraged businessmen to think of their market as the world rather than just the 13 million consumers living within the country's borders. While no better endowed than its neighbors, Chile soon surpassed them in the exploitation of its natural resources.
"We may not like the Government that came before us," says Finance Minister Alejandro Foxley. "But they did many things right. We have inherited an economy that is an asset." And in contrast to other third world countries, where development is concentrated in a few major cities, the Chilean boom has spread the entire 3,000-mile length of this sliver of a nation.
In the northern desert, farmers are using Israeli drip-irrigation techniques to produce bumper harvests of grapes that are sold in North America and Europe during the winter. High in the Andes, a consortium of Australian, British and Japanese investors has opened the world's largest privately owned copper mine. Renewable pine forests in southern Chile are exporting almost $1 billion annually in lumber, wood chips and pulp. Still further south, rain-drenched archipelagos and fjords have hatched a salmon industry with revenues that rival those of traditional fishmongers like Ireland and Scotland. Tourism also has become a billion-dollar business, as hordes of visitors discover the beaches, ski slopes, Swiss-style lakes and primeval forests of a country that embraces every ecosphere except a tropical zone.
Now that democracy reigns in Santiago again, officials from Buenos Aires and Mexico City, Warsaw and Bucharest, arrive almost monthly for cram courses on privatizing state industries and picking export winners. Eventually, these pilgrims make their way to the doorstep of Hernan Buchi, the 42-year-old former Finance Minister of the Pinochet Government.
Buchi lost the 1989 presidential election to Aylwin by a large margin, but he continues to be recognized as the genius behind Chile's economic miracle. A shy, ascetic man, Buchi is an unlikely icon for the glitzy new entrepreneurial class his policies have spawned. ("I'd feel more comfortable if he played polo and owned a BMW," says a young investment banker who admires him.)
Buchi's advice to his foreign suitors is blunt and discomforting. Before economic reforms can be undertaken, he tells them, their countries must pass through the sort of chaos Chile experienced in the Allende period. "Only after hitting bottom will the general population accept major transformations," he says. And don't look to the established business community for support, he adds. "When we started opening up our economy to the world, some of our strongest opposition came from businessmen."
Their resistance was understandable. Private enterprise in Latin America has always expected the state to provide a risk-free environment: ample and cheap credit lines, protection from imports and the near absence of domestic rivals. When these guarantees were suddenly removed by General Pinochet, a lot of elite firms went belly up. In their place rose a new class of entrepreneurs who were contemptuous of the old business ways.
These new Chilean businessmen like to cite CAP, a major steel producer, as an example of the past follies of private enterprise. CAP was created after World War II when the substitution of foreign imports by domestic manufactures became the rage in Latin America. From the day its ovens were first fired up, the company was a white elephant. Designed to manufacture every type of steel the country needed, CAP was unable to achieve high-volume efficiency for any one product. But high tariffs shielded it from competition from abroad. Moreover, CAP paid no corporate taxes, and the private entrepreneurs who owned most of its shares could always rely on their minority partner -- the Government -- for emergency loans.
The only losers were Chilean taxpayers, who paid a subsidy of $30 million a year to keep the company afloat. Nobody has ever bothered to calculate how much additional money consumers lost by not being allowed to buy cheaper imported steel.
"It was a real sweet life," recalls Roberto de Andraca, who has spent 32 years as a CAP executive. "We fixed any problems by talking to the very Government people who protected us: the central bank guy, the customs man, the tax official."
CAP's honeymoon with the Government ended after the Pinochet coup. On the advice of Chilean economists trained at the University of Chicago, public subsidies to corporations were withdrawn and tariffs on foreign imports were sharply reduced. "When we protested to Pinochet and his Finance Minister, they told us to go bankrupt if we couldn't compete," Andraca says. And to emphasize its resolve to let CAP swim or sink, the Government put its stake in the company up for sale.
In desperation, CAP embraced both orthodox austerity and unconventional financial policies. The company trimmed its product lines, turning out only those goods that could compete with foreign imports. The labor force was slashed. The remaining employees were induced to buy 15 percent of the company's shares with loans guaranteed by their pension funds. Another 15 percent of CAP was purchased by management. The rest of the shares were picked up by assorted institutions and private investors.
Even while it was servicing a mammoth $550 million foreign debt, CAP used its annual cash flow to buy other companies. "One of the reasons to diversify was to make it easier to sell our shares," explains Andraca, a tall, voluble 56-year-old engineer-turned-promoter. "Nobody wanted us just as a steel company."
Today, Andraca is chairman of CAP's holding company, which owns 19 firms -- enterprises ranging from mines to real estate to forestry -- with annual sales exceeding $600 million. Exports account for half of these revenues. CAP's steel division claims to be among the most efficient producers in the world. For Andraca, the biggest paradox is that CAP continues to be the largest provider of steel to the Chilean market: "Funny, when you think that we got into everything else because we thought we could never compete as a steel maker."
Nowadays, the Chilean economy is dominated by a score of business conglomerates, a few of them even larger than CAP. The Luksic Group, for example, rang up over $1 billion in sales last year from assorted ventures like mining, fishing, forestry, beverages, food products, rail transportation, real estate, hotels, telecommunications and banking. The rationale for such rampant diversification is the cyclical nature of businesses in Chilean history. "How do you know there will always be a market for fruit abroad, or that beer consumption will continue to rise at home?" asks Gonzalo Menendez, who runs the group's bank. "It makes sense to spread the risk. And of course, there's another reason: The economic boom in this country just keeps opening more and more opportunities that are too lucrative to cede to competitors."
Such frenzied growth is straining the traditional family structure of the big Chilean enterprises. In the old days, the patriarch staffed the top posts with his sons and nephews. But now, "the business groups know they have to reach beyond the family for good managers, and pay them good salaries," says the 42-year-old Menendez, who has the clear-eyed, exquisitely tailored look of the modern Chilean chief executive officer. There are perhaps only 150 to 200 executives in the country who earn annual incomes above $100,000. In the next few years, Menendez predicts, "there will be many more," and stock options will proliferate as companies fight for the loyalties of senior executives.
Just a few blocks west of Menendez's sumptuous Beaux-Arts bank headquarters, Santiago levels down to one-story houses and shops with a drab, provincial look of faded pastels and broken-tile roofs. Income also levels down, to a few thousand dollars or less a year. The men fixing motorbikes on the sidewalks and the pushcart vendors hawking empanadas -- meat-and-vegetable turnovers -- haven't heard of stock options. This is the neighborhood chosen by some of the more important trade unions for their headquarters.
During most of the dictatorship, they were shut down and their leaders incarcerated. The right to strike was rescinded, and union membership rolls shriveled. When the Pinochet era ended, the great fear among businessmen was that the pendulum would swing back, and that a resentful labor movement would force a soft-hearted new government to concede sharp wage increases that would undercut all those prosperous companies.
But nothing of the sort has happened. Under President Aylwin, a grandfatherly Christian Democrat, there have actually been fewer strikes than in Pinochet's last year, when they were still illegal. Union membership hasn't noticeably surged. There has been no wage explosion -- only moderate rises, well within the range deemed affordable by entrepreneurs.
"Maybe we've been too prudent," says Miguel Vega, the burly, 42-year-old leader of the textile workers, the most combative union in the Allende era. "But we don't want to be accused of social agitation. Who's to say Pinochet won't use labor unrest to come marching back into power?"
Probe a bit more, though, and Vega cites more far-reaching reasons for the lack of labor militance. The majority of Chilean enterprises, he notes, were created after the 1973 coup. "That's a generational problem for us because young workers have never been in contact with trade unions," Vega says. "Many of them are a lot better educated than their parents. I spent eight years in school, so I'm practically considered a scholar among my union colleagues. But it's not at all unusual to see young workers with high-school diplomas. It's hard for them to look up to union leaders who are so much less educated. The old speeches on class struggle and solidarity leave them cold."
Free-trade policies have also transformed the labor scene. "Years ago, we could insist that all textile factories pay the same wages," Vega says, because their goods were sold only in Chile and protectionism eliminated the threat of foreign competition. "But many businessmen have convinced workers that markets here and abroad will be lost if wages rise too quickly."
Yet another big change is the private pension system, which has virtually replaced state-run social security. Before its advent a decade ago, hyperinflation melted savings into small change. Workers who had spent decades laboring for poverty wages retired into even greater penury. Under the new system, employees put part of every paycheck in any of 50 private pension funds, which invest the money in blue-chip stocks and Government bonds. If workers are dissatisfied with their fund's performance -- the results are published weekly -- they can switch their money to another one.
The private pension system now covers 90 percent of all employees, and helps explain why Chile's savings (and thus, investment) rate has skyrocketed. But trade unions initially denounced it as a ploy to commit workers to the new capitalism. "That was a mistake," Vega admits. The private pension funds "are obviously very popular among workers," he adds, "and we no longer object to them."
Vega blames all these factors for labor's sagging recruitment efforts. At Hilados y Tejidos Garib, one of the more modern textile plants, his union couldn't attract enough members to displace the company union as the workers' representative in contract negotiations.
Jose Cornejo was among the many Garib workers who failed to sign up with Vega. At 30, he considers himself a blue-collar employee on a faster track than laborers of his father's generation. He was barely a teen-ager when the military coup took place. That night his father, Antonio, a watchman at a Government building, was arrested at his work post by army troops. Tortured, threatened with execution three times and barely fed during his 16 days in detention, he "came home looking like a rag doll," Cornejo recalls. "Dad had nothing but bad luck after that. He hurt himself in a construction accident. And since then, he cadges tips looking after parked cars."
After quitting school at 17 to help his family make ends meet, Jose Cornejo labored as a supermarket deliveryman, a construction worker and ballboy at a country club, where he met owners of the Garib factory on the tennis courts. He has been working the last six years at the textile plant, and is now in charge of a computerized Swiss machine that finishes cloth for export. "I'm the one who decides if the material is good enough to ship abroad," he says.
Besides a steady rise in income to $300 a month, he received a loan from his boss for a mortgage down payment. He lives with his wife and two daughters in a modest two-bedroom house, part of a new working-class community, still treeless and unpaved, that sprawls over former vineyards in the shadows of the snow-streaked Andes Mountains.
"I've been treated well by my boss -- but I deserve it," Cornejo says. "I show up even on vacations if there's work to be done, and I don't screw up on the machines. My wages have gone up every year, so I have to believe they'll continue rising." And his politics? "Like my dad's. I'll always vote for the left."
But what kind of left? Certainly not the same one Cornejo's father knew a generation ago. The "change of mentality" engineered by Pinochet was not confined to the business community. As the dictatorship lasted through the 1970's and then into the 80's, leftists also changed their outlook. The collapse of Marxist regimes in Eastern Europe -- and the disastrous economic legacies exposed in their wake -- shook the assumptions of even orthodox left-wing Chileans. And capitalist Chile seemed to be an oasis in a continent ravaged by mega-inflation and mini-growth. "The more Marxist one was, the more stupefied one became," says Luis Maira, a leading socialist politician.
The ideological retreat was painful enough for leftist intellectuals. Far more excruciating was their attempt to fit into a society they loathed. Radicals who were in their 20's during the Allende era became thirtysomething liberals with growing families to feed. They joined private enterprise. Some of them even agreed to work for the hated Government.
Carlos Fuensalida, an urban planner, became the first known leftist to be hired by the Pinochet Government when he accepted a post at the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs in 1978, shortly after his return to Chile from exile in Spain. He was told by ministry officials to omit his wife's name on his job application because her sister was said to be a dangerous Marxist. And he was warned to keep his political views to himself.
For two years he did little more than collect a paycheck. Contempt for public works was so pervasive at the ministry, Fuensalida says, that "whenever I suggested a project I was told to leave it to private enterprise." But capitalism-run-riot was devastating downtown Santiago. Traffic snarls, fumes, noise, grime and general tawdriness were obliterating the historic city center.
In 1980, Fuensalida was finally allowed to form a task force, with a minimum budget. "I picked people of my same professional and political background, and I gave them a lot of breathing room," he says. He recruited them among eager students and underemployed faculty in the urban planning departments of the universities. They pelted the ministry with ideas, which for the most part were batted down. But some notions did survive.
The most important was to preserve the architecture of downtown Santiago, for economic as well as esthetic reasons. For several years, a full-scale business exodus had been under way. Corporate offices were moving to new mirrored high-rises in the affluent neighborhoods closer to the Andean foothills, and stores soon followed them into California-style malls.
Fuensalida came up with an effective -- and cheap -- solution. Offering tax breaks, he convinced merchants and corporations to put up most of the money to sandblast their buildings' facades and replace asphalt streets with cobblestoned pedestrian walks. Turn-of-the-century museums and theaters were refurbished with private donations. Public monuments were polished. Parks and plazas were pruned and replanted. Santiago, which never inspired paeans, suddenly became a model of urban renaissance for planners in Mexico City, Lima and Buenos Aires -- cities with far more impressive architectural inventories.
"I wanted to insure that the Government that followed Pinochet's would inherit a livable capital," Fuensalida says. The new Government has given Fuensalida control of all public investment in urban Chile and a mandate to revive other major cities.
For all the plaudits, Fuensalida still did not earn enough to cover the expenses of a three-child household. So his wife, Elena Serrano, a lawyer, applied for an opening in the public relations department of the Santiago branch of a major American bank six years ago. Fluent in English, articulate and poised, she beat out dozens of other candidates for the job.
At first, she remembers feeling like a left-wing Alice fallen deep down the rabbit hole into a conservative wonderland. "I discovered a world that adored the dictatorship, people who were infinitely in love with Pinochet," she recalls. "Even their language sickened me. They spoke of 'presumed human rights violations' when they really meant torture and executions."
Then came the months of angst. Friends accused her of soldiering for American imperialism. "The nicer ones would just warn me to be careful or I'd become a convert," she says. "I told myself I was hibernating until the dictatorship ended."
As years went by, she was promoted to vice president, and became less timid about making her views known to the senior executives. She persuaded them to spend the bank's charitable funds on public-school gymnasiums that could double as evening community centers in poor neighborhoods -- instead of making yet another donation to Santiago's symphony orchestra and ballet.
"I started to think of myself as a bridge between the dictatorship and the coming democratic Government," says Serrano, whose own politics were shifting to the center. "I let my bosses know there was a whole world of Pinochet opponents outside our doors, and that they had nothing to fear from them."
She campaigned for Aylwin and his center-left coalition in the 1989 elections. When the new Government took power, its economic team turned to people like her for advice on dealing with conservative money men. She was with Finance Minister Foxley in New York for his first meetings with some of Chile's largest creditors.
"I had to explain to him what Brooks Brothers was," Serrano recalls. And she reviewed the speeches of his chief debt negotiator to strike out words that might bewilder or offend United States bankers. "He kept wanting to use the phrase 'moral principles,' " she says, with a barely concealed smile. "I convinced him that it just wasn't part of their vocabulary."

Hotel for Young Lovers? Perestroika Turns Pale

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ASTRAKHAN, U.S.S.R., July 5

 BODY:
Tired of trysting in stairwells and graveyards, young people here persuaded one of the new insurgent city councilmen to propose that the city build a special youth hotel, with Bohemian cafe and hourly bedroom rates, to allow privacy for spooning.
In doing so, the councilman, Valery V. Karpov, touched one of the sorest spots of Communism -- the inhibitions of communal apartment living -- with one of the sharper issues of glasnost: how libertine should the new freedoms and candor be allowed to become. 
 "I am sorry I ever proposed this," said Mr. Karpov, acknowledging that the hotel was unlikely to be built any time soon and estimating that the uproar was about to drive him from politics.
"This is an idea for the intellectuals," Boris M. Glukhman, deputy chairman of the city council, said dismissively of an issue that, in its own way, is as much a matter of self-determination out here in the political provinces as any of the more celebrated sovereignty and economic plans being furiously debated in Moscow, 800 miles to the northwest.
"But we are not ready to solve this special problem of the individual on such a social scale," Mr. Glukhman added, reflecting the view not just of the Communist-controlled council but of the ordinary people who have been complaining directly to Mr. Karpov for proposing such a new frontier of moral tolerance in this ancient city on the Volga.
 
A Lesson in Puritanism
 Mr. Karpov said he thought the subject was a basic issue of human rights, one that proceeded from his being chairman of the city's 20-member youth commission, where the idea arose and was approved. Instead, he has received a lesson in what he terms puritanism and the power it carries in a society newly opened to free speech. "I've discovered the Soviet Union is a match for the United States in at least one area -- puritanism," contended Mr. Karpov, a 36-year-old teacher of modern history.
"Hypocrisy has been the main feature of our society," he said. "I thought the time had come to balance our old socialist realism with some capitalist realism. What I proposed is nothing more than the sort of purpose motels in America are put to."
Mr. Karpov's supporters say he is what true perestroika reforms need, someone to speak his mind and push the limits of free debate, even if the specifics of his proposals can be too strong. They note, for example, that his anti-hypocrisy crusade embraces a raft of issues, including an end to the longtime practice of imprisoning individual fishermen here on the Volga sturgeon grounds for daring to compete with the state monopoly in caviar harvesting.
"Some poor fisherman can get 10 years in jail for 10 kilograms of caviar," he noted angrily. "That's an abuse of human rights."
At the very least, Mr. Karpov provides a measure of the extent to which freethinking is advancing here in the Russian boondocks. But, elected only last year, Mr. Karpov said he has painfully found the limits of democratic politics here in this city of 500,000.
"Out of a hundred detailed proposals I've submitted to the city council to make life better, only sex gets any attention," he said ruefully.
This is doubly understandable in this society, perhaps, because of the inhibitions encouraged across the decades of Communism. These include communal apartments with all their social awkwardness and invitation to snooping, and a police-state pervasiveness that still employs a domestic passport system to account for everyone's unusual whereabouts, particularly at hotels.
The Soviet people have been ingenious about the problem. The better known lovers' ploys of the era of stagnation included the Red Arrow overnight train to Leningrad with its multi-bed compartments, and, similarly, the private cabins of the slow, daylong Bukhta Radosty (Harbor of Joy) boatride outside Moscow.
Mr. Karpov, who speaks several languages and says he would prefer that the spelling of his surname start with a c instead of a k, is fast trying to fill in the many blanks of Soviet history for his students now that they are finally free to be told. His early loathing of Communist faculty meetings caused him never to join the party, he related, and thus he was ready and eager when insurgent, anti-Communist politics swept some new personalities to the fore in the city in the last few years. He talks of sex as a measure of the importance of the individual rights, while conceding the fun of it.
"I myself when I was a student ccasionally sneaked off with my girlfriend to the family dacha when my parents were away, but not everyone has a dacha," Mr. Karpov said. "You know old man Freud had it right -- the sexual aspects of life will surface regardless."
But Mr. Glukhman, the council official, decorating his sense of romance with dialectic, makes something of the same point in opposing the hotel with a smiling nod toward tradition.
"This is a problem of every individual understanding the task set before him by nature and taking into account the ingenuity of each individual at solving this problem," said the 54-year-old deputy chairman. "Depending, of course, on each individual's sense of urgency about this subject."
The young, who can be found congregating at night in the darkness along the concrete Volga levee, have responded to Mr. Karpov's sense of candid politics in different ways.
"Karpov is a good man with many good ideas," said Valentina Sabeshkina, a local 26-year-old newspaper reporter. "But I don't know whether we need such a hotel right now, particularly when so many people have nothing much to eat or wear."
"First, solve the basic problems," she declared, saying the hotel could wait, even if everyone was talking about it.

HEADLINE: Economic Watch;
Putting a Price on the Soviet 'Grand Bargain'

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
A year ago, the idea of the "grand bargain" -- radical Soviet political and economic reform in exchange for tens of billions of dollars in Western aid -- would have been dismissed as an insult by the Kremlin and as a waste of money by the White House.
Now, the impossible seems at least plausible, and the issue of how much aid should be promised under what conditions may overshadow all others at the London economic summit meeting later this month. 
 The obvious explanation is that the economic crisis in the Soviet Union has reached such proportions that it can no longer be ignored. Soviet output fell 6 percent last year and, according to PlanEcon, a Washington consulting firm, is likely to plunge another 18 percent in 1991. Perestroika has become just another word for nothing left to lose.
But the turnabout also reflects new thinking about the best way to make the leap from socialism to capitalism. Most Western analysts, who were initially loath to second-guess Mikhail S. Gorbachev's quest for a painless transition, are now convinced that change must be rapid and that reforms must be buttressed with substantial foreign aid if they are to keep popular support.
Their views are mirrored, albeit weakly, in the Soviet Union.
While some Soviet reformers cling to the view that some cleverer, less obtrusive form of planning could jump-start the economy, a small group of younger economists with a grasp of how markets work has recently been in a position to influence the Soviet policy scramble. Grigory Yavlinsky, the most visible of the new breed and the father of the grand bargain, reportedly spent hours making his case to Mr. Gorbachev last month.
The way has also been eased by the growing recognition of how badly some of Mr. Gorbachev's early efforts, from the creation of a superbureaucracy to monitor industrial quality control to the destruction of vineyards in the name of sobriety, have disrupted output without yielding productivity gains.
Some policies that were better conceived, like the legalization of cooperatives and farmers' markets, have been partly sabotaged by local Communist Party bosses. And some that were truly revolutionary -- for example, the law of enterprises that removed Moscow ministries from the business of setting production targets -- have simply been ignored.
Long experience in coping with bureaucratic contradiction allowed the system to muddle through the 1980's. But the cumulative stresses are now showing.
PlanEcon says production at Soviet factories is falling even faster than the nation's total output, and less of what is produced is making it to factories, farms and retail stores. Just this week, Anatoly Dmitrievsky, a Soviet energy expert, predicted that oil production this year, which is critically needed to finance the country's ballooning bill for imported food, will be 15 percent below the 1989 peak.
But this bad economic news could prove liberating.
Last year, Mr. Gorbachev reportedly rejected the 500-day crash reform plan when its patron, Stanislav Shatalin, acknowledged that production would initially fall by as much as one-third and that millions would lose their jobs. "In fact," said Stanley Fischer, the former chief economist for the World Bank, "the collapse is happening without the reform."
 
Complications of the Decline
 The effects of unchecked decline are bound to spill beyond the Soviet Union's borders, particularly into Europe. While many analysts doubt that a poorer, Balkanized state would threaten Western security, there is widespread agreement that the Soviet Union's troubles are complicating Eastern Europe's transition to capitalism. Factories tied to the old East bloc trading system have been devastated, forcing governments to waste money to protect them from bankruptcy.
The deeper worry in Western Europe is that the Soviet Union's woes will produce a flood of economic and political refugees -- a flood that is especially unwelcome in light of Germany's problems in absorbing its impoverished east. That is apparently why European leaders, notably Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, are so eager to buy insurance against Soviet instability. Mr. Kohl, not coincidentally, met Mr. Gorbachev in Kiev on Friday, to help set the table for the summit meeting.
 
Argument for Big Bang
 The sea change in attitudes among economists in both East and West has in part been pushed by the abject failure of Mr. Gorbachev's half measures. But it largely follows from the insight that stagnant socialist systems share most problems of the overregulated, inflation-prone economies of the third world. Only a big bang, a striking break with the past, it is argued, is likely to create the conditions for self-sustaining change.
At a minimum, the argument goes, this means an end to virtually all price controls, credible protection of private property, elimination of most government subsidies and an immediate opening of the economy to foreign competition. It also implies a need for large-scale foreign assistance -- the quid pro quo of the grand bargain.
Creating free markets overnight is bound to disrupt production and distribution, cutting already low living standards. To manage the transition without destroying the nation's fragile democratic impulse, Mr. Fischer insists, the fall in consumption would need to be buffered with imports financed with foreign money.
Similarly, opening the economy quickly would be possible only if rubles were freely convertible to dollars. And instant convertibility depends on the availability of foreign credit.
Poland is the most advanced test of a big bang supported with substantial infusions of Western cash. And by one conventional measure, the experience has been sobering: output has yet to top pre-bang levels. But Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard economist and a consultant to the Polish Government, counters that there are better ways to judge the test.
Some 375,000 businesses have sprung up, he notes, and shops are full of goods, both domestic and imported. Unemployment is running at 7.7 percent -- high by socialist standards, but in line with Western Europe.
Herbert Levine, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania, points out that the 20 percent decline in Polish output is a misleading indicator of living standards: Many goods no longer produced in Poland are goods nobody wanted to buy.
 
Unspoken Little Bargains
 Bush Administration officials insist that a public bargain, aid linked to a timetable for political and economic reforms, is not in the cards. What is conceivable, they say, is a series of unspoken little bargains in which Soviet leaders are generously rewarded for bold moves toward democracy and capitalism.
Analysts suggest this might not prove as convoluted a process as it appears. Political conditions need not be negotiated: Mr. Gorbachev is already committed on paper to a new constitution guaranteeing free elections, limiting the Kremlin's authority and laying out reasonable conditions for individual republics to leave the union.
Nor would it be difficult to avoid the appearance of an economic diktat that humiliates the Soviets and commits Western taxpayers' money in advance. Mr. Gorbachev wants provisional membership in the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Giving it to him would create a neutral forum in which to hammer out a reform plan conforming to international lending practices. It would also allow the West to insist on sharp cuts in Soviet military spending and foreign aid in the name of fiscal prudence.
All this suggests that it makes sense to watch what the officials at the summit meeting do -- rather than what they say. "I take this one seriously," one high-ranking American official said.

HEADLINE: 2d Florio Budget Is Study in Survival

BYLINE: By PETER KERR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, July 3

 BODY:
With his second budget now in place, Gov. Jim Florio has demonstrated that whatever else he stands for, he is a dedicated practitioner of the politics of survival.
In his first six months in office, Governor Florio and fellow Democrats in the Legislature championed an unabashed kind of class politics. They raised income taxes on the affluent. They redirected a river of money to poorer school districts. And they loosed a barrage of fiery oratory against the insurance industry as an exploiter of the common man. 
 This year, with the Democratic majorities in both houses facing re-election, Mr. Florio and the legislators produced a budget that a Republican would be proud of: it raises no taxes, increases aid to suburban homeowners and slims down government by several thousand workers.
So marked is the turnabout that the Republicans can be expected to ask in the coming months what exactly Mr. Florio and the Democrats stand for, or if they stand for anything at all.
 
Debate Over Democrats' Message
 "They have been sending out a mixed message," said Stephen A. Salmore, a Republican Party consultant who is advising its 1991 legislative candidates. "In the first year, the Democratic policies were clearly perceived by the public as a redistribution of income. In the second year, much of what has happened in Trenton was designed to blunt that perception. Put together, the message is one of confusion."
But the Florio administration and Democratic legislative leaders say the new budget only clarifies the message they have been trying to send the voters since they took office: that they are coming to the aid of middle-class taxpayers who are struggling to get by.
Under the $14.7 billion budget passed by the Legislature and signed by Mr. Florio late on June 30, the state will lay off between 2,000 and 3,000 workers, and most state agencies will have their budgets cut 8 percent from the budget in the previous fiscal year.
There will be a freeze in aid to state colleges for the third year in a row, and the state's 400,000 welfare recipients will see no increase in their aid for the fourth year in a row. The budget also cuts $4 million from the state's major job training program for the unemployed poor.
 
Heart, Soul and Property Taxes
 But overall spending increases by $2.3 billion. The largest share of the increase, nearly $2 billion, is directed to reduce the burden of property taxes on homeowners.
"The heart and soul of this budget is property-tax relief for the middle class," said Jon Shure, the Governor's director of communications. "And we have gotten the job done in tough economic times."
The budget comes at the end of six months in which the Governor has sharply revised the goals and tone of his administration.
Shortly before he took office in January 1990, Mr. Florio talked about an ambitious set of liberal goals, including an assault on urban poverty, a crackdown on overdevelopment, and changes in a health care system that leaves more than one million New Jerseyans uninsured.
In his first months in office, Mr. Florio raised taxes, including a $1.4 billion increase in income taxes on wealthier New Jerseyans. Much of that rise was used to increase aid to poor and middle-income school districts. Mr. Florio also appointed an environmental prosecutor, and pushed through the Legislature a ban on assault rifles and a new automobile insurance system that the administration says will lower most customers' premiums.
"They call themselves the 'good hands' people," Mr. Florio said the day after the Allstate Insurance Company announced it would sue to block Mr. Florio's insurance plan. "The question is: What part of our anatomy do they have their good hands around?"
But after elections last November demonstrated that most voters were angered by Mr. Florio's tax package, he began a campaign to win back middle-class voters.
In March he approved a revised version of his tax and education bills of 1990, shifting more than $360 million from school aid to aid to municipalities to reduce property taxes.
This spring, Mr. Florio assailed the state's school boards as bureaucracies marbled with fat. And he castigated the state's public employees unions for refusing to give back wages and benefits already granted in their contracts.
In signing the new budget on June 30, Mr. Florio said he took pride in realizing one of the administration's major goals: making government smaller.
Steven DeMicco, the executive director of the New Jersey Democratic State Committee, said Democrats running for re-election this fall would argue that they had brought state spending under control, reduced local property taxes and stemmed the rise in automobile insurance rates.
"All of them were out of control under the Republican administration," Mr. DeMicco said, referring to Mr. Florio's predecessor. Gov. Thomas H. Kean. "They have been reined in by bold actions."
The Republicans in the Legislature, Mr. DeMicco added, have refused to offer alternatives.
But Mr. Florio and other Democrats can expect to be attacked from both left and right in the months to come.
 
Suit Fights School-Aid Revision
 Marilyn J. Morheuser, the director of the Education Law Center in Newark, has filed suit against the state over the revision in Mr. Florio's Quality Education Act, saying it defies a state Supreme Court decision on school financing handed down last year.
Ms. Morheuser, who successfully sued to force the state to increase aid to the poorest school districts, says the decision by Mr. Florio and the Legislature effectively guts the promises to help poor districts that Mr. Florio made last year.
The Republicans, meanwhile, argue that it will be difficult for legislators who voted in the largest tax increase in the state's history in 1990 to run as advocates of small government in 1991.
"They represent the idea of taking from suburban New Jersey and giving to urban New Jersey, taking from affluent districts and giving to the poor" said Donald Sico, executive director of the Assembly Republican office. "This is a budget it is going to be hard for them to sell."

HEADLINE: Gray Skies for California Banks

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 7

 BODY:
California's big banks are being hit with some big shocks, and the state's slumping economy is just one of them.
A Labor Department report issued on Friday, showing that California's unemployment rate surged in June to its highest level in seven years, underscored the difficult economic climate facing the state's four largest banking companies: the BankAmerica Corporation, the Security Pacific Corporation, Wells Fargo & Company and the First Interstate Bancorp. 
 The state's unemployment rate jumped to 8.2 percent in June, up from 7.7 percent in May and 5.1 percent in June 1990. It was the highest jobless rate in California since March 1984, when the rate reached 8.3 percent. The national unemployment rate in June was 7 percent, the Labor Department said.
 
Three Increase Reserves
 Analysts said the sharp rise in unemployment reflected broad problems in the state's economy, including the effects of a drought, the slowdown in Pentagon spending, an overbuilt commercial real estate market as well as the national recession. And the unemployment rate explains some of the problems behind the large increases in loan-loss reserves taken in recent weeks by Security Pacific, Wells Fargo and First Interstate.
Because of the additions to their reserves, Security Pacific and Wells Fargo said they would post sharply lower earnings for the quarter ended June 30; First Interstate said it would post a loss for the period.
BankAmerica said that it was having more problems in many parts of its loan portfolio but that they were more than offset by improvement in its loans to other countries. BankAmerica, based in San Francisco, said it expected its second-quarter earnings to be flat compared with the similar period a year earlier.
 
Basically Sound
 The California banks are still basically strong, analysts said, and no one sees evidence yet that any of them will suffer the devastating losses like those that crippled many banks in the Northeast, Texas and other markets suffering from prolonged economic and real estate troubles.
But the deteriorating condition of the California banks' loan portfolios has burst a recent surge in confidence among investors that the banks would weather the recession without much difficulty.
With business slow, more companies, especially those with heavy loads of debt, are having difficulty meeting all of their payments. Developers and owners of commercial real estate are having trouble filling office buildings and shopping centers, putting more real estate loans in jeopardy.
"The common thread in what's happening to the banks is the softening California business climate and the slumping commercial real estate market," said Denise Petsis, an analyst at Argus Research in New York.
After running up sharply this spring, Wells Fargo's stock closed at $66.50 a share on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, up $1.125 for the day but down nearly a third from its peak of $98.75 in early June. First Interstate's shares have fallen from a high of $42.50 this year to $26.75 a share, up 12.5 cents on Friday.
Security Pacific's shares have dropped from a recent high of $33.125 two months ago to $21.125 on Friday, down 12.5 cents on the day. Even BankAmerica, which was hurt the least by loan problems in the second quarter, saw its stock driven down from $40.375 a share earlier this year to $34.50 a share on Friday, up $1 for the day.
In addition to the difficulties posed by the California economy, the banks are also paying a price for the business strategies they pursued in recent years.
First Interstate, based in Los Angeles, was battered in the second quarter by its push into neighboring states, with its Nevada and Oregon operations reporting more loan problems. Security Pacific, also based in Los Angeles, suffered from loans it made in Britain and Australia. The problems of Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, were mainly with companies that borrowed heavily to finance buyouts or other transactions.
"Each of their operations and loan compositions are different," Ms. Petsis said.
 
Tougher Regulation
 Moreover, the banks are contending with regulators who are suddenly applying stricter standards than ever, in some cases forcing the banks to deal more aggressively with potentially troubled loans than the institutions think is necessary.
"It appears that regulators are applying the same generally tougher standards they were in the East last year," said Mark Lynch, an analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company.
At Wells Fargo, the company's addition of $350 million to its reserves for bad loans was made primarily at the direction of Federal banking regulators from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, industry executives said. In announcing the step on June 25, Wells Fargo pointedly noted that it was counting among its potentially bad loans about $400 million on which the borrowers were up to date on all interest and principal payments. About half of those loans were related to buyouts or other deals that regulators called highly leveraged transactions.
An industry publication, The American Banker, has reported that the regulators based their decisions about the loans' soundness on their assessment of the borrowers' prospects several years in the future, a new approach that Wells Fargo strongly objected to.
A spokeswoman for Wells Fargo declined to comment, and a spokesman for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency could not be reached.
Similarly, regulators reportedly took a very hard line with First Interstate, creating serious disagreements with the bank's managers, especially in Nevada. Donald Snyder, chairman of First Interstate's Nevada bank, resigned in the wake of the intense regulatory scrutiny, as did the Nevada bank's president and several other top lending officers.
 
Softness in Real Estate
 One big uncertainty now facing California banks is the real estate market. Residential real estate is showing signs of bouncing back after a period of little sales activity and declining prices in many markets. The commercial market is very slow and is plagued by an excess of available space, especially in Southern California.
In making its earnings projection last week, Security Pacific said it was adding $200 million in commercial real estate loans to its pool of troubled loans. Wells Fargo said real estate loans were not a serious factor in its problems. First Interstate reported some moderate problems and warned that the California real estate market "retains elements of unpredictability that may result in changes in the level of nonperforming assets, as well as in further exposure to credit losses."
The other big question is how soon the state's once-robust economy will bounce back. Economists said California will probably lag the national recovery from the recession because the drought, continuing layoffs in the aerospace business and a bad slump in housing construction will continue for some months at least.
The state's budget crisis is not helping, either. The package of tax increases and spending cuts being pieced together by Governor Pete Wilson and the Legislature to close a $14.3 billion budget deficit could leave consumers and businesses with less money to spend. More layoffs in state and local government could also result.

HEADLINE: Optimistic Economists Vs. Gloomy Executives

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 7

 BODY:
With few exceptions, statistical indicators now portray an American economy climbing solidly out of the recession.
Retail sales are up, along with other gauges like factory orders and output, consumer psychology and the length of the work week. Indeed, on the assumption that the recovery is now so firmly grounded that no additional impetus is needed from lower interest rates, a few economists have begun to speculate about possible moves by the Federal Reserve to restrain the recovery by raising rates. 
 But the people who actually meet payrolls and otherwise run the nation's businesses seem to be hearing a different drummer. Ask them how business is and chances are you will be told that things are considerably somewhat less than wonderful.
 
Natural Divergence
 Since the business cycle affects industries at different times and downturns are felt with different degrees of severity, some divergence of views is natural. What is striking is how sharp is the contrast between professional economists and those who manage corporations of all sizes.
The proportion of economists holding that the economy is in the process of making at least some sort of a comeback is overwhelming: 84 percent of participants in a survey by Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a newsletter in Sedona, Ariz., think the recession will be over this month, with 65 percent contending that it was over by the end of June.
But Peter T. Rogers, president of the Marion Plywood Corporation in Marion, Wis., whose veneers and plywoods go into pianos and skateboards as well as into doors and other construction products, said in a phone interview last week that "I can't say the economy is really looking better." His father, Thomas, the chairman of the $17 million-a-year family-owned concern, added, "It's pretty spotty."
 
Laid-off Workers Recalled
 On the other hand, things are not really so bad. Marion has recalled all 60 or so of the workers it laid off since last summer and expects by year-end to restore the work force to its pre-recession level of 300. And profits in the fiscal year ending this summer are likely to match those of 1990.
Still, there is an undercurrent to the business evaluations of company executives that is decidedly at odds with the numbers flowing these days from Washington's statistics mills. It is basically a skepticism about the recovery that could inhibit inventory-building and other actions that would hasten the recovery, a skepticism shared by the heads of many of the biggest American corporations.
The disparity between the views of professional economists and corporate managers was particularly evident at the semiannual meeting of the Business Council this spring, where the chiefs of the biggest 100 companies were considerably less optimistic than a team of economists from their own companies.
Part of the explanation may be that economists take a broader, less parochial view of what is happening with business trends, while executives must worry about more concrete matters: whether to keep a marginal plant open in a depressed area or whether the Government will impose new health-care requirements.
 
Different Standards Used
 But the main explanation is probably that the two groups use different standards of evaluation. Economists scrutinize month-to-month changes while corporate chiefs, with the implicit encouragement of security analysts on Wall Street, focus on year-to-year comparisons.
"When you talk to an economist or Government statistician, they usually relate to the previous quarter or month," said Walter K. Joelson, manager of economic research and forecasting for the General Electric Company, a man with a foot in both worlds. "When you talk to a business executive, you always get comparisons with a year ago."
One reason for this is that few companies make, even for internal use, adjustments for seasonal variations in such things as their orders and shipments. By simply comparing the second quarter of 1991 with the second quarter of 1990, for example, this problem is avoided, since seasonal factors can generally be assumed to be the same.
 
Poor Sources of Information
 But this tends to make executives poor sources of information about a recent turn in the economy, even if their companies and industries are good bellwethers. A few months after a recovery gets under way, said Robert G. Dederick, chief economist for the Northern Trust Company in Chicago, executives will be asserting that "business is still pretty lousy" because it trails that of a year earlier, even if it is better than the immediately preceding month or two.
Executives, in other words, look at levels of business while economists look at changes, said Stuart G. Hoffman of the Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial Corporation.
So even though a business chief may be paid millions of dollars to run a huge, multi-industry empire and has a wealth of proprietary data at his fingertips, he may not have the best perspective on whether the recession is over.
Keep in mind that the economist considers the recession to be history when the economy starts moving up, said Maury N. Harris, chief economist for Paine Webber Inc. To the executive, he added, there will be no such assertion until "you're higher than you used to be" at some time in a prosperous past.

HEADLINE: American Expertise Meets Harsh Reality: The Angolan Business Climate

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LUANDA, Angola

 BODY:
At first glance, it is a triumph of American business ingenuity.
Less than a week after a cease-fire ending Angola's 16-year civil war was signed, a small company based in Los Angeles has begun building the prototype for what will eventually become a 2,000-unit single-family housing development. 
 Not only does the company, American Overseas Development, hope to make a substantial profit, but it will also provide a desperately needed product at a relatively low cost. While Luanda's population has grown to more than double its prewar level of about 1.2 million, no new housing has been built here in at least eight years, Government officials say.
But the story of the housing project is also a cautionary tale about what happens when the rare American entrepreneur braves this war-shattered country. Until now, virtually the only American companies doing business here have been big oil companies.
The housing project began about 18 months ago when Cesar Celestino, the president of the company, which specializes in building houses using pre-cut wood paneling, signed a construction contract with the Angolan Government. In turn, the company will eventually help send about 300 Angolan citizens to the United States to learn how to repair and maintain the household appliances.
Armed with the agreement, Dwight Brown, a 57-year-old construction engineer, arrived here in April to start work on building two model homes and a 40-classroom school.
Mr. Brown first became acquainted with Africa in the early 1980's while working in Liberia on a similar project. By Western standards, Liberia is considered a hardship posting, whose withering tropical heat and often-primitive conditions wear down even the hardiest. Yet Mr. Brown says he thrived there.
Angola, he thought, would be much the same. What he found, instead, was that the long years of civil war had made Luanda, once called the Rio of West Africa, a filthy, smelly city of crumbling buildings and decaying infrastructure.
"Never by any stretch of the imagination did I expect to find anything like this," he said. "I was devastated."
It had also become a city of the disabled and the orphaned. "You have to become accustomed to seeing one-legged people everywhere. And all the kids, I've never seen so many in my life."
To make matters worse, he said, the Government had contracted to build a foundation for the model homes and provide some tools and building materials, but virtually nothing had been done. And there was neither water nor electricity at the job site.
Mr. Brown also soon discovered that the most building supplies -- nails, for example -- could not be bought in bulk on the local market and had to be imported. Getting supplies through the port and airport, however, proved to be another headache. "First," he said, "they wanted $50,000 in what they called import fees for stuff that was only worth about $8,000."
In the meantime, despite the fact that the shipping container was under 24-hour guard, it was broken into and several items, including a power generator, were stolen.
 
A Frustrating Bureaucracy
 But the biggest frustration in doing business here is Angola's byzantine government bureaucracy. "The Government seems to be trying its best," he said, "but there's a real attitude problem here. We'll go to an office where we're supposed to get something done, and they'll pass it on to the next guy, then the next guy, and then the next."
As for hard work, he said, the concept barely exists. "The Government pays everybody, and there are no bonuses for a hard-working person," he said. "So, if you don't work, you get paid."
Mr. Brown's complaints are unusual only in their frankness, several Angolan and foreign residents here said.
For years, Angolan officials attributed their country's economic plight on the chaotic period after independence from Portugal in 1975, when nearly 300,000 European settlers fled virtually overnight, taking with them essential know-how, as well as vital machinery and parts needed to keep the economy going.
The new Marxist-oriented leaders sought to deal with the crisis by adopting the Soviet model of state-run industry and agriculture. But Angolans and foreigners increasingly agree that many of Angola's problems stem from the Government's own unwieldly centralized policies.
Mr. Brown is nonetheless optimistic that with the end of the war, and economic decentralization, "things will eventually sort themselves out."
As far as others contemplating doing business here, he advises, "Be prepared to bring everything."

HEADLINE: Sheepshead Bay Losing Its Old-Salt Air

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW

 BODY:
At that rare time when most New York City roads are virtually empty, at 6 A.M. on a midsummer weekend, cars full of fishermen jostle for parking spaces along Emmons Avenue in the Sheepshead Bay section of Brooklyn. Party-fishing boat operators beckon like carnival barkers, urging them to spend $27 for a day at sea, much as they have for generations.
At first glance history seems to have made its way up to about 1960 along the avenue, and then stopped dead in its tracks: Helen Randazzo serves the same hot-and-medium sauce that has made her Sheepshead Bay clam bar famous for 35 years; George Richford "works the bay" aboard party-fishing boats much as he has since 1955, and George Schultz, the owner of Pip's, is still on the lookout for another new talent at his comedy club like Rodney Dangerfield, Lenny Bruce or Buddy Hackett.
 
An Uphill Struggle
 But despite the survival of the fishing boats and institutions like Randazzo's, longtime residents of Sheepshead Bay say they are fighting an uphill battle to preserve the character of their community as the city's last quaint ocean-front fishing village. 
 Neither "progress" nor urban blight is alleged as the culprit for the neighborhood's perceived decline. Instead, residents blame a complex mixture of demographic change, poor city planning, a radically transformed fishing industry, squabbles between dinner-cruise boat operators and the city and the aftereffects of the 1978 demise of Lundy's, once the world's largest restaurant.
Sheepshead Bay's once solidly Italian- and Irish-American population has recently become more ethnically diverse, and the community has one of the highest percentages of elderly residents of any New York City neighborhood, said Hilda Mirwis, the chairwoman of the community board that includes much of the South Brooklyn waterfront. While Lundy's remains an empty hulk, much of Emmons Avenue to its east is now a patchwork of nondescript low-rise condominiums, insurance offices, vacant lots and fast-food restaurants, with only a handful of old wooden houses and fishing-tackle shops.
"There used to be dozens of fishing boats and the avenue was lined with restaurants," Mrs. Randazzo said. "The street would be filled with people at night, and chauffeur-driven limousines would be parked in front of Lundy's."
"Now, the kids don't believe in fishing like years ago," she added. "A lot of people have died, and you don't really know the new people who've moved in." She, too, will have to move in two years, she said, because her restaurant, like much Emmons Avenue real estate, was owned by Frederick Lundy and sold by his heirs to developers.
 
Fewer Hard-Core Old Salts
 The sense of change, or decline, is most profound along the waterfront, where a diminishing number of boats with names like the Dorothy B VII and Apache V still carry hundreds of urban fishermen in search of sea bass, bluefish, mackerel and even tuna. The ranks of these party boats have plummeted to 18 today from 45 in 1970, Mr. Richford said, and many of the approximately 70 people who work the boats say they believe that their fleet's days are numbered.
"There are so many things against you now in this business," said Mr. Richford, the owner of Pastime II. "The economics are bad. Fuel and insurance are way up, but we can't raise our prices because people can't afford it. We don't get the hard-core fishermen anymore -- the old salts who'd go out all winter -- and not enough young people are interested in fishing. And our parking lots, that Lundy's owned, have been eaten up by condos."
Offshore fisheries have also been depleted by foreign fishing fleets and "draggers, who come out at night and drag the beaches for fish," said Jeff Moser, a mate on the Zephyr.
Meanwhile, several dinner-cruise boats that have long operated from Sheepshead Bay piers have become embroiled in a bitter dispute with the city over the right to sail. The boats have the cautious support of many fishermen and have contributed to the community's maritime flavor, but the city contends they have no right to berth at the piers.
The Department of Ports and Trade filed suit last month to force out the Romance and the Royal Princess, which take customers for three-hour evening cruises with dinner and dancing for $39.50 to $60 a person.
 
City Bars VIP Yachts From Piers
 "They're not supposed to be there," said Wallace L. Ford 2d, the former Ports and Trade Commissioner who became Commissioner of the new Department of Business Services last week. That department and the city's Development Corporation now oversee the functions of Ports and Trade, which was eliminated last week. The boats, which are operated by VIP Yachts, do not have permits to berth at Sheepshead Bay piers, which are intended for fishing boats, he said.
Despite a decade-old legal provision stipulating that the piers are for fishing, the city had essentially looked the other way -- while collecting $30,000 a year in fees from VIP -- until this March, when Commissioner Ford filed the restraining order, said Michael Barry, VIP's lawyer.
"VIP has been here 40 years, taking people out to eat, fish and for parties," Mr. Barry said. "There are 10 piers with five slips each, and most are vacant, not producing any revenue for the city. The city has designated one pier for excursion boats, which they finished reconstructing several weeks ago, but they've refused to open it. We've offered to pay for permits at the new pier, but they refuse to take our money."
Although some fishermen are bitter about the dinner boats, Mr. Richford said, "Everybody can co-exist if there were enough parking."
 
Fishermen Call Parking Crucial
 Margaret McCord, the 88-year-old unofficial mayor of Sheepshead Bay, said that the parking problem posed the most serious threat to the fishing fleet's future. "Fishermen have to come by car," she said, sitting on a pier at the Knights of Columbus building, pointing to the new Waterview apartments on Emmons Avenue that have replaced long-time parking lots. "They can't carry all their gear and fish on the subway. If there isn't parking, the fishing industry could die."
The city has developed several plans during the last 15 years for revitalizing Sheepshead Bay, including a slowly progressing $12.3 million refurbishing of its piers and esplanade. But the studies and plans have failed to yield the promised parking lot, zoning changes to protect the area's character or any broader strategy to capitalize on the bay's potential for drawing tourists, said Thomas Bowers, the president of the Sheepshead Bay-Plumb Beach Civic Association.
"Other cities, like Miami, San Francisco and Baltimore, value their waterfronts as a beautiful natural resource, but administration after administration in this city has let ours deteriorate," said Ms. Mirwis, the community board leader. "This is a beautiful scenic community, not phony like the South Street Seaport. They spent $300 million on it. We need only $23 million for development here."

Dinkins Finds A Key to the City Is Togetherness

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
In their vague agreement last week to agree on a budget, Mayor David N. Dinkins and Peter F. Vallone, the City Council Speaker, underlined only two words in the full 15 paragraphs:
Together, which was how they had managed to forge an agreement that established the Council as a full partner in setting the agenda of New York City government and marked what may be the beginning of a more respectful relationship. 
 And Independence, which was what Mr. Dinkins had pledged to maintain at all costs. He succeeded for now by fending off the state Financial Control Board and, apparently, by braking Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's proposed new vehicle to help the city ride out the recession.
A week later the togetherness and independence seem less tenuous than the budget, which largely neglected fundamental restructuring.
"Not only are there clear indications that municipal services have deteriorated while promises go unfulfilled," a panel created by the Governor concluded, "but there is also a sensation of helplessness -- a feeling that there is no one or no place in city government to go for assistance or redress, and that no one is held accountable. Productivity reports issue from City Hall, yet nothing appears to change. Increase in municipal employment has not meant an increase in service delivery."
That Governor was not Mr. Cuomo, but a predecessor, Nelson A. Rockefeller, who with Mayor John V. Lindsay was guilty of the sin of commission. Twenty years ago, both recruited panels of experts to embarrass each other.
Governor Rockefeller's version reached a conclusion that reverberates today: "In simplest terms, the city can no longer command the resources required to perform the staggering tasks of income redistribution and service provi sion to which it has committed itself; but its leaders have not yet adjusted their atti tudes or their spending decisions to this situation."
 Mr. Cuomo was a member of Mr. Lindsay's commission, but he acknowledged that nothing much came of either one. The vehicle that he now wants to create by merging his two-year-old New York, New York initiative with Mr. Dinkins's management advisory task force would be different, Mr. Cuomo maintains, because "the new reality" dictates that reforms that were once dismissed as merely "convenient improvements" now represent "a matter of survival."
The Governor's decision not to unilaterally impose a new vehicle on the city was no oversight. "There are people out there would say, if you want to restructure the city you shouldn't ask them to do it," he said, "but the only way to do it is together." Mr. Cuomo said of the Mayor: "He loves the idea of restructuring."
Mr. Cuomo's impatience with the pace of reform, though, was evident at last week's meeting of the Control Board, although the Governor directed his pique at Edward V. Regan, the State Comptroller -- interrogating him about which branch libraries were being closed -- and at Republican obstructionists in the State Legislature.
Considering Mr. Cuomo's relationship with state legislators, his characterization of the City Council as the city's "new legislature" -- a reference to the fact that it was recently vested with the budgetary powers that Governor Rockefeller's commission had recommended -- may have been as much a warning to Mr. Dinkins as a gesture of respect to the Council.
The give and take that preceded last week's city budget agreement gave a new dimension to the word bonding. Mutual resentment and mistrust evolved into begrudging respect between the Deputy Mayors, particularly Bill Lynch and Sally Hernandez-Pinero, and certain Council members and staff -- a respect that apparently did not extend to the two principals. Wasn't it unusual, Mr. Vallone was asked after the agreement was announced Sunday night, that he and Mr. Dinkins had not even spoken for more than 48 hours? "Not for this Mayor," Mr. Vallone replied tartly.
For months, the crisis atmosphere that might have compelled cooperation never materialized and it was uncertain whether the July 1 deadline alone would suffice. In the end, the deadline was more or less met by everybody except organized labor -- whether because the players wanted to flee before the Independence Day weekend or because the Council, edgy in the knowledge that its threat to pass its own budget was largely a bluff that might play into the Mayor's hands, decided to declare victory, rescind its demands for greater control over spending, and wait until next year.
"It's like paying a debt -- we've got to acquire these powers in installments," said Herbert E. Berman, the Brooklyn Democrat who heads the Council's Finance Committee. Meanwhile, he said, tongue-tied from nearly nonstop negotiations, "we have stepped back from the abyss, but we're still in troubled waters."
Clinging together independently, though, without fully grasping the life preserver offered by the Governor.

Signs of a Weak Housing Rebound

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
HOUSING industry stocks, after soaring early this year, have abruptly stopped climbing and begun to trail the overall stock market.
The rise of the housing stocks, which began last November, served as a signal that the deep housing recession might end far sooner than many had expected. But the new weakness in prices has kept one home builder from going through with a planned stock offering, even though many others succeeded and another is hoping to sell shares soon. And the falloff in stock prices could signal that the rebound in housing is going to be weaker than had been optimistically hoped for only a few months ago. 
 "After the end of the Persian Gulf war, there was a huge enthusiasm" among home buyers, said Kenneth Campbell of Audit Investments, an analyst who follows the real estate industry. "But there is only a modest follow-through."
Last week, the Commerce Department reported that sales of new homes fell 3.3 percent in May, and revised April's previously reported 1.2 percent gain to show a small drop of two-tenths of 1 percent. Still, the annual rate of 474,000 home sales was 14.5 percent higher than the low of 414,000 reached in January.
The fall in part reflected worries over rising interest rates, which have pushed up the cost of buying a new home. Bulls on the industry generally expect rates to come down soon, helping to stimulate sales, but a strengthening economy could have the opposite effect.
An index of 11 housing stocks, weighted by market capitalization, has fallen 11.5 percent in the last five weeks, a period during which the Standard & Poor's 500 slipped only 4 percent.
But that retrenchment came only after an extraordinary period for the housing stocks. From Nov. 2 to the end of May, a period when the S.& P. 500 rose 25 percent, every home-building stock at least doubled, and the index rose 135 percent.
That rise left some industry analysts gasping. "You have to look for a very substantial upswing in earnings" to justify the prices, Mr. Campbell said. "It is hard to believe they will do it just on economic recovery. You have to believe in a very substantial increase in market share" for the publicly held builders.
That market share increase may arrive, at least for some builders. Bankers vow that never again will they lend to undercapitalized housing developers. This time, they say, builders will have to put a substantial amount of their own capital at risk.
Such pledges of caution have been violated in the past, but they are likely to endure for some time. And that will put builders without access to additional equity investments at a disadvantage. Last week, Hovnanian Enterprises sold two million new shares at $7.50, following in the footsteps of companies like Toll Brothers Inc. and the Del Webb Corporation. Continental Homes Inc. last week filed to sell 1.8 million shares, including 300,000 to be sold by current shareholders. Shares of the Arizona home builder were unchanged, at $7.875, for the week.
The Ryland Group, a national home builder, had planned to sell two million shares, but it withdrew the offering late last month, complaining that its stock price -- which had fallen to less than $19 after topping $25 -- was too low. Last week its shares closed at $19.75.
With signs of a less-than-robust rebound in home sales, analysts have been pushing out earnings estimates, no longer looking to this year for a big rebound, but focusing on 1992 and even 1993 as the likely time for a surge of profits.
Over all, Stephen J. Dobi of Smith Barney said in a recent report, "1991 will be the least active home-building year in more than three decades." But he forecast that "housing will post a modest recovery in the second-half of 1991." He wrote before last week's report of falling sales of new homes, and could not be reached for comment on Friday or over the weekend.
In the retrenchment of share prices that began in June and continued in the first week of July, the three worst performers, down about 20 percent each, were Standard-Pacific, the Kaufman and Broad Home Corporation and the PHM Corporation, the parent of Pulte Homes. Each of them builds homes in California, where a string of banks surprised Wall Street last week with warnings of disappointing profits.
The only winner over the period was UDC-Universal Development, which raised new equity capital in a private transaction last month, selling stock at $11.875. The price has since risen to $13.375. Among the buyers were the company's top officers.

HEADLINE: Third World Embracing Reforms To Encourage Economic Growth

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
A powerful new economic pragmatism is sweeping third world capitals from Brasilia to Bangkok, and countries that were once proud economic nationalists are now trying to forge closer ties with the rest of the world.
The broad changes are the subject of the World Bank's annual World Economic Development Report, which was made public this morning. And in interviews last week, government officials and economists from third world nations said they were committed to allowing market forces to flourish free of government restraints, abandoning fiscal and monetary policies that were politically motivated but economically unsound and opening borders to foreign goods and investment.
 
'Time for Fresh Thinking'
 "Everybody is convinced it is time for fresh thinking," India's Finance Minister Manmohan Singh said in an interview last week. [Page D3.] 
 And Sebastian Edwards, a Chilean economist at the University of California at Los Angeles, said, "For Chile, there is no turning back."
Argentina, for example, has caught tax-reform fever. Mexico is selling its Government-owned businesses. Peru is cutting its budget deficit. Turkey has thrown off its decades-old protectionist blanket. Thailand kept its budget balanced and held inflation to a modest 3 percent. Ghana and a handful of other African nations no longer tax their farmers out of producing.
"The change in thinking is really remarkably pervasive," said Stanley Fischer, former chief economist at the World Bank and now a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "Ten years ago, for example, Mexicans insisted that their main job was to protect themselves from the imperialist U.S."
If the nascent economic changes take root and spread, the four billion people who live in the developing world could enjoy a better standard of living. The changes could also provide a wealth of opportunities to businesses and investors in the United States and other rich countries.
What started the revolution? For one thing, the stunning growth of South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and other Asian economies. For another, the collapse of socialism in Eastern Europe.
The belief that this revolution is an enduring one is strongest among early reformers who have already reaped the rewards of faster growth. Hasan L. Ersel, deputy governor of Turkey's central bank, said, "If Turkey doesn't experience an enormous external shock, it is highly unlikely that these policies will be reversed."
Certainly, the road to economic reform is lined with ruts. Steps toward reforms in Argentina and Brazil have been derailed by a repeated failure to control inflation. Despite progress on trade and liberalizing financial markets, Turkey has not brought its budget under control. Ghana's far-reaching reforms have not yet persuaded many investors to come aboard. And Eastern European political leaders have found that their commitment to market-driven economies -- with the layoffs and higher prices these bring in the short run -- have brought strikes, protests and challenges to incumbent officials.
But it now seems clear that in many developing nations there is a new sense of realism, much of it inspired by the hardships of the last decade.
 
'Nothing Inevitable About Stagnation'
"The enormous differences in performance among developing countries in the 80's suggests that there is nothing inevitable about stagnation" said Lawrence H. Summers, chief economist at the World Bank. While many economies in Africa and Latin America shrank during the decade, Botswana, Chile, Indonesia and Thailand, among others, expanded.
"The key," Professor Fischer of M.I.T. said, "is moving away from saying that world is unfair to saying however unfair it is, we want to make the best use of it."
The international economy is widely expected to hold modest expansions among the wealthier countries, continued high interest rates, weak commodity prices and persistent debt problems.
So the poorer nations, already starved for investment, are likely to have to compete for scarce capital.
The good news, the World Bank says, is that reform is sufficiently widespread that the economies of the developing countries should grow, on average, 5 percent a year, faster than in the 1980's. That is also faster than the 3 percent rate the bank expects for rich countries.
Countries that have adopted economic reforms, the bank says, include Chile, Ghana, India, Indonesia, South Korea, Mexico, Morocco and Turkey. Even China, which doubled its growth rate in the 1980's by allowing some farmland to be privately owned, is on the list. "You can see reasons for optimism in what developing countries are doing in almost every part of the world," Mr. Summers said.
 
Countries Will Lag Without Reforms
 Those reformers that succeed could narrow the gap between their standards of living and those of rich countries at a rapid pace. But countries that continue to mismanage their economies -- tolerating inefficiency for political ends, squandering precious resources on wars, investing too little in education -- may be doomed to fall further behind. "It no longer makes sense to think of the third world as one group," Mr. Summers said.
The old strategy for transforming a poor country into a rich one, advocated from the 1930's through the 1960's, called for rapid government-led industrialization at the expense of agriculture, protecting infant industries from foreign competition and replacing imports with domestic production for the local market.
At the nub of this philosophy was the notion that government should guide economic development. Thus came a tight web of licensing requirements, restrictions on who could enter or leave industries, constraints on bankruptcy filing and layoffs, and price controls.
"These views have not stood test of time," the World Bank says bluntly. The institution is bankrolled by rich nations that dispenses aid, loans and advice to poor countries.
And seemingly small steps toward deregulation have often produced great spurts of economic activity. Ghana, for instance, used to levy confiscatory taxes of 50 percent or more on cocoa, and some farmers left crops to rot in the fields or smuggled them out. When it sharply lowered the taxes, cocoa production and exports soared. When South Korea lifted interest rates on bank deposits in the 1970's, the size of its banking system quadrupled in less than four years. Morgan Stanley & Company estimates that United States exports to the third world have lately grown at three times the rate of sales to other rich countries. And third world stock markets from Mexico City to Taipei have been booming.
Many developing countries also tried to build up local industries by shielding them from competition. The result was often that inefficient companies turned out shoddy goods that cost too much. Many Argentines drive cars that Detroit might have been proud of in, say, 1960, and Indians buy homemade steel that costs more than the imported kind. In disastrous cases -- Tanzanian shoe companies, Polish shipyards, Chinese car companies -- the products have been worth less than the cost of the raw materials used to make them.
 
An Avalanche Of Borrowing
Many third world countries also saw foreign ownership as a greater threat to sovereignty than borrowing. After an avalanche of borrowing, many countries had more debt than they could carry, and they lost control of their economies.
Mexico, Brazil, South Korea, Poland and Ghana, among others, borrowed half a trillion dollars -- most of it from commerical banks -- and put the money into government-sponsored projects. But many borrowers found they could not pay their debts.
Some countries tried to renegotiate the terms of their loans, stretching them out over longer periods to reduce payments, or seeking lower interest rates. If the banks balked, the borrowers threatened to halt debt payments. Brazil and Argentina eventually negotiated more favorable terms on their huge foreign debt. Peru, on the other hand, simply announced that it would no longer pay its debts, and lost its ability to borrow abrood, with calamitous consequences for its economy.
In the last three years, the United States offered what came to be known as the Brady plan, for Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, which encouraged banks to forgive some the debt in return for promises that economic reforms that improve the climate for private investment. Other industrial nations supported the Brady plan, which has had at least one notable success -- Mexico.
Mexico obtained relief of roughly a fifth of its $60 billion outstanding private debt. That, along with Mexico's economic reforms, gave a big boost to investor confidence.
Argentina, on the other hand, is still trying to qualify for debt reduction. Its President twice signed an agreement with the International Monetary Fund, only to have Parliament reject it. The result has been that Argentina has been unable to get new loans.
 
Foreign Investment Needed for Growth
Many of these countries that preferred to borrow now see foreign direct investment as a catalyst to growth. Chile, for example, laid out the welcome mat to overseas investors, many from the Pacific Rim.
Private investment has doubled since its low in the mid-1980's, according to Guy Pfeffermann, an economist at the International Finance Corporation, with most of the increase in East Asia, Latin America and, to a lesser extent, Africa. It is rising fastest in countries like Morocco, Chile, Mexico, Botswana and Thailand, where the business climate is improving.
Many countries have also learned the dangers of a boom-bust economy. The old populist prescription was to take windfall gains -- from a surge in commodities prices, say, or oil -- and throw a party. After oil prices surged in 1973, Nigeria tripled its public payroll to 1.5 million. After the 1979 jump in oil prices, Mexico's budget deficit soared to 17 percent of G.N.P.
But today Mexico has slashed its budget deficit to 4 percent of gross national product, which compares favorably with the United States. And it has cut tax rates and ended the practice of taxing dividends twice, which discourages investment. At the same time, the Mexican Government has beefed up tax collection by closing loopholes and prosecuting corporate tax dodgers in record numbers.
It has taken to heart a notion that has won converts in Eastern Europe: when it comes to government, smaller is better. Since 1982, Mexico has sold 875 of 1,155 Government-owned companies, including giants like TelMex, the national phone company; Mexicana, the airline, and Cannanea Copper. Banamex, Mexico's largest bank, will soon go on the block.
The payoff has been three years of 3 to 4 percent growth and an inflation rate that is less than 20 percent -- low by Latin standards. Even more promising, an estimated $10 billion that had been taken overseas has returned, as investors' confidence in the stability of Mexico's economy has grown.

HEADLINE: Administration Faulting States Over Increasing Costs of Medicaid

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 7

 BODY:
In a new study, the Bush Administration asserts that states have systematically underestimated the huge and rapid increase in Medicaid costs in the last few years, resulting in billions of dollars in unexpected medical bills for the Federal Government.
State officials say unanticipated economic trends, especially the recession, caused much of the rise in costs, by increasing the number of people eligible for Medicaid because of lower incomes. 
 But the study says the recession is responsible for "a relatively small percentage" of the cost increase. A confidential draft of the report, marked for "internal use only," says one-fourth to one-third of the unexpected increases were attributable to "technical problems" in the way the states estimated costs, including a failure to recognize foreseeable trends.
Alarmed at the increases, the Federal budget director, Richard G. Darman, announced April 30 that he was sending out what officials described as "SWAT teams" of Federal budget and health officials to investigate.
Erroneous estimates by the states cause problems for the President and Congress because the Federal Government relies on state estimates in writing the budget for Medicaid, which finances health care for 27 million poor people. The program last year cost $72 billion: $41 billion in Federal money, $31 billion from the states.
Under law, the Federal Government reimburses each state for Medicaid, paying from 50 percent to 80 percent of the cost depending on the average income of the state's workers.
 
Adding to Federal Deficit
 There is no trust fund or other special source of money to pay for Medicaid. When costs increase, they contribute to the Federal budget deficit. One objective of the report is to give the states guidelines and incentives to improve the accuracy of the estimates.
In November 1989, the report says, states estimated that their Medicaid programs would cost the Federal Government $44.4 billion in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, 1990. But this May they projected Federal costs for the same period at $52.6 billion, an increase of 18 percent in just 18 months.
Estimates of 1991 hospital costs for Medicaid recipients quadrupled in Alabama, tripled in Massachusetts and doubled in Pennsylvania.
Steven M. Lieberman, assistant director of the Office of Management and Budget, who coordinated the Medicaid review, and Kimberly Gibson, a spokeswoman for the budget office, declined to discuss the report. John M. Gibbons, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said no one would discuss it "on the record."
The report notes there has been a "rapid increase in Federal Medicaid mandates," requiring the coverage of millions of additional children and pregnant women, and it implies that Congress would be less willing to expand the program if it had a truer picture of future costs.
The report lays a foundation for Federal efforts to curb the use of techniques by which states obtain extra Medicaid money from the Federal Government while putting up little or no extra money themselves.
 
States Getting Donations
 All nine states visited by the Federal teams use the techniques of soliciting "voluntary donations" by hospitals or imposing special taxes on hospitals. The states then use the extra money as part of their share of the Medicaid costs, and hospitals usually get back from Medicaid more than they paid in "donations" or taxes.
The nine states were Alabama, California, Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas. Together, the report says, they account for almost half of projected Medicaid spending in 1991 and 1992, and for about 55 percent of the increase in estimates.
The report lists other reasons for increases in Medicaid costs, including state decisions to raise payments to hospitals and nursing homes in response to court orders or threatened lawsuits. It says state officials need "definitive guidance" from Washington to help them resist such lawsuits.
State officials cooperated with the investigation, but say the Federal budget office, which frequently underestimates the Federal budget deficit, is in no position to lecture the states. They point out, for example, that the Federal deficit in the 1990 fiscal year, $220 billion, was 78 percent higher than Mr. Darman estimated in January 1990.
 
Difficult to Untangle
 In analyzing the rise in Medicaid costs, the study acknowledges that it is often difficult to untangle economic factors, technical problems in estimating techniques and policy changes in the program.
"Economic trends have clearly contributed to the increase," the report says, but it adds that "a relatively small percentage of the increase in estimates was due solely to changes in the economy."
By contrast, James L. Martin, director of state-Federal relations for the National Governors' Association, said, "It's inevitable that the current recession is a major factor in state estimates of revenues and expenditures, including Medicaid."
When people lose jobs, their income usually declines, and some become eligible for assistance under the main Federal-state welfare program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children. People enrolled in that program are automatically eligible for Medicaid.
From 1985 to 1990, the report says, Congress passed seven major laws containing hundreds of provisions altering Medicaid, and states are now feeling the impact of those changes.
Thus, it says: "One state estimated that a 1986 provision, requiring emergency care for undocumented aliens, would cost about $65 million annually when implemented in October 1988. The state now estimates that the fiscal year 1992 cost of the provision will be 10 times that amount, or $650 million. The Federal share of the cost is $325 million."
The state is not named, but California and Florida have incurred substantial costs for undocumented aliens.
"One state initially saw 40 percent participation rates for newly Medicaid-eligible pregnant women, infants and children, but now is finding about 70 percent to 80 percent participation for the lower-income eligibles," it said.
The Medicaid review was conducted by officials from the Office of Management and Budget and the Department of Health and Human Services led by Mr. Lieberman, the assistant director of the budget office, and J. Michael Hudson , deputy chief of the Health Care Financing Administration.

HEADLINE: American Voices: Aiding the Soviets;
Compassion and Pragmatism on Help for Moscow

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GARY, Ind.

 BODY:
F. Brannan Jackson's face hangs heavy with doubt as he contemplates the prospect of American aid to the Soviet Union. When he turns his thoughts into words, the pastor of the Calvary Institutional Baptist Church speaks like a Samaritan. "We've heard the stories of economic distress over there," he says. "I think we should help the Soviet Union."
He goes on: "We can do it. We have the kind of economic structure that we do the things we want to, when we want to, where we want to. It is a risk. But if we can achieve stability within Russia, there may be an opportunity to achieve a peaceful relationship with them." 
 Then the 67-year-old Dr. Jackson pauses, as if to consider the decaying city that lies beyond his own neat neighborhood, the deserted housing units along the dunes of Lake Michigan and the empty mall where the signs have crumbled and boards over store windows are weathered white. "Where are we going to get the money from?" he asks. "I don't know."
In mid-July the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, is to meet with President Bush and the other leaders of the seven major industrialized democracies in London, where he is expected to seek commitments of Western aid to help transform the sclerotic Soviet economy from central control to a market system.
 
A Deep Ambivalence
 Interviews with scores of Americans, from the union halls of Cleveland to the farms of Iowa, reveal a deep ambivalence about the idea of a Soviet bailout financed in part by the United States Treasury. Many interviewed on a drive across the Midwest had thought little if at all about the subject, but many others in the Midwest and in corners of the nation from Florida to Tennessee to California tended to favor aid.
All, however, wondered whether America could afford a high-stakes gamble on Soviet reform. They wondered whether the gamble would pay off in terms of stability in the Soviet Union and, consequently, stable Soviet-American relations that could enable the United States to reduce its military spending for years to come.
History has taught these Americans that their country can change the world, but their lives have taught them that change is costly.
"I have mixed emotions," said Clarence Davis, 54, president of District 54 of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers in Cleveland. "Certainly, I wouldn't want to see that country with their large military presence taken over by some of the right-wing generals that are standing in the background waiting for the revolution to fail.
"But I certainly wouldn't want to steal from this country the funds that are necessary for so many things we need to do. We can't afford a national health plan for this country. I don't know what we can do for some other folks."
Among the 60 or so people who were interviewed or who refused to be interviewed were those who made it clear that they were too consumed with their own financial constraints to worry about another country's troubles. Many answered with variations on the theme most succinctly stated by Aaron K. Bilyeu, a 40-year-old Vietnam veteran from Auburn, Ind.: "It's a good idea -- maybe."
Most often, their answers came in the form of questions: Is the Soviet Union worthy of help? Would American aid make any difference? Would it hurt us to help them?
 
Are They Worthy?
Caution Lingers As Fear Recedes
Along highways and subdivisions from Cleveland to Des Moines to Los Angeles, yellow ribbons hang on street lamps and doorways like talismans of faith in the United States' new-found military might. In these places the fear of nuclear war with the Soviet Union is barely mentioned: if it hasn't vanished, it has been put in a bottom drawer.
Yet the end of fear has not meant the end of caution. Looking at the shifting Soviet political currents, the ethnic strife, the empty shelves and the rivalry between reformers and hard-liners, some favor aid to promote stability and peaceful change. But others argue that the aid would fall into the wrong hands.
"Neglecting them will make things worse," said Linda Masuku, 32, an immigrant from South Africa now working as a secretary at St. Paul's Church in Grinnell, Iowa. "The United States should help get rid of this Communism. Things change. There are things you can cure. What's happening in the Soviet Union is a long-term thing that needs to be cured."
John Chiang, 28, a Los Angeles lawyer, favors aid to the Soviet Union, but with strict conditions. "I'm not concerned about reverting to the cold war in the classic sense," he said, "but I do think there could be tremendous antagonism if they don't restore their own internal order. We should be working with them on their banking system, their infrastructure, advising them how the money should be spent, and provide technical assistance."
But a recent immigrant wants to see changes before aid, not after. "The leaders of the Soviet Congress are still the old-fashioned hard-headed Communists," said Miklos Szucs, who was born 29 years ago in Hungary. Now, with his American-born wife, he sells his spicy homemade sausages at the Dohar's Meats stand at the West Side Market in Cleveland.
"A country that wants to spend more on keeping an army than harvesting the grain isn't worth a penny," he said. "They need at least five years to get the people who were in power out of power. Otherwise, they're going to put the money in the same place they put it before -- in their pockets."
Diane Lambert, manager of the Chester/ Valcom Computer Center in Bourbonnais, Ill., grew up in Kankakee and was 9 years old in 1959, when she saw Nikita S. Khrushchev in a parade in a nearby town. She was excited, but didn't like him: "a funny fat man with a button nose." Now 41, she is fascinated by the changes in the Soviet Union, but still does not trust them.
"I've got conflicting feelings," she said. "How can you kick someone when they're down? But in my heart I don't think it's fair. We'd be helping them become more powerful. For every dollar we give them, we'd have to give another dollar to our own defense."
 
Would Aid Help?
Few Illusions On Quick Fixes
Can the command economy become a market economy? Can the Soviet Union become something different? In the restaurant of the Morris Inn on the University of Notre Dame campus in South Bend, Ind., a group of five professors lifted their voices over the easy-listening music and spoke about history, opportunity and risk.
Two views emerged from that conversation and from later interviews. The first was that aid, given in moderate amounts or in kind, with many conditions attached, could be instrumental in changing the Soviet system. The other was that the Soviet economy is so large and so ossified that any aid would be money down the drain.
"What the Soviet Union is facing is comparable to unscrambling an egg," said Roger B. Skurski, a professor of economics at Notre Dame. "There's no way to really do it. They can't start with a clean slate. You have to deal with the mind set they have first."
"If we offer them help, we would have to do it very carefully," he added, suggesting scholarships for Soviet economics students, technical advisers and more academic and professional exchanges between the countries.
 
A Necessary Gamble?
 V. Paul Kenney, a professor of physics who has traveled to the Soviet Union and stays in touch with Soviet scientists, would like to see a more broad-based effort at aid, linked to the country's progress down the road to democracy and free markets. A large investment is a necessary gamble, he said.
"It seems like an awful lot of money's been put into the cold war," he said. "Talk about billions of dollars -- you can get up to trillions over the years. If all of the effort that was put into the cold war was a security issue, then surely doing what we can to keep the whole thing from blowing apart was also a security issue."
But he added: "It's going to be very expensive to solve things. Americans like quick fixes. I'm not sure there is a quick fix here. I'm not sure there's anything to do but to ride along with things and watch as they try to work themselves out of a hole. What I would do at this moment of crisis is try and grease the skids."
Others said large-scale aid in the near future would be a palliative, with little impact on the basic economic structure. Jon Huntsman, chairman of the Huntsman Chemical Corporation in Salt Lake City, has embarked on several joint ventures with Soviet partners, including plants making chemicals and plastic bottles.
"We should participate in joint ventures and help train their people, by teaching them how to fish but not providing them with fish," he said. "I don't agree with pumping money into their system without the proper exposure to our open-market system."
But John B. Attanasio, a Notre Dame law professor, said he doubted that private enterprise would want to lead the way in aiding the Soviet Union. "There has to be Government aid, considerable amounts of it, with a lot of it in kind," he said.
And with conditions, said Howard L. Lasher, a New York State Assemblyman whose district includes the large colony of Russian immigrants in Brighton Beach. "When you give economic aid, you have to look at individual rights and civil liberties," he said. "Otherwise, you'll just be building up another dictatorship."
 
Is It Affordable?
Keen Awareness Of Needs at Home
Where would the aid come from? That concern, more than any other, was on the minds of those Americans interviewed. Many were afraid that the Soviets' gain would be their loss. "Take it from the defense budget; don't take it from the poor or the inner cities," said Dr. Jackson of Gary. And Mr. Bilyeu at the American Legion post in Auburn, Ind., said: "Not from the veterans. Let's be damn sure they don't take it from lower-class and middle-class America."
And while many others suggested that the investment in stability should come from military spending, a few, like John Alger, a 32-year-old Florida vegetable farmer, demurred. "I wouldn't strip defense back a dime," he said. "That's going to keep them in line."
Luis A. Sanchez, 25, a Cuban-born high school social studies teacher in Miami, said: "I think we should give the Soviets as much as we can as long as it doesn't hurt us. We want to open up new markets for ourselves, but we are not in a position to be so generous that we can be their savior. We have to look out for ourselves at the same time."
In Iowa, many people still have keen memories of Khrushchev's visit to Roswell Garst's farm in Coon Rapids in 1959. Iowa's interests often coincide with the Soviet Union's, as they did in June, when Mr. Bush announced $1.5 billion in grain credits for the Soviet Union. But there is also keen awareness of the consequences of overextending a budget.
 
Drought and Debt
 Gary and Susan Davis raise corn, soybeans and hogs on a farm in Newburg, population 50. Thanks to friends at the United States Information Agency, they have many foreign guests, and they say the visits have made them appreciate the good that American aid can do.
But after a decade of watching drought and debt bankrupt their overextended neighbors, the Davises, who are in their early 50's, are queasy about taking more money from the Treasury to bail out the Soviet economy.
"I'd rather do that than some of the things our leaders spend their money on," Susan Davis said. "If we could do it, it would be a grand investment. But we're a distressed world power, and so are they. We have economic problems in our country, and so do they. Should we help them?"
"You ought to start with 'Can we help them?' " her husband interjected. "Maybe we could take it from defense spending, though I'd rather see the government bureaucracy pruned." He paused. "But if the Soviets had to come up with the money themselves, they'd have more incentive to do things right."
 
'It's Not Our Job'
 Up the road in Marshalltown, Delbert Kellogg, Gary Davis's high school contemporary and fellow farmer, had no ambivalence. "It's not our job," he said.
It's just not our job. Their problems are something they're going to have to work out by themselves." He would rather see investments by American businessmen than by the American Government. After all, he added, we don't want to create another Japan.
The belief that American generosity in foreign economic aid had come back to haunt American businessmen was mentioned again and again. John Dwan, director of communications for the Health Sciences Center at the University of Utah, argued that Germany and Japan, not the United States, should be the ones to help the Soviets.
"They're today's sugar daddies," said Mr. Dwan, a retired colonel in the Marine reserves. "The Soviet Union needs a Marshall Plan, but it should be a Russian plan financed with marks and yen."
If there was a common ground in all the responses, it was the undertone of anxiety -- anxiety in part about the future of the Soviet Union, but in greater measure about the future of the United States.
 
'They Know Better Now'
 Most seemed to feel, as did Ellis Rivers Sr., a 64-year-old Memphis tailor, that the Soviets were "hip now."
"They were just trying to change the world to the way they thought," he said. "They know better now."
George Drake, a history professor who is stepping down as president of Grinnell College in Iowa, said: "Security is the biggest pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Yes, maybe we'd be throwing money down a rat hole. But I'm an optimist. I say it's worth a try." But he had his own caveat: Give them aid, he said. Condition it. But don't make them feel like a supplicant.
"In a peculiar way, we're closer to the Soviet Union than to any other country, because we're so preoccupied with them," he said. "We haven't known enough about them, but they are in the waking thoughts of people here and have been for as long as I can remember. Our relationship with them will always be more intense than with other countries.
"It is similar to a love-hate relationship with human beings. To the extent that the relationship is not equal, there will be more difficulties with it than otherwise. They don't want to be beholden to us. How things play out now depends not just on what we do, but on how we do it."
