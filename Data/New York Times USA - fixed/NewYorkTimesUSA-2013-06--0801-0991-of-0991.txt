HEADLINE: Exit From the Bond Market Is Turning Into a Stampede

BYLINE: NATHANIEL POPPER and PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: The sell-off prompted some calming words from a Fed official about its support for the economy &#8212; and by extension, the bond market. 

 BODY:
Wall Street never thought it would be this bad.
Over the last two months, and particularly over the last two weeks, investors have been exiting their bond investments with unexpected ferocity, moves that continued through Monday.
A bond sell-off has been anticipated for years, given the long run of popularity that corporate and government bonds have enjoyed. But most strategists expected that investors would slowly transfer out of bonds, allowing interest rates to slowly drift up.
Instead, since the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, recently suggested that the strength of the economic recovery might allow the Fed to slow down its bond-buying program, waves of selling have convulsed the markets. 
 The recent pain has spilled over into stock markets, pushing the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index down an additional 1.2 percent on Monday. But the real pressure has been felt in the bigger and more closely watched bond market. The value of outstanding United States government 10-year notes has fallen 10 percent since a high in early May.
The selling has been most visible among retail investors, who have sold a record $48 billion worth of shares in bond mutual funds so far in June, according to the data company TrimTabs. But hedge funds and other big institutional investors have also been closing out positions or stepping back from the bond market.
"The feeling you are getting out there is that people are selling first and asking questions later," said Hans Humes, chief executive of the hedge fund Greylock Capital.
The anxiety has been heightened by recent instability in the Chinese banking sector, where lending has shown signs of freezing up. That led Chinese stocks down particularly sharply, with the Shanghai composite index ending Monday down 5.3 percent.
But Mr. Humes and many others in the market say they think that the recent swings are driven more by fear than by a rational assessment of what bonds are worth. This could lead to crises for some big investors who took speculative bets, but it makes many analysts skeptical that the panic will lead to any broader instability in the financial system.
"The fundamental story is not so bad - you are not talking about the system teetering on the edge of anything," Mr. Humes said.
It was the strength of the underlying economy that Mr. Bernanke emphasized last Wednesday at a news conference where he explained the central bank's impulse to pull back on its $85 billion a month bond-buying program.
The money the Fed spends on bonds is supposed to bolster the economy, but the cheap money coming from the Fed has also made it less expensive and easier for investors to make large, increasingly speculative bets on bond prices.
The Fed's unusual bond purchases have given it far more influence over the market than at past turning points for interest rates. But Fed officials are clearly unhappy with the extent of the reaction to Mr. Bernanke's statements. On Monday, some top Fed officials made public comments that appeared to be aimed at calming some of the market's wild selling. Narayana Kocherlakota, the president of the regional Fed branch in Minnesota, said in a statement on the bank's Web site that the Fed's recent communications had left the "public with large amounts of residual uncertainty."
Mr. Kocherlakota emphasized that the Fed still planned to support the economy until it grew significantly stronger.
The recent rout follows several years of generally falling interest rates and comfortable bond returns. The belief that the Fed was likely to maintain its stimulus into the foreseeable future caused many investors to continue piling into bonds, even through the first few months of this year. TrimTabs estimates that $1.2 trillion flowed into bond funds over the last four years.
But those good times bred complacency, and Mr. Bernanke's recent comments have caused an abrupt change in perceptions.
The S.& P. 500 recovered from large losses early in the day to finish down 19.34 points, to 1,573.09, on Monday. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.9 percent, or 139.84 points, to 14,659.56. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 1.1 percent, or 36.49 points, to 3,320.76.
In the current fear-soaked atmosphere, market participants are looking over their shoulders, seeking to identify which firms or funds are sitting on big losses and might be forced to sell large lots of bonds. The most obvious contenders are those that bought bonds with borrowed money. In Wall Street parlance, that is called leverage. It can magnify returns when rates are low and prices are rising, but unwinding leveraged trades can deepen losses.
"The fact that we're seeing these violent moves is a reflection that there was leverage there," George Goncalves, a fixed-income strategist at Nomura, said. "This is definitely more than a hissy fit. Some people are being forced to sell."
Usually the preserve of banks and hedge funds, leverage even spread into retail-focused bond funds in recent years when rates were at very low levels. Since 2008, about one-fifth of the exchange-traded funds that invest in longer-term bonds were leveraged, according to Savita Subramanian, an equity strategist at Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch.
The signs of stress have also been evident in the more ordinary exchange-traded funds, or E.T.F.'s, that hold bonds. These E.T.F.'s are very easy to sell at moments of panic, but the operators of the E.T.F.'s have found it harder to sell off the actual bonds. This has caused the value of the E.T.F.'s to sink further than the value of the underlying bonds.
On Friday, a municipal bond E.T.F. that is popular with retail investors fell 3.7 percent below the value of the bonds it was supposed to be holding, the so-called net asset value, according to ETF Global. On average over the last two months, the E.T.F., which trades under the ticker symbol MUB, was only 0.6 percent below the value of its net asset value.
"It's a self-fulfilling cycle until everyone gets exhausted," said Peter Tchir, the founder of TF Market Advisors. "We don't think we've seen the capitulation we need to hit bottom yet."

HEADLINE: Economists Are Asking: Did Bernanke Tip Fed's Hand?

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSS SORKIN


HIGHLIGHT: In a perfect world, the Fed&#8217;s communications strategy should make the markets less erratic, but with investors hanging on every word from the Fed, volatility seems to have grown worse. 

 BODY:
Is Ben Bernanke being too chatty?
That's the question being put forward by some economists and others about Mr. Bernanke, the normally restrained Federal Reserve chairman, after his comments in May and last week about the economy and the central bank's plans for eventually backing off its stimulus measures.
Last week, his comments that the economic recovery was surpassing forecasts sent the market into a tailspin because Wall Street was worried that the Fed would start easing its bond-buying program and raise interest rates sooner than many had anticipated. That, in turn, could slow the economy, some worry. Since then, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has fallen nearly 5 percent. 
Mr. Bernanke, hardly one to be described as verbose, said far more during his news conference on Wednesday than he usually does - and he went further about the Fed's policy plans than the committee itself had said earlier in its official statement.
He went so far that one of the Fed's directors, James B. Bullard, publicly questioned the board's decision to let Mr. Bernanke expound upon its thinking. In a statement, Mr. Bullard said he "felt that the committee's decision to authorize the chairman to lay out a more elaborate plan for reducing the pace of asset purchases was inappropriately timed."
He went on to say that "a more prudent approach would be to wait for more tangible signs that the economy was strengthening and that inflation was on a path to return toward target before making such an announcement."
It wasn't that long ago that any Fed chairman hardly said a word. Until 1994, the Fed did not even regularly issue a statement disclosing a change in policy after its monthly meeting. Alan Greenspan made an art out of talking in circles so that investors couldn't divine his intentions.
Janet Yellen, the Fed's vice chairwoman and a possible successor to Mr. Bernanke, explained in a recent speech that for most of the last century, the Fed's communications policy was modeled on Montagu Norman, governor of the Bank of England, whose motto, she said, was, "Never explain, never excuse."
Ever since the financial crisis, with calls for more transparency, Mr. Bernanke has taken a different tack, holding news conferences and providing specific details and timelines for the Fed's policies.
In some instances, it has worked magnificently. By laying out a timetable for the Fed's stimulus back in January 2012 - in which he explained the Fed's inflation and unemployment targets - he found a way to create a relative calm in the markets.
Questions about the communications strategy, however, were raised about whether he was oversharing. Would it become, as they might say on Twitter, T.M.I.? (Too Much Information.) The worry back then was that he would box himself into a specific timeline and that he would have a tricky time exiting his stimulus strategy.
Even before Mr. Bernanke spoke last week, he was being blamed for the recent market volatility. "The purpose of central-bank transparency was to give markets clarity and reduce volatility," Ed Yardeni, president and chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research, told Bloomberg News two days before the Bernanke news conference.
"Instead, it's increasing volatility and been counterproductive. Clearly the backup in bond yields and sell-off are disconcerting."
In a perfect world, the Fed's communications strategy should mean the markets are less erratic, not more.
However, with investors hanging on every syllable of every word that comes out of the mouths of Mr. Bernanke and the other board members, volatility seems to have been worse.
In fairness, everything is relative, so it is possible that the markets would act even more erratically if the communications policy was less straightforward. It is impossible to know. It's the ultimate Catch-22.
During Mr. Bernanke's news conference, he was asked whether his comments went beyond what the committee had agreed on.
"There's no change in policy involved here. There's simply a clarification, helping people to think about where policy will evolve. So, it was thought that it might be best for me to explain that to this group," Mr. Bernanke told reporters.
And yet, his words moved the market because they filled in gaps that a statement from the Fed could never fully communicate.
Ms. Yellen, in her speech, which was given to the Society of American Business Editors and Writers, said that the Fed's move to be more transparent wasn't just for the sake of transparency. She said the Fed's utterances had become an important tool.
The first big communications moment for the Fed, she said, was in 2003 when the central bank was running out of options to spur growth because it had already cut the federal funds rate. So it decided to tell the market that it planned to keep rates low for a considerable period.
"The committee was using communication - mere words - as its primary monetary policy tool. Until then, it was probably common to think of communication about future policy as something that supplemented the setting of the federal funds rate. In this case, communication was an independent and effective tool for influencing the economy," she said.
Communication is indeed influencing the markets now. Whether it is too much of a good thing will only truly become apparent down the road.

HEADLINE: A Case for the Humanities Not Made

BYLINE: STANLEY FISH


HIGHLIGHT: College teachers should &#8216;reach out&#8217; to their colleagues in K-12? Sure, let&#8217;s have a joint bake sale or a dance. 

 BODY:
In recent columns both David Brooks and Verlyn Klinkenborg have remarked (as almost everyone else has) on the decline of the humanities in our colleges and universities.
Brooks speculates that "many humanists have lost faith in their own enterprise" and have replaced traditional aesthetic concerns - "the old notions of truth, beauty and goodness" - with overtly political concerns. (I have some sympathy with this complaint.) Klinkenborg laments the erosion of writing skills - again I am compelled to agree - and deplores a "vocational emphasis" that has resulted in a precipitate drop in the number of literature majors. He, too, lays some of the blame at the door of the humanists themselves, decrying the "technical narrowness" of specialization and a "theoretical emphasis" that, he thinks, is more suitable to graduate than to undergraduate courses. (Here I disagree; when specialists drill down, what they and their students find waiting for them is a deep flowering of the general; and theory rigorously employed sheds more light on "old notions of truth, beauty and goodness" than anything else.) 
Klinkenborg also points to a public relations failure. Humanists, he says, "do a bad job of explaining why the humanities matter" and he cites, as does Brooks, a report recently issued by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences titled "The Heart of the Matter." Produced in response to a Congressional request, the report is clear about what is needed: "At a time when economic anxiety is driving the public toward a narrow concept of education focused on short-term payoffs, it is imperative that colleges, universities and their supporters make a clear and convincing case for the value of Liberal Arts Education." The report promises to show the way by making the case in general and suggesting some specific actions that might be taken.
The promise is not redeemed, and I predict that this report - laden with bland commonplaces and recommendations that could bear fruit only in a Utopia - will be dutifully noted by pious commentators and then live a quiet life on the shelf for which it was destined.

The claims made for the humanities and social sciences (it is clear that the social sciences are an add-on and an afterthought) are predictably large:
"The humanities and social sciences provide an intellectual framework and context for understanding and thriving in a complex world."
"A thorough grounding in these subjects allows citizens to participate meaningfully in the democratic process."
The humanities and social sciences "enable us to participate in a global economy that requires understanding of diverse cultures and sensitivity to different perspectives."
In each of these sentences, and many others that might be instanced, the key words - "framework," "context," "complex," "meaningfully," "understanding," "diverse," "sensitivity," "perspectives" - are spectacularly empty; just where specificity is needed, sonorous abstraction blunts the edge of what is being asserted, rendering it unexceptionable (no one's against understanding, complexity and meaningfulness) and without bite.
Then there are the recommendations.
"Increase NEH funding." Fine idea, but only political efforts of a kind not mentioned here will do that trick. College teachers should "reach out" to their colleagues in K-12. Sure, let's have a joint bake sale or a dance. "Embrace the chance to connect with the larger community." What exactly does "connect with" mean and where does the "chance" reside? "Deepen knowledge of other cultures." Add "deepen" to the list of words that say nothing. Develop "intercultural skills." First tell me what they are and how they differ from mono-cultural skills. "Expand the pool of qualified teachers." Wait a moment while I wave my magic wand. "Promote Language Learning." Yes, that's something we could and should do, but it will take money, and money has systematically been withdrawn from public higher education for decades.
The report alludes to this unhappy fact, but doesn't take it up. Nor does it take up the converging factors that accelerate the rush to vocationalism and short-term payoffs - the mania for online education, unsupportable student debt, rising costs in every area of a college's operation, the Internet's preference for chunked-up bits of information, the elimination or radical downsizing of French, Russian, German, religious studies, theater and other programs because they cannot be justified under zero-based budgeting assumptions.
These and other deep and seemingly intractable problems are either completely ignored or barely glanced at as the authors of the report alternate between grand, un-cashable claims and pie-in-the sky proposals that have no traction because there is barely a suggestion of a road map that might lead to their realization.
Nevertheless, amid all this vagueness there is a strong, if somewhat subliminal, message, one that is complicit with the very forces the report is supposedly written to combat. Humanists are advised "to apply their work to the great challenges of the era as well as pursuing basic curiosity-driven research." "Curiosity-driven" means driven simply by the desire (often obsessive) to determine the truth of a matter, independently of whether it is a truth that will rise to an era's great challenges.
That of course is precisely how the academy, and especially the humanist academy, has traditionally been conceived - as a cloistered and separate area in which inquiry is engaged in for its own sake and not because it yields useful results. It is the rejection of this contemplative ideal in favor of various forms of instrumentalism that underlies the turn away from the humanist curriculum. The rhetoric of the report puts its authors on the side of that ideal, but when push comes to shove, they are all too ready to dilute it in the name of some large abstraction - democracy, culture, social progress, whatever. They are, in short, all too ready to depart from the heart of the matter.

HEADLINE: U.S. Civil Charges Against Corzine Are Seen as Near

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The federal agency that regulated the brokerage firm MF Global before it collapsed in 2011 plans to sue Jon S. Corzine, its former chief executive. 

 BODY:
Federal regulators are poised to sue Jon S. Corzine over the collapse of MF Global and the brokerage firm's misuse of customer money during its final days, a blowup that rattled Wall Street and cast a spotlight on Mr. Corzine, the former New Jersey governor who ran the firm until its bankruptcy in 2011.
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the federal agency that regulated MF Global, plans to approve the lawsuit as soon as this week, according to law enforcement officials with knowledge of the case. In a rare move against a Wall Street executive, the agency has informed Mr. Corzine's lawyers that it aims to file the civil case without offering him the opportunity to settle, setting up a legal battle that could drag on for years.
 Without directly linking Mr. Corzine to the disappearance of more than $1 billion in customer money, the trading commission will probably blame the chief executive for failing to prevent the breach at a lower rung of the firm, the law enforcement officials said. If found liable, he could face millions of dollars in fines and possibly a ban from trading commodities, jeopardizing his future on Wall Street. 
In a statement, a spokesman for Mr. Corzine denounced the trading commission for planning to file what he called an "unprecedented and meritless civil enforcement action."
The aggressive action would stand in contrast to the government's investigations so far into the 2008 financial crisis, many of which produced symbolic fines. In the case of Lehman Brothers, which imploded at the height of the crisis, no employee has ever been charged with civil or criminal wrongdoing.
An MF Global case, expected to be filed in federal court, could become something of an experiment for federal regulators under pressure to adopt a harder line against Wall Street. It would also thrust the trading commission - the financial industry's smallest regulator - onto a bigger stage.
A case would darken the cloud over the legacy of Mr. Corzine, 66, who as a onetime Democratic governor and senator from New Jersey and a former chief of Goldman Sachs has long been a confidant of leaders in Washington and on Wall Street.
But it would also suggest that authorities have all but removed a greater threat: criminal charges. After nearly two years of stitching together evidence, criminal investigators have concluded that porous risk controls at the firm, rather than fraud, allowed the customer money to disappear, according to the law enforcement officials with knowledge of the case.
Still, the spokesman for Mr. Corzine, Steven Goldberg, said that the trading commission's anticipated lawsuit "is not surprising considering the political pressure to hold someone liable for the failure of MF Global," the largest Wall Street bankruptcy since the 2008 financial crisis. Lawmakers and even some agency officials, he noted, have publicly condemned the firm.
"If the C.F.T.C. brings this enforcement action, Mr. Corzine would welcome the opportunity to litigate this matter in an impartial venue, free from politically influenced prejudice and unfounded assertions, which have been frequently repeated despite the lack of a factual basis," Mr. Goldberg said.
The trading commission has not told other top executives that they will be sued, according to lawyers briefed on the case. The regulator appears more likely to take aim at lower-level employees tasked with protecting customer accounts.
The agency faces a lower threshold for proving its charges than criminal authorities do. Prosecutors must prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt, but the agency would only have to show a preponderance of the evidence.
Yet the trading commission is not expected to accuse Mr. Corzine of authorizing the breach of customer money, the officials with knowledge of the case said. Instead, the agency is likely to say that he failed to sufficiently supervise the firm and is subject to so-called control person liability, a legal provision that allows for the punishment of executives for the bad acts of lower-level employees.
As MF Global teetered on the brink of collapse, employees in Chicago transferred customer money to plug holes in the firm's own accounts, causing a shortfall for clients like hedge funds and farmers whose funds vanished into banks and clearinghouses. The money might have never disappeared if the banks had not pocketed the customers' money.
"During the difficult final week, Mr. Corzine was never informed, nor was he ever given reason to believe, that customer funds were at risk or were being used improperly," Mr. Goldberg said. "Justice would not be served if Mr. Corzine were to be blamed for alleged mistakes that were made without his knowledge."
Some internal e-mails lend support to Mr. Corzine's defense. An e-mail reviewed by The New York Times indicates that an employee in the firm's Chicago office, Edith O'Brien, explicitly stated to Mr. Corzine that money was a "house wire," meaning that it came from the firm's own accounts, not from customers. Ms. O'Brien, who oversaw the transfer of customer money during the firm's final week, has been a focus of the investigation since its onset.
For months, she declined to cooperate with authorities without receiving immunity from criminal prosecution. Federal authorities hesitated to grant her request, according to the officials close to the case, but started to reverse course this spring when they invited her to an interview.
For now, Ms. O'Brien is likely to receive immunity from criminal prosecution, but she or her direct bosses could still face a civil action from the trading commission, the officials said. Ms. O'Brien has not been accused of any wrongdoing.
A spokesman for the F.B.I. in Manhattan declined to comment. The trading commission also declined to comment.
MF Global filed for bankruptcy on Halloween 2011. Months later, the trading commission's investigation escalated even as criminal scrutiny petered out. Early this year, people involved in the case said, the regulator deposed Mr. Corzine.
The investigation presented a test for the agency's enforcement division, which has adopted a more aggressive stance under David Meister, a former federal prosecutor who joined the agency in 2010.
Ultimately, Mr. Meister's team warned Mr. Corzine's lawyers, Andrew J. Levander and Benjamin E. Rosenberg at Dechert, that it planned to recommend an enforcement action against him. The division, according to people with knowledge of the case, planned to accuse the executive of a "failure to exercise adequate supervision," stemming from a breakdown in the firm's internal controls.
Mr. Goldberg said the allegation would be "nothing more than another example of Monday morning quarterbacking," a defense first raised when MF Global's bankruptcy trustee sued Mr. Corzine and his aides in April.
According to the lawsuit, an October 2010 internal report warned Mr. Corzine about certain "high risk" areas stemming from the lack of controls.
While such warning signs could support the trading commission's case, it plans to level a second charge that could be more difficult to prove. In claiming "control person liability," the agency must show that Mr. Corzine had control over Ms. O'Brien or any other employee who may have transferred customer money. It also must prove that he either "did not act in good faith" or knowingly "induced" an employee to break the law. While Mr. Corzine is thought to have received e-mails with estimates of customer money, authorities appear to lack a smoking gun.
The agency has successfully relied on the statutes that cover failure to supervise and control person liability in previous cases, but it has never used them in such a prominent action.
Mr. Goldberg said that regulators "regularly reviewed MF Global and had never found fault with its systems and procedures for maintaining customer funds."
Since the collapse of the firm, Mr. Corzine has kept a low public profile. Lately, however, he has ventured out a bit. He recently visited Central America for a humanitarian project involving children, for example. And last week, he was seen at an old haunt in Lower Manhattan, Esquires of Wall Street, an 81-year-old barbershop that Mr. Corzine has frequented since his days at Goldman.

HEADLINE: The Future of Fair Labor

BYLINE: By JEFFERSON COWIE. 
Jefferson Cowie is a professor of labor history at Cornell and the author of ''Stayin' Alive: The 1970s and the Last Days of the Working Class.''

 BODY:
ITHACA, N.Y. -- SEVENTY-FIVE years ago today, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Fair Labor Standards Act to give a policy backbone to his belief that goods that were not produced under ''rudimentary standards of decency'' should not be ''allowed to pollute the channels of interstate trade."
The act is the bedrock of modern employment law. It outlawed child labor, guaranteed a minimum wage, established the official length of the workweek at 40 hours, and required overtime pay for anything more. Capping the working week encouraged employers to hire more people rather than work the ones they had to exhaustion. All this came not from the magic of market equilibrium but from federal policy. 
For decades afterward, Congress brought more people under the law's purview and engaged in perennial struggles to maintain or increase the minimum wage. Fifty years ago this month, John F. Kennedy signed its most important amendment, the Equal Pay Act, which guaranteed women and others equal pay for equal work.
Despite this noble history, today the act faces an uncertain future, thanks to a series of disconcerting shifts in the way we think about work in America.
The problem is indicative of the moral and political slipperiness of our time. A large and growing number of employers willfully classify their employees as ''exempt'' from the law by shifting their jobs, but not their pay, to administrative, executive and professional categories. Being exempt allows employers to ignore pesky things like overtime or minimum wages, since these are salaried, not hourly workers. Lawsuits over back overtime pay resulting from misclassifications have gone through the roof.
If the line between exempt and nonexempt workers has become unfairly blurred, the line distinguishing employee and independent contractor has faded to near invisibility. We are moving toward the ''1099 economy,'' named after the tax form provided to independent contractors, a classification that often walks the line of legality.
For some workers, being a 1099'er means more flexibility, creativity and control over their work. However, there are many more reluctant 1099 workers who want regular jobs but find themselves locked out of the system by employers looking for an easy way to buck their responsibility to their employees.
And then there is the most infamous classification hustle: the internship. For bright, young (and typically affluent) interns at America's top corporations there is no actual job, so there are no fair labor standards to apply. That means no minimum wage and no maximum hours. There is often no pay at all.
A recent decision by the Federal District Court in Manhattan declaring that the hard-working ''interns'' involved in making the 2010 film ''Black Swan'' for Fox Searchlight were really employees is encouraging, and may well have long-range implications. It's a hopeful sign that we may yet be able to re-establish an idea that is as old-fashioned as it is good: work and you get paid.
And yet, countercurrents persist. When Obamacare goes into effect next year, businesses that have more than 50 full-time employees will have to start offering health insurance. This could produce a scramble among small companies to reclassify enough employees so as not to have to pay for health insurance.
In response, we need a new commitment from the federal government to buttress the Fair Labor Standards Act.
More money for enforcement is a must. Compliance actions from the Department of Labor's Division of Wages and Hours fell by over a third between 1997 and 2007. This is partly a matter of resources: for this coming budget year, the Obama administration is seeking a modest increase of $15 million for enforcement of both the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Family Medical Leave Act. That's not enough.
There are several other ways to improve the act. Because its enforcement scheme relies on employees to come forward, rather than on government-initiated supervision through audits and worksite visits, protection against retaliation needs to be more robust. We can also improve the law's deterrence function, in the form of punitive damages for severe or pervasive violations.
It's true that we are in the middle of a seismic shift in the way we structure our work lives. Both workers and employers want more flexibility. But that similarity of interests shouldn't mask the fact that employers will always have more power than their employees, and that it's in their interests to make those employees work as long and as cheaply as possible.
In Roosevelt's day, the courts found most wages and hours legislation unconstitutional based on the doctrine of ''liberty of contract.'' The idea was as simple as it was pernicious: wages and hours legislation violated an individual's freedom to make an independent (read: worse) deal with his employer.
We can't afford to drift further back to the bad old days of liberty of contract. Americans are drastically overworked and underpaid compared to workers in other advanced countries, and our workers are trapped in a rigid pattern of inequality that has ended a historic claim to being the nation of upward mobility.
Roosevelt did not bother with economic arguments when it came to hours and wages. He offered a simple framework, both moral and patriotic. ''A self-supporting and self-respecting democracy,'' he proclaimed, ''can plead no justification for the existence of child labor, no economic reason for chiseling workers' wages or stretching workers' hours.'' That is as true today as it was then.

HEADLINE: Archimedes: Separating Myth From Science

BYLINE: By KENNETH CHANG

 BODY:
For the last time: Archimedes did not invent a death ray.
But more than 2,200 years after his death, his inventions are still driving technological innovations -- so much so that experts from around the world gathered recently for a conference at New York University on his continuing influence.
The death ray legend has Archimedes using mirrors to concentrate sunlight to incinerate Roman ships attacking his home of Syracuse, the ancient city-state in the southeast Sicily. It has been debunked no fewer than three times on the television show ''Mythbusters'' (the third time at the behest of President Obama).
Rather, it is a mundane contraption attributed to the great Greek mathematician, inventor, engineer and military planner -- the Archimedes screw, a corkscrew inside a cylinder -- that has a new use in the 21st century. For thousands of years, farmers have used this simple machine for irrigation: Placed at an angle with one end submerged in a river or a lake, the screw is turned by a handle, lifting water upward and out at the other end. 
Archimedes Screw
A couple of decades ago, engineers found that running an Archimedes screw backward -- that is, dropping water in at the top, causing the screw to turn as the water falls to the bottom -- is a robust, economical and efficient way to generate electricity from small streams. The power output is modest, enough for a village, but with a small impact on the environment. Unlike the turbine blades that spin in huge hydropower plants like the Hoover Dam, an Archimedes screw permits fish to swim through it and emerge at the other end almost unscathed.
Such generators have been built in Europe, including one commissioned by Queen Elizabeth II of England to power Windsor Castle; the first in the United States could start operating next year.
Construction of an Archimedean Screw Hydro Turbine
And Archimedes' ideas are showing up in other fields as well.
''He just planted the seeds for so many seminal ideas that could grow over the ages,'' said Chris Rorres, an emeritus professor of mathematics at Drexel University, who organized the conference at N.Y.U.
A panoply of devices and ideas are named after Archimedes. Besides the Archimedes screw, there is the Archimedes principle, the law of buoyancy that states the upward force on a submerged object equals the weight of the liquid displaced. There is the Archimedes claw, a weapon that most likely did exist, grabbing onto Roman ships and tipping them over. And there is the Archimedes sphere, a forerunner of the planetarium -- a hand-held globe that showed the constellations as well as the locations of the sun and the planets in the sky.
''Here was someone who just changed how we look at the universe,'' Dr. Rorres said.
Only a handful of Archimedes' writings survive, and much of what we think we know about him was written centuries after his death.
Some of the legends, like using mirrors to set the Roman ships afire, proved too good to be true. The same may go for the tale of Archimedes figuring out, while sitting in a bathtub, how to tell if the maker of a crown for the king had fraudulently mixed in some silver with the gold; according to this story Archimedes, too excited to put on clothes, ran naked through the streets of Syracuse shouting, ''Eureka!''
As with the mirrors, the underlying principle works. But in practice, the tiny difference in volume between a crown made of pure gold and one made of a mixture of gold and silver is too small to be reliably measured.
Some of the talks at the conference were about using present-day ingenuity to figure out what Archimedes actually achieved in antiquity.
Michael Wright, a researcher at Imperial College London, has been trying to decipher how the Archimedes sphere showed the night sky. Although it is described in historical writings, no pieces or even drawings of it have survived. Others had already made celestial spheres, globes that show the positions of the constellations.
The Roman historian Cicero described the Archimedes sphere as uninteresting at first glance until it was explained. ''There was a wonderful contrivance due to Archimedes inside,'' he wrote. ''He had devised a way in which a single rotation would generate the several non-uniform motions.''
If this description is taken literally, it would seem that Archimedes figured out the gearing needed to mimic the motion of the planets, including the retrograde motion where they appear to stop and reverse direction for a while before proceeding in their usual direction.
''This instrument was just like any other celestial sphere, except with the addition of indicators for the Sun, Moon, the planets moving over the sphere and a mechanism inside the sphere to move them,'' Mr. Wright said.
In the spring, he began building his version of the Archimedes sphere. He presented it in public for the first time at the conference.
''I can't guarantee that the original was like this,'' Mr. Wright said. ''What I can say is this, in the simplest way that I can imagine it, fits the evidence we have. We've been talking for 2,000 years about this thing that Archimedes made, and nobody seems to have offered to show people what it was like. I had an idea. I thought it was worth making, even if it was so people could have an argument about it and disagree with it. That's a good way to get things going.''
Dr. Rorres said the singular genius of Archimedes was that he not only was able to solve abstract mathematics problems, but also used mathematics to solve physics problems, and he then engineered devices to take advantage of the physics. ''He came up with fundamental laws of nature, proved them mathematically and then was able to apply them,'' Dr. Rorres said.
Archimedes oversaw the defenses of Syracuse, and while death ray mirrors and steam cannons (another supposed Archimedes invention debunked by ''Mythbusters'') were too fanciful, the Archimedes claw appears to have been a real weapon used against the Roman navy.
It is very likely that it took advantage of two scientific principles Archimedes discovered.
With his law of buoyancy, he was able to determine whether a paraboloid (a shape similar to the nose cone of a jetliner) would float upright or tip over, a principle of utmost importance to ship designers, and Archimedes probably realized that the Roman ships were vulnerable as they came close to the city walls.
''Archimedes knew about the stability of these kinds of ships,'' said Harry G. Harris, an emeritus professor of structural engineering at Drexel who has built a model of the claw. ''When it is moving fast through the water, it is stable. Standing still or going very slow, it is very easy to tip over.''
So using an Archimedean principle -- the law of the lever, which enables a small force to lift a large weight, as in seesaws and pulleys -- a claw at the end of a chain would be lowered and hooked into a Roman ship, then lifted to capsize the ship and crash it against the rocks.
Syracuse won the battle but was weakened under a long siege and fell three years later. And in 212 B.C., at the age of about 75, Archimedes was killed by a Roman soldier, supposedly furious that he refused to stop work on a mathematical drawing. His last words: ''Do not disturb my circles!''
Of course, that bit about the circles is probably also a myth.

HEADLINE: Exit From the Bond Market Is Turning Into a Stampede

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER and PETER EAVIS

 BODY:
Wall Street never thought it would be this bad.
Over the last two months, and particularly over the last two weeks, investors have been exiting their bond investments with unexpected ferocity, moves that continued through Monday.
A bond sell-off has been anticipated for years, given the long run of popularity that corporate and government bonds have enjoyed. But most strategists expected that investors would slowly transfer out of bonds, allowing interest rates to slowly drift up.
Instead, since the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, recently suggested that the strength of the economic recovery might allow the Fed to slow down its bond-buying program, waves of selling have convulsed the markets. 
The recent pain has spilled over into stock markets, pushing the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index down an additional 1.2 percent on Monday. But the real pressure has been felt in the bigger and more closely watched bond market. The value of outstanding United States government 10-year notes has fallen 10 percent since a high in early May.
The selling has been most visible among retail investors, who have sold a record $48 billion worth of shares in bond mutual funds so far in June, according to the data company TrimTabs. But hedge funds and other big institutional investors have also been closing out positions or stepping back from the bond market.
''The feeling you are getting out there is that people are selling first and asking questions later,'' said Hans Humes, chief executive of the hedge fund Greylock Capital.
The anxiety has been heightened by recent instability in the Chinese banking sector, where lending has shown signs of freezing up. That led Chinese stocks down particularly sharply, with the Shanghai composite index ending Monday down 5.3 percent.
But Mr. Humes and many others in the market say they think that the recent swings are driven more by fear than by a rational assessment of what bonds are worth. This could lead to crises for some big investors who took speculative bets, but it makes many analysts skeptical that the panic will lead to any broader instability in the financial system.
''The fundamental story is not so bad -- you are not talking about the system teetering on the edge of anything,'' Mr. Humes said.
It was the strength of the underlying economy that Mr. Bernanke emphasized last Wednesday at a news conference where he explained the central bank's impulse to pull back on its $85 billion a month bond-buying program.
The money the Fed spends on bonds is supposed to bolster the economy, but the cheap money coming from the Fed has also made it less expensive and easier for investors to make large, increasingly speculative bets on bond prices.
The Fed's unusual bond purchases have given it far more influence over the market than at past turning points for interest rates. But Fed officials are clearly unhappy with the extent of the reaction to Mr. Bernanke's statements. On Monday, some top Fed officials made public comments that appeared to be aimed at calming some of the market's wild selling. Narayana Kocherlakota, the president of the regional Fed branch in Minnesota, said in a statement on the bank's Web site that the Fed's recent communications had left the ''public with large amounts of residual uncertainty.''
Mr. Kocherlakota emphasized that the Fed still planned to support the economy until it grew significantly stronger.
The recent rout follows several years of generally falling interest rates and comfortable bond returns. The belief that the Fed was likely to maintain its stimulus into the foreseeable future caused many investors to continue piling into bonds, even through the first few months of this year. TrimTabs estimates that $1.2 trillion flowed into bond funds over the last four years.
But those good times bred complacency, and Mr. Bernanke's recent comments have caused an abrupt change in perceptions.
The S.& P. 500 recovered from large losses early in the day to finish down 19.34 points, to 1,573.09, on Monday. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.9 percent, or 139.84 points, to 14,659.56. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 1.1 percent, or 36.49 points, to 3,320.76.
In the current fear-soaked atmosphere, market participants are looking over their shoulders, seeking to identify which firms or funds are sitting on big losses and might be forced to sell large lots of bonds. The most obvious contenders are those that bought bonds with borrowed money. In Wall Street parlance, that is called leverage. It can magnify returns when rates are low and prices are rising, but unwinding leveraged trades can deepen losses.
''The fact that we're seeing these violent moves is a reflection that there was leverage there,'' George Goncalves, a fixed-income strategist at Nomura, said. ''This is definitely more than a hissy fit. Some people are being forced to sell.''
Usually the preserve of banks and hedge funds, leverage even spread into retail-focused bond funds in recent years when rates were at very low levels. Since 2008, about one-fifth of the exchange-traded funds that invest in longer-term bonds were leveraged, according to Savita Subramanian, an equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
The signs of stress have also been evident in the more ordinary exchange-traded funds, or E.T.F.'s, that hold bonds. These E.T.F.'s are very easy to sell at moments of panic, but the operators of the E.T.F.'s have found it harder to sell off the actual bonds. This has caused the value of the E.T.F.'s to sink further than the value of the underlying bonds.
On Friday, a municipal bond E.T.F. that is popular with retail investors fell 3.7 percent below the value of the bonds it was supposed to be holding, the so-called net asset value, according to ETF Global. On average over the last two months, the E.T.F., which trades under the ticker symbol MUB, was only 0.6 percent below the value of its net asset value.
''It's a self-fulfilling cycle until everyone gets exhausted,'' said Peter Tchir, the founder of TF Market Advisors. ''We don't think we've seen the capitulation we need to hit bottom yet.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: U.S. Civil Charges Against Corzine Are Seen As Near

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
Federal regulators are poised to sue Jon S. Corzine over the collapse of MF Global and the brokerage firm's misuse of customer money during its final days, a blowup that rattled Wall Street and cast a spotlight on Mr. Corzine, the former New Jersey governor who ran the firm until its bankruptcy in 2011.
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the federal agency that regulated MF Global, plans to approve the lawsuit as soon as this week, according to law enforcement officials with knowledge of the case. In a rare move against a Wall Street executive, the agency has informed Mr. Corzine's lawyers that it aims to file the civil case without offering him the opportunity to settle, setting up a legal battle that could drag on for years.
Without directly linking Mr. Corzine to the disappearance of more than $1 billion in customer money, the trading commission will probably blame the chief executive for failing to prevent the breach at a lower rung of the firm, the law enforcement officials said. If found liable, he could face millions of dollars in fines and possibly a ban from trading commodities, jeopardizing his future on Wall Street. 
In a statement, a spokesman for Mr. Corzine denounced the trading commission for planning to file what he called an ''unprecedented and meritless civil enforcement action.''
The aggressive action would stand in contrast to the government's investigations so far into the 2008 financial crisis, many of which produced symbolic fines. In the case of Lehman Brothers, which imploded at the height of the crisis, no employee has ever been charged with civil or criminal wrongdoing.
An MF Global case, expected to be filed in federal court, could become something of an experiment for federal regulators under pressure to adopt a harder line against Wall Street. It would also thrust the trading commission -- the financial industry's smallest regulator -- onto a bigger stage.
A case would darken the cloud over the legacy of Mr. Corzine, 66, who as a onetime Democratic governor and senator from New Jersey and a former chief of Goldman Sachs has long been a confidant of leaders in Washington and on Wall Street.
But it would also suggest that authorities have all but removed a greater threat: criminal charges. After nearly two years of stitching together evidence, criminal investigators have concluded that porous risk controls at the firm, rather than fraud, allowed the customer money to disappear, according to the law enforcement officials with knowledge of the case.
Still, the spokesman for Mr. Corzine, Steven Goldberg, said that the trading commission's anticipated lawsuit ''is not surprising considering the political pressure to hold someone liable for the failure of MF Global,'' the largest Wall Street bankruptcy since the 2008 financial crisis. Lawmakers and even some agency officials, he noted, have publicly condemned the firm.
''If the C.F.T.C. brings this enforcement action, Mr. Corzine would welcome the opportunity to litigate this matter in an impartial venue, free from politically influenced prejudice and unfounded assertions, which have been frequently repeated despite the lack of a factual basis,'' Mr. Goldberg said.
The trading commission has not told other top executives that they will be sued, according to lawyers briefed on the case. The regulator appears more likely to take aim at lower-level employees tasked with protecting customer accounts.
The agency faces a lower threshold for proving its charges than criminal authorities do. Prosecutors must prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt, but the agency would only have to show a preponderance of the evidence.
Yet the trading commission is not expected to accuse Mr. Corzine of authorizing the breach of customer money, the officials with knowledge of the case said. Instead, the agency is likely to say that he failed to sufficiently supervise the firm and is subject to so-called control person liability, a legal provision that allows for the punishment of executives for the bad acts of lower-level employees.
As MF Global teetered on the brink of collapse, employees in Chicago transferred customer money to plug holes in the firm's own accounts, causing a shortfall for clients like hedge funds and farmers whose funds vanished into banks and clearinghouses. The money might have never disappeared if the banks had not pocketed the customers' money.
''During the difficult final week, Mr. Corzine was never informed, nor was he ever given reason to believe, that customer funds were at risk or were being used improperly,'' Mr. Goldberg said. ''Justice would not be served if Mr. Corzine were to be blamed for alleged mistakes that were made without his knowledge.''
Some internal e-mails lend support to Mr. Corzine's defense. An e-mail reviewed by The New York Times indicates that an employee in the firm's Chicago office, Edith O'Brien, explicitly stated to Mr. Corzine that money was a ''house wire,'' meaning that it came from the firm's own accounts, not from customers. Ms. O'Brien, who oversaw the transfer of customer money during the firm's final week, has been a focus of the investigation since its onset.
For months, she declined to cooperate with authorities without receiving immunity from criminal prosecution. Federal authorities hesitated to grant her request, according to the officials close to the case, but started to reverse course this spring when they invited her to an interview.
For now, Ms. O'Brien is likely to receive immunity from criminal prosecution, but she or her direct bosses could still face a civil action from the trading commission, the officials said. Ms. O'Brien has not been accused of any wrongdoing.
A spokesman for the F.B.I. in Manhattan declined to comment. The trading commission also declined to comment.
MF Global filed for bankruptcy on Halloween 2011. Months later, the trading commission's investigation escalated even as criminal scrutiny petered out. Early this year, people involved in the case said, the regulator deposed Mr. Corzine.
The investigation presented a test for the agency's enforcement division, which has adopted a more aggressive stance under David Meister, a former federal prosecutor who joined the agency in 2010.
Ultimately, Mr. Meister's team warned Mr. Corzine's lawyers that it planned to recommend an enforcement action against him. The division, according to people with knowledge of the case, planned to accuse the executive of a ''failure to exercise adequate supervision,'' stemming from a breakdown in the firm's internal controls.
Mr. Goldberg said the allegation would be ''nothing more than another example of Monday morning quarterbacking,'' a defense first raised when MF Global's bankruptcy trustee sued Mr. Corzine and his aides in April.
According to the lawsuit, an October 2010 internal report warned Mr. Corzine about certain ''high risk'' areas stemming from the lack of controls.
While such warning signs could support the trading commission's case, it plans to level a second charge that could be more difficult to prove. In claiming ''control person liability,'' the agency must show that Mr. Corzine had control over Ms. O'Brien or any other employee who may have transferred customer money. It also must prove that he either ''did not act in good faith'' or knowingly ''induced'' an employee to break the law. While Mr. Corzine is thought to have received e-mails with estimates of customer money, authorities appear to lack a smoking gun.
The agency has successfully relied on the statutes that cover failure to supervise and control person liability in previous cases, but it has never used them in such a prominent action.
Mr. Goldberg said that regulators ''regularly reviewed MF Global and had never found fault with its systems and procedures for maintaining customer funds.''
Since the collapse of the firm, Mr. Corzine has kept a low public profile. Lately, however, he has ventured out a bit. He recently visited Central America for a humanitarian project involving children, for example. And last week, he was seen at an old haunt in Lower Manhattan, Esquires of Wall Street, an 81-year-old barbershop that Mr. Corzine has frequented since his days at Goldman.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Speed Of Ascent

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS. 
Joe Nocera's column will appear on Thursday.

 BODY:
The Supreme Court didn't exactly shock the world on Monday. But, by imposing stricter standards on how courts review affirmative action plans, the court did send another small signal that the era of explicitly race-based affirmative action is coming to an end.
During their heyday, affirmative action programs produced some lasting good. It would have been immoral in the civil rights era to have an archipelago of white colleges and universities dotting the land. Affirmative action plans prevented that. As William Bowen and Derek Bok wrote in their classic work, ''The Shape of the River,'' in 1960, only 5.4 percent of blacks between 25 and 29 had graduated from college, while, by 1995, that share had risen to 15.4 percent. The share of black medical school students climbed from 2.2 percent to 8.1 percent. 
But affirmative action programs also perpetrated some noteworthy wrongs. They reinforced crude racial categorizations, which repelled many Americans. They discriminated against Asian-Americans. Thomas Espenshade of Princeton reviewed admissions data from 1997 and found that Asian applicants had to outscore African-Americans by 450 points on their S.A.T.'s to have an equal chance of getting into a college. The programs also produced a mismatch between minority students and the schools they attended, which sometimes ended up hurting the students they were designed to help.
The evidence on this is hotly disputed, but Richard Sander and Stuart Taylor Jr. make a compelling case in their book ''Mismatch.'' Because some minority applicants get drafted into schools where they wouldn't otherwise be accepted, they are more likely to be stuck in the bottom of their classes and more likely to flee from difficult science and engineering majors. Black law school students are four times more likely to fail bar exams, with mismatch, according to Sander and Taylor, explaining half this gap.
So affirmative action gave us some wildly good and unfortunately negative outcomes, and it stirred up fierce debates. But that's not why these racial preferences are going away. They are going away because underlying realities have changed.
First, economic inequality now trumps racial inequality as the chief source of disadvantage. Sean Reardon of Stanford has looked at a range of studies over 50 years and found whereas the black/white test score gap used to be nearly twice as large as the rich/poor gap, now the income gap is nearly twice large as the race gap. Given this, explicitly race-based affirmative action just doesn't respond to the needs of the moment.
Second, the ethnic makeup of the country has become more complex. At the dawn of the affirmative action era, it was easy to see the chief racial divide as between whites and blacks, but the ethnic mosaic is much more complicated now, with an explosion of different groups from all over the world, at various levels of disadvantage.
Third, we're living in an age of data. Once, it may have seemed reasonable to measure a person by a few crude metrics: S.A.T., G.P.A., race. But now colleges and universities, especially with financial aid forms, have access to a wide array of data on all applicants and can potentially get a much more personalized look at the disadvantages each individual has overcome.
The result is that race-based affirmative action, while not being rejected, is being subsumed within class-based affirmative action. It's being subsumed within more detailed measures of exactly which challenges each applicant faced.
In his Century Foundation report, ''A Better Affirmative Action,'' Richard Kahlenberg shows how state university systems in places like Texas and Colorado and at places like the U.C.L.A. Law School are devising class-based preference systems, which ameliorate economic disadvantage while still producing racially diverse campuses.
What often happens is this: Voters or courts in a state will strike down race-based affirmative action. Minority enrollments initially plummet. Then administrations devise class-based systems that look at the specific obstacles that applicants have overcome: growing up in a neighborhood with concentrated poverty, with a single parent or in a home with few financial assets. Minority enrollments recover, at least to a significant degree, and the new system is fairer than the old.
What are we looking for when we admit a student into a university? We're looking for speed of ascent, not academic attainment at one moment in time. A student who's risen from an economic catastrophe to achieve a B-plus average has more speed of ascent than the child of law professors who has an A average. The first student may be more expensive to teach. She may not write as many big alumni checks. But she'll reflect more credit on her school and society.
We now have the means to measure speed of ascent in a fairer and better way. Explicit, raced-based affirmative action programs weren't wrong for their time, but they are being replaced.

HEADLINE: Credit Warnings Offer World a Peek Into China's Secretive Banks

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
BEIJING -- China's hidden banking system is coming out of the shadows as the government seeks to rein in the excessive lending that it fears could spin out of control.
The People's Bank of China, the central bank, let the world know on Monday that it was putting the nation's banks on notice: the loose money and the speculation it fed had to stop. It said banks had to step up risk controls and improve cash management. And they had to do it, the bank said, by avoiding a ''stampede'' mentality.
The banks had quietly received that very message a week earlier, which set off, if not a rush for the exits, certainly widespread worry in China and financial centers around the world. 
It precipitated a cash squeeze among the banks that sent their short-term interest rates sharply higher last week. The crackdown, which appears aimed at reining in banks engaged in complex deals that involve hiding and repackaging risky loans so that regulators cannot notice them, also led to a sharp sell-off in stocks worldwide during the last week. Investors feared it might further slow the Chinese economy.
China, the world's second-largest economy after the United States, has a huge influence on the world economy so the actions of its central bank are closely watched across the globe. But its financial and banking system remains opaque to Chinese and foreigners alike. Within the government's own warnings about lending lies its dilemma: it needs to control where money is being lent at the same time it wants to reform a banking system that has grown dependent on government direction.
''The government knows some banks are doing things that aren't prudent,'' says Yukon Huang, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. ''Some of them are taking easy money and putting it in Ponzi schemes. The government is saying, 'Don't do that any more. And don't count on the government to bail you out.' ''
Li Keqiang, China's prime minister, who took office last March, has promised a more market-oriented approach to managing the economy. And analysts say his economic advisers are pressing to reorganize the economy in a way that will allow it to respond better to market forces.
But to put such reforms in place, the new government is going to have to take on powerful state-run companies and interest groups that sometimes resist pressure from the center or turn to allies in the central leadership who block such moves.
The government's target is the sharp and potentially dangerous rise in the so-called shadow banking. Banks borrow at the low interbank rate, then lend to trust companies and smaller banks who in turn make riskier loans. The fear among some analysts is that the vast amount of bad debt and hidden liabilities the shadow banking system masks could start sinking banks. Those excesses could start a chain of other economic setbacks.
Most economists say China's financial system is not facing huge systemic risks, and that growth could even come in at 7 percent, which would still make it the world's fastest-growing major economy. But there are mounting concerns here that the good times could be over partly because the banking sector is hiding piles of bad debt.
The Chinese government has the policy tools to deal with a crisis, including huge foreign exchange reserves and the ability to force state banks to lend in a time of crisis. The People's Bank of China is not an independent institution, like many central banks in major economies are; it reports to the central government.
But after years of pumping money into the economy, the central bank can see signs of diminishing returns. Banks lent a huge amount of money in the first half of this year, and yet growth has been tepid. Manufacturing has begun to contract, according to a recent survey, and banks seem desperate for more cash.
Last Friday, Fitch Ratings said in a report that less money in the market for interbank loans could hamper some banks from making payouts when high-interest financial instruments for China's rich,called wealth management products, mature later this month.
Fitch said about $244 billion would come due later this month and that the effort to make the payout could send short-term borrowing rates even higher.
Wall Street analysts are now revising their economic growth forecasts downward and warning that the Chinese central bank's refusal to alleviate commercial banks' cash shortages by pumping more money into the economy could lead some smaller banks to default.
They warn of other dangers facing China's economic policy makers. If the property market stumbles, some analysts fear that could wallop the broader economy.
China's exports, long a strength, had been buoyant early in the year, according to official statistics. But some analysts have questioned whether trade statistics were being manipulated by speculators pretending to sell goods overseas in order to bring money into the country that they would then use to speculate in the financial markets.
The most recent export figures have been less robust, possibly hurt by China's currency, the renminbi, which has strengthened over the last year against the dollar and the Japanese yen.
The prime minister and his economic team are trying to move swiftly to guard against a crisis down the road, after years of loose credit and heavy spending on manufacturing, property and infrastructure. But if they press too hard, analysts say, an already weakening economy could lock up, and see growth dip below 7 percent, starting even more trouble with the banking sector.
''To push through their reforms I think Li Keqiang and Xi Jinping are willing to accept lower growth,'' says Nicholas Lardy, an expert on China's economy at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.
Last Friday, a large group of bankers and entrepreneurs surveyed by the central bank said their confidence in the country's macroeconomic conditions was weakening.
Loan demand was falling, said Xiang Songzuo, chief economist of the Agricultural Bank of China, according to the English language China Daily.
''Even a monetary easing is not going to solve the problem,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Big Law's Troubling Trajectory

BYLINE: By STEVEN J. HARPER. 
Steven J. Harper, a former partner at the law firm Kirkland & Ellis and an adjunct professor at Northwestern University, is the author, most recently, of ''The Lawyer Bubble: A Profession in Crisis.''

 BODY:
WILMETTE, Ill. -- ''THIS is not about cost-cutting but about the future of the firm and strategically positioning us for the next five years,'' said Weil, Gotshal & Manges's executive chairman, Barry Wolf. He announced layoffs on Monday of 60 associates and 110 staff members, as well as compensation reductions for roughly 10 percent of the firm's partners. It's also about something else: the unfortunate evolution of the profession.
This time really is different. The last significant round of law firm layoffs came on a single day in February 2009 as the Great Recession deepened. Six major firms around the country announced the layoffs of close to 1,000 lawyers and staff members on what became known as ''Bloody Thursday.'' In that month alone, some 2,000 lawyers and staff members lost their jobs. But in those dark moments, the economy was losing 750,000 jobs a month and widespread fears of another Great Depression were not frivolous. 
The carnage of 2009 seemed to be an unprecedented one-time event.
No such overarching climate for rationalizations exists today. In fact, partners in the nation's largest firms are doing better than ever. With more than 1,200 lawyers in 21 offices throughout the world, Weil, Gotshal & Manges had average partner profits exceeding $2.2 million in 2012, according to American Lawyer. Last year, the firm ranked ninth on the American Lawyer A-list -- reflecting a combination of economic performance, lawyer diversity, associate satisfaction and pro bono achievement to which all big firms aspire. All of that makes its recent actions even more startling, if not disconcerting, to anyone who worries about the profession's trajectory.
In a sense, Weil simply confirms what most lawyers already know: big-firm practice has become just another business. Most readers might react to Weil's staggering partner incomes by asking why $2 million plus a year -- or even half that -- isn't enough. It's a fair question. Ask equity partners in any big firm whether as law students they ever dreamed of making the money they now earn. Anyone answering honestly would give a resounding ''No.'' College students whose principal career objective was wealth typically headed into business; law school attracted those with different ambitions. After all, the legal profession was supposed to be something special.
Not anymore. Most big firms are now following the leads of their corporate clients, which run businesses with one eye on the current stock price while maximizing quarterly earnings. But that can be an unforgiving world. Weil's enormous reported profits for 2012 included a downward arrow because they represented an 8 percent drop from 2011, in part because of expensive hires. However unjustified, even a single year of relatively minor decline can create concerns. Cutting costs through layoffs and getting more billable hours out of the survivors has become a typical, businesslike response.
Paradoxically, firms also pursue a growth agenda in the midst of such downsizing. The current demand for high-end legal services is flat, so many firm leaders use high profits to attract rainmakers from elsewhere. The effort to buy top-line revenues by acquiring partners with portable books of business has thrown most big law firms into a lateral hiring frenzy. In that contest, Weil recently lost some talent, but it has acquired even more -- recruiting 20 new lateral partners in 2012 and 18 in 2011. (The firm had 195 equity partners at the end of 2012.) Ironically, recent studies demonstrate -- and about 40 percent of managing partners admit -- that lateral hiring usually is not profitable for the firms that do it. Yet the expensive strategy remains pervasive. The mantra that ''bigger must be better'' prevails in the face of contrary data.
But perhaps the most ominous aspect of Weil's action touches those who are beginning their legal careers, especially if other firms follow its lead.
June is the heart of the big-law-firm recruiting experience. Top students from the best schools are getting larger paychecks than they have ever seen as they spend the summer working as would-be associates. Partners are putting on their best faces to impress the next generation's top prospects before they return to their campuses and, hopefully, say nice things about the law firms that employed them for the summer. In the midst of this celebratory period, Weil dropped a sobering bomb that sends this message: You may be an associate here today; tomorrow you could be gone.
Such a summer blast is remarkable. For instance, the ill-fated Dewey & LeBoeuf announced significant associate layoffs during the recruiting off-season in early 2012, months before summer associates were scheduled to arrive. (By late May, the firm was in bankruptcy.)
Weil's leaders probably considered the public relations and recruiting consequences of their dramatic midsummer purge. If so, they might have taken comfort in some numbers. Last week, the National Associate for Law Placement announced that large law firms of more than 500 lawyers hired 3,600 new associates in 2012 -- more than in 2011 but still far below the 5,100 new hires in 2009. Some students at top-20 law schools aren't getting big-firm jobs that were once automatic for most of their predecessors. The overall market is even more dismal. In 2012, law schools graduated a record number of new lawyers -- more than 46,000. About half of them got long-term, full-time jobs requiring a legal degree.
It comes down to this: firm leaders know that regardless of how they treat young lawyers, numerous replacements wait for their turns in the increasingly fragile big-law barrel. Meanwhile, the profession's existential crisis continues as intergenerational antagonisms fester. Except for the relatively few partners at the top, this can't end well.

HEADLINE: From 'No' to 'Go'

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
LONDON -- Brazilians have an expression, ''Vai acabar em pizza.'' Something that ends in pizza is something that ends in a big zero, zilch, nothing. The phrase is commonly used for the predictable conclusion of judicial investigations of the white-collar crime practiced with impunity by rich folk in Brazil.
Impunity is one of the issues driving mass protests across Brazil that began with anger over fare hikes. A pattern has emerged. From Sidi Bouzid in Tunisia -- where a squabble over a fruit-and-vegetable cart ignited the Arab Spring -- to Istanbul -- where an uprising was triggered by plans to build a mall over a city park -- these eruptions with hashtags share characteristics: 
Small spark, large conflagration; disoriented leader, leaderless movement; vertical rigid state power, flat nimble protests; harsh authority, impish youth; force of the state, flexibility of Facebook; police crackdowns, agile regroupings; conspiracy charges, humorous ripostes. Fidel Castro spent years in the Sierra Maestra preparing his revolution. Twitter has dispensed with that.
Or has it? A core issue with these social-media driven movements is, in the words of Zeynep Tufekci, an assistant professor in the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina, ''How do you get from a 'No' to a 'Go?'''
In other words the eruptions whose shared slogan might be ''Enough is enough!'' are good at protest and resistance but much less good at defining objectives -- whether political, social or economic -- and organizing to attain them. They thrill in the negative. They tend to fizzle in the affirmative.
They lack leaders. There is no truck with a microphone. Agendas read like a Twitter timeline -- fascinating but diffuse -- rather than coherent expressions of a goal. There is no Martin Luther King or Nelson Mandela -- or Tancredo Neves and Lula (among others) leading the fight for Brazilian democracy three decades ago.
As Wael Ghonim, the former Google executive who emerged as a significant, but not defining, figure of the Egyptian revolution, once put it on 60 Minutes, ''Our revolution is like Wikipedia, O.K.? Everyone is contributing content; you don't know the names of the people contributing the content.''
Of course, from Tunis to Cairo there was a clear objective: the ousting of a hated despot. It was only after this unifying goal was accomplished that the weaknesses of a leaderless movement became apparent and groups that did boast organization -- like the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt or Ennahda in Tunisia -- filled the vacuum. They have not, however, been able to satisfy the thirst of their nations for renewal.
In Turkey, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan wanted a mall over the Gezi city park. The tweet went out with the hashtag #direngezi -- Resist Gezi! Erdogan has befriended an oligarch, favored him with the usual lucrative networks, and this oligarch owns a popular chain of steak restaurants. Hashtag #direnentrecote -- Resist entrecte!
The movement morphed into a lot of things by the time police drove out the occupiers of Gezi. It was about the autocratic turn of a conservative leader in power for 11 years. It was about Erdogan's invasion of Turks' personal lives, the way he calls them alcoholics if they drink, or advises them not to kiss on the subway, or comments on their dress. He is not the Sultan!
It was about his deadening control of the media, and the way his Justice and Development Party, having opened Turkey up, now sees enemies everywhere. It was about how Erdogan's push against the secular Turkey of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk has overshot: If there is no reason why a religious young woman should not attend college wearing a veil, equally there is no reason for the ruling A.K.P. politicians to rant about Muslim women in bikinis. Enough is enough!
In Brazil the ire is more directed at the entire political class than President Dilma Rousseff herself. It is about the way politicians live like mandarins with immense privilege, their vote-buying scandals and their lack of accountability. It is about the skewed use of resources: more than $13 billion on new stadiums and preparations for the 2014 World Cup while basic health and education and transportation needs remain unmet. It is about police violence when acquiescence to injustice ends.
These movements have erupted in two of the major emergent powers of the 21st century where economies have been growing fast. I do not think this is a coincidence. Ordinary Turks and Brazilians, particularly young people, are reacting to a feeling of global forces beyond their control; they are reminding leaders swept up in boom times of the need for consultation and accountability; they are telling the hyper-connected financiers who have profited most that social justice -- society itself -- matters. By gathering, by occupying, they are asserting a shared humanity against atomizing development and the globalized shopping mall.
Can they get from ''No'' to ''Go''? It will take organization on a scale not yet seen, decisions on objectives and, yes, leaders. But I do not see it all ending in pizza. From Tunis to Istanbul, from Cairo to So Paulo, something essential has already happened. Fear has fallen. That in itself is a game-changer.

Korean institute tops list of younger universities
The Pohang University of Science and Technology in South Korea has once again topped the cole Polytechnique Fdrale of Lausanne in Switzerland to retain the top spot in The Times Higher Education ''100 Under 50'' ranking, which lists institutions that are less than a half-century old.
The Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology; the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology; the University of California, Irvine; Maastricht University in the Netherlands; the University of York in Britain; Nanyang Technological University in Singapore; Universit Pierre et Marie Curie in Paris and Universit Paris-Sud rounded out the top 10, which was published last Wednesday. 
''The traditional elite cannot afford to coast on centuries of history and tradition, or rely too heavily on reputation -- there is a new breed of dynamic universities emerging quickly and visibly to challenge for their crowns,'' Phil Baty, editor of the Times Higher Education rankings, said in a statement. He added that with emerging universities from East Asia establishing themselves as powerhouses, ''the competition for future world dominance in higher education and research is wide open.''
Britain had the most universities in the top 100 (18), followed by Australia (13) and the United States (8). Taiwan had the most institutions of any Asian state (5). -- CALVIN YANG
Many feel 'less welcome' under British migrant cap
About half of non-European students in Britain said that a government immigration cap made them feel ''less welcome,'' according to research released Monday by Regent's University London, a private, nonprofit institution. The report referred to a 2011 announcement that Britain meant to reduce annual migration by non-E.U. citizens to 100,000 from 242,000 by 2015.
In a poll conducted by YouthSight, a research agency, 52 percent of 500 surveyed non-E.U. students said that immigration policy reflected negatively on how welcome they felt in Britain. The report also found that these students were ''highly segregated'' from the general student body, with 40 percent saying that they spent most of their time with others from the same country.
However, non-E.U. students otherwise had positive views on British education: 94 percent said that U.K. universities were highly respected internationally; 83 percent were happy with the quality of their courses; and 81 percent approved of their teachers. -- JOYCE LAU
Apple to provide iPads to Los Angeles schools
Apple has announced a $30 million deal to introduce iPads across the United States' second-largest public school system, after the Los Angeles Board of Education approved an initiative last Tuesday to equip its students with the tablet.
The program will be rolled out in phases, beginning with 47 schools in August. According to a statement by the Los Angeles United School District, the aim is to provide every student with an iPad by 2014.
It said that the Apple device was rated highly by a panel that included teachers and students. The iPads will be pre-loaded with educational apps, including the Pearson Common Core System of Courses. -- CALVIN YANG
China revamps system to gauge schools' quality
The Chinese Ministry of Education will implement a new system to gauge the quality of its primary and secondary schools, Xinhua, the state news agency, reported last week.
The ministry said it based its new system on the Program For International Student Assessment, a worldwide testing system for 15-year-olds commonly known as PISA, which is run by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. A trial run of the new Chinese system has been carried out in Shanghai.
Xinhua quoted Zheng Fuzhi, a ministry official, as saying that the new system would go beyond the current practice of basing evaluations only on test scores and admissions rates. -- JOYCE LAU
I.M.F. to offer online courses on finances through edX
The International Monetary Fund said last week that it would offer free financial courses in collaboration with edX, the online learning platform started by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Two pilot courses, one on financial policies and the other on debt sustainability, will be offered to government officials in the coming months, and to the general public in 2014.
The I.M.F. is aiming to reach a wider audience at a lower cost, in a departure from its current model, in which finance and banking officials travel to training centers to attend workshops. It joins more than 20 universities in working with edX. -- YENNI KWOK
Graduating seniors unsure of studies, counselors say
Only about half of guidance counselors at international schools feel that their graduating seniors have a clear idea of what they want to study, according to a report released last week by IE University in Spain.
The survey, which included responses from more than 200 counselors, found that the most popular field of study among high school seniors in Europe and Asia was business management. North American students were more likely to choose the liberal arts, and Middle Eastern students engineering.
English, Spanish, French and German were the most desired languages, followed closely by Chinese, although this result was possibly a reflection of the study's demographic; slightly more than half of the queried schools were based in Europe, with the other half split between the Americas, Asia and the Middle East. -- JOYCE LAU

HEADLINE: Mass Layoffs at a Top-Flight Law Firm

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
Layoffs are a brutal reality of corporate America. During fallow periods, publicly traded companies, including the big banks, routinely cull their ranks. The country's largest law firms, by contrast, have historically taken a kinder, gentler approach, rarely firing employees en masse.
The news on Monday that Weil, Gotshal & Manges, among the nation's most prestigious and profitable law firms, was laying off a large number of lawyers and support staff while also reducing the pay of some of its partners, sent shock waves through the industry and underscored the financial difficulties facing the legal profession.
Sixty junior lawyers, known at firms as associates, lost their jobs. That amounts to roughly 7 percent of Weil's associates. Annual compensation will be reduced for roughly 30 of the firm's 300 partners, in many cases by hundreds of thousands of dollars. And 110 non-lawyers -- roughly half of them secretaries -- were let go.
The leadership of Weil, a New York-based firm of 1,200 lawyers that counts General Electric and Sanofi as marquee clients and handled the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, informed its employees Monday morning about the reductions. 
''While we have been able to avoid these actions in the past, and it is very painful from a human perspective, the management committee believes that these actions are essential now to enable our firm to continue to excel and retain its historic profitability in the new normal,'' Barry M. Wolf, Weil's executive partner, wrote in a firmwide e-mail.
The ''new normal,'' in the view of Weil's management and echoed by legal industry experts, is that the market for high-end legal services is continuing to shrink. Dan DiPietro, chairman of the law firm group at Citi Private Bank, said he believed that the profession could experience a wave of job cuts. He said that there were too many lawyers at the country's largest firms, estimating the excess capacity at as much as 10 percent of the lawyer population.
''My guess is that a good number of firms have been thinking about right-sizing and waiting for someone to provide them cover and we'll see more of these moves,'' Mr. DiPietro said. ''As difficult as layoffs are, it seems that they will be necessary for some firms to get in sync with the current market dynamics.''
Those market dynamics have shifted starkly from the boom years leading up to the financial crisis. Pre-2008, profitability exploded and the number of lawyers grew at the country's top firms as demand increased about 4 percent a year. But demand has been flat to down for the last five years, according to several industry reports, and shows little sign of picking up.
At Weil, whose partners make, on average, about $2.2 million a year, the situation is unique. During the depths of the downturn, the firm avoided the layoffs that some other firms were forced to make. That was largely because of the firm's pre-eminent bankruptcy practice, which advised both General Motors and Lehman on their Chapter 11 filings. Those assignments, particularly Lehman, generated hundreds of millions of dollars in fees, not only in bankruptcy work, but also from the reams of litigation that flowed from them.
In an interview last week, Mr. Wolf said that Weil's leaders thought that as the crisis-related assignments wound down and the economy recovered, the firm would see a pickup in its ''transactional business,'' the lucrative work of advising corporations and private equity firms on acquisitions, as well as performing legal work for stock and bond offerings. But transactional activity at Weil remains soft and has not returned to anywhere near pre-2008 levels.
Nevertheless, the firm has performed well relative to its peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters. In 2012, Weil was ranked No. 1 in private equity representations globally. It ranked No. 2 in domestic mergers and acquisitions last year and has maintained that position in 2013, advising on deals like the American Airlines merger with US Airways. Still, Mr. Wolf said, there was not enough work to keep Weil's army of lawyers sufficiently busy.
''Our market share has been improving, but the market has been shrinking,'' Mr. Wolf said.
Mr. Wolf, a corporate lawyer who joined Weil in 1984 straight out of law school, said that while the decision to cut associates and staff was personally distressing for him and the management committee, there was little disagreement that it was the right one.
''We believe that this not just a cycle but that the supply-demand balance is out of whack across the industry,'' he said. ''If we thought this was a cycle and our business was going to pick up meaningfully next year, we would not be doing this.''
Monday was a grim day at Weil, with partners informing associates of their dismissals in one-on-one meetings. Each gets six months of severance. Partners subject to salary reductions have already been informed by firm management. (There are no partner cuts because under Weil's partnership agreement, partners can be fired only for cause.)
The mass layoffs are the first in the 82-year history of Weil, which has 21 offices worldwide and headquarters in the General Motors building, one of New York's most coveted business addresses. Last year, the firm posted revenue of about $1.2 billion, and its profits per partner ranked 17th of all firms nationally.
In Monday's e-mail, Weil said it was taking the action ''from a position of strength.'' It said that it had zero debt and a fully financed pension plan with more than $500 million in assets. It also noted that its partners did not have long-term compensation guarantees.
By listing those attributes, Weil appeared to be pre-emptively addressing comparisons to Dewey & LeBoeuf, a firm of a similar size that dissolved last year. Dewey collapsed after disappointing profits and a heavy debt load forced it to slash partners' salaries. Many Dewey partners had multiyear, multimillion-dollar contracts. When they did not get paid their guarantee, they fled, crippling the firm.
Now, a year after Dewey's demise, most industry specialists view the firm as an outlier, a victim of gross financial mismanagement. Still, some of Dewey's problems partly derived from the same industry trends facing successful firms like Weil.
Among the main factors hurting law firm profitability is that corporate clients have become stingy. Until recently, pricing pressure barely existed for premium legal services. Decades ago, clients would receive a bill with only a lump sum and the statement ''for professional services rendered.''
But today, big corporations, facing pressures of their own, have clamped down on legal expenses. They have beefed up their in-house legal staffs and perform much of the work themselves. They are demanding that for routine assignments like document discovery, work be sent to outsourcing firms and contract lawyers rather than given to expensive associates. And they ask for discounts or capped fees at places like Weil, which charge more than $1,000 an hour for some partners' work.
Steven J. Harper, a retired partner at Kirkland & Ellis and author of ''The Lawyer Bubble: A Profession in Crisis'' (Basic Books, 2013), said that Weil's move highlighted the inexorable long-term trend: big firm partnerships were now nothing more than bottom-line, profit-maximizing businesses.
Profits per partner -- a statistic highlighted annually in the closely watched American Lawyer magazine rankings -- have become an unhealthy obsession, Mr. Harper said. Driving this fixation is the frenzied lateral hiring market, in which firms are poaching lawyers with big books of business from rivals. Firms fear that if profitability wanes, they will lose their stars.
''The culture at most of these large law firms is that you must maintain astronomical levels of partner earnings in order to keep your top talent,'' Mr. Harper said. ''Cutting staff is one way to do that.''
Mr. Wolf of Weil said that while layoffs would help the firm's profits, the move was not motivated by reducing expenses to enrich partners.
''This is not about cost-cutting but about the future of the firm and strategically positioning us for the next five years,'' Mr. Wolf said.
Several industry experts applauded the move. Peter Zeughauser, a law firm consultant, said that many firms were in denial about slack demand, and Weil's cutbacks could pressure them into getting leaner.
''We have been telling our clients about these economic realities for some time,'' Mr. Zeughauser said. ''Weil is a bellwether firm, and this will be a real wake-up call.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Stocks Sag on Wall Street

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks fell sharply Monday on Wall Street on concerns that the Federal Reserve's stimulus may be drawing to a close and a cash squeeze in China could further slow growth. 
At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was off 139.84, or 0.9 percent, to 14,659.56. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 1.2 percent, and the Nasdaq composite fell 1.1 percent.
Earlier in the session, the Dow was down more than 200 points.
European and Asian shares also slumped.
Banking shares in China tumbled to their biggest daily loss in almost four years after the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, said lenders needed to do a better job of managing their cash and loans. The central bank is trying to move China, the world's second largest economy, away from credit-driven investment.
The S.&P. 500 has fallen 3.5 percent in June, and is on track for its worst monthly performance since May 2012.
''We are starting to see that follow through in Asia, which is all part of the broader narrative -- the focus on a lack of stimulus, a creeping higher in rates and the potential impact for less liquidity globally,'' said Peter Kenny, chief market strategist at Knight Capital in Jersey City. ''This underscores the power and the importance of Fed policy to global central banking.''
The shift out of assets that have benefited most from cheap money has been sharpest in the United States debt market, where yields on 10-year Treasury notes hit 2.6 percent on Monday, its highest level since August 2011.
This rise in rates and the brighter outlook for the American economy, which was behind the Fed's decision, has favored the dollar against most major currencies. The dollar index was up 0.3 percent at 82.57 points on Monday, building on last week's 2.2 percent rally, its biggest weekly gain in 19 months.
Against the yen, the dollar was down 0.1 percent to 97.80 yen, while euro fell 0.2 percent to $1.3099, a level not seen since June 6.
Tenet Healthcare, a hospital operator, said it would buy smaller rival Vanguard Health Systems for $4.3 billion, or $21 per share including debt, to expand into new geographies. Vanguard shares jumped 67 percent and Tenet gained 4.5 percent.
Rising interest rates served to dent gold prices, weighing on mining stocks, while other commodities were also pressured by strength in the dollar.
Freeport McMoRan Copper and Gold has restarted some operations at the world's second-biggest copper mine after receiving approval from the Indonesian government. Freeport shares shed 4.8 percent.
European equity markets remained weak despite data showing German business morale picking up for a second straight month in June, pointing to a slow recovery for Europe's largest economy. The Euro Stoxx 50 of euro zone blue chips closed down 1.5 percent, and the FTSE 100 in London lost 1.4 percent.

HEADLINE: Clues in the Cycle of Suicide

BYLINE: By DAVID DOBBS

 BODY:
On average, about 700 Americans kill themselves each week -- but in the fine-weather weeks of May and June, the toll rises closer to 800, sometimes higher. Every year, suicide peaks with the tulips and lilacs -- increasing roughly 15 percent over the annual average to create one of psychiatry's most consistent epidemiological patterns. It may seem perverse that the period of spring and early summer, as the psychologist Kay Redfield Jamison puts it in her splendid book ''Night Falls Fast,'' should contain ''a capacity for self-murder that winter less often has.'' Yet it does.
This grim spring growth confounds conventional belief that suicides peak in winter. It also confounds researchers -- and fascinates them. As they discover more angles into the biology of mood and behavior, they are finding new clues about why suicides rise with the sun's arc. They hope solving this puzzle will help us better understand why people commit suicide at all -- and perhaps reduce the numbers year-round. 
This effort takes an extra urgency from what Dr. Adam Kaplin, a psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins University, calls a ''suicide epidemic'' -- a sharp increase in both absolute and per-capita rates since the recession that began in 2007, particularly among the middle-aged. More than 38,000 people committed suicide in the United States in 2010 -- a 16.5 percent jump from the 32,600 suicides five years before, and a new high. The stakes involved in figuring out the dynamics of self-murder seem only to rise with time.
The spring surge in suicides is actually the largest of a few oscillations throughout the year. After dropping to an annual low in February (October in the southern hemisphere), rates climb sharply through spring; fall slowly in summer; show a slight rise, according to some studies, in fall; and then begin a steep winter drop. The spring peak generally runs 10 to 25 percent above the yearly average and 20 to 50 percent above the February low.
The spring increase was first noticed in 19th-century Europe. Many studies, some examining data hundreds of years back, have documented it since. But explaining it has proved difficult, primarily because of suicide's extreme complexity.
''There's no one reason that people do it,'' said Nadine Kaslow, a research psychologist at Emory University. Rather, she says, people usually commit suicide because personal, social-system and environmental factors combine to push them to a new place of energized despair.
In this view, spring somehow adds weight to an already unbearable load. But how?
One traditional candidate, favored by both Dr. Jamison and Dr. Kaslow, is the ''broken promise effect'' -- the sometimes crushing disappointment that spring fails to bring the relief the sufferer has hoped for.
In addition, psychiatrists have long observed that for patients with bipolar disorder and depression, spring can create a manic agitation that amplifies the risk of suicide -- agitation that has long shown itself in a rising rate of hospitalizations for suicide attempts and for manic or schizophrenic episodes in spring and summer.
Researchers have long suspected that this may be tied to the springtime drop in the sleep-friendly hormone melatonin, a reduction that energizes us for spring's longer days but may sometimes help generate dangerous agitation. Yet that link, like many, remains elusive.
In the past decade or so, some researchers have increasingly focused on another candidate: an apparently intimate relationship between suicide and inflammation.
Dr. Kaplin studies depression in patients with multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune inflammatory disease. In M.S., he says, depression and inflammation feed each other: Even after accounting for the psychological effects of any serious illness, M.S. heightens depression risk, and depression amplifies the inflammation central to the disease's central pathologies.
Driving this relationship, Dr. Kaplin suspects, are immune-system chemical messengers called cytokines. Some cytokines increase inflammation, while others curb it.
Inflammatory cytokines play crucial roles in fighting infection, but they can also cause problems. When people with hepatitis C are given the cytokine interferon to help fight the infection, for instance, up to 40 percent become depressed and one in 50 attempt suicide. Other studies suggest that inflammatory cytokine activity reduces levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin and halts the growth of new brain cells -- two hallmarks of depression.
If inflammation heightens the risk of depression, how might that lead to a spring surge in suicide?
Dr. Kaplin and others point to several possibilities -- ''all speculative,'' he says, not findings to act on but clues to follow. In every case, the suggested risk comes not from a direct effect but from an additional sensitivity to inflammation that could be a final straw or irritant.
One possibility is that many people enter spring sensitized to inflammation by late-winter battles with seasonal infections like colds and flu.
A second possibility involves tree pollen. Dr. Teodor T. Postolache, a psychiatrist at the University of Maryland, believes that large amounts of it may cause cytokine-driven inflammatory responses. A study he did links high spring tree pollen counts with high seasonal suicide rates; another examined the brains of 34 suicide victims and found gene-expression patterns consistent with cytokine-driven inflammation.
Yet another possibility involves vitamin D. The low levels caused by lack of sunlight in the winter are thought to lead to inflammation; one recent study tentatively suggested a link to suicide. Dr. Kaplin thus wonders if people already at risk for suicide may increase their risk if they enter spring with inflammatory systems sensitized by vitamin D deficiencies.
''The answer to this puzzle is probably some form of 'all of the above,' '' he said.
Even if these inflammatory factors prove out, they will be just some among many -- mood disorders, divorce, job loss, grief, trauma -- that fertilize spring's darkest bloom. But the more factors researchers can identify, the better we can understand not just the spring surge but the larger mysteries of suicide.
Still, if researchers are ever to identify the seasonal culprits, they may need to hurry. One of the most intriguing findings in the seasonality of suicide is that this ancient pattern appears to be fading -- possibly because we all spend more time indoors.
A study of Switzerland's well-kept monthly suicide records between 1880 and 2000, for instance, showed the spring/summer curve growing flatter with each successive 30-year period. Like too many lives lost as we struggle to comprehend suicide, this spring surge may slip away before we can fully glean its unique offerings.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Shaping A Plaza's Next Century

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
In 1916 Grand Army Plaza opened at the southeast corner of Central Park, designed by Carrre & Hastings as a grand outdoor room in the manner of a French garden -- New York's version of the Place de la Concorde in Paris.
Designated a landmark in 1974 and considered by many to be one of the most formal public spaces in the city, the plaza has nonetheless fallen into disrepair -- its bluestone surface cracked, the gilded statue of Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman eroded. 
Now the Central Park Conservancy is proposing a $2 million restoration of the plaza's trees and pavement. The work planned is what that nonprofit organization says it can afford, having raised $1.5 million.
But preservationists and others say the plan does not go far enough, and that the plaza should undergo a complete overhaul that restores historical details like the original lights, benches, balustrades and columns, which have been changed or removed over the years.
On Monday, after hearing emphatic testimony from various advocates, the city's Public Design Commission urged the conservancy to go back to the drawing board and return with a more ambitious plan.
In their questioning at Monday's hearing, commission members and preservationists signaled that they were not convinced of the conservancy's financial limitations -- particularly in light of the $100 million gift it received last year from the hedge fund manager John A. Paulson.
James S. Polshek, a commission member and architect, noted that the plaza -- near the Plaza Hotel -- is midway between the New York Public Library at 42d Street, which is named after Stephen A. Schwarzman, and the David H. Koch Theater at Lincoln Center. ''I can't imagine those two chaps'' would not be moved to contribute, Mr. Polshek said.
''This is a piddling amount of money -- nobody can claim the city is in a slump,'' Mr. Polshek said. ''We really shouldn't settle for halfway. If it's another five or six million, that's not an adequate excuse.''
The Beaux-Arts plaza is ''perhaps the single most historically significant surviving work of landscape architecture from the City Beautiful era in New York City,'' said Michael Gotkin, a preservationist, referring to the architectural and urban-planning movement from the 1890s and 1900s that believed attractive buildings could uplift the downtrodden.
But Guy Nordenson, another member, suggested that the conservancy ''take a step back'' and consider how the plaza could be reimagined given that nearly a century has passed.
''Is it best to go back or is there an adaptation of this that is more appropriate today?'' he said. ''Maybe you could work with a landscape architect who could shake up the discussions. This is neither here nor there, and not convincing.''
Landmark West!, a preservation advocacy group, argued that the proposed reconstruction ''merely seeks to restore the plaza largely as is -- compounding the mistakes, accretions and loss of historic fabric over the past 100 years,'' adding that ''the plaza deserves to be restored to its original glory as a public outdoor gathering place.''
The Institute of Classical Architecture & Art implored the commission to remember the plaza's importance as one of the city's leading crossroads. ''The gateway thrusts into the fabled precincts of Fifth Avenue's prime shopping mecca across which even Holden Caulfield drunkenly traversed in search of the park's pond to discover where the ducks go in winter,'' said the institute's president, Paul Gunther, in his testimony. ''Now is the time to do it right.''
Christopher J. Nolan, a vice president at the conservancy, who presented the plan to the commission on Monday, said he would return with a more comprehensive final proposal but that the feasibility of such a master plan would depend on city or private contributions.
''It's finding the money to put the balustrade back,'' Mr. Nolan said in an interview after the hearing.
Mr. Nolan added that recreating the balustrade in granite would cost an additional $3 million to $4 million. He also said that the conservancy would need to raise money for the plaza's south side in five to 10 years, which features the Pulitzer Fountain, designed in the Italian Renaissance tradition.
All agree that the plaza needs improvements.
''I fear this is a restoration of mistakes, instead of a removal of those mistakes,'' said Susan Nial, an Upper West Side resident, in her testimony.
In 1990 the Landmarks Preservation Commission approved a full restoration for the plaza that was only partly realized because of budget shortfalls and the economic recession of the early '90s.
The use of the plaza is ''intense,'' Mr. Nolan said, noting how many passers-by, horse-drawn carriages, street performers and others frequent the area.
On Monday the design commission voted to approve the conservancy's proposal ''on a preliminary basis contingent on seeing a comprehensive plan.''
The commission is a panel of art experts and others whose members review permanent works of art, architecture and landscape architecture proposed for city-owned property.
After the hearing Mr. Nolan said the conservancy accepted this mandate. ''It's a reasonable response,'' he said. ''If funding could be secured, likely our intention would be to stick to that original plan, which we'll consider in our final proposal.''
Mr. Polshek remained optimistic that the money could be raised among the city's rich and famous -- like the real estate developers Donald J. Trump and Larry A. Silverstein. ''You could name the columns,'' he suggested. ''You could have a Trump column and a Silverstein column. It's obscene, but they'll be gone and the columns will be here.''

HEADLINE: Science Events: Magic Illusions and the Music of Particles

BYLINE: By JASCHA HOFFMAN

 BODY:
Coming events and reading matter at the intersection of science and culture.
CONTEST
Iron Science Teacher Competition. Exploratorium, Pier 15, San Francisco. June 28 and July 12 at noon. Included with museum admission ($25 adult, $19 students/teachers). (Live webcast.)
In the cult Japanese television show ''Iron Chef,'' frantic cooks have an hour to whip up a meal around a secret ingredient like river eel or asparagus. At this competition at the San Francisco Exploratorium, science teachers will face a similar trial. Before a live audience, and with running commentary, they must transform everyday items into eye-popping science lessons. Past years' ingredients have included paper clips, light bulbs, chalk, leaves and eggs. ''It makes science more approachable to see it in everyday objects,'' said Linda Shore, who directs the museum's Teacher Institute, which hosts the competition. When money is scarce, cheap demonstrations also allow instructors to, as one teacher put it, ''teach the $10 million state science standards on a $10 budget.'' 
SOUND
Collide@CERN. Public lecture by Bill Fontana. Globe of Science and Innovation, CERN, Switzerland. July 4 at 7 p.m. (Live webcast.)
For 30 years the sound sculptor Bill Fontana has transformed structures like the Golden Gate Bridge and the Eiffel Tower into enormous sound installations. What could he do with the world's largest particle accelerator? We're about to find out as Mr. Fontana begins his residency at CERN, the European physics lab that runs the Large Hadron Collider. At a lecture on the first anniversary of the announcement of a particle believed to be the Higgs boson, Mr. Fontana will play recordings he gathered last winter of particle-accelerating machines. (This summer, with the accelerator turned off, he will echo these sounds through the 17-mile tunnel.) The young cosmologist Subodh Patil, chosen as Mr. Fontana's ''inspiration partner,'' will also speak. ''The cosmic microwave background can be thought of as the echo of the Big Bang that we're still 'hearing,''' Dr. Patil wrote in an e-mail. ''My recent work has focused on understanding how variations in the speed of sound during inflation imprints distinct overtones on the echo.''
BOOK
Touching a Nerve: The Self as Brain, by Patricia S. Churchland. Norton. 304 pages. $26.95.
''You cannot understand the mind without understanding how the brain works,'' writes the philosopher Patricia S. Churchland in this marvelous book, which uses recent findings from neuroscience and evolution to illuminate deep questions about human nature. After early chapters debunking the soul and afterlife, Dr. Churchland gives a nuanced account of sex, violence and morality, working up gently but ambitiously from brain chemicals to ethical norms. She predicts that consciousness, which she believes may be shared in some form by all mammals and birds, will eventually be understood by the convergence of ''a million little important results,'' not by a miraculous discovery. Throughout the book Dr. Churchland draws on episodes from her early life on a Canadian farm to illustrate her arguments. A trustworthy guide, she gives comfort not by simplifying the research but by asking the right questions.
MUSEUM
Illusion. Science Gallery. Trinity College, Dublin. Opens July 11.
COMING SOON: ILLUSION at SCIENCE GALLERY
A good magician exploits the flaws and biases of your nervous system. A new show at the Science Gallery in Dublin, curated by the psychologist Richard Wiseman, asks what the illusions might reveal about how our brains work. The show will feature a variety of deceptive artworks, many involving mirrors. In a reflective trick popular in the Victorian era, glowing letters will seem to fly from a glass bottle. In a high-tech illusion, viewers expressions are mimicked by an animal's head overlaid on their own in a digitally enhanced mirror. There will also be some good old-fashioned tricks, with a pair of neuroscientists -- Stephen Macknik and Susana Martinez-Conde, co-authors of ''Sleights of Mind'' -- on hand to explain their cognitive underpinnings. ''Illusions allow us to study how and why the brain fills in missing or ambiguous information,'' said Paul Gleeson, a researcher for the show who is also a magician.

HEADLINE: Deals in the Works Involving 2 Luxury Retailers

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED and PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
High-end fashion still has plenty of appeal for Wall Street as two of the biggest luxury brands tested their worth to the market.
The private equity owners of Neiman Marcus, one of the country's most upscale department stores and the owner of Bergdorf Goodman in Manhattan, on Monday filed for an initial public offering, the first step toward becoming a publicly traded company.
And the owner of Lord & Taylor is exploring a potential bid for Saks Inc., the 90-year-old department store chain, according to someone who had been briefed on the matter but was not authorized to speak publicly. 
Interest in both companies highlights how the market for Chanel dresses and Louis Vuitton handbags has stayed strong, despite the financial crisis. Revenue at the two retailers hovers just below 2008 levels.
The filing of Neiman Marcus has been long expected, as private equity firms are moving to sell their holdings to take advantage of relatively robust stock markets. The retailer, known for selling wares like Christian Louboutin heels and $100,000 aquatic jet packs, agreed to sell itself to the investment firms TPG Capital and Warburg Pincus more than eight years ago.
TPG and Warburg Pincus had explored selling the company before, including in 2007, but held on as the weakening economy began to roil nearly every segment of the retail industry. In a low, the company reported a $668 million loss in 2009, immediately after the financial crisis.
Neiman Marcus, which operates 41 stores around the country and other brands, has rebounded since then. On Monday, the retailer disclosed that it earned $140.1 million last year, in addition to $4.3 billion in revenue, its best fiscal year since before the 2008 crisis. For the 39 weeks that ended April 27, it made a $160.8 million profit, up 6 percent from the period last year.
The prospectus was light on other details, including how many shares the company plans to sell, at what price and on what stock exchange it will list.
Saks may find itself joining forces with other department stores with rich histories. Among the potential bidders for the chain is said to be Richard A. Baker, the shopping mall developer-turned-retailing mogul who owns both Lord & Taylor and Hudson's Bay.
Among other potential buyers or investors are Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity giant, and the Qatar Investment Authority, a sovereign wealth fund for the Middle Eastern emirate, the person briefed on the matter said.
The destinies of Neiman Marcus and Saks at one point could have been intertwined. K.K.R. approached Neiman Marcus's owners this year with a preliminary proposal to merge the retailer with Saks, a person briefed on the discussions said previously, potentially creating one of the biggest upscale department stores in the country. But TPG and Warburg Pincus were cool to the idea.
For Mr. Baker, chief executive of Hudson's Bay, the parent of The Bay stores in Canada and Lord & Taylor in the United States, an acquisition of Saks would cap an extraordinary run of deals. In 2006, at the market peak, he acquired Lord & Taylor for $1.2 billion. He later acquired Hudson's Bay and combined the two into one company, which posted about $4.1 billion in revenue during its 2012 fiscal year.
Last November, Mr. Baker orchestrated an initial public offering of Hudson's Bay, listing the company on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Adding Saks to his portfolio holds great appeal to Mr. Baker, 47, who lives in Greenwich, Conn., and whose business is based in New York. In the United States, the flagship stores of Saks and Lord & Taylor are 11 blocks apart on Fifth Avenue. And there is also growth potential in Canada for both the 43 Saks Fifth Avenue department stores, and the 66 stores that are part of its discount arm, Off 5th.
If Mr. Baker bids for Saks, presumably real estate could be part of the attraction. After acquiring Hudson's Bay, he struck a complex deal to sell the rights to leases on an underperforming division of Hudson's Bay to Target for about $1.8 billion. The deal enabled him to pay down a large amount of debt.
Mr. Baker's interest in Saks was first reported on Monday by Women's Wear Daily.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Fund-Raiser for Thompson's Mayoral Campaign Has a History of Swindling

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

 BODY:
One of the most prolific fund-raisers for the mayoral campaign of William C. Thompson Jr. is an admitted swindler who once cheated a tiny, economically depressed Wisconsin village out of $250,000 and later escaped from a federal prison.
He is also a polarizing figure in the Satmar sect of Hasidic Jews and was an instigator in a bitter, long-running dynastic struggle between two Satmar factions -- even once provoking a brawl in a Brooklyn synagogue. 
The fund-raiser, Jacob Brach, 55, gathered more than $30,000 in donations for the Thompson campaign this year, mainly from Satmar Hasidim and their business associates. He is the third largest bundler for Mr. Thompson, who has been raising money feverishly and making a strong push for Orthodox Jewish support in Brooklyn as he makes his second run for mayor.
All but one of the 180 contributions Mr. Brach collected were for $175 -- the maximum that the city will match under its voluntary campaign financing program.
Mr. Thompson has a personal connection to Mr. Brach: his father, William C. Thompson Sr., a former judge, was a lawyer for Mr. Brach's Satmar faction. The elder Mr. Thompson appeared in court, as part of the faction's legal team, on a day in 2001 when Mr. Brach was questioned about his behavior and his criminal record.
Mr. Brach has not aided Mr. Thompson exclusively. In early 2012 he bundled at least $8,000 in donations for the mayoral campaign of Bill de Blasio, records indicate.
And he is not the only Satmar raising money in the mayor's race, or the busiest. Herman Friedman, a 34-year-old Brooklyn entrepreneur, collected more than $80,000 for the campaign of Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker. Through a spokesman, Mr. Friedman said he advocated for various issues in Brooklyn but declined to provide details or be interviewed.
Mr. Brach, also known as Yossi Brach, came to the attention of law enforcement officials as early as 1988, when he was accused by Union Carbide of Canada and another Canadian company of bilking them out of more than $300,000 by offering them patent rights to a disposable toilet seat cover.
Two years later, Mr. Brach, who then lived in Kiryas Joel in Orange County, posed as the millionaire owner of a knitting mill and got officials in Randolph, Wis. (which had a population of 1,600), to lend him $250,000 to relocate there. Tommy Thompson, the governor at the time, appeared with Mr. Brach at a news conference saying the move would create hundreds of jobs.
Mr. Brach pleaded guilty to wire fraud in 1990 in the Canada and Wisconsin cases. He agreed to reimburse the fraud victims, but a federal judge, Vincent L. Broderick, rejected his request for leniency and sentenced him to 27 months in prison.
''The picture I have is a man who develops schemes to enrich himself at the expense of others, schemes which are elaborate and which are drenched in fraud,'' the judge said. ''You have been engaging in a way of life that involves deceiving and defrauding people on quite a sophisticated level.''
A year later, Mr. Brach obtained a one-day medical pass from his minimum-security prison and did not return. Arrested in March 1992, he received an additional 10-month sentence.
In 2002, he was charged in Florida with securities and telecommunications fraud, accused of selling $25,000 in fake stock in an Internet company to a retired police chief who was dying of cancer. Prosecutors dropped the case after Mr. Brach refunded the money.
Mr. Brach did not respond to repeated telephone and e-mail messages on Sunday and Monday. A spokesman for Mr. Thompson's campaign declined to comment.
Within the publicity-averse Satmar community, according to Hasidim and others who know him, Mr. Brach has a reputation as a political operator and provocateur. He is associated with the Aroynem, a branch of the Satmars headed by Aron Teitelbaum, the leader of Kiryas Joel. The Zaloynim are a rival faction, based in Williamsburg and named for Zalmen Teitelbaum, Aron's brother.
During the 2001 New York mayoral race, while Zaloynim leaders were overseas, Mr. Brach led a contingent of Aroynem who endorsed Mark Green, a Democrat who was then the public advocate, without making clear that only one Satmar faction was on board. The stunt achieved little beyond embarrassing Mr. Green.
When the Satmar schism boiled over into the secular courts, Mr. Brach was named a plaintiff in a lawsuit by the Aroynem. His criminal record was discussed during cross-examination, and his antics in and out of the courtroom became a liability for the Aroynem, lawyers said.
The judge urged prosecutors to investigate Mr. Brach for inundating the court with what he called ''false, incredible stories'' accusing court officials of bribery and other improprieties, records show.
Defying a court order, Mr. Brach repeatedly disrupted worshipers in the main Satmar synagogue and at other events, shouting invectives against the Zaloynim and triggering repeated contempt-of-court citations, according to court papers. He was sentenced to 30 days.
Then in 2004, prosecutors said, Mr. Brach provoked a melee in the synagogue after he sat in a special chair reserved for the grand rabbi. Mr. Brach's leg was broken, according to news accounts.
Mr. Brach has also been associated with Der Blatt, a Yiddish-language newspaper aligned with the Aroynem. As recently as a year ago, he took the Aroynem's side in a radio debate with Hank Sheinkopf, a Zaloynim spokesman. Mr. Sheinkopf is now a political consultant for Mr. Thompson.

HEADLINE: Affirmative Action Survives Another Test

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
Read the related editorial on this case.
Perhaps the best that could have been expected from the Roberts court was a compromise on the affirmative action case, Fisher v. University of Texas, Austin. That seems to be the result in the 7-1 decision, which affirms the Supreme Court's 2003 decision in Grutter v. Bollinger that explicitly allowed race to be a factor in admissions decisions, as long as it was not the determining factor. 
Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote the majority opinion in Fisher and opposed the Grutter decision, kept the Texas ruling narrow, sending the case back to the lower courts to determine whether the university properly applied the principles laid out in Grutter. That counts as a victory -- for now -- for the freedom of colleges and universities to determine what education entails and how to achieve their goals.
The Grutter case, with a majority opinion by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, allowed public universities to consider race to achieve a ''critical mass'' of minority students. Justice Kennedy's U.T. decision accepts that rationale, and affirms a central principle: universities are allowed deference in their ''education judgment that diversity is essential to their educational mission'' and in ''the decision to pursue educational benefits that flow from student body diversity.''
But Justice Kennedy made it clear that once this compelling goal was established, the institution must still prove that it needed to rely on race to achieve this goal. The lower courts reviewing a diversity plan must be satisfied that no workable race-neutral alternative would produce the education benefits that diversity provides. In this case, Justice Kennedy said, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit did not apply strict scrutiny to the Texas plan to see how its process actually worked, but largely accepted the university's ''good faith'' judgment.
Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a separate concurring opinion saying he would have overruled Grutter, and Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a short statement saying he still opposed the Grutter ruling, but accepted the majority opinion that the lower courts did not review the plan under the right analysis.
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, writing in dissent, said there was no need to require the lower courts to take another look, since the ''university's admissions policy flexibly considers race only as a 'factor of a factor of a factor of a factor' in the calculus.'' Still, as she points out ''the court rightly declines to cast off the equal protection framework settled in Grutter.''
For now, the profound educational, social and economic benefits from racial and ethnic diversity ensured by Grutter live for another day -- or case. That may come as soon as next term, when the court is scheduled to review a voter-approved amendment to Michigan's Constitution that prohibits public universities from considering race as an admissions factor.

HEADLINE: How the Liberal Arts Prepare Us for Life

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''The Humanist Vocation'' (column, June 21):
I am one of the literature majors David Brooks referred to in his column. No, I never got a well-paying job teaching literature, only a few temporary adjunct positions. But many is the time I felt grateful for my liberal arts education: when I attended art exhibitions, concerts or lectures; saw a movie, read a book or traveled abroad; was able to speak and understand French, German, Spanish and Russian; conversed with people from all over the world; and even did a crossword puzzle.
My education has broadened my worldview and my appreciation of culture in its many forms. The study of humanities has enriched my life beyond measure. Although it has never fattened my pocketbook, it has deepened my appreciation of life, an invaluable outcome. 
SUSAN B. O'CONNELL Sacramento, June 23, 2013
To the Editor:
David Brooks's column is a welcome start to a conversation on the state of the humanities that needs to be continued and expanded. While I applaud his points and those made in a June 19 news article about the disturbing state of the liberal arts, it is time that we academics also accept some responsibility for the situation.
In recent decades the tendency has grown among academics to produce jargon-laden articles about obscure subjects that only their mothers and a few colleagues might appreciate. This tendency has helped alienate our core constituents -- the intellectually curious public -- who might like to read a stimulating academic work but who are too often befuddled and annoyed by baffling academic prose.
We can't just blame the job market. A system that rewards opacity over clarity and enlightenment needs to be changed.
SUSAN J. NAPIER Cambridge, Mass., June 21, 2013
The writer is a professor of Japanese studies at Tufts University.
To the Editor:
David Brooks's column is a reminder to those of us whose lives were changed by humanities courses (mine was a freshman course in ''Ideas and Institutions in Western Civilization'') that something vital is being lost in the eclipse of courses and majors in the humanities.
The humanities deal not only with the spirit and the soul, as Mr. Brooks notes, but they also deal with them in a way that allows for a diverse view of what is legitimately spiritual, not just the one version learned in one's religion.
The broad view of spirit and soul offered by the humanities should not be lost to a world increasingly dominated by rigid orthodoxy.
JOHN N. CORBIN Cary, N.C., June 21, 2013
To the Editor:
More than 50 years ago, I entered Mount Holyoke College with neither a clear idea of a major field of study nor a career. After all, this was pre-Betty Friedan and the feminist revolution. I did have some vague idea that college would be pleasurable in its own right and might help me raise better children.
Economics, my eventual major, was a social science at that time. It did not require any statistics or other hard courses that might be useful in the business world. I chose it because it interested me, the department was small, and I might get noticed by the professors there. English, however, the largest department on campus, was where my heart was. My fondest memories of college are of the afternoons I sat curled up in a wing chair on the top floor of Williston Library reading Victorian novels and marveling in the fact that I was getting college credit for such a deliciously enjoyable activity.
Forwarding to my post-graduation experience, I could not get hired by any of the banks or insurance companies in Philadelphia, economics major or not. They were not interested in hiring women. I did get a job based on my English studies, though. A pharmaceutical company hired me to write letters in its public relations department. So my humanities courses got me hired. My economics courses did not.
Am I a better, more thoughtful person for all the humanities courses I took? Who knows? I do know that my joy in reading is one of the lasting personal benefits of the studies I undertook so many years ago.

HEADLINE: Labor's Declining Share Is an International Problem

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: As economists get a clearer picture of the causes of labor&#8217;s decreasing share of income, it is clear that higher interest rates would help workers, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Bruce Bartlett held senior policy roles in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations and served on the staffs of Representatives Jack Kemp and Ron Paul. He is the author of "The Benefit and the Burden: Tax Reform - Why We Need It and What It Will Take." 
In a recent post, I noted the declining share of national income going to labor in the form of wages and benefits and the rising share going to capital income like dividends. Before talking about solutions to this problem, it's important to understand that this is a worldwide phenomenon not confined to the United States. This fact is documented in recent studies. 
For many years, economists said they believed that labor's share of income was an empirical relationship so stable that it was virtually a constant. In fact, it was called "Bowley's law," after the British economic historian Arthur Bowley, who first identified it almost 100 years ago.
It takes time for economists to separate trends from the normal ups and downs in various types of economic data, and it took a while before they realized that labor's falling share went beyond what could be explained by the recent recession. The latest Economic Report of the President (see Pages 60-61) discusses this phenomenon and suggests that it results from changes in technology, increasing globalization, changes in market structure and the decline of labor unions.
More importantly, the report notes that labor's falling share is even more pronounced in other developed countries. The reason this is important is that it allows us to avoid focusing too much on policies and factors unique to the United States. For example, labor's share of income has fallen even in countries with much stronger protection for labor unions and greater unionization of the labor force.
Studies by international economics agencies have begun looking at the problem of labor's declining share of income across national boundaries.
Last year, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development devoted a long chapter in its annual Employment Outlook to the problem. It noted that labor's share appears to have started falling more than 30 years ago. Since the early 2000s, labor's median share of income across all its member countries has fallen to 61.7 percent from 66.1 percent.
To show the order of magnitude of that decline, if labor's share of income in the United States had fallen by the same percentage, workers would be receiving more than $600 billion less aggregate income this year alone. With about 144 million people working, that's a loss of more than $4,000 per worker.
And remember that labor's share includes benefits, so it is not just an issue of falling wages due to rising health insurance costs for employers, as some economists assert.
Among the key points made in the O.E.C.D. report is that labor's share has not fallen equally across industries or classes of workers. The share of income going to highly paid workers has increased in many cases, while that going to low-paid workers has fallen. Thus income inequality has increased.
The report identifies the substitution of capital for labor in many industries as a cause of labor's declining share. A shorthand term for this is "automation," but it really goes beyond simply replacing workers with machines. It also includes the spread of technology, like computers and the Internet, that has increased the productivity of some workers, allowing them to do the work of several workers in the recent past, but not others.
But as a recent report from the International Labor Organization points out, the gains to higher productivity resulting from technological innovation are not going entirely to workers. It says that since 1999, average labor productivity in a cross-section of countries has increased twice as much as wages.
A new study by Loukas Karabarbounis and Brent Neiman of the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business identifies the low cost of capital as a key source of labor's woes. Because of low interest rates and low taxes on investment, companies have been encouraged to substitute technology, machinery and equipment for labor, which explains about half the decline in labor's share of income, according to their estimate.
Interestingly, this means that rising interest rates, which have roiled the bond market in recent weeks, are part of the solution to labor's declining share of income. By raising the cost of capital, higher rates will make labor relatively more attractive vis--vis capital. Higher taxes on capital would also have that effect as well.
As Professor Neiman put it in an e-mail to me,
Rising real interest rates, higher prices of investment goods, higher depreciation rates, or even increases in corporate tax rates would (everything else equal) push labor's share upward as they all generate increases in the cost of capital.
This is important because many economists routinely assert that more capital investment is critical to increase productivity, which, in turn, will automatically lead to higher wages. While this is undoubtedly true up to a point, we may have passed the point where it is still true in economically advanced countries such as the United States.
It may be that so much of the gains from productivity now go to capital and to the most highly paid workers that one can no longer say, as a truism, that more investment is per se a good thing for workers.
Because there is so much concern right now about the economic consequences of higher interest rates, which are almost universally viewed as negative, I would like to note that higher rates will raise the income of many middle-class people who tend to keep their savings in bonds, certificates of deposit and savings accounts that yield very little return.
As the table shows, interest income has fallen sharply since 2008, when the economic crisis forced the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, taking hundreds of billions of dollars a year out of the pockets of middle- and working-class families. By contrast, those with high incomes tend to put more of their savings into stocks that have benefited from a rising stock market, thus contributing further to income inequality.
In short, from the point of view of workers and those with modest savings, rising interest rates are unambiguously a good thing, because they will raise personal income and labor's share of national income.

HEADLINE: Buying Food That's Past Its Prime to Save the Planet

BYLINE: CHRISTOPHER F. SCHUETZE


HIGHLIGHT: In Europe and North America, small businesses are allowing consumers to save money and cut down on food waste by buying food that is past its &#8216;expiration date.&#8217; 

 BODY:
SCHAGEN, The Netherlands - This tiny town in North Holland has a new attraction. Since the beginning of the year, the local grocer has been selling nearly expired food from a makeshift outlet supermarket. Both customers and distributors are lining up.
In the rudimentary store, only open for business on weekends, a box of Pickwick Winter Glow herbal tea, which cost up to (EURO)3 (about $4) when it was on sale in a regular supermarket last December, now goes for 75 cents (about $1). A container of yogurt that is set to expire in a day, costs 50 cents, a quarter of its original price. 
Because the food sold at Outlet Stam is nearing its "best by" date, customers get a 30 to 70 percent discount.
"I just hate food waste," said Willem Jan Stam who opened the outlet right behind the town's conventional grocery store, which has been in his family for nearly a century.
The popularity of food that is close to its expiration date is growing both in Europe and North America as consumers become more cost-conscious. In Britain, approvedfood.co.uk website sells food that is close to past its prime at a discount. In France, the "destockage" chain Noz has 207 outlets that sell food and beverages, along with out-of-date or factory-rejected consumer goods. In the American state of Pennsylvania, Amelia's Grocery Outlet, recently opened its sixteenth store.
Doug Rauch, a former chief executive of Trader Joe's, has launched the Urban Food Initiative, which would sell expired foods to the needy at a fraction of their price, according to reports.
Though driven by consumers' economics, the trend of buying food past its quality sell-by date is also a step in reducing food waste in a world where starvation still exists.
According to the United Nations, 1.3 billion tons of food are lost or wasted each year. A group of British engineers estimates that up to half of all farm-produced food is thrown out, sometimes because the food is not attractive enough for supermarkets.
"For anyone who wants to cut down on their grocery bill, I think it's great," said Janice Revell, co-founder of the American website stilltasty.com about buying food close to or past its expiry date.
According to Ms. Revell, whose website bills itself as the ultimate guide to shelf life, food producers in the United States put "best before" dates on their products based on internal quality and taste tests. Despite the stamped dates, many canned products - especially those low in acid - can last years if stored properly.
"It's a quality issue, it has nothing to do with safety," she said, noting that some foods, such as baby foods, do have a hard expiration date.
"The industry is just pushing food on the market," said Mr. Stam, who says distributors are happy to sell him products cheaply because they fear having to pay to dispose of them.
The outlet store's popularity here has surprised even Mr. Stam who says he gets 500 to 600 customers, mostly from out of town, during the 10 hours he keeps the store open every weekend. Several Dutch TV channels have put the store on the map.
The clientele comes from a mix of economic backgrounds, with wealthier customers often buying bulk.
"I have many Mercedeses in the parking lot," he said.
The contradiction of massive global food waste and starvation has received renewed high-level attention.
"It is a well-known fact that current levels of production are sufficient, yet millions of people are still suffering and dying of starvation. This is truly scandalous," said Pope Francis, addressing the 38th session of the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization that ended on Saturday in Rome.
Do you eat food that's past its "best by" date? Do you buy food that is past its prime? Why or why not?

HEADLINE: Obama's Ambitious Global Warming Action Plan

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: The White House unveils a long-awaited plan to cut carbon pollution along with risks from unavoidable warming. 

 BODY:
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
In advance of President Obama's speech Tuesday afternoon laying out his three-pronged plan to cut releases of greenhouse gases and the impacts of global warming, White House officials circulated detailed fact sheets and discussed the plans with journalists, including me, last night. They laid out an impressive array of steps, most of which have long been in the pipeline or anticipated and which can be carried out without congressional approval.
The 21-page White House "climate action plan" is easy to search and read, so I encourage you to sift it yourself.
The three main sections describe planned regulations, rules and standards aimed at cutting releases of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from power plants, heavy vehicles and buildings; a suite of new steps to cut vulnerability to climate and coastal hazards; and a fresh summary of international initiatives the administration plans to pursue with other countries. 
"While no single step can reverse the effects of climate change," one circulated statement said, "the President believes we have a moral obligation to our kids to leave them a planet that's not polluted and damaged."
Of course this climate plan is just rhetoric until it is translated into on-the-ground actions. And the most significant steps, such as the rule-making that would cut carbon dioxide pollution from existing power plants, will take a decade or more to come to fruition.
But if you doubt the reality of this shift, just look at the news coverage from Monday of the drop in the price of shares in coal companies ahead of the speech. This headline in Street Insider says it all: "Coal Stocks Routed as Pres. Obama Preps to Tackle Carbon Emissions."
The plans on the international front appear to set the United States on a different track from the World Bank, which has signaled strong concerns about climate change but still supports the construction of new coal-burning power plants in some big developing countries (India, for example) if they are the most efficient design. In an interview Monday night, a senior White House official said that the United States would end financial support for such projects except if they have systems for capturing carbon dioxide (none do) or are in the "world's poorest countries."
Obama's plan for boosting the country's capacity to withstand climate-related hazards has some great sections, including this line:
The President will direct federal agencies to identify and remove barriers to making climate-resilient investments; identify and remove counterproductive policies that increase vulnerabilities; and encourage and support smarter, more resilient investments, including through agency grants, technical assistance, and other programs, in sectors from transportation and water management to conservation and disaster relief.
What's particularly welcome there is the language on "removing counterproductive policies that increase vulnerabilities" - which I hope will lead to some of the steps I recently described that could cut costs from future wildfires in America's "red zones," as well as shifts in how federal flood insurance is priced. There are echoes of points I explored in this January piece: "Obama's Second-Term Options on the Environment."
Here are the main points, as laid out in a White House fact sheet: 
President Obama's Plan to Cut Carbon Pollution 
Taking Action for Our Kids 
We have a moral obligation to leave our children a planet that's not polluted or damaged, and by taking an all-of-the-above approach to develop homegrown energy and steady, responsible steps to cut carbon pollution, we can protect our kids' health and begin to slow the effects of climate change so we leave a cleaner, more stable environment for future generations. Building on efforts underway in states and communities across the country, the President's plan cuts carbon pollution that causes climate change and threatens public health. Today, we have limits in place for arsenic, mercury and lead, but we let power plants release as much carbon pollution as they want - pollution that is contributing to higher rates of asthma attacks and more frequent and severe floods and heat waves.
Cutting carbon pollution will help keep our air and water clean and protect our kids. The President's plan will also spark innovation across a wide variety of energy technologies, resulting in cleaner forms of American-made energy and cutting our dependence on foreign oil. Combined with the President's other actions to increase the efficiency of our cars and household appliances, the President's plan will help American families cut energy waste, lowering their gas and utility bills. In addition, the plan steps up our global efforts to lead on climate change and invests to strengthen our roads, bridges, and shorelines so we can better protect people's homes, businesses, and way of life from severe weather.
While no single step can reverse the effects of climate change, we have a moral obligation to act on behalf of future generations. Climate change represents one of the major challenges of the 21st century, but as a nation of innovators, we can and will meet this challenge in a way that advances our economy, our environment, and public health all at the same time. That is why the President's comprehensive plan takes action to:
Cuts Carbon Pollution in America. In 2012, U.S. carbon pollution from the energy sector fell to the lowest level in two decades even as the economy continued to grow. To build on this progress, the Obama Administration is putting in place tough new rules to cut carbon pollution-just like we have for other toxins like mercury and arsenic -so we protect the health of our children and move our economy toward American-made clean energy sources that will create good jobs and lower home energy bills. For example, the plan:
 Directs EPA to work closely with states, industry and other stakeholder to establish carbon pollution standards for both new and existing power plants;
 Makes up to $8 billion in loan guarantee authority available for a wide array of advanced fossil energy and efficiency projects to support investments in innovative technologies;
 Directs DOI to permit enough renewables project-like wind and solar - on public lands by 2020 to power more than 6 million homes; designates the first-ever hydropower project for priority permitting; and sets a new goal to install 100 megawatts of renewables on federally assisted housing by 2020; while maintaining the commitment to deploy renewables on military installations;
 Expands the President's Better Building Challenge, focusing on helping commercial, industrial, and multi-family buildings cut waste and become at least 20 percent more energy efficient by 2020;
 Sets a goal to reduce carbon pollution by at least 3 billion metric tons cumulatively by 2030 - more than half of the annual carbon pollution from the U.S. energy sector - through efficiency standards set over the course of the Administration for appliances and federal buildings;
 Commits to partnering with industry and stakeholders to develop fuel economy standards for heavy-duty vehicles to save families money at the pump and further reduce reliance on foreign oil and fuel consumption post-2018; and
 Leverages new opportunities to reduce pollution of highly-potent greenhouse gases known as hydrofluorocarbons; directs agencies to develop a comprehensive methane strategy; and commits to protect our forests and critical landscapes.
Prepares the United States for the Impacts of Climate Change. Even as we take new steps to cut carbon pollution, we must also prepare for the impacts of a changing climate that are already being felt across the country. Building on progress over the last four years, the plan:
 Directs agencies to support local climate-resilient investment by removing barriers or counterproductive policies and modernizing programs; and establishes a short-term task force of state, local, and tribal officials to advise on key actions the Federal government can take to help strengthen communities on the ground;
 Pilots innovative strategies in the Hurricane Sandy-affected region to strengthen communities against future extreme weather and other climate impacts; and building on a new, consistent flood risk reduction standard established for the Sandy-affected region, agencies will update flood-risk reduction standards for all federally funded projects;
 Launches an effort to create sustainable and resilient hospitals in the face of climate change through a public-private partnership with the healthcare industry;
 Maintains agricultural productivity by delivering tailored, science-based knowledge to farmers, ranchers, and landowners; and helps communities prepare for drought and wildfire by launching a National Drought Resilience Partnership and by expanding and prioritizing forest- and rangeland-restoration efforts to make areas less vulnerable to catastrophic fire; and
 Provides climate preparedness tools and information needed by state, local, and private-sector leaders through a centralized "toolkit" and a new Climate Data Initiative.
Lead International Efforts to Address Global Climate Change. Just as no country is immune from the impacts of climate change, no country can meet this challenge alone. That is why it is imperative for the United States to couple action at home with leadership internationally. America must help forge a truly global solution to this global challenge by galvanizing international action to significantly reduce emissions, prepare for climate impacts, and drive progress through the international negotiations. For example, the plan:
 Commits to expand major new and existing international initiatives, including bilateral initiatives with China, India, and other major emitting countries;
 Leads global sector public financing towards cleaner energy by calling for the end of U.S. government support for public financing of new coal-fired powers plants overseas, except for the most efficient coal technology available in the world's poorest countries, or facilities deploying carbon capture and sequestration technologies; and
 Strengthens global resilience to climate change by expanding government and local community planning and response capacities.

HEADLINE: U.S. Poised to Sue Corzine Over MF Global

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Federal regulators are preparing to sue Jon S. Corzine over the collapse of MF Global. | With markets in a tailspin, some economists are asking if Ben Bernanke said too much. | Investors have been exiting their bond investments with unprecedented ferocity. | High-end fashion still has appeal for Wall Street. 

 BODY:
U.S. POISED TO SUE CORZINE OVER MF GLOBAL | Federal regulators are preparing to sue Jon S. Corzine over the collapse of MF Global and the brokerage firm's misuse of customer money, DealBook's Ben Protess reports. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the agency that regulated MF Global, plans to approve the lawsuit as soon as this week against Mr. Corzine, the former New Jersey governor who ran the firm until its bankruptcy in 2011, according to law enforcement officials with knowledge of the case. In a rare move, the agency has informed Mr. Corzine's lawyers that it intends to file the civil case without offering him the opportunity to settle, setting up a potentially lengthy legal battle, Mr. Protess reports.
"Without directly linking Mr. Corzine to the disappearance of more than $1 billion in customer money, the trading commission will probably blame the chief executive for failing to prevent the breach at a lower rung of the firm, the law enforcement officials said," Mr. Protess writes. "If found liable, he could face millions of dollars in fines and possibly a ban from trading commodities, jeopardizing his future on Wall Street." A spokesman for Mr. Corzine in a statement denounced the trading commission for planning to file what he called an "unprecedented and meritless civil enforcement action." 
Mr. Protess says: "A case would darken the cloud over the legacy of Mr. Corzine, 66, who as a onetime Democratic governor and senator from New Jersey and a former chief of Goldman Sachs has long been a confidant of leaders in Washington and on Wall Street. But it would also suggest that authorities have all but removed a greater threat: criminal charges."
DID BERNANKE SAY TOO MUCH? | Ben S. Bernanke, the normally restrained Federal Reserve chairman, said far more during a news conference on Wednesday than he usually does, and he went further about the Fed's policy plans than the central bank committee had said in its official statement. With markets now in a tailspin, some economists and others are asking whether Mr. Bernanke is being too chatty, Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook column. Even a regional president of the Fed, James B. Bullard, publicly questioned the decision to let Mr. Bernanke expound on the committee's thinking.
"It wasn't that long ago that any Fed chairman hardly said a word," Mr. Sorkin writes. "Ever since the financial crisis, with calls for more transparency, Mr. Bernanke has taken a different tack, holding news conferences and providing specific details and timelines for the Fed's policies."
A STAMPEDE FROM BONDS | Investors have been exiting their bond investments with unprecedented ferocity over the last two months and particularly over the last two weeks, Nathaniel Popper and Peter Eavis report in DealBook. "A bond sell-off has been anticipated for years, given the long run of popularity that corporate and government bonds have enjoyed. But most strategists expected that investors would slowly transfer out of bonds, allowing interest rates to slowly drift up." Instead, ever since Mr. Bernanke's remarks, waves of selling have convulsed the markets.
The pain has spilled over into stock markets, but the real pressure has been felt in the bigger and more closely watched bond market. Retail investors have sold a record $48 billion worth of shares in bond mutual funds so far in June, according to the data company TrimTabs. Hedge funds and other big institutional investors have also been closing out positions or stepping back. "The feeling you are getting out there is that people are selling first and asking questions later," said Hans Humes, chief executive of the hedge fund Greylock Capital.
ON THE AGENDA | Sprint shareholders vote on the $21.6 billion bid from SoftBank. Yahoo holds its annual meeting at 11 a.m. The S.&P./Case-Schiller Index of home prices is out at 9 a.m. Data on new home sales in May is out at 10 a.m. Walgreen reports earnings before the market opens. Apollo Group reports earnings this evening.
HIGH-END RETAIL DEALS IN THE WORKS | High-end fashion still has appeal for Wall Street, Michael J. de la Merced and Peter Lattman write in DealBook. The private equity owners of Neiman Marcus, the owner of Bergdorf Goodman in Manhattan, on Monday filed for an initial public offering. And the owner of Lord & Taylor is exploring a potential bid for Saks Inc., the 90-year-old department store chain, according to someone briefed on the matter. "Interest in both companies highlights how the market for Chanel dresses and Louis Vuitton handbags has stayed strong, despite the financial crisis. Revenue at the two retailers hovers just below 2008 levels."

HEADLINE: As More Attend College, Majors Become More Career-Focused

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: There is now a higher distribution of career-focused college majors, but these degrees may be going to students who would not have gone to college at all in prior generations. 

 BODY:
A popular article by Verlyn Klinkenborg last week in The New York Times Sunday Review lamented the decline of English majors at top colleges and universities. Mr. Klinkenborg is worried about the "technical narrowness" of some college programs and the "rush to make education pay off"- which, he writes, "presupposes that only the most immediately applicable skills are worth acquiring."
I am sympathetic to certain parts of Mr. Klinkenborg's hypothesis: for instance, the potential value of writing skills even for students who major in scientific or technical fields, and the risks that specialization can pose to young minds that are still in their formative stages.
But Mr. Klinkenborg also neglects an important fact: more American students are attending college than ever before. He is correct to say that the distribution of majors has become more career-focused, but these degrees may be going to students who would not have gone to college at all in prior generations. 
In 2011, according to the federal government's Digest of Education Statistics, about 1.7 million bachelor's degrees were awarded by American colleges, roughly double the 840,000 degrees in 1971. The number of Americans of college age has not increased nearly so rapidly. We can approximate the number of Americans who would be at the typical age to receive a bachelor's degree by evaluating the number of 21-year-olds in the United States population. In 2011, there were about 4.6 million 21-year-olds in the United States, compared with 3.7 million in 1971 - only about a 25 percent increase instead of double.
A related calculation is the number of bachelor's degrees awarded per 21-year-old in the United States. In 1971, there were 26.7 bachelor's degrees awarded for every 100 21-year-olds in the United States. By 2011, that figure had increased to 43.4 degrees, about a 60 percent increase.
The relative decline of majors like English is modest when accounting for the increased propensity of Americans to go to college. In fact, the number of new degrees in English is fairly similar to what it has been for most of the last 20 years as a share of the college-age population.
In 2011, 3.1 percent of new bachelor's degrees were in English language or literature. That figure is down from 4.1 percent 10 years ago, 4.7 percent 20 years ago, and 7.6 percent 40 years ago, in 1971.
But as a proportion of the college-age population, the decline is much less distinct. In 2011, 1.1 out of every 100 21-year-olds graduated with a bachelor's degree in English, down only incrementally from 1.2 in 2001 and 1.3 in 1991. And the percentage of English majors as a share of the population is actually higher than it was in 1981, when only 0.7 out of every 100 21-year-olds received a degree in English.
Something of the same story holds for other traditional college majors, including many fields that are grouped under the heading of STEM, or science, technology, engineering and math. Measured as a share of all bachelor's degrees, for example, the number of mathematics and statistics degrees has declined slightly - to 1.0 percent in 2011 from 1.3 percent in 1991. However, it has held steady at about 0.4 percent of the 21-year-old population.
The number of engineering graduates, likewise, has decreased slightly as a share of all college degrees. But it has increased slightly relative to the college-age population.
The social sciences abide by a similar pattern. The number of social science majors is lower by any measure since the early 1970s. But whereas the number of social-science graduates is flat since the 1980s as a proportion of degree recipients, it has increased considerably relative to the population of young Americans.
Which majors have experienced the largest increase in graduates? As I mentioned, they tend to be those associated with relatively specific post-college careers. For instance, the number of graduates in what the government calls "health professions and related programs" has roughly doubled since 1991 as a share of the college-age population. The students in this category are not necessarily bound to become doctors. (They enter college with only average SAT scores.) But the heading includes a range of majors, like hospital administration and nursing, that offer strong career prospects as the health care field adds jobs.
Undergraduate majors in business, which like the health professions tend to attract students with average SAT scores, have also become much more popular over the last four decades.
It would have been virtually unheard of 40 years ago for a student to receive a bachelor's degree in criminal justice or a related field. But these have now become fairly common majors, as more employers in these domains prefer - or even require - college diplomas.
Some employers in the visual and performing arts, which were once thought of as crafts or trades that required hands-on experience, might also now prefer or demand college degrees, and the number of bachelor's degrees in these fields has been on a long-term increase.
In short, college attendance has become more of a norm for a broader range of students, including those that might pursue a wide array of careers, like nursing or criminal justice, that are ordinarily associated with the middle class.
Mr. Klinkenborg's experience is at highly selective universities, including Harvard and Yale, where he has taught nonfiction writing. In those environments, he might have some room for concern about the fate of English majors. Since 1996, the average critical reading SAT score for prospective English majors has declined to 580 from 605, among the sharpest declines in any college discipline. And the unemployment rate among English majors was 6.9 percent in 2011 - considerably higher than 5.3 percent for bachelor's degree recipients as a whole.
But schools like Harvard and Yale are becoming ever less representative of the whole as more young Americans attend college.
Perhaps the more important moral and policy question is what academic requirements should be in place, whether in English composition or probability and statistics, among students across all majors - including those who go to college with a specific career in mind.
I hesitate to generalize too much from my own college experience, at the University of Chicago, but it is a school that emphasizes a course of study among all its undergraduates. My strategy was to choose a major - economics - that I expected to offer strong career prospects, but then to take as few courses in that field as required, diversifying my curriculum instead.
It won't be the right approach for every student or every university. But perhaps there can be a balance between recognizing two concepts: on the one hand, that college has become more of a necessity for more careers and a wider array of Americans; on the other hand, Americans are now more likely than before to change professions throughout their working lives. Perhaps we should at once encourage or require college students to take coursework in English - and tell them to be wary about majoring in it.

The usage expert Bryan A. Garner notes that "punctuation problems are often a prime indicator of poor writing," and he quotes Hugh Sykes Davies on this point: "Most errors of punctuation arise from ill-designed, badly shaped sentences, and from the attempt to make them work by means of violent tricks with commas and colons."
No tricks and no violence, please. If you find yourself desperately shoving in commas, dashes and colons to hold a sentence together, start again and simplify. Here are some recent cases in point: 
 They may also wonder why no one, anyone, smacked the director, Zack Snyder, in the head and reminded him that he was midwifing a superhero franchise, as the film's first image, of a yelling, straining woman signals, not restaging the end of days. 
Danger! Danger! Eight commas in one sentence! The jumble of phrases and clauses is very difficult to read. There's also a grammatical and logical problem in using the positive "anyone" in apposition to the negative "no one."
 His harshest critics might argue that by exposing American intelligence practices, he gave aid and comfort to Al Qaeda and its allies, with whom the country remains in a military conflict, thanks to the Authorization for Use of Military Force, which Congress passed after Sept. 11, 2001, and is in force now. 
The strain of trying to hold the syntax together, clause after clause, finally proves too much. Among other problems, the same "which" cannot serve both as the object of "passed" and as the subject of "is." Once the case of the relative pronoun is determined in the clause, it can't switch; you have to repeat the pronoun. Better still, start over.
 In Hong Kong, legal experts said the government was likely to turn over Mr. Snowden if it found him and the United States asked, although he could delay extradition, potentially for months, with court challenges, but probably could not block the process. 
Five commas here, plus the double-reverse of an "although" followed by a "but."
 With fields, dusty and dry one moment, muddy and saturated the next, farmers face a familiar fear - that their crops will not make it. 
Here the punctuation problem was the cause, not a symptom, of the confusion. The erroneous comma after "fields" makes the sentence difficult to decipher.
 In February, Private Manning pleaded guilty to nine lesser versions of the charges he is facing - and one full one - while confessing in detail to releasing the trove of documents for which he could be sentenced to up to 20 years. 
But his plea was not part of any deal and prosecutors are going to trial because they hope to convict him, based on essentially the same facts, of 20 more serious offenses - including espionage and aiding the enemy - that could result in a life sentence.
The pairs of dashes in successive sentences are just the most obvious sign of trouble. We should have started over with this convoluted passage.
 Ms. Gibson described the growth of the Web site in the United States as steady and that it would integrate all types of experts into its coverage who it may reach through blogs, commenters and types of social media. 
At least two problems tangle this sentence. We needed "said" or some other verb to introduce the clause "that it would integrate...." And we wanted "whom" - the object of "may reach" - not "who."
 
 In a Word 
This week's grab bag of grammar, style and other missteps, compiled with help from colleagues and readers.
 On Friday, Mr. Marshall's lawyers made an unscheduled appearance before the trial judge, Justice A. Kirke Bartley Jr., to file a sworn affidavit from the juror, Judi DeMarco, in which she recounts the confrontation and says she felt coerced into voting to convict Mr. Marshall. 
A redundancy, as all affidavits are sworn.
 KABUL, Afghanistan - First, the British marines tried to pacify it, and lost more soldiers there than anywhere else in Afghanistan. 
Marines and soldiers aren't the same.
 Administration officials say that Mr. Obama is likely to make his most fulsome economic arguments against Europe's continued emphasis on budget cutting - and for the relatively successful American model - after the Group of 8 meeting, when he flies to Germany. 
Perhaps we meant fullest, broadest or strongest, but not "most fulsome." From The Times's stylebook:
 fulsome means not just abundant but offensively excessive.
 It all began with "An American Family." Without the dysfunctional Louds and the riveting real-life drama of their household, televised by PBS in 1973, there may never have been an MTV "Real World," any "Real Housewives," "Bachelors" or other inescapable figures from the reality TV landscape. 
Use "might," not "may," in this contrary-to-fact construction.
 In 1950, a young man, with or without a high school degree, would have found it much easier than it is today to get and keep a job in the auto industry. 
As we noted last week, high schools grant diplomas, not degrees.
 Each country adheres to its own Orthodox church, and for decades were simply disinterested in each other. 
Two problems here. The singular "each" and "its" don't work with the plural verb "were"; recast the sentence. Also, we meant "uninterested," not "disinterested," which in careful usage means unbiased or impartial.
 But some speculated that the drinking that killed him wasn't just habitual but targeted; that is, despondent over the state of his career, he deliberately drank himself into a stupor, laid out too long in the sun and willed himself to die. 
Lay, not laid, for the past tense of lie.
 The wording of the bill offers broad latitude to the Russian police, who already are engaged in what rights groups say are political prosecutions, to interpret the traditional or nontraditional nature of relationships portrayed in public places where children are present. 
It's smoother to put the adverb between the verb parts: "are already engaged."
 Andrew Mokete Mlangeni, who was a prisoner at Robben Island with Mr. Mandela, told The Sunday Times newspaper that Mr. Mandela's family "must release him so that God may have his own way." 
Pretty clear that The Sunday Times is a newspaper.

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Strikes Down Part of Voting Rights Act

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: The court will issue rulings sometime after 10 a.m. Eastern time on Tuesday, potentially including decisions on same-sex marriage and the Voting Rights Act. 

 BODY:
 The Supreme Court ruled in Shelby County, Ala. v. Holder on Tuesday striking down part of the Voting Rights Act. Times reporters and editors are analyzing the Supreme Court decision and its implications, as well as the public's reaction to it.
 4:46 P.M. | Voting Rights at Issue in Va. Campaign for Governor 
In Virginia, one of the nine states required to win federal approval before changing voting laws, the Supreme Court's decision undoing that mechanism quickly became fodder in the race for governor. The campaign of Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, circulated a link to a year-old video of Kenneth T. Cuccinelli, his Republican rival, comparing the need to seek permission from the Justice Department to "running to mommy.''
Speaking to an audience of social conservatives in June 2012, Mr. Cuccinelli, the state's attorney general, criticized Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which requires states with histories of racial discrimination to submit changes to voting procedures for federal approval. 
"Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act requires federal permission to do anything. To move a polling place, you have to go... I call it 'running to mommy,' which you get my level of respect for it,'' Mr. Cuccinelli said. The remarks were unearthed earlier by The Virginian-Pilot of Norfolk, Va.
In a statement after the court's decision, Mr. Cuccinelli struck a less confrontational note, reassuring Virginians that existing safeguards protected them from being disenfranchised. "My role as attorney general is to ensure that those safeguards are followed and that Virginia's voting procedures continue to comply with state and federal anti-discrimination laws," he said.
Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor, said it appeared that Virginia and the other "preclearance'' states could now argue that they did not need Justice Department approval.
That is just what a spokesman for Mr. Cuccinelli's office said. "The decision has effectively stricken Virginia's preclearance requirement,'' the spokesman, Brian J. Gottstein, said.
Mr. McAuliffe said he was disappointed in the court's decision and urged Congress to rewrite the preclearance procedures.
"Unlike my opponent, I believe that, while we have made progress, protections are still necessary to ensure that Virginians are allowed to exercise their right to vote without the risk of disenfranchisement,'' Mr. McAuliffe said in a statement.

 4:37 P.M. | Four Questions for Chandler Davidson 
Chandler Davidson is a professor emeritus of sociology and political science at Rice University whose scholarly focus has been on voting rights. His research has been cited by the Supreme Court seven times, and in 2005-6, he was one of the 10 members of the National Commission on the Voting Rights Act sponsored by the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. He co-edited "Quiet Revolution in the South," a collection of assessments of the impact of the Voting Rights Act from 1965 to 1990.

Q. How would you summarize the decision in a single sentence? 
 A. The decision ignores the fact implied by Congress's overwhelming vote in 2006 to extend Section 5 for another 25 years: the electoral systems in almost all of the covered jurisdictions are still overshadowed by the remnants of a Jim Crow system that itself was a remnant of slavery.
 Q. Did anything in it - or in the justices' votes - surprise you? 
 A. I was surprised to see only Section 4 struck down, but now that I think about it, it was a clever way for the majority to attempt to escape the burden of striking down Section 5 while effectively doing so.
 Q. How will the ruling affect elections and voting? How will it affect minority turnout and representation? 
 A. It will make prevention of the current nationwide effort by Republicans to suppress the votes of key Democratic constituencies much, much more difficult. For example, my state - Texas - has a history of attempted vote suppression going back to the end of Reconstruction and continuing right up to the present. The Republican-dominated legislature's recent effort to pass the most draconian photo-ID voting requirement in the nation - prohibited soon after passage by the Justice Department's finding that it violated Section 5 - is simply one of the more dramatic instances of the state's numerous, ongoing minority vote suppression actions.
 Q. What's next for the Voting Rights Act? 
 A. Section 2 of the act will continue to be used by minority voters who are discriminated against. But taking a jurisdiction to federal court and ultimately preventing its efforts to discriminate can be a long and costly process, as those plaintiffs already in jurisdictions not covered by Section 5 will attest. As for the current Congress's coming together on behalf of the interests of minority voters as it did in 2006, I believe the chances are virtually nil. I hope I'm wrong.

 3:08 P.M. | Split in South Over Impact of Decision 
Across the South, reaction to the Supreme Court's voting rights decision on Tuesday appeared to be split, largely along racial and partisan lines. Luther Strange, the Republican attorney general of Alabama, called it "a victory for Alabama" and added that he did not believe Alabama should be included in any formula Congress might adopt.
Tate Reeves, the Republican lieutenant governor of Mississippi, said that he was pleased by the decision but that preclearance "unfairly applied to certain states should be eliminated in recognition of the progress Mississippi has made over the past 48 years."
On one point, most people agreed: that Congress was not likely to come up with a remedy to Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act any time soon, leaving the South without the oversight provided by Section 5.
"I don't like it," said David Jordan, a black state senator from the Mississippi Delta. "There may be some states that are ready to come from under it. But I don't know of any adjacent to me. Mississippi's certainly not. Louisiana's not ready. Alabama's not ready."
With legal challenges to voter identification laws and other statewide changes, the most uncertain impact of the court's decision may be in the small towns and rural counties where complying with the act has become routine and other legal challenges are less likely.
Tommy Coleman, a white lawyer in Albany, Ga., who helps cities and counties comply with the Voting Rights Act, said he suspected that black political success over the decades would forestall a broad rollback of minority gains in the South. "It's not politically reasonable to think that the white majority will come in to re-establish a poll tax or anything like that," he said.
Echoing the views of many on both sides of the debate, Mr. Coleman said that with voter identification laws in places like Ohio and Pennsylvania, and with problems with Hispanic access to the polls, the South may not the center of the fight anymore. "I'm not so sure that there aren't other jurisdictions in the country that are equally if not more in need of this than the South," he said.
Jerry Wilson, a lawyer in central Georgia who has worked in Voting Rights Act litigation for 25 years, was not so sure.
"I think we're in big trouble," he said, reeling off a list of counties in the region that have up to now been prevented by the Voting Rights Act from making what he says were discriminatory voting changes. With the burden shifting from the jurisdictions to the affected voters to prove discrimination, he was contemplating the work ahead.
"The community groups that I worked with through the years," he said, "they cannot handle this one on their own."

 3:02 P.M. | Four Questions for John Neiman 
 John Neiman has been the state solicitor general in the office of the Alabama attorney general, Luther Strange, for the last two and a half years. He grew up in Birmingham, went to college at the University of North Carolina and attended law school at Harvard. He was a law clerk for Justice Anthony M. Kennedy on the Supreme Court and Judge Paul V. Niemeyer on the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Baltimore. He has worked at private law firms and for the law schools at the University of Georgia and the University of Alabama. His client, the Alabama state government, is separate from Shelby County, the plaintiff in the Supreme Court case. Alabama submitted an amicus brief supporting Shelby County in the Supreme Court. 
 Q. How would you summarize the decision in a single sentence? 
 A. The court decided that Congress cannot impose the extreme remedy created by Section 5 on some states, but not others, unless Congress uses a rational formula for determining which states should be covered and which states should not be.
 Q. Did anything in it - or in the justices' votes - surprise you? 
 A. I was surprised that the justices did not develop more of a consensus around the majority opinion. All nine justices agreed in a 2009 case that the coverage formula had serious constitutional issues. The coverage formula is exceedingly difficult to justify as a matter of logic. I had hoped that more justices would agree to strike down the coverage formula, and to leave it to Congress to fix the problem if it so desired. That was, after all, the narrower of the two arguments Shelby County was making. The county had also asked the court to hold, more broadly, that Section 5 itself was unconstitutional. The court did not go that far.
 Q. How will the ruling affect elections and voting? How will it affect minority turnout and representation? 
 A. I certainly hope that the ruling will have absolutely no effect on minority turnout and voting. It should not have any effect, especially since other aspects of the Voting Rights Act, such as Section 2, remain firmly in place. The beneficial aspect of the court's decision is that it will help states to enact good-faith reforms to their election laws that are obviously nondiscriminatory. Previously, the covered states had to get preclearance from federal employees before enforcing even the most innocuous of changes to their voting laws. That process often took a very long time and was extremely costly to cash-strapped state governments.
 Q. What's next for the Voting Rights Act? 
 A. We will have to see whether Congress comes up with a rational coverage formula and thus revives Section 5. Meanwhile, Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, the most important part of the statute, will remain in place. It applies in every state and allows people to bring an action when they believe that their voting rights have been violated. It will continue to protect all Americans.

 2:24 P.M. | Four Questions for Ellen D. Katz 
 Ellen D. Katz is the Ralph W. Aigler professor of law at the University of Michigan Law School. She participated as amicus curiae in support of respondents in Shelby County v. Holder. She is also the principal author of the "Katz study," a study of Section 2 litigation nationwide, which was made part of the Congressional record and discussed in Justice Ginsburg's dissent. 
 Q. How would you summarize the decision in a single sentence? 
 A. Today's decision effectively terminates a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, the most successful and salient piece of civil rights legislation in American history, while leaving Congress with far less power to address racial discrimination in voting in the future.

Q. Did anything in in it - or in the justices' votes - surprise you? 
 A. Chief Justice Roberts's opinion devotes very little attention to the "thousands of pages of evidence" Congress assembled before reauthorizing the V.R.A.'s regional provisions. He reasons that "regardless of how to look at that record," it does not show the sort of "flagrant" discrimination that originally propelled Congress to enact the statute, and it was assembled to support the existing regime rather than to craft a new coverage formula "from scratch." The chief justice is not necessarily wrong on either point. What is surprising, however, is that until today, these points would not have been thought sufficient to deprive Congress of the power to judge the facts and reauthorize this statute to address the contemporary ways racial discrimination finds expression in the electoral process.

Q. How will the ruling affect elections and voting? How will it affect minority turnout and representation? 
 A. Shelby County strikes down Section 4(b) of the V.R.A., the so-called coverage formula. This provision subjected places with very low voter participation rates on designated dates to Section 5 of the statute. Section 5, in turn, required "covered" jurisdictions to show that proposed electoral changes were nondiscriminatory before implementing them. Shelby County does not invalidate the "preclearance" requirement of Section 5. But make no mistake: by scrapping the coverage formula, the decision eviscerates the obligation to seek preclearance. Congress could theoretically pass a new coverage formula, but it is difficult to imagine that politics would allow this to happen in Congress, or any set of facts could be assembled that this court would find constitutionally sufficient.
What this means is that places like Texas may now put into effect electoral districts of the sort the state attempted to implement last year. A federal court blocked implementation of these districts under Section 5 based on its finding that Texas had consciously crafted them to minimize minority influence. Shelby County also means that places that had been subject to Section 5 can now immediately implement voter ID measures of the sort that both Texas and South Carolina attempted to impose last year. Because preclearance was operational, Texas was unable to implement its measure and South Carolina's requirement went into effect only after federal review helped mitigate the burdens the original measure would have imposed on minority voters.
 Q. What's next for the Voting Rights Act? 
 A. There will be a push for a legislative response, but what politics will allow is anyone's guess.
In terms of litigation, Chief Justice Roberts's opinion is explicit that today's decision "in no way" affects the validity of Section 2 of the V.R.A., a provision that applies nationwide and bars electoral practices that "result" in a denial or abridgment of the right to vote based on race. Curiously, though, much of the court's analysis seems to invite a challenge to that provision. True, Section 2 lacks the "extraordinary" burden shifting that was the essence of the regime nullified today. And yet, the argument for Section 2's invalidity is found in the court's refusal to accord any meaningful deference to Congress's judgment that the existing regime remained necessary and its sense that the type of discrimination documented in the congressional record was insufficient to support that regime.

 1:55 P.M. | Obama and Holder 'Deeply Disappointed' in Decision 
President Obama said he was "deeply disappointed" with the Supreme Court's 5-to-4 decision ruling a central piece of the 1965 Voting Rights Act unconstitutional, and he called on Congress to pass legislation protecting access to voting.
The president registered his critique in a written statement issued by the White House that noted the law's bipartisan legacy and the high court's acknowledgment, in the ruling, that discrimination persists.
He wrote: "For nearly 50 years, the Voting Rights Act - enacted and repeatedly renewed by wide bipartisan majorities in Congress - has helped secure the right to vote for millions of Americans. Today's decision invalidating one of its core provisions upsets decades of well-established practices that help make sure voting is fair, especially in places where voting discrimination has been historically prevalent.
"As a nation, we've made a great deal of progress towards guaranteeing every American the right to vote. But, as the Supreme Court recognized, voting discrimination still exists. And while today's decision is a setback, it doesn't represent the end of our efforts to end voting discrimination."
Mr. Obama, on the night of his re-election and in his State of the Union address this year, objected to waits lasting hours that some voters had at the polls for the 2012 election and vowed to do something about it.
"I am calling on Congress to pass legislation to ensure every American has equal access to the polls," he said, without specifics. "My administration will continue to do everything in its power to ensure a fair and equal voting process."
In his administration, the job of proposing specific new laws falls to Mr. Obama's attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., who used similar language to disparate the court's decision in separate remarks delivered at the Justice Department.
Mr. Holder, who is named as defendant in the case, Shelby County v. Holder, as the nation's chief law-enforcement officer, echoed Mr. Obama in pronouncing himself "deeply disappointed" and emphasizing the law's long history of bipartisan support in Congress and successive presidential administrations.
"After all, as Congress correctly recognized in the hearings held in 2006, racial and language minorities face significant voting discrimination in some parts of our country," Mr. Holder said. "Given the successful decisions in the department's Voting Rights Act cases over the last 18 months - over the last 18 months - the need for a vital and intact Voting Rights Act remains clear."
He singled out two recent, successful federal cases - one against Texas' Congressional district map last year in which a federal court said that the plaintiffs had marshaled more evidence of discriminatory intent against Latinos than the judges could address, and another against a South Carolina voter identification law that was said to affect black voters disproportionately.
"The Department of Justice will continue to carefully monitor jurisdictions around the country for voting changes that may hamper voting rights," Mr. Holder said. "Let me be very clear: We will not hesitate to take swift enforcement action using every legal tool that remains available to us against any jurisdiction that seeks to take advantage of the Supreme Court's ruling by hindering eligible citizens full and free exercise of the franchise."

 1:33 P.M. | Civil Rights Groups Condemn Ruling and Map Next Steps 
Angered by the Supreme Court's decision Tuesday to strike down a central part of the Voting Rights Act, members of the N.A.A.C.P. and civil rights lawyers said they would ask Congress to draw up a new coverage formula.
"We are confident that members of both houses of Congress that helped lead the effort in 2006, many of whom are still there, will help to restore the power of Section 4," Wade Henderson, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said outside the Supreme Court on Tuesday.
"Today's decision severely undermines the legal protections that have been vital for more than almost five decades of protecting voters of all nationalities," Barbara Arnwine, the executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under the Law, said. "The second problem is that this decision is a betrayal of the American people that there is nothing more critical than making sure that the highest court of our land gets it right when it comes to what is the appropriate coverage for protecting American people."
Ray Haygood of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund said his organization would set up a hot line for people to call and report "jurisdictions that will try to take advantage of this interim period."

 1:26 P.M. | A Current Look at the Black Electorate 
The majority ruled that Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act was unconstitutional in large part because its formula relies on outdated data. Below are charts that show how black voter registration compares to whites' currently in the Section 5 states and black citizen turnout in the 2012 election, according to the United States Census Bureau.

 12:41 P.M. | Texas to Move Quickly on Voter Laws and Maps 
Within two hours of the Supreme Court's decision on the Voting Rights Act, Greg Abbott, the attorney general for the state of Texas, announced that a voter identification law that was blocked last year by the Justice Department would go into effect.
"With today's decision, the state's voter ID law will take effect immediately," he said in a statement. "Redistricting maps passed by the legislature may also take effect without approval from the federal government."
 In March 2012, the Justice Department objected to Texas' voter identification law, finding that under certain data sets "Hispanic registered voters are more than twice as likely as non-Hispanic registered voters to lack such identification," and that the locations and hours of license offices made it difficult for many Hispanics to attain that identification.
 Texas also sought clearance through an appeals court in Washington, which offers a separate track for jurisdictions under the Voting Rights Act. In a unanimous opinion, the three-judge panel ruled that the voter ID law would hinder minority turnout and impose "strict, unforgiving burdens on the poor."
Several days earlier, another panel on the same federal court blocked a Texas redistricting map passed in 2011, ruling that it had been enacted with "a discriminatory purpose." Because this map was blocked, Texas had been using temporary maps drawn up by a federal court in San Antonio. The legislature passed that temporary map, with minor revisions, into law, and it is awaiting the governor's signature. But after the Supreme Court decision, said Michael Li, an elections lawyer in Dallas, the original 2011 maps that had been blocked are now operative, and the governor could simply veto the new maps.

 1:02 P.M. | Four Questions for Ilya Shapiro 
Ilya Shapiro is a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the Cato Institute and editor in chief of the Cato Supreme Court Review. He filed an amicus brief supporting Shelby County's challenge to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.

 Q. How would you summarize the decision in a single sentence? 
 A. The Supreme Court restored a measure of constitutional order by recognizing that the exceptional conditions that justified the extra-constitutional federal oversight of state election laws no longer exist, thankfully.
 Q. Did anything in in it - or in the justices' votes - surprise you? 
 A. It was a mild surprise that the court decided to rule on Section 4 rather than Section 5, but this was certainly one of the plausible scenarios court-watchers were contemplating. The vote breakdown wasn't surprising, although it's disappointing that not a single one of the so-called liberal justices see any constitutional defects in such an outmoded and anachronistic law.
 Q. How will the ruling affect elections and voting? How will it affect minority turnout and representation? 
 A. It won't affect elections much other than that the time and money previously spent by local, state and federal officials on Section 5 compliance will now be freed up for constructive purposes. Redistricting will also be much easier. The end result will likely be the same because Section 2 still exists to prevent racial discrimination in voting - further proving that Sections 4/5 are unnecessary and therefore unconstitutional.
 Q. What's next for the Voting Rights Act? 
 A. Resources will be shifted to enforcing Section 2, which covers individual instances of racial discrimination in voting.

 12:58 P.M. | Video: A History of Voting Rights

 12:44 P.M. | Four Questions for Spencer Overton 
Spencer Overton is a professor at the George Washington University Law School and a senior fellow at Demos, a liberal research organization, and he teaches and writes on voting rights. He is the author of the book "Stealing Democracy: The New Politics of Voter Suppression." 
 Q. How would you summarize the decision in a single sentence? 
 A. The court effectively rolled back an important provision of the Voting Rights Act, ruling that the act's formula requiring federal preapproval of election changes for some states but not others was outdated because it was based on data from the 1960s and '70s.
 Q. Did anything in in it - or in the justices' votes - surprise you? 
 A. I was not surprised by the votes of the particular justices.
 Q. How will the ruling affect elections and voting? How will it affect minority turnout and representation? 
 A. Overwhelming evidence shows that many state and local politicians continue to win elections by unfairly manipulating election rules, and the court's decision will only make this problem worse. The biggest problem will be the under-the-radar manipulation of election rules for local offices like city councils, county commissions, school boards and sheriffs. These offices are often nonpartisan and escape national attention, but make important decisions related to schools, criminal justice, health and family services, and economic opportunity that directly affect our daily lives. Local manipulation is a real problem - over 85 percent of all election rule changes rejected as unfair under Section 5 were at the local level. In Nueces County, Tex., for example, the rapidly growing Latino community surpassed 56 percent of the county's population, and in response county officials gerrymandered local election districts to diminish the ballots of Latino voters. Without Section 5 protections to block this type of racial manipulation, voters in many areas like Nueces County will lack the thousands (and sometimes millions) of dollars needed to bring a lawsuit and stop these unfair changes.
 Q. What's next for the Voting Rights Act? 
 A. Congress should update the Voting Rights Act. First, Congress should update preclearance so that states and localities that have recently violated voting rights or do so in the future are required to submit their election rule changes to federal officials for preapproval. Second, Congress should streamline litigation, so that it is more efficient and effective in stopping unfair election rules before they are used in elections and harm voters. Third, Congress should require that states and localities with significant minority populations disclose information about the effects of their election law changes - more transparency would deter bad activity.

 12:28 P.M. | Voting Rights a Contentious Issue in the House 
House Republicans have taken aim at the Voting Rights Act during every period they have been in the majority over the last two decades, resisting at times the renewal of the law or targeting aspects of the act for removal.
The topic was a fierce subject of debate in statehouses and in Congress over the last few years as states redrew Congressional districts. Last year, Representative Paul C. Broun of Georgia offered a late-night amendment to a bill that would have barred the Justice Department from using money toward enforcement of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. The move drew a sharp rebuke from Representative John Lewis of Georgia, a civil rights activist.
- Jennifer Steinhauer 
 12:12 P.M. | Congressional Democrats Not Optimistic About Remedy 
Representative Mel Watt, a North Carolina Democrat who favors the preclearance requirements that the Voting Rights Act established, called the decision outrageous. But any remedy from Congress, he added, would be difficult to piece together.
"I don't think that we would be able to come up with a remedy that would satisfy this Supreme Court," Mr. Watt said, noting that before Congress reauthorized the act in 2006, it gathered 15,000 pages of evidence demonstrating that racial discrimination was still prevalent enough to justify the law. "Fifteen thousand pages. If that's not enough, what would be?"
Mr. Watt said he believed the court's majority had overreached. "I'm disappointed that they've substituted their own judgment on this for a legislative judgement," he said. "I think that's in unchartered territory, especially for a court that says they are not an activist court."

Kenneth Dukes, 45, a black pastor in Montevallo, Ala., who was one of the Shelby County residents represented by the N.A.A.C.P. in the case, said on Tuesday that he was disappointed with the decision and worried that the Supreme Court's ruling would open the door to voter discrimination.
Mr. Dukes said that he did not think the South had made enough progress for the law to be dropped.
"Have we made progress? Yes, we've made tremendous progress. The South has made a lot of progress," he said. "You don't have the public Klan meetings. You don't have the blatant discrimination. But you still have intimidation. You still have racism. As long as the potential for discrimination is still there, the act is still needed."
Without federal oversight of local elections, he said, he thinks minorities will encounter challenges to voting.
Mr. Dukes said he would rally African-Americans in his community to form a local chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. for Shelby County and plans to hold public forums to educate black voters on what this ruling means.
"We've made progress to the point where we have a black president," Mr. Dukes said. "But a history forgotten is often repeated. We have to celebrate the progress but not say we have arrived and get rid of the laws."

 12:07 P.M. | Four Questions for Deborah N. Archer 
 Deborah N. Archer is a professor at New York Law School, where she directs its Racial Justice Project. Previously, she was a lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc. and with the American Civil Liberties Union. Ms. Archer was a co-author of the amicus brief for Representative John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat and a leader of the civil rights movement. 
 Q. How would you summarize the decision in a single sentence? 
 A. While the court upheld the constitutionality of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act - the cornerstone of the Voting Rights Act - by striking down Section 4 it has rendered Section 5 impotent unless Congress can come up with a new coverage formula.
 Q. Did anything in in it - or in the justices' votes - surprise you? 
 A. The breakdown of the votes were expected, but I was surprised that the majority opinion did not take on Section 5 directly. I am heartened that the court recognized that pre-clearance can be applied consistent with the Constitution.
 Q. How will the ruling affect elections and voting? How will it affect minority turnout and representation? 
 A. It is a sad day for civil rights. And it must be a particularly difficult day for civil rights pioneers like Mr. Lewis, who personally paid a high price for the enactment of the Voting Rights Act.
The court's opinion ignores the truth that across the country, states, cities and counties continue to enact practices that suppress and infringe on minorities' constitutional right to vote. The harms that Section 5 was designed to counter continue, and the court's opinion makes it that much more difficult to address.
Although the court struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, it does not mean that civil rights advocates are without tools to fight racial discrimination in voting. We still have Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, portions of the National Voter Registration Act and the Help America Vote Act, along with many provisions in state constitutions.
The ruling is likely to create a lot of uncertainty regarding the legality of voting changes that were blocked by Section 5 in the last few years and whether formerly covered jurisdictions can immediately seek to enact those changes.
 Q. What's next for the Voting Rights Act? 
 A. Section 5 will be dormant, unless this deeply divided Congress can agree on a new formula to determine which jurisdictions will be covered. The power now rests with Congress to restore the ability of Section 5 to serve as a check point to protect equal political participation.
We will also likely see increased use of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act to challenge discriminatory voting practices, but Section 2 cannot completely fill the void left by Section 5.
Civil rights advocates will have to work with Congress, in this difficult political climate, to come up with a new coverage formula.

 11:31 A.M. | The Formula Behind the Voting Rights Act 
Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act is now largely without significance - unless Congress chooses to pass a new bill for determining which states would be covered. It is unlikely Congress could agree on a new formula, but a series of maps illustrates some of the variables that have been discussed by lawmakers, judges and legal scholars.
- Graphics Desk 
 11:32 A.M. | On Decision, a Mixed Reaction From Congress 
Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, criticized the Supreme Court's decision to strike down Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, saying the "decision to overturn the coverage formula effectively guts the ability of Section 5 to protect voters from discriminatory practices."
"As we approach the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s speech at the March on Washington, it is especially compelling to remember that his dream has not yet been achieved," Mr. Leahy said in a statement. "We have made great progress since that time and part of the Congress's reauthorization of Section 5 a few years ago was based on the need to preserve that progress. Yet, I fear today's decision will make it more difficult for racial minorities to have their right to vote fully protected."
 Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said the court's decision on Tuesday reflected the positive impact of the civil rights legislation and that the legislation was no longer needed.
"What it tells me is after 45 years, the Voting Rights Act worked," Mr. Grassley said, "and that's the best I can say. It just proves that it worked."

 11:20 A.M. | Americans Split on Voting Rights Act 
Americans split on racial and party lines in their opinions on the Voting Rights Act of 1965, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll conducted earlier this month.
On the question of whether the Voting Rights Act is still necessary, Americans are split, with 49 percent saying it is, and 44 percent saying it is not. Partisanship and race help fuel views of this issue as well, with Democrats and black respondents far more apt to say the act is still needed than are Republicans and white Americans.

 10:59 A.M. | Voting Rights Act Q. and A. 
 The Times Supreme Court reporter Adam Liptak did a primer in February on the Voting Rights Act. Excerpts are below. 
 Q. What did the Voting Rights Act do? 
 A. The Voting Rights of Act of 1965 addressed pervasive lawless conduct by Southern officials bent on denying blacks the right to vote. The act's central innovation was its requirement that jurisdictions with a history of discrimination get permission from the federal government - the Justice Department or a federal court in Washington - before making changes to voting procedures. The requirement, in Section 5 of the law, applied to changes large and small, from moving a polling place to redistricting an entire state. It was a significant intrusion on state sovereignty and was initially meant to last for just five years.
 Q. What is the heart of the legal dispute? 
 A. When the Supreme Court last considered the constitutionality of Section 5 in 2009 in Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District v. Holder, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., writing for eight justices, avoided the question but suggested that Congress should act to update the coverage formula based on data fresher than 1972.
"Things have changed in the South," he wrote. "Voter turnout and registration rates now approach parity. Blatantly discriminatory evasions of federal decrees are rare. And minority candidates hold office at unprecedented levels."
Section 5 is an important tool, the chief justice said. But he said making distinctions among states requires justification.
"The evil that Section 5 is meant to address may no longer be concentrated in the jurisdictions singled out for preclearance," he wrote. "The statute's coverage formula is based on data that is now more than 35 years old, and there is considerable evidence that it fails to account for current political conditions. For example, the racial gap in voter registration and turnout is lower in the states originally covered by Section 5 than it is nationwide."

 10:35 A.M. | Supreme Court Strikes Down Part of Voting Rights Act 
The Supreme Court struck down a central portion of the Voting Rights Act on Tuesday, effectively ending the practice in which some states with a history of racial discrimination must receive clearance from the federal government before changing voting laws.
The vote was 5 to 4, with the five conservative-leaning judges in the majority and the four liberal-leaning justices in the minority. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote the decision.
The majority held that Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, originally passed in 1965 and since updated by Congress, was unconstitutional. The section includes a formula that determines which states must receive preapproval.
The court did not strike down Section 5, which allows the federal government to require preapproval. But without Section 4, which determines which states would need to receive clearance, Section 5 is largely without significance - unless Congress chooses to pass a new bill for determining which states would be covered.
Given the current partisan nature of Congress, reaching agreement on a new formula may be difficult.
"Section 5 of the act required states to obtain federal permission before enacting any law related to voting - a drastic departure from basic principles of federalism," Chief Justice Roberts wrote. "And Section 4 of the act applied that requirement only to some states - an equally dramatic departure from the principle that all states enjoy equal sovereignty."
"There is no denying, however, that the conditions that originally justified these measures no longer characterize voting in the covered jurisdictions," he wrote.
- The New York Times 
 10:10 A.M. | Supreme Court Rules in Voting Rights Case 
The Supreme Court on Tuesday voted 5 to 4 in Shelby County, Ala. v. Holder to strike down part of the Voting Rights Act. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote the decision.
From the legal experts at SCOTUSblog:
Holding: Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act is unconstitutional. Its formula can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance. Thomas concurs. Ginsburg dissents, joined by Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan. Section 4 is unconstitutional in light of current conditions. In 1966, the formula was rational in both practice and theory.
From Chief Justice Roberts's decision:
The Court makes clear that: "Our decision in no way affects the permanent, nationwide ban on racial discrimination in voting found in [Section] 2. We issue no holding on [Section] 5 itself, only on the coverage formula. Congress may draft another formula based on current conditions"
Justice Ginsburg writes a dissent, reading, in part: "In the Court's view, the very success of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act demands its dormancy."
From SCOTUSblog:
In his concurrence, Justice Thomas says he would strike Section 5 as well. Thomas: the reasons that the Court gives for striking down Section 4 would also apply to strike down Section 5.

 9:26 A.M. | A Guide to The Times's Supreme Court Coverage 
This week is expected to be one of the more consequential ones at the Supreme Court in recent years. The justices ruled Monday on affirmative action at the University of Texas, likely starting a new period of legal challenges to race-based admission programs. The court has yet to rule on six cases from the 2012-13 term, including three of the most closely watched: two on same-sex marriage and one on the Voting Rights Act. The court will issue rulings sometime after 10 a.m. Eastern time on Tuesday, potentially including a decision on one or more of those major cases.
We realize that people will be eager to know what a ruling means as soon as it comes out (and you can read the decision yourself when it is posted on the court's Web site). But we also want to point out that the immediate descriptions of any ruling may not be very meaningful.
For one thing, a ruling could be complicated, as were last year's health care ruling and the 2000 Bush v. Gore decision, and not amenable to instant summarizing. The court could even announce one portion of a decision - especially on same-sex marriage, given the two different cases - before it releases another portion.
Dozens of Times journalists, in Washington, New York and around the country, are covering the major rulings and the reactions to them by the public and those directly affected. At the center of the coverage is Adam Liptak, the Supreme Court reporter for The Times (and a lawyer), who will be in court to hear the ruling. He offered an overview of this week, and what it will say about the justices' vision of equality, in Sunday's New York Times.
The moment that we feel comfortable with a ruling's basic meaning, which could be almost immediately, we plan to explain the decision. But we promise not to bombard you with guesswork or unintelligible legal technicalities. The Times will also run blog posts from the legal experts at SCOTUSblog on our own site, as well as ask other outside experts to help readers understand the decision. Once the initial meaning of the ruling seems clear, Times reporters and editors will be analyzing it in real time, on our live blog dedicated to the ruling and on stories appearing across our digital platforms. We will also post updates to Twitter on @thecaucus and @nytimes, and post selected reactions from readers.
We expect to have Mr. Liptak's initial story about any ruling by late morning or shortly after noon, not long after the court's session has ended. Whatever happens Tuesday, we expect the court to issue more rulings later this week, on a day or days yet to be announced.
 For background on same-sex marriage, we recommend: Mr. Liptak's article on the history of gay clerks at the Supreme Court; on the legal strategy, with roots in San Francisco, that helped push the cases to the court so quickly; on the shadow of Roe v. Wade; and on the two days of oral arguments earlier this year. We also recommend Ashley Parker's article on younger opponents of same-sex marriage; Sheryl Gay Stolberg's article on Ken Mehlman, a former Bush adviser turned advocate for same-sex marriage; Michael D. Shear's article on the decisions that may await President Obama; and a recent New York Times/CBS poll, as described by Ms. Stolberg and Dalia Sussman.
 On the Voting Rights Act: Mr. Liptak's article from Shelby County, Ala., the plaintiff in the case, as well as his article about the oral arguments; Campbell Robertson's article, in Monday's Times, about the act; Nate Silver's blog post about the use of statistics during oral arguments; and a graphical overview of the act.
Thanks for being with us.

HEADLINE: New York Suit Against Greenberg Allowed to Proceed

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: The decision by the Court of Appeals will let Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman move forward with an eight-year-old case first brought by Eliot L. Spitzer and then by Andrew M. Cuomo &#8212; and could eventually lead to an appearance by Mr. Greenberg on the stand. 

 BODY:
A New York State appeals court ruled on Tuesday that a lawsuit by the attorney general against Maurice R. Greenberg, the former chief executive of the American International Group, can proceed. 
The decision by the Court of Appeals will let the attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, move forward with an eight-year-old case first brought by Eliot L. Spitzer and then by Andrew M. Cuomo - and could eventually lead to an appearance by Mr. Greenberg on the stand.
The battle arises from accusations that Mr. Greenberg and a former chief financial officer of A.I.G., Howard Smith, allowed the insurer to commit accounting fraud that led to a $3.9 billion restatement in 2005. The case predates the firm's $182 billion government bailout during the financial crisis of 2008.
Earlier this year, Mr. Schneiderman took the unusual step of dropping his right to contest the settlement of a separate class-action lawsuit - and the right to win cash damages in its own legal action - pushing instead with his effort to bar Mr. Greenberg from the securities industry and from serving as a director or officer of a publicly traded company.
Some have publicly questioned the wisdom of pursuing the lawsuit. Two former New York governors, Mario Cuomo and George Pataki, wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal earlier this year that criticized Mr. Schneiderman's efforts as "a dead-end case" that was not a worthwhile endeavor.
In its decision, the appeals court noted the long duration of the lawsuit, writing, "The course of the litigation has been long, and some issues have fallen by the wayside." But the judges dismissed arguments by lawyers for Mr. Greenberg and Mr. Smith that other legal battles, including a lawsuit by the Securities and Exchange Commission, fully covered all possible relief.
"There is no doubt room for argument about whether the lifetime bans that the attorney general proposes would be a justifiable exercise of a court's discretion," the judges wrote. "But that question, as well as the availability of any other equitable relief that the attorney general may seek, must be decided by the lower courts in the first instance."
Damien LaVera, a spokesman for Mr. Schneiderman's office, said in a statement: "Attorney General Schneiderman is committed to ensuring that anyone who commits fraud is held accountable for their actions no matter how wealthy they are or how many powerful friends they have. Today's decision means we will have an opportunity to establish in court Hank Greenberg's role in this fraud and hold him accountable."
David Boies, a lawyer for Mr. Greenberg, said in a statement: "We are pleased that the attorney general's claim for damages, which throughout the eight years of this litigation has been the focus of the case, has now been dismissed. We are disappointed that the Court of Appeals did not dismiss the attorney general's recently raised claims for injunctive relief, but we are confident that the action will be dismissed by the lower courts because the state cannot demonstrate that it is entitled to injunctive or disgorgement remedies against Mr. Greenberg and Mr. Smith."

HEADLINE: My Restaurant Adventure: Four Stars and Forewarned

BYLINE: BRUCE BUSCHEL


HIGHLIGHT: In Part 2 of a series, the owner explains how he got his restaurant open &#8212; and why he started thinking about closing it down. 

 BODY:
Editor's Note: For more than two years, Bruce Buschel chronicled his experiences creating a restaurant on this blog. In a series of posts this week, Mr. Buschel explains why Southfork Kitchen will not be opening in Bridgehampton, N.Y., this season.
After my coffee shop dreams were dashed, I answered a classified ad in a local paper. An old nightclub, one with which I was familiar, if only through a bubbly haze, was for sale. The vibe was right. The price was right. The recession had not yet hit. 
The owner had had blueprints drawn up for a needed renovation: $350,000, tops. He wanted me to be his partner. He settled on being my general contractor. All I had to do was trade in his cabaret license for a restaurant permit. And a health permit and a building permit and a county road permit and a state liquor license and a certificate of authority and a new septic system and a full sprinkler system and a parking lot and rain drainage. And then I had to find a chef and a staff and some fish and I would be in business.
I started writing about my misadventures for this blog and garnered more empathy in India than in my own backyard. Local bluebloods looked askance on the tooting of one's own corn; the blue collars had their own idea of what kind of restaurant I should run, and none of them involved fish. While they wisely allowed for summer "gouging," they expected burgers and beer come the fall.
Everyone wanted to know the details of my business plan. When onlookers demanded numbers, I offered these: 70 percent of all restaurants fail or change hands within their first three years, and according to my best guess, 98 percent of those failed enterprises had what they considered excellent business plans. My business plan, mostly guesswork, included these two sentences, reprinted now not as bravado but foreshadowing: "Eateries are finite in the Hamptons and therefore always in demand. If the restaurant fails, change the concept or rent the space or sell the property."
Rehabbing the 100-year-old building didn't quite work out. It was condemned. (Which was not in the plan.) And the contractor didn't work out either. He was condemned. (Not in the plan.) I had to start from scratch. (N.I.P.) All of which required me to come up with a lot more scratch. (N.I.P.).
But starting over did open up a host of design possibilities, and I took the bait. I employed a young architect from Brooklyn (TBD Design). And we obsessed about every little thing: Recycled bricks. Edison light bulbs. Invisible speakers. An antique fireplace. Booths, banquettes, alcoves. Reclaimed cypress from North Carolina. Old hemlock planks from upstate New York. Cedar from old pickle barrels. The crew called me Woody Woodpicker. Civilians accused me of wasting money on frivolous details like ceilings and walls and floors. I was investing in ambiance, I insisted, and ambiance would pay me back. Our basement was more colorful than a Crayola box.
The best restaurants in the Hamptons were the priciest; they attracted well-heeled customers who, in turn, attracted a good staff. Or maybe a well-trained staff attracted a good clientele. Either way, like a Long Island blowfish, my modest eatery at a roadside coffee shop had inflated into a fancy sustainable fish restaurant with a lovely vegetable garden and debt as high as sweet corn in July. Pass the butter, and a sharp knife. Rub sea salt here.
I hired a Michelin-star chef before tasting his food. I fired a public relations firm when its representatives claimed that not tasting the chef's food had stymied their efforts. Critics and customers did the tasting. Chef Joe Isidori won an epaulet full of stars, and Southfork Kitchen was voted "best restaurant" on Curbed Hamptons. And Diner's Choice Winner on Open Table.
We were perceived as arrogant and expensive because we were, more or less, arrogant and expensive. We served no meat. We honored reservations. We charged for no-shows. We had no television and no discernible bar scene. Our staff was well trained and polite. We had more wines from Long Island than France. We were, flat-out, a fancy fish restaurant with advanced locavoritis. Our prix fixe was $68, not $28. We thought it was a good deal: brioche and whole grain breads, home-churned butter, local honey, spicy smoked paprika, Atlantic sea salt and three amuse-bouches - usually local oysters, a fish tartar and a vegetable from our garden with a Meyer lemon sauce, all served before the first course. And then the surprise party began in earnest, a pescatorian's delight.
Getting the sea to the spoon and the farm to the flat top turned out to be fairly efficient. Getting anything from our kitchen to our guests was the hardest stretch of the voyage. The front of the house was in constant flux. If a kitchen is like a college, with genuine interest about teachers and degrees and grad school, the front of house is more a high school - servers and runners are concerned with their popularity, their workload and their take-home pay. They may or may not be studying for a career; their futures arrive each midnight. If during any service, half the servers followed half the 100 rules I had established, I would have considered myself a lucky man, if I had believed in luck.
Still, in the summers, we sailed as smoothly as any yacht in Sag Harbor Bay. And we were convinced that quality would conquer the off-season sag that had been foretold. If we were good enough, we believed (which rhymes with deceived) people would find us. Alas, in the end, we were a destination restaurant in an area where the most common destination at the end of a long winter's day was hearth and home. And who could blame anyone?
The idea to rent out the space came in the form of two grown men and one small misunderstanding.

HEADLINE: Immigration and the Labor Market

BYLINE: EDUARDO PORTER


HIGHLIGHT: By the accounts of many economic studies, an increase in immigration is likely to leave most American workers better off. 

 BODY:
Are American workers are about to experience unwelcome new competition for their jobs? The bill moving through Congress to overhaul the nation's immigration laws, if approved, would give employers access to expanded visa programs that would admit hundreds of thousands of immigrant workers, of both low and high skills, to toil in workplaces from strawberry fields to technology companies.
The legislation also offers legal status to millions of immigrants working illegally across the country, and ultimately a shot at citizenship. The change would encourage many to roam freely throughout the economy, leaving dead-end jobs in immigrant-heavy sectors of the labor market to seek higher pay elsewhere. 
But by many accounts, most American workers need not worry about the prospect of hordes of workers entering the country with an eye on their jobs. Rather, immigration is seen as more likely to leave American workers better off.
The latest organization to come to this conclusion is the Congressional Budget Office, which issued a report this month concluding that the immigration bill would add six million workers to the American job market by 2023 and nine million by 2033 - increasing the labor force by 5 percent.
In the beginning, the jump in immigration would hit pay, the office said. It expects that by 2023 average wages would be 0.1 percent lower, on average, than they would have been absent a change in law.
Still, most American workers would have little to worry about. Average wages would decline to a large extent because most of the new immigrant workers would be paid less than domestic laborers, pulling the average down. Most importantly, the decline would only be temporary. Wages would rise as businesses invested to take advantage of the expanded labor force. By 2033, the C.B.O. forecast, average wages would be 0.5 percent higher than they would have been without the new immigrants.
These conclusions may seem to fly in the face of the laws of supply and demand. But they are not quite so odd. They can become obvious, in fact, when accounting for the response of American companies, and workers, to the inflows of foreign labor.
The belief that immigration would simply displace American workers relies on the assumption that employers would do nothing but replace a costlier domestic labor force with cheaper imports. But companies actually invest and expand to reap the higher profits that the new labor allows. This provides new opportunities for immigrants and domestic workers alike.
In other words, immigration can produce jobs for Americans, too. Restaurants are much less common in Norway than the United States because Norway lacks the cheap labor - making a dinner out in Oslo prohibitively expensive. In many New York restaurants, the American waiters and maitre d' owe their jobs to the underpaid immigrants working illegally in the kitchen, whose low wages allow the restaurant to exist.
What's more, immigration expands productivity. Highly skilled immigrant workers generate more productive innovations. And the influx of new workers of a variety of skills, high and low, would promote specialization.
Giovanni Peri, an economist at the University of California, Davis, and Chad Sparber of Colgate University found that American workers in states with large shares of less-educated immigrantsgravitate towards communications-related occupations, their area of comparative advantage, while the immigrants stick to manual tasks and physical labor.
This increases the growth rate of the economy and pushes wages higher. Mr. Peri estimated that the wave of immigrants that entered the United States between 1990 and 2007 by about $5,100 a year on average, in 2005 dollars. This amounts to more than a fifth of the income gains over the period.
There will be losers, especially among the workers most like the newcomers. A 50-year-old janitor with no high school diploma, for instance, will find it hard to make a transition into another job when immigrants move into the building maintenance business. But this group is probably small, and composed mostly of illegal immigrants already in the workplace.
George Borjas of Harvard University argues that those without a high school diploma - about 8 percent of the labor force - are easily replaced by immigrants and are likely to suffer a noticeable drop in wages if low-skill immigration increases. Mr. Peri disagrees. He argues that high-school dropouts could find jobs in parts of the labor market that might even benefit from new immigrants' arrival.
The Congressional Budget Office looked at it differently. Rather than split the work force by educational attainment, it sliced it into five equal cohorts of skill, from the least educated fifth to the most. It found that none of these groups is hurt by immigration over the long run, in absolute terms. Some gain more, and some gain less.
Unskilled American workers - who never completed high school, or maybe got an equivalency diploma - would do relatively poorly. So would highly educated workers, who would face more competition from new immigrant scientists and engineers with H1-B visas.
Average wages in both these slices would decline 0.3 percent relative to the average by 2033. The rest of workers, by contrast, would see their relative wages rise by 0.5 percent.
But even though the gains would not be distributed evenly, according to the study, every group would win. "Average wages would be higher under the bill than under current law for workers in all quintiles of the skill distribution," it said.

HEADLINE: Why It's Hard to Build Emergency Savings

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: Some savings accounts charge inactivity fees, making it hard to use them for emergency funds. 

 BODY:
Despite improvement in the economy, more than a fourth of Americans have no emergency savings. And those who do manage to sock away some money in basic savings accounts get abysmal interest on their funds and sometimes have to pay excessive fees.
Half of Americans have less than three months of expenses saved up, and just a quarter have six months saved, which is the typical recommendation for emergency financial reserves, according to a report from the financial Web site Bankrate.com. The survey by Princeton Survey Research Associates International queried 1,004 adults from June 6 to 9 using landlines and cellphones. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4 percentage points. 
Meanwhile, in a separate report, the Consumer Federation of America finds that statement or passbook savings accounts, the main place where lower- and moderate-income consumers put their savings to cover unexpected expenses like car repairs or dental bills, are very stingy with their interest rates and sometimes hit customers with extra fees. The accounts are used by about three-fifths of households nationally, the report found.
The federation's report is based on an analysis of information about traditional savings accounts from the Federal Reserve Board's 2010 Survey of Consumer Finances, and research on the Web sites of 150 banks, including the 50 largest as measured by the number of branches, as well as the 10 largest credit unions. The Federal Reserve data was analyzed for the federation by Catherine Montalto, a family economics professor at Ohio State University.
The federation's report found that 17 percent of banks reviewed paid just 0.01 percent interest or less, or no more than 10 cents annually, on a $1,000 balance. Just 4 percent of the banks pay more than 0.25 percent on basic savings accounts. Interest rates on such accounts, in short, are "ridiculously low," said Stephen Brobeck, the federation's executive director, during a telephone briefing.
What's more, the accounts may hit customers with significant fees that wipe out even the negligible interest they earn. For instance, in a sample of about two dozen banks, some banks charge fees from $1 to $12 if the account is inactive for as little as six months. While most banks don't charge the fees unless the balance drops below a minimum balance (sometimes as low as $50), one online bank charges a $10 fee after six months of inactivity, regardless of the balance.
The inactivity fees are especially burdensome for savers who have built their account to a certain level as an emergency cushion and then just let it sit until needed, said Mr. Brobeck. "A consumer who wants to park funds but doesn't make additional deposits and doesn't have any emergencies could get whacked with these fees," he said.
Some banks also penalize customers for excessive withdrawals. Federal regulations limit withdrawals from a savings account to six per month. But a significant number of banks - half of the large banks in the study - limit withdrawals to three a month and charge fees for each withdrawal over the limit. The fees vary widely, from 50 cents to $15 at large and medium banks and 50 cents to $10 at small banks.
The Bankrate report found that while the savings numbers are slightly better than before the recession, when just 39 percent had three months of expenses in the bank, they are still troubling, said Greg McBride, senior financial analyst at Bankrate.
The main culprit appears to be stagnating wages, he said; people have shed debt since the recession, but they still don't have much excess cash.
It's true that interest rates don't offer much incentive to save, but Mr. McBride said an emergency fund was not meant to earn big investment returns. Rather, it's just what it should be: a safe stash of cash for unexpected expenses.
The best way to build an emergency fund, he suggested, is to arrange for automatic transfers from a checking account into a savings account.
By arranging for automatic transfers, most savings accounts waive monthly service fees, Mr. Brobeck of the consumer federation said.
Do you have an emergency fund? Is it kept in a typical savings account?

HEADLINE: Wheelies: The Let's Sit Down and Talk Edition

BYLINE: BENJAMIN PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: N.H.T.S.A. will sit down with critics of its handling of the Chrysler recall, and New York legislators table a bill that could affect Tesla&#8217;s business in the state. 

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring new from around the Web:
 David Strickland, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, has agreed to meet with critics of the agency's handling of a widespread fuel tank-related recall recently disputed by Chrysler. N.H.T.S.A. directed Chrysler to recall 2.7 million Jeeps for a problem that could lead to fires during crashes, but Chrysler refused. The automaker originally reached an agreement with the agency that involved installing trailer hitches to protect vulnerable fuel tanks, but the Center for Auto Safety says the fix is inadequate. The meeting is scheduled for next month. (The Detroit News)
 The German police have apprehended a man in connection with hundreds of road rage shootings throughout Europe over the last five years. The police have accused a 57-year-old trucker of carrying out 762 highway shootings, although only one person is known to have been injured. After an investigation of forensic evidence and phone records, the police found the man, whom they have not identified. The police told NPR it was like "finding a needle in a haystack." (NPR) 
 The New York State legislature has tabled a bill that Tesla Motors says would make it impossible for the electric car manufacturer to sell cars in the state. The legislation would make it illegal for automakers to operate dealerships, which is the Apple-esque model Tesla uses to sell cars. Elon Musk, Telsa's chief executive, had accused dealer-friendly legislators of trying to pull a fast one, but Senator Lee Zeldin, the Long Island Republican who sponsored the bill in the State Senate, said they were planning to create an exception for Tesla. As it turned out, the State Assembly did not act upon the measure and will not reconvene until January. (Automotive News)
 Known for decades for its impressive fuel economy numbers, the Honda Civic is scheduled to get an engine upgrade that Honda says will further bolster efficiency. Honda confirmed that it will put its Earth Dreams direct-injection gasoline engines into Civics, along with continuously variable transmissions, in an attempt to battle a more competitive Toyota Corolla, long the Civic's nemesis in the small car market. Automotive News speculated that the changes could appear in Honda's 2015 model lineup. (Automotive News)
 The 2013 Ford F-150 is this year's top pick in the Cars.com American-Made Index, the first time since 2008 that a domestic company has won. Ford's victory unseats the assembled-in-America Toyota Camry, which topped the list from 2009 to 2012. Cars.com says it selects "most American" vehicles from domestic and foreign manufacturers, as long as they are assembled in the United States. The top five vehicles on the list also include the Dodge Avenger, the Honda Odyssey and the Toyota Sienna. (Cars.com)
 In other F-150-related news, Ford's Harley-Davidson edition F-150 pickup has reached its denouement. Automotive News reports that amid a glut of other high-end F-150 trim levels, the Harley-Davidson-theme pickups garnered only about 2 percent of F-150 sales. Ford said it had the F-150 Limited and the Super Duty Platinum editions in the works for 2014. (Automotive News)
 Have you ever wished you could buy your favorite classic Chevrolet, only brand new? Now might be your chance. A Nebraska dealership had a collection of about 500 vehicles sealed inside when it was closed in 1996. A number of the vehicles are classics, like a 1958 Cameo pickup and a 1959 Bel Air sedan with only a few miles on the odometer. Some still had the protective plastic on the seats from the factory. An auction will be held by VanDerBink Auctions in late September. (Autoweek)
 According to NBC News, Americans spent $53 billion on pet supplies and services in 2012. So it should not be all that surprising that food trucks geared toward dogs appear to be on the rise. In cities like Austin, Chicago and New York City, trucks sell products like peanut butter-bacon-flavored ice cream for dogs. With many people willing to treat their dogs to something above the standard bowl of Alpo, it adds up. NBC's report projects that pet-related sales could increase by $2 billion this year.

HEADLINE: Patience for Reopening Latino Cultural Space Is Gone

BYLINE: MONA EL NAGGAR


HIGHLIGHT: A theater and a large multipurpose room in the Julia de Burgos Cultural Center in East Harlem have been closed since late 2011, but a lease with a new operator is unfinished and repairs have not begun. 

 BODY:
The Julia de Burgos Cultural Center, a city-owned building in East Harlem, has long been an important hub for the neighborhood's Latino population. Named after a renowned Puerto Rican poet, the five-story building served as a place for local artists to showcase their work and residents to gather to celebrate birthdays, hold funerals, discuss community affairs and dance salsa.
"It was about all of us coming together," said Marina Ortiz, founder of East Harlem Preservation, a group dedicated to preserving East Harlem's culture and history. Ms. Ortiz said she used to visit the center regularly for almost 20 years, before New York City officials closed a large multipurpose space and theater there over a year and a half ago for renovation and to find a new operator. 
"It was torn out from under us," she said, adding that her efforts to determine why it was taking so long to reopen the two rooms had been futile. Other parts of the center remain in use, but work has not even begun on the renovation.
Having grown frustrated, a coalition of community leaders and artists plan to stage a series of street performances as a form of protest outside the Julia de Burgos center, starting Wednesday, to pressure the city.
"It's not about one show; it's about no show," said Eugene Rodriguez, a playwright and longtime resident of East Harlem who is leading the effort. "Latino artists have no access to Latino institutions in the neighborhood. It kills me. It really kills me."
Mr. Rodriguez, 65, swallowed, looked away and started to cry.
City officials contend the changes will benefit the neighborhood and local cultural groups. But many residents and activists say they view the delay as part of the marginalization of East Harlem's working-class Latino population and the city's disinterest in preserving the Puerto Rican identity of a neighborhood undergoing a slow but steady gentrification.
"The Julia de Burgos is symptomatic of the larger issue," said Marta Moreno Vega, founder of the Caribbean Cultural Center and a former director of El Museo del Barrio. "The disparity in the way that culture and art is understood in the city and the way that resources are distributed and attention is given is what you see in the Julia de Burgos."
The building, on Lexington Avenue between 105th and 106th Streets, that houses the multipurpose room and the theater also contains other exhibition and performance areas and a public school. The city rents out space to various Latino art groups, including Taller Boricua, which had operated the 2,800-square-foot multipurpose space and occasionally used the 160-seat theater.
In September 2010, the city's Economic Development Corporation announced plans to renovate and reorganize the administration of the two spaces, saying that they were mismanaged and underused.
In November 2011, the city selected the Hispanic Federation, a nonprofit organization, to operate and maintain the two spaces. But the city and the Hispanic Federation are still negotiating the terms of the lease, and the rooms remain locked.
Responding to neighborhood complaints, City Councilwoman Melissa Mark-Viverito, who represents the area, has been working with the development corporation, and on Friday she said the city would find a way for cultural groups to rent out the spaces while the lease was being negotiated.
The development corporation said in a statement on Tuesday that "local groups will have the opportunity to rent space" on a temporary basis, but it had yet to work out the fees and other details.
"I hear the frustration but I'm asking for patience still," Ms. Mark-Viverito said in a phone interview.
Still, some activists are not satisfied.
"Why should we be patient?" Ms. Ortiz said. "Why should we accept vague assurances? I want precise answers: When, where, who, how."
As to why it has taken so long to hammer out a lease, Jose Calderon, the president of the Hispanic Federal, said renovations promised by the city were yet to be completed. "Any tenants moving into a space want certain things done," he said.
Ms. Mark-Viverito said that her office had set aside nearly $1 million for renovations, but that the expenditure was only recently approved by the city's Office of Management and Budget.
Sitting on the stoop of his house on 118th Street, Mr. Rodriguez waited for Ms. Ortiz and a number of other neighbors, artists and friends to arrive for a meeting to discuss Wednesday's protest. He said he planned to deliver a Shakespearean-style speech: "Friends! Latinos! Countrymen! Lend me your ears! I come to praise La Julia not to bury her!"

HEADLINE: Let Them Eat Soccer

BYLINE: By ELIO GASPARI. 
Elio Gaspari, a columnist for the Brazilian newspapers O Globo and Folha de So Paulo, is the author of a multivolume history of Brazil's military dictatorship.

 BODY:
SO PAULO, Brazil -- SINCE early June, protests that began out of anger over public transit fare increases have spread across Brazil, filling the streets of So Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and dozens of other cities with hundreds of thousands of demonstrators. On June 13, the police cracked down violently and the protests mushroomed. Finally, after seven days, the government of President Dilma Rousseff pushed governors and mayors to cancel the fare increases they had presented as the inevitable price of a modern market economy.
The cost of public transportation for a family living in Rio or So Paulo is, proportionally, higher than in New York or Paris. Yet, the service delivered is humiliating. In 2009, security guards of a train company that services the Rio metropolitan area used whips on passengers during rush hour crowding. The mayor of Rio has proudly declared that during his tenure not a cent is being spent on subsidizing public transportation. Yet he was able to find $560 million of public money to spend on the renovation of the iconic Maracan stadium to meet the requirements of next year's FIFA World Cup. 
At a time when federal, state and municipal taxes eat up 36 percent of Brazil's gross domestic product without providing public services minimally compatible with what is expected from government, at least $13 billion is being poured into 12 soccer stadiums to host the World Cup. An additional $12 billion is being spent on projects to host the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio.
But delusionary modernism has its pitfalls. The same day the first protests started in So Paulo, the city's mayor and the state's governor happened to be in Paris trying to land yet another global mega event -- the 2020 World's Fair. A few days later, when the protesters were climbing atop the Congress building in Braslia, a landmark of Oscar Niemeyer's architecture, the president of the House of Representatives was visiting Moscow.
The lavish lifestyle of high-ranking public servants (generous travel expenses, official cars with drivers, offensively large paychecks) has become a rallying point for the protests.
It is as if there are two Brazils. One is expected to shout -- but only in stadiums. The other does as it pleases.
When Ms. Rousseff attended a Confederations Cup soccer match between Brazil and Japan last week, she was incensed when waiters started serving Champagne and caviar in the V.I.P. section. After she complained, popcorn soon materialized for the luminaries. Notwithstanding her protest, Ms. Rousseff was soundly booed by the rest of the crowd.
In today's Brazil, there is too much caviar for the elite -- and the people have noticed. That realization, along with outrage at widespread corruption, has helped the current outcry cross class, party and generational lines.
In 2005, the government of Luis Incio Lula da Silva, then Brazil's president, was caught in a vast cash-for-vote scandal. The plot, which became known as ''mensalo,'' because the bribe payments were made monthly, shattered expectations. Mr. da Silva's government had been widely trusted to lead a fight against corruption. Suddenly, a former president of his Workers' Party and his own chief of staff were caught up in a scandal.
Almost eight long years later, Brazil's Supreme Court sentenced 25 of the accused. Their sentences ranged from 2 to 40 years in prison. But none are actually behind bars yet, and legal appeals could continue for another couple of years.
To grasp the significance of this, Americans need only contemplate their rage if the Watergate scandal had dragged on, enabling Richard M. Nixon to finish his second term, help elect a handpicked successor from his own party in 1976 and then watch all those indicted, tried and convicted walk free eight years later.
When the riot police in So Paulo fired rubber bullets and tear-gas bombs at protesters, they probably thought they were dealing with a couple of thousand worthless rioters. How could a national protest against bus-fare increases averaging less than 10 cents possibly be representative of modern Brazil, where people drive cars and, whenever possible, go shopping in Miami or New York?
But all who witnessed that very first act of police aggression know it was deliberate. It was gratuitous. And it was a colossal mistake.
In the face of growing protests, governors and mayors -- who at first were intransigent -- rushed to lower the transportation rates. Ms. Rousseff praised the shouting crowds, then conferred with Mr. da Silva and his spin doctors. Last week, in a much anticipated address to the nation, she declared that the voice of the streets was being heard and announced programs to promote better education and health care. On Monday, she took a more personal step, meeting with the leaders of the movement that triggered the protests. Her immediate aim is to survive the final week of the Confederations Cup without a major catastrophe in the streets.
As the protests have intensified, there have been cases of looting and vandalism. But the great majority of the protesters aren't rioters, nor should the rioters be mistaken for protesters.
Indeed, it would be safe to assume that the percentage of violent troublemakers among the protesters is smaller than the number of thieves among the negotiators of government contracts.

HEADLINE: With Snowden in Middle, U.S. And Russia Joust, and Cool Off

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN, ELLEN BARRY and PETER BAKER.; David M. Herszenhorn and Ellen Barry reported from Moscow, and Peter Baker from Washington. Reporting was contributed by Andrew Roth from Moscow; David E. Sanger, Steven Lee Myers and Charlie Savage from Washington; and Michael R. Gordon from Jidda, Saudi Arabia.

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Tuesday appeared to rule out sending Edward J. Snowden back to the United States to face espionage charges, leaving him in limbo even as Moscow and Washington seemed to be making an effort to prevent a cold-war-style standoff from escalating.
In his first public comments on the case, Mr. Putin said that Mr. Snowden -- the former National Security Agency contractor who leaked documents about American surveillance programs -- had committed no crime on Russian soil and was ''a free man'' who could choose his own destination. ''We can only extradite some foreign nationals to the countries with which we have the relevant international agreements on extradition,'' he added. ''With the United States, we have no such agreement.'' 
But while American officials remained angry at China for letting Mr. Snowden fly to Moscow, they and their Russian counterparts toned down the red-hot language that threatened a deeper rupture in relations. Mr. Putin said he saw little to gain in the conflict. ''It's like shearing a piglet,'' he said. ''There's a lot of squealing and very little wool.'' Some American officials interpreted the comment as a positive signal and speculated that Mr. Snowden would be sent to another country that could turn him over.
Yet the Russian president's remarks during an official visit to Finland also underscored what may be the lasting damage the case has caused for American relations with both Moscow and Beijing. In noting that Mr. Snowden viewed himself as a ''human rights activist'' who ''struggles for freedom of information,'' Mr. Putin made clear that it would be harder for President Obama to claim the moral high ground when he presses foreign leaders to stop repressing dissenters and halt cyberattacks.
In the days since Mr. Snowden fled Hong Kong for Moscow, the Russians and the Chinese have seized both on his revelations about surveillance and the fact that the United States is seeking his arrest to make the case for a you-do-it-too argument. Igor Morozov, a Russian lawmaker, wrote that the case exposed an American ''policy of double standards.'' Xinhua, the state-owned Chinese news agency, editorialized that ''the United States, which has long been trying to play innocent as a victim of cyberattacks, has turned out to be the biggest villain in our age.''
American officials said such arguments were false equivalences, saying that there was no comparison between Congressionally sanctioned and court-monitored surveillance programs, or the prosecution of Mr. Snowden, and the actions taken by the governments in Moscow and Beijing. But it is an argument that Washington may find difficult to sell in some parts of the world, even among some American allies, and it is fueling criticism inside the United States.
''The Russians for the better part of a decade have always tried to argue that the U.S. has double standards,'' said Andrew Weiss, a former Russia adviser to President Bill Clinton and now vice president at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ''In the Russian domestic context and international context they never get tired of looking for those kinds of axes.''
The arguments could complicate American initiatives with both countries. Chinese officials are now ramping up the critique ahead of the United States-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, which starts in Washington in early July with the arrival of an array of Chinese leaders. On the top of the agenda, at Mr. Obama's insistence, is talk about how to work out rules of the road for behavior involving computers and online.
Until lately, the United States seemed to have Beijing on the defensive, with evidence that Chinese military units were behind recent computer attacks. Then Mr. Snowden told a Hong Kong newspaper that the United States had been engaged in a vigorous hacking campaign in China.
Mr. Obama has insisted that there is a difference between common espionage and China's behavior. ''Every country in the world, large and small, engages in intelligence gathering,'' he told Charlie Rose in an interview on PBS. But intelligence gathering is different from ''a hacker directly connected with the Chinese government or the Chinese military breaking into Apple's software systems to see if they can obtain the designs for the latest Apple product,'' he said.
''That's theft,'' the president added, ''and we can't tolerate that.''
China does not acknowledge the theft, or buy Mr. Obama's argument. ''The timing couldn't be worse for Obama,'' one senior Asian diplomat said. ''I know he draws distinctions between stealing intellectual property and spying, but for most people that difference is not significant.''
The timing is also bad with Russia, which Mr. Obama is depending on to help resolve the war in Syria. When Secretary of State John Kerry criticized Russia on Monday as a repressive country, he personally offended Mr. Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov. On Tuesday, Mr. Lavrov lashed out at the United States, saying, ''There are no legal grounds for this kind of behavior from American officials toward us.''
Within hours, though, the two sides appeared to pull back. Mr. Kerry told reporters traveling with him in Saudi Arabia that the United States was ''not looking for a confrontation.'' And American and Russian officials meeting in Geneva on Tuesday scheduled a session next week between Mr. Kerry and Mr. Lavrov to discuss Syria.
Mr. Putin, who is scheduled to host Mr. Obama in St. Petersburg and Moscow in September, said he hoped the Snowden case would ''not affect in any way the businesslike character of our relations with the United States.''
But the case may be drawing Russia and China closer together, and Beijing's action may influence Moscow's decision. The two governments have consulted on the case, with the Chinese explaining why it allowed Mr. Snowden to leave Hong Kong even though the United States had revoked his passport and requested his arrest, said Dimitri K. Simes, president of the Center for the National Interest, a policy research group in Washington.
''These conversations clearly make it more difficult for Russia to appear weak by making a concession while Beijing stood its ground,'' Mr. Simes said.
Aleksei K. Pushkov, chairman of the Russian Parliament's foreign affairs committee, said in a Twitter post early Wednesday that ''the U.S. threats toward Russia and China over the Snowden affair will not give results, but only bring Moscow and Beijing together even more strongly. Unreasoned pressure.''
The Obama administration was relying on Deputy Secretary of State William J. Burns, a low-key, respected former ambassador to Russia, to negotiate with Moscow. The administration argued Tuesday that even though the United States and Russia did not have an extradition treaty, Washington had regularly sent back Russians sought by Moscow. Over the last five years, the Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday, the United States had returned 1,700 Russian citizens, with more than 500 of them being ''criminal deportations.''
But in Moscow, Mr. Snowden was being compared to cold war dissidents. ''I have never heard of any case when the United States would extradite someone's fugitive spy,'' said Vlacheslav Nikonov, a member of Parliament. ''It just never happened. Why would they expect that would happen?''
As for the subject of all this attention, Mr. Snowden remained in the transit zone of Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport. Mr. Putin said Russian intelligence agencies had not questioned him, although some independent analysts cast doubt on that assertion. ''If I still worked there, I would talk to him,'' said Aleksandr Kondaurov, a retired K.G.B. general.
Mr. Snowden, who remained out of sight for another day, has requested asylum from Ecuador. There are no direct flights from Moscow to Quito, the Ecuadorean capital, so if he were to head there, he might travel through Havana. The next flight from Moscow to Havana is Thursday.

HEADLINE: After Decades Among Yankees and Mets, a Shutter Stops Snapping

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER. 
E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com; Twitter: @jimdwyernyt

 BODY:
''When I met Pop at the old stadium, he had a booth in the back of my pizza station, Main 11,'' Alva Robinson said. ''We got to be friends -- swapping pizza and pictures. I do popcorn now. I'm the popcorn lady. But I always made sure Pop had his ice water, soda.''
Pop went by other names at the stadiums where he took pictures for most of the last 55 years. Seor. Magic (Lens). Or simply, Lou. In the backstages of the city's ballparks, which run on a barter economy of small favors and easy smiles, scores of people who didn't know what else to call him were part of his everyday life for decades. 
Many of them turned out at the Greenwich Village Funeral Home on Tuesday where his full name and the dates that staked out the 93-year span of his life were listed on a digital display: Louis Requena, Dec. 12, 1919 - June 20, 2013.
''Eleven years ago, first day I'm shooting a game for The A.P., and I'm pretty anxious, and my editor says, 'find this older guy,' '' said Frank Franklin, a photographer for The Associated Press. ''He showed me around, made everything smooth. First inning, there was a play at the plate, runner sliding under the tag. That was the picture, and he nailed it. He was in his 80s.''
Mr. Requena was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, one of six children in a family that moved to New York 90 years ago. Except for a stint in Europe with the Army Air Forces during World War II, he spent the rest of his life in and around New York. ''He was always carrying a Brownie Instamatic,'' Wanda Betancourt, his niece, said.
In 1958, he had a job at a clothing store that sponsored a Latino baseball team, and after he shot a promotional picture of the team with the Yankees, he worked his way into taking pictures at the stadium.
He never left, covering the Yankees and the Mets for news agencies and newspapers.
Players came and went, their dramas caught in the blink of a shutter on film and digital cards. Behind the scenes were security guards and cooks and people like Mr. Requena, who stayed and whose memories were chiseled into place over seasons of familiarity. In 1998, four decades after Mr. Requena started shooting pictures, Eric Capstick began wandering Yankee Stadium with a video camera to capture the faces of fans to show on the scoreboard between innings.
''You see the same people working there, game after game,'' Mr. Capstick said. ''These are not deep connections. But over the years, they matter. There used to be a bar in the press room that was open for about 45 minutes after the game. When Lou started greeting me there, I was part of it.''
Mr. Requena's skill at scrounging ballpark food was legend. ''I fed him,'' said Charles Davis, who runs a buffet in the press room at Citifield. ''I was a new kid 15 years ago, a nobody in the press room, and as the old-timers retired, I stayed on. I wouldn't let him pay -- don't touch that cash register. Put it on me.''
Food was part of the currency Mr. Requena traded. As he got older, a knee injury made it harder for him to tote heavy gear. Jeff Feller, a social worker who was always at the stadium as a member of the Bleacher Creature brigade, was enlisted to help. ''I felt a nudge under the table after the first game, and he's whispering, 'Doggie bag,' and slipping me a package of food,'' Mr. Feller said.
Another time, he was doing a swap of memorabilia for some favor, but did not want to overpay. ''He's looking for a signed ball, and he's going through his things, and says, 'No, that's Yogi. That's DiMaggio. No. Mickey. No,' '' Mr. Feller said.
To avoid the stress of the stairs that led to the special fieldside dugout for the photographers, Mr. Requena set up in a small box, Section 11, just off first base. It let him shoot from a slightly higher angle than the other photographers.
In time, others moved in, but Mr. Requena protected the front row for still photographers. One day, the broadcaster Ed Randall showed up with a video cameraman and they were biding time in the coveted first row.
''Suddenly, Lou's yelling at me, 'You working? You working?' '' said Mr. Randall, who was among those who came to the funeral home.
Mr. Capstick, the fan-face videographer, recalled the moment in the bar when Mr. Requena began a benediction that became a ritual: ''He said, 'Good night, nice people. You too, Eric.' ''

HEADLINE: Akron Shakes Off Some Rust With Goodyear Tire's Help

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

 BODY:
AKRON, Ohio -- For much of the last three decades, the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company served as this city's signature global brand. The world's third-largest tire manufacturer, with $21 billion in revenue last year, was founded here in 1898 and stayed put even as B. F. Goodrich, Firestone and General Tire, its biggest competitors, closed their Akron plants and left in the 1980s.
In a word, Goodyear is devoted to this 188-year-old northeastern Ohio city. On May 13, in a step intended to sink deeper roots, the company's top executives gathered in the city's east end to formally open a 639,000-square-foot, seven-story, $160 million world headquarters for Goodyear, by far the largest office building ever constructed in Akron.
During the ribbon-cutting ceremony, Richard J. Kramer, Goodyear's chairman and chief executive, noted the building's advanced communications capacity, energy efficiency and other high-tech features. He described how the seven-story building, which is connected to the company's 860,000-square-foot Innovation Center that was renovated at a cost of $30 million, enabled the company's professional and research staff to collaborate more easily. 
But the most important facet of the new building, he said, is its location. ''We're proud,'' he said, raising a closed hand. ''We're very proud to be the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company of Akron, Ohio.''
''It's an important time in this city's history,'' said Jennifer A. Thomas, Akron program director for the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, one of the city's leading philanthropic organizations. ''Goodyear is a global technology company as much as they are a tire company, and they are committed to Akron. They represent a foundation, among others, of a new kind of economy that is developing here.''
Akron, founded in 1825 as a center of waterborne commerce along the 40-foot-wide Ohio and Erie Canal, knows something about era-defining transitions. Agriculture became such a mainstay in the mid-19th century that the small grain companies that merged to form Quaker Oats were started here. Quaker Oats operated a mill downtown until 1970.
Most of the city's development, though, centered on making tires for America's trucks and cars. From the time Benjamin Franklin Goodrich opened the city's first rubber factory in 1871 until the 1980s, the rank smell of heated rubber was this city's unmistakable industrial scent. The black dust of tire manufacturing hung over four separate mammoth tire manufacturing works, and a constellation of smaller plants.
Akron was a gritty and polluted city that employed 58,000 rubber industry workers in 1930. In 1960, the city's population peaked at 290,351, according to the census. Even as late as 1980, according to a study by the Brookings Institution's Metropolitan Policy Program, Akron's tire and rubber industry employed 26,000 people. But by the end of the decade, Goodyear was the only big rubber company left in Akron.
Today there is scant tire manufacturing in the city. B. F. Goodrich merged its operations with Uniroyal in 1986 and shut its three-million-square-foot Akron plant. Bridgestone, the Japanese company that bought Firestone in 1988, manufactures tires for Indy-class racing cars in a corner of its largely empty 1.3 million-square-foot plant on Akron's south end. Goodyear makes tires for Nascar races in a portion of its campus here.
Just like the other industrial cities of the Midwest that formed the Rust Belt, the end of tire manufacturing, and the loss of over 20,000 jobs, was the start of a long period of civic trauma that sent the city's population sliding. Last year, according to the census, the number of city residents dropped below 199,000, the lowest in a century.
Akron, though, is far from dead. Even as three tire companies departed, and Goodyear shrank its manufacturing operations, they left behind expansive campuses close to the city center that contained a collection of stalwart manufacturing buildings made of red brick and reinforced concrete that could be modernized to serve 21st-century markets.
In 2007, the Industrial Realty Group, a developer based in Downey, Calif., that specializes in turning old manufacturing sites into mixed-used developments, reached an agreement with the city and Goodyear to buy 480 acres of the company's campus for a mixed-use development named East End.
The development plan, activated in 2010 after a two-year delay caused by the recession, calls for constructing a $17 million, 135-room hotel and renovating the 292,000-square-foot Goodyear Hall that will house 110 market-rate apartments, retail space, a conference center and a theater at a cost of $36 million. Both are adjacent to an interchange for Interstate 76 and just north of the new headquarters.
Stuart Lichter, the founder and chairman of Industrial Realty, said his company also was spending $95 million to turn the 1.5 million-square-foot complex across the street, the site of Goodyear's old headquarters, into four stories and 800,000 square feet of office space, with three levels of indoor parking.
Construction on these projects has begun. The hotel and Goodyear Hall will be finished in 2014, said Mr. Lichter. The larger renovation concludes when the last tenant is recruited, he said, and could take several years.
Goodyear's bright, airy, library-quiet headquarters building, and the $40 million, 952,000-square-foot, five-story parking deck connected to it by an overhead walkway, lie at the southern end of the former Goodyear campus.
In all, private spending on the new headquarters, parking deck and the rest of the East End development is $378 million. The city, state, and federal governments are spending $227.6 million in public funds for infrastructure development, according to city figures.
Goodyear does not own its new headquarters or the parking structure. Under the terms of a single-tenant 25-year lease agreement negotiated by Mr. Lichter and Goodyear, the two structures are owned by Angelo, Gordon & Company, a New York-based real estate investment firm, which financed the construction costs of both and collects lease payments from Goodyear.
As part of the agreement, Mr. Lichter said he had to promise to ensure that Goodyear's cost for operating the new building would not exceed the cost of operating the obsolete headquarters that it was replacing.
Mr. Lichter was confident he could make the numbers work. In the late 1980s, he bought B. F. Goodrich's plant in Akron and collaborated with the city to turn it into Canal Place, a $30 million, 27-acre, 1.8 million-square-foot office and retail complex of 12 buildings that house almost 100 businesses and where more than 1,000 people work.
''Goodyear told me, 'If you can pull this off, we'll stay,' '' Mr. Lichter said. ''We pulled it off and they stayed.''
Mr. Lichter was helped by two other men who are widely credited with instigating the city's revival -- Akron's longtime mayor, Donald L. Plusquellic, who was first elected in 1987, and Luis M. Proenza, the president of the University of Akron since 1999.
Dr. Proenza led a $643 million capital construction project that turned a downtown commuter college into a research university. On a handsome and modern urban campus, it has influential programs in engineering and polymers, which are large molecules made by linking many similar smaller molecules.
The university's graduates, said Dr. Proenza, are working at a number of entrepreneurial high-tech companies in polymer development and engineering that are settling in and around Akron.
Mr. Plusquellic is described by his aides and business executives as a master at recruiting developers, negotiating for state and federal funds for infrastructure and at efficiently reviewing and approving city permits to build projects -- among them a convention center, a minor league baseball stadium and new and renovated office buildings.
''Goodyear wanted a fair deal, something they could get if they decided to move to another location,'' said Mr. Plusquellic. ''It was very valuable to keep them here. Not only for the jobs. We need Goodyear for Akron. We just couldn't lose them.''

HEADLINE: Dragging the Beach Blanket Out of the Attic

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- Next month Disney Channel's young viewers will be introduced to a movie genre -- the beach party film -- that hasn't been popular since their grandparents were teenagers.
''Teen Beach Movie'' has a kooky plot twist and will get a marketing push on par with the one Disney gave to the hugely successful ''High School Musical'' series. But will Disney's efforts result in a franchise-spawning hit? Or will ''Teen Beach Movie'' and its surfing, singing, super-silly characters end up, well, high and dry?
''We will find out,'' said a laughing Gary Marsh, president of Disney Channels Worldwide. ''We're certainly rolling the dice to some degree.''
The beach party film occupies a particularly dusty corner of the Hollywood curiosity cabinet. Movies like ''Beach Blanket Bingo,'' ''Gidget'' and ''How to Stuff a Wild Bikini'' surged from 1959 to the mid 1960s, driven by a postwar fascination with California and the growing power of young ticket buyers. But then the party abruptly ended as social change engulfed moviegoers, shifting their taste in films. 
''With all of the social upheaval, these films became impossible to sell by about 1970,'' explained Jeanine Basinger, the chairwoman of Wesleyan University's film studies department. ''The wholesome, innocent, endless summers became utterly unrelatable.''
Relatability is a paramount concern in children's entertainment. But Disney Channel is betting that kids will see ''Teen Beach Movie'' as a fresh take on the musical format. Mr. Marsh has already served up break-into-song movies (''High School Musical'' and its sequels) and performance-based films, including ''Lemonade Mouth'' and, to some degree, ''Camp Rock.''
''I challenged everybody internally to find a different way to do a musical,'' Mr. Marsh said. ''I wanted a reinvention of the musical form.''
He got it and then some. In ''Teen Beach Movie,'' two modern adolescents are transported into ''Wet Side Story,'' an over-the-top 1962 tale of surfers versus bikers. The characters from the film within the film -- Tanner, Butchy, Seacat, Cheechee, Giggles, Lugnut and Struts -- welcome the interlopers.
But the modern visitors inadvertently change the plot. Complicating any hope of escape. (''Oh, bonkers!'')
Multiplex efforts to reinvent the beach party genre over the years have sputtered. The independent film ''Monster Beach Party'' gave it a whirl in 2009, but took in a grand total of $112,791 at the box office. ''Summer Catch,'' which tried to recapture the beach spirit without the singing, was a bust in 2001, costing $45 million to make and selling about $26 million in tickets, after adjusting for inflation.
The last full-on beach party film a big studio tried was ''Back to the Beach,'' a Paramount release in 1987 that took in a modest $27 million.
Disney Channel's immediate goal with ''Teen Beach Movie'' is to win big ratings and sell DVDs. If the film strikes a cultural chord like ''High School Musical,'' which became a $1 billion franchise (including CDs, clothing lines, theme park extensions and local stage shows), all the better.
''Teen Beach Movie,'' which will premiere on July 19, is a nod to Disney's distant past: Annette Funicello, of course, started as a Mouseketeer before teaming with Frankie Avalon in 1963 for ''Beach Party,'' which led to several follow-up films, including ''Beach Blanket Bingo'' in 1965.
That tie-in is likely to be lost on Disney's young viewers, but they may spot another connection: Garrett Clayton, who plays the heartthrob Tanner, a ''mannequin with six rows of teeth,'' in the words of one character, bears a striking resemblance to Zac Efron, who formed the gooey center of ''High School Musical.'' Ross Lynch and Maia Mitchell star as the modern teenagers.
Mr. Marsh thinks Disney Channel viewers ages 6 to 14 will be able to relate to ''Teen Beach Movie,'' partly because of its similarities to ''Grease,'' the enduringly popular 1978 musical about high school life in the '50s. An important scene in ''Teen Beach Movie'' takes place at a slumber party, just as one in ''Grease'' does.
''Teen Beach Movie'' also comes with empowered modern girls who bristle at the antiquated views on gender roles in ''Wet Side Story.'' Rolling her eyes at the boy-crazy antics of one of the girls in ''Wet Side Story,'' Ms. Mitchell's character asks, ''Why does she need a boy to be happy?'' (The answer: ''Because it's 1962.'')
''Disney, contrary to what you might think, is open to a wide variety of pitches,'' said Vince Marcello, one of the writers of the movie. ''People told me not to even bring this idea to Disney. They said it was too out there for Disney.''
Disney is backing its latest musical confection with a particularly hefty marketing campaign. The company started promoting the movie with TV commercials on New Year's Eve. Cast members recently started crisscrossing the country on a mall tour. There have been promotions at Typhoon Lagoon, a Disney World water park, and at One Direction concerts.
''Teen Beach Movie'' was assembled by a creative team as wacky as the film itself. Mr. Marcello's only previous movie writing experience was a short student film, ''Zombie Prom.'' (It was based on the Off Broadway show of the same title.) Another ''Teen Beach Movie'' writer, Robert Horn, got his start writing on the television series ''Designing Women.''
The movie's director, Jeffrey Hornaday, also started his career with campy 1980s entertainment, providing choreography for movies including ''Flashdance'' and ''Romancing the Stone.'' But the retro costumes were designed by Ruth E. Carter, best known for her Oscar-nominated work on serious films like ''Amistad'' and ''Malcolm X.''
''The mantra was, 'Let's go as absolutely over the top as we can go,'' said Mr. Hornaday, who previously directed a Disney Channel movie called ''Geek Charming.'' ''I wanted big Busby Berkeley overhead shots -- the works.''
He added, ''Nobody remembers what these beach party movies really looked like anyway.''

HEADLINE: Car Sharing Grows With Fewer Strings Attached

BYLINE: By SALLY McGRANE

 BODY:
BERLIN -- Marc Clemens, founder and chief executive of Sommelier Priv, an online wine service, gave up owning a car a year and a half ago. When he wants to drive to work in the morning, he checks his smartphone to see where a particular BMW, Smart car or Mini is parked and takes it.
Once he gets to his destination, Mr. Clemens parks the car on the street and forgets about it.
He relies exclusively on two car-sharing services, DriveNow and Car2Go. ''I use this three to four times a day,'' he said, as he dropped off a colleague in front of a wine bar in the German capital's Mitte district on a recent Sunday evening. ''To get to work, for business meetings, going out to a bar. I like it because it's one-way.'' 
Car sharing has been around for decades in Europe and has caught on in the United States with Zipcar. These station-based car-sharing services require members to pick up vehicles from a particular place, which may or may not be convenient. Users usually need to reserve cars in advance for prearranged, prepaid blocks of time and, when they are done with the car, they have to return it to the same place -- all factors that have limited car sharing's attractiveness.
Berlin, though, has become the largest one-way, car-sharing city in the world. One-way or free-floating services, which recently started in the United States, use GPS and smartphone apps for far more flexible car sharing. Cars are parked on city streets, and users pick up cars parked nearest to them. Instead of bringing the car back to a lot, users leave it wherever they find parking near their destination. They are charged for the amount of time they spend driving.
These new systems have been making an impression. Since the first commercial one-way car-sharing systems started in Germany two years ago, 183,000 people have signed up, according to Bundesverband CarSharing -- a large number, considering that long-established car-sharing systems in Germany have 262,000 members. Car2Go has started service in 11 North American cities including Austin, Tex., Seattle and Washington. DriveNow is in San Francisco, but it uses the older station-based model.
''It's going to alter what car sharing is,'' said Susan Shaheen, co-director of the Transportation Sustainability Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley. ''We didn't have the technology to do this in the '90s.''
Two of Germany's biggest automakers are squarely behind the idea. DriveNow is a joint venture of BMW and the car rental company Sixt, and Car2Go is a subsidiary of Daimler. (In the United States, DriveNow is solely BMW's venture.)
''We grew up having everything; maybe our parents had two cars. And now, with the current generation, there's a trend toward shared economies,'' said Michael Fischer, a spokesman for DriveNow in Germany. ''As a car manufacturer, do you want to lose this group? Or offer them something? Because, apparently, you cannot sell to them.''
Car2Go, which uses fleets of Daimler's Smart cars, pioneered the one-way model with a pilot project in Ulm, Germany, in 2009. ''More and more, people in cities don't want their own cars. But in many ways, car sharing was unattractive,'' said Andreas Leo, a spokesman for Car2Go in Europe. ''It was hard to reach, you had to book in advance, you had to pay a monthly fee whether you used the car or not. We looked at the technology and decided to develop car sharing without these restrictions.''
Now in 21 cities, Car2Go puts its worldwide membership at 400,000. Berlin, with 1,200 cars, has the company's largest fleet. DriveNow, whose fleet is made up of Minis and other BMWs, is active in four German cities with 700 cars in Berlin.
It doesn't cost much to join; the idea is that a short trip should cost less than a taxi. DriveNow costs about $39 to register and 32 to 46 cents a minute to drive. The Car2Go registration fee is about $27 and 39 cents a minute to drive.
One-way car sharers tend to be about 30 years old, male and technophiles. Both Car2Go and DriveNow, however, report that the longer they are in a city, the more women and older people join. ''It is a new kind of mobility, a new stage of mobility, especially for young people,'' said Christoph Menzel, a professor with the Institute for Traffic Management at the Ostfalia University of Applied Sciences.
Mr. Menzel, who is compiling a study of one-way car sharing, predicts that the market for free-floating cars will explode in the next years, but he has doubts about profitability. ''It's working well for the people using it,'' he said. ''But the concern is that companies' costs are higher than benefits.''
Car2Go says four cities are profitable thus far. ''We want to make money,'' the company's Mr. Leo said. ''This is not a marketing gag or a charity concept.''
DriveNow and Car2Go each report that in Berlin hundreds of new users sign up for one-way car sharing every day. Other car companies have noticed and are joining in. Last year, Flinkster, the station-based car-sharing company run by Deutsche Bahn, the German railway company, partnered with Citron's one-way car-sharing company, Multicity, for a pilot project that now has 350 free-floating cars in Berlin. ''Things are developing, and we can try everything, from bikes to electric cars, to improve the mobility chain,'' said Susan Sass, a Deutsche Bahn spokeswoman. ''We can see if the clients like it.''
In Berlin, some people are concerned that the popularity of the new car-sharing systems will encourage people to drive rather than walk, bike or use buses and subways. ''Environmentally speaking, that would be a step backward,'' said Gabi Lambrecht, a spokeswoman for Bundesverband CarSharing.
One-way car-sharing companies say most of their members have monthly or yearly passes for public transportation, and that their systems enhance rather than compete with existing modes of transportation. If anything, they say, it will make it easier for urbanites to give up their cars if they know they have easy access to an automobile when they want it.
On a recent Friday afternoon, in the bustling Car2Go office in central Berlin, Kathrin Ilic was signing up for a Car2Go membership because friends had told her how convenient it was. She said she would use Car2Go for one specific trip: to take her daughter to visit a friend who lives on the other side of the city. ''I have to transfer three times using public transportation,'' said Ms. Ilic, whose partner uses the family car. ''My little mouse is 5, and with all the toys and the blankets, it would be nice to have a car.''

HEADLINE: Bittersweet Achievement On Climate

BYLINE: By JASON BORDOFF and MICHAEL LEVI. 
Jason Bordoff, director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia, advised , President Obama on energy and climate change. Michael Levi is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and the author, most recently, of ''The Power Surge: Energy, Opportunity, and the Battle for America's Future.''

 BODY:
PRESIDENT OBAMA's announcement on Tuesday that he will use his executive authority to regulate carbon-dioxide emissions from existing power plants, and to finalize rules for plants that have yet to be built, is reason to celebrate -- but also an occasion for mourning. The announcement reflects Congress's refusal to pass serious laws to curb greenhouse-gas emissions. Ultimately, if America is to fully contribute to an effective global response to the perils of a warming planet, Congress must stop dithering.
The dangers of climate change are rising as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation worldwide boost atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide. In March that concentration passed 400 parts per million -- a concentration not seen for several million years, according to the best available evidence. It is on a pace to climb far higher in the coming decades, unless emissions are curbed. The United States is only one piece of that global puzzle, but it is an essential one. 
For many years, advocates of serious action on climate change have rightly emphasized the importance of putting a price on carbon so that energy prices reflect the damage to society caused by carbon dioxide emissions. Whether through a cap-and-trade system, carbon tax, or an equivalent measure, a carbon price would boost the development of low-carbon technologies while deterring the use of carbon-intensive fuels.
Not long ago, both sides of the aisle agreed on this principle, which has the support of mainstream economists. The administration of President George Bush pioneered a cap-and-trade system in the early 1990s, to deal with acid rain, and as presidential candidates in 2008, Barack Obama and John McCain both promoted cap-and-trade systems that would have slashed greenhouse-gas emissions over the next 40 years.
After cap-and-trade passed the House by a hair in 2009, the Senate was unable to muster the 60 votes necessary to pass a companion bill. Cap-and-trade is now demonized as a ''job killing'' regulation -- a ''full-blown fleecing of the middle class,'' as House Speaker John A. Boehner put it. A carbon tax would significantly reduce the deficit and raise revenue -- without taxing work or investment. Yet this common-sense idea seems politically impossible in today's Washington.
This has left the Obama administration with little choice but to use its authority under the Clean Air Act to reduce emissions from existing and new power plants. These new rules should be flexible and cost-effective. This is made more feasible by the growing abundance of natural gas and alternative fuels that give America other resources for cutting emissions. Mr. Obama's announcement will also make the United States a more credible player as it tries to encourage other countries to curb their emissions.
But the Clean Air Act, enacted in 1963 and subsequently amended, was designed to deal with local pollution problems like acid rain. These are radically different from global challenges like climate change, and the act is limited in its reach. In the short term, regulation can curb emissions from existing coal-fired plants and produce big gains in energy efficiency. But in the long term, a price on carbon throughout the economy would let the market decide how best to reduce emissions at the lowest cost. The refusal of Congress to act will hurt Americans; it will raise the cost of cutting future emissions and expose Americans to higher costs from storms, floods, droughts and other weather-related events.
The world is watching while Congress sits on its hands. The Obama administration recently raised its estimate of the economic damage caused by carbon emissions by two-thirds, reflecting an improved understanding among independent experts of the impact of rising sea levels and other developments relating to climate change.
Mr. Obama deserves credit for taking a politically difficult step, but we fear that people will view regulation as an adequate substitute for Congressional action. For the United States to do its full and essential part to avoid the worst risks of climate change, and to achieve emissions reductions that will take many decades, and occur among economic and technology changes we cannot yet anticipate, Congress must act.

HEADLINE: Frustration Over Closing Of a Space in East Harlem

BYLINE: By MONA EL NAGGAR

 BODY:
The Julia de Burgos Cultural Center, a city-owned building in East Harlem, has long been an important hub for the neighborhood's Latino population. Named after a renowned Puerto Rican poet, the five-story building served as a place for local artists to showcase their work and residents to gather to celebrate birthdays, hold funerals, discuss community affairs and dance salsa.
''It was about all of us coming together,'' said Marina Ortiz, founder of East Harlem Preservation, a group dedicated to preserving East Harlem's culture and history. Ms. Ortiz said she used to visit the center regularly for almost 20 years, before New York City officials closed a large multipurpose space and theater there over a year and a half ago for renovation and to find a new operator. 
''It was torn out from under us,'' she said, adding that her efforts to determine why it was taking so long to reopen the two rooms had been futile. Other parts of the center remain in use, but work has not even begun on the renovation.
Having grown frustrated, a coalition of community leaders and artists plan to stage a series of street performances as a form of protest outside the Julia de Burgos center, starting Wednesday, to pressure the city.
''It's not about one show; it's about no show,'' said Eugene Rodriguez, a playwright and longtime resident of East Harlem who is leading the effort. ''Latino artists have no access to Latino institutions in the neighborhood. It kills me. It really kills me.''
Mr. Rodriguez, 65, swallowed, looked away and started to cry.
City officials contend the changes will benefit the neighborhood and local cultural groups. But many residents and activists say they view the delay as part of the marginalization of East Harlem's working-class Latino population and the city's disinterest in preserving the Puerto Rican identity of a neighborhood undergoing a slow but steady gentrification.
''The Julia de Burgos is symptomatic of the larger issue,'' said Marta Moreno Vega, founder of the Caribbean Cultural Center and a former director of El Museo del Barrio. ''The disparity in the way that culture and art is understood in the city and the way that resources are distributed and attention is given is what you see in the Julia de Burgos.''
The building, on Lexington Avenue between 105th and 106th Streets, that houses the multipurpose room and the theater also contains other exhibition and performance areas and a public school. The city rents out space to various Latino art groups, including Taller Boricua, which had operated the 2,800-square-foot multipurpose space and occasionally used the 160-seat theater.
In September 2010, the city's Economic Development Corporation announced plans to renovate and reorganize the administration of the two spaces, saying that they were mismanaged and underused.
In November 2011, the city selected the Hispanic Federation, a nonprofit organization, to operate and maintain the two spaces. But the city and the Hispanic Federation are still negotiating the terms of the lease, and the rooms remain locked.
Responding to neighborhood complaints, City Councilwoman Melissa Mark-Viverito, who represents the area, has been working with the development corporation, and on Friday she said the city would find a way for cultural groups to rent out the spaces while the lease was being negotiated.
The development corporation said in a statement on Tuesday that ''local groups will have the opportunity to rent space'' on a temporary basis, but it had yet to work out the fees and other details.
''I hear the frustration but I'm asking for patience still,'' Ms. Mark-Viverito said in a phone interview.
Still, some activists are not satisfied.
''Why should we be patient?'' Ms. Ortiz said. ''Why should we accept vague assurances? I want precise answers: When, where, who, how.''
As to why it has taken so long to hammer out a lease, Jose Calderon, the president of the Hispanic Federation, said renovations promised by the city were yet to be completed. ''Any tenants moving into a space want certain things done,'' he said.
Ms. Mark-Viverito said that her office had set aside nearly $1 million for renovations, but that the expenditure was only recently approved by the city's Office of Management and Budget.
Sitting on the stoop of his house on 118th Street, Mr. Rodriguez waited for Ms. Ortiz and a number of other neighbors, artists and friends to arrive for a meeting to discuss Wednesday's protest. He said he planned to deliver a Shakespearean-style speech: ''Friends! Latinos! Countrymen! Lend me your ears! I come to praise La Julia not to bury her!''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Taking a Risk Over Climate

BYLINE: By JUSTIN GILLIS; John M. Broder contributed reporting.

 BODY:
With no chance of Congressional support, President Obama is staking part of his legacy on a big risk: that he can substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions by stretching the intent of a law decades old and not written with climate change in mind.
His plan, unveiled Tuesday at Georgetown University in Washington, will set off legal and political battles that will last years. 
But experts say that if all goes well for the president, the plan could potentially meet his stated goal of an overall emissions reduction of 17 percent by 2020, compared with the level in 2005.
''If the question is, 'Will this solve our emissions problem?' the answer is no,'' said Michael A. Levi, an energy analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. ''If the question is, 'Could this move us along the path we want to be on?' the answer is yes, it could.''
In his speech, Mr. Obama said he would use executive powers to limit the carbon dioxide that power plants could emit. He also called for government spending to promote the development of energy alternatives, and committed to helping cities and states protect themselves from rising seas and other effects of climate change.
But formally, the main thing he did on Tuesday was order the Environmental Protection Agency to devise an emissions control plan, with the first draft due in a year. Experts say he will be lucky to get a final plan in place by the time he leaves office in early 2017.
Mr. Obama is trying to ensure continuation of a trend already under way: emissions in the United States have been falling for several years. But at the global scale, they are rising fast, and as the president acknowledged, it will take much stronger international action to turn that around and head off the worst effects of climate change.
''For the world at large, the United States is just one piece of the puzzle,'' Mr. Levi said.
Already, glaciers are melting, heat waves and heavy rains are increasing, the food system is under stress and the sea is rising. The best that can be hoped for, scientists say, is to limit the damage, or slow it enough to provide society more time to adjust.
The president recognized that in his plan, calling for more steps to help the country prepare, from strengthening sea walls to hardening the electrical grid.
The heart of Mr. Obama's plan, however, is lowering the country's emissions using administrative remedies, an effort to sidestep a recalcitrant Congress. The success of that goal will depend on how far the administration is able to stretch the boundaries of the Clean Air Act, signed into law by President Richard M. Nixon in 1970.
The Supreme Court has already ruled that it can be used to regulate greenhouse gases, which include carbon dioxide emissions, but figuring out how to do that within the technical requirements of the law will be a major challenge.
The administration's thinking appears to have been influenced by a proposal from an environmental group, the Natural Resources Defense Council.
The group urged a creative approach, calling on the federal government to set a target level of greenhouse gases for each state, taking account of historical patterns. A state generating a lot of power from coal, then exporting it to other states, would not be unduly penalized, for instance.
As the environmental group envisions it, states would meet their goals by tweaking the overall electrical system, not just by cracking down on individual power plants. States might urge companies to produce more renewable power, for instance, but they could also retrofit homes and businesses to reduce energy waste, or encourage the use of clean-burning natural gas instead of coal.
States would presumably be allowed to use market signals, like a price on greenhouse emissions, to achieve their goals, as California and nine Northeastern states are already doing.
It is unclear how much all this might cost at the retail level. The Natural Resources Defense Council argues that even if prices go up, electric bills for many consumers could actually decline as their homes were retrofitted to use less energy.
The fossil-fuel industry and its allies in Congress are certain to argue that the president's plan will be ruinously expensive and require the shutdown of numerous coal-burning power plants. Republican leaders immediately condemned the plan as a job-killer and framed it as an attack on coal.
The political attraction of a state-led approach is that it would move a lot of the nitty-gritty decision making out of Washington. But, for that very reason, it would entail legal risk. The Clean Air Act, written in the heyday of environmentalism, basically envisions commandments from Washington ordering utilities to clean up the air, not flexible approaches.
While carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere reached a historic level of 400 parts per million last month, emissions from the United States have been falling, partly because of the weak economy but also because of the newfound abundance of natural gas from hydraulic fracturing. Gas has displaced a lot of coal in power generation; such switching cuts greenhouse emissions nearly in half for a given amount of electricity produced.
Other factors, like tougher building codes, are contributing to the decline. And transport emissions are falling in part because of one of Mr. Obama's policies: tough fuel-efficiency measures for new cars.
But modest reductions already achieved in the United States and other Western countries are being swamped by rising emissions from the East. So the real question is whether technologies can be developed, and then deployed worldwide, that allow for continued economic growth and rising energy use with minimal greenhouse emissions.
In his speech, Mr. Obama sought to reclaim global leadership on climate change for the United States. His plan includes ideas and money for making global progress.
Daniel P. Schrag, head of Harvard's Center for the Environment, said the president's plan would succeed only if it created market conditions unleashing the creative power of American capitalism, calling forth greater innovation in the energy industry.
Mr. Obama nodded to that point in his speech, noting that ''countries like China and Germany are going all in'' on the clean energy race. ''I believe Americans build things better than anybody else,'' he said. ''I want America to win that race, but we can't win it if we're not in it.''

HEADLINE: Suit To Move Forward

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
A New York State appeals court ruled on Tuesday that a lawsuit by the attorney general against Maurice R. Greenberg, the former chief executive of the American International Group, can proceed. 
The decision by the Court of Appeals will let the attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, move forward with an eight-year-old case first brought by Eliot L. Spitzer and then by Andrew M. Cuomo -- and could eventually lead to an appearance by Mr. Greenberg on the stand.
The battle arises from accusations that Mr. Greenberg and a former chief financial officer of A.I.G., Howard Smith, allowed the insurer to commit accounting fraud that led to a $3.9 billion restatement in 2005. The case predates the firm's $182 billion government bailout during the financial crisis of 2008.
Earlier this year, Mr. Schneiderman took the unusual step of dropping his right to contest the settlement of a separate class-action lawsuit -- and the right to win cash damages in its own legal action -- pushing instead with his effort to bar Mr. Greenberg from the securities industry and from serving as a director or officer of a publicly traded company.
Some have publicly questioned the wisdom of pursuing the lawsuit. Two former New York governors, Mario Cuomo and George Pataki, wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal earlier this year that criticized Mr. Schneiderman's efforts as ''a dead-end case'' that was not a worthwhile endeavor.
In its decision, the appeals court noted the long duration of the lawsuit, writing, ''The course of the litigation has been long, and some issues have fallen by the wayside.'' But the judges dismissed arguments by lawyers for Mr. Greenberg and Mr. Smith that other legal battles, including a lawsuit by the Securities and Exchange Commission, fully covered all possible relief.
''There is no doubt room for argument about whether the lifetime bans that the attorney general proposes would be a justifiable exercise of a court's discretion,'' the judges wrote. ''But that question, as well as the availability of any other equitable relief that the attorney general may seek, must be decided by the lower courts in the first instance.''
Damien LaVera, a spokesman for Mr. Schneiderman's office, said in a statement: ''Attorney General Schneiderman is committed to ensuring that anyone who commits fraud is held accountable for their actions no matter how wealthy they are or how many powerful friends they have. Today's decision means we will have an opportunity to establish in court Hank Greenberg's role in this fraud and hold him accountable.''
David Boies, a lawyer for Mr. Greenberg, said in a statement: ''We are pleased that the attorney general's claim for damages, which throughout the eight years of this litigation has been the focus of the case, has now been dismissed. We are disappointed that the Court of Appeals did not dismiss the attorney general's recently raised claims for injunctive relief, but we are confident that the action will be dismissed by the lower courts because the state cannot demonstrate that it is entitled to injunctive or disgorgement remedies against Mr. Greenberg and Mr. Smith.''

HEADLINE: Overhaul May Benefit, Not Hurt, U.S. Workers

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
Are American workers are about to experience unwelcome new competition for their jobs? The bill moving through Congress to overhaul the nation's immigration laws, if approved, would give employers access to expanded visa programs that would admit hundreds of thousands of immigrant workers, of both low and high skills, to toil in workplaces from strawberry fields to technology companies.
The legislation also offers legal status to millions of immigrants working illegally across the country, and ultimately a shot at citizenship. The change would encourage many to roam freely throughout the economy, leaving dead-end jobs in immigrant-heavy sectors of the labor market to seek higher pay elsewhere. 
But by many accounts, most American workers need not worry about the prospect of hordes of workers entering the country with an eye on their jobs. Rather, immigration is seen as more likely to leave American workers better off.
The latest organization to come to this conclusion is the Congressional Budget Office, which issued a report this month concluding that the immigration bill would add six million workers to the American job market by 2023 and nine million by 2033 -- increasing the labor force by 5 percent.
In the beginning, the jump in immigration would hit pay, the office said. It expects that by 2023 average wages would be 0.1 percent lower, on average, than they would have been absent a change in law.
Still, most American workers would have little to worry about. Average wages would decline to a large extent because most of the new immigrant workers would be paid less than domestic laborers, pulling the average down. Most importantly, the decline would only be temporary. Wages would rise as businesses invested to take advantage of the expanded labor force. By 2033, the C.B.O. forecast, average wages would be 0.5 percent higher than they would have been without the new immigrants.
These conclusions may seem to fly in the face of the laws of supply and demand. But they are not quite so odd. They can become obvious, in fact, when accounting for the response of American companies, and workers, to the inflows of foreign labor.
The belief that immigration would simply displace American workers relies on the assumption that employers would do nothing but replace a costlier domestic labor force with cheaper imports. But companies actually invest and expand to reap the higher profits that the new labor allows. This provides new opportunities for immigrants and domestic workers alike.
In other words, immigration can produce jobs for Americans, too. Restaurants are much less common in Norway than the United States because Norway lacks the cheap labor -- making a dinner out in Oslo prohibitively expensive. In many New York restaurants, the American waiters and maitre d' owe their jobs to the underpaid immigrants working illegally in the kitchen, whose low wages allow the restaurant to exist.
What's more, immigration expands productivity. Highly skilled immigrant workers generate more productive innovations. And the influx of new workers of a variety of skills, high and low, would promote specialization.
Giovanni Peri, an economist at the University of California, Davis, and Chad Sparber of Colgate University found that American workers in states with large shares of less-educated immigrants gravitate towards communications-related occupations, their area of comparative advantage, while the immigrants stick to manual tasks and physical labor.
This increases the growth rate of the economy and pushes wages higher. Mr. Peri estimated that the wave of immigrants that entered the United States between 1990 and 2007 increased workers' incomes by about $5,100 a year on average, in 2005 dollars. This amounts to more than a fifth of the income gains over the period.
There will be losers, especially among the workers most like the newcomers. A 50-year-old janitor with no high school diploma, for instance, will find it hard to make a transition into another job when immigrants move into the building maintenance business. But this group is probably small, and composed mostly of illegal immigrants already in the workplace.
George Borjas of Harvard University argues that those without a high school diploma -- about 8 percent of the labor force -- are easily replaced by immigrants and are likely to suffer a noticeable drop in wages if low-skill immigration increases. Mr. Peri disagrees. He argues that high-school dropouts could find jobs in parts of the labor market that might even benefit from new immigrants' arrival.
The Congressional Budget Office looked at it differently. Rather than split the work force by educational attainment, it sliced it into five equal cohorts of skill, from the least educated fifth to the most. It found that none of these groups is hurt by immigration over the long run, in absolute terms. Some gain more, and some gain less.
Unskilled American workers -- who never completed high school, or maybe got an equivalency diploma -- would do relatively poorly. So would highly educated workers, who would face more competition from new immigrant scientists and engineers with H1-B visas.
Average wages in both these slices would decline 0.3 percent relative to the average by 2033. The rest of workers, by contrast, would see their relative wages rise by 0.5 percent.
But even though the gains would not be distributed evenly, according to the study, every group would win. ''Average wages would be higher under the bill than under current law for workers in all quintiles of the skill distribution,'' it said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Factory Orders Seen as Sign Of Rising Investment Plans

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Businesses stepped up their orders in May for long-lasting manufactured goods, and a gauge of their investment plans rose for a third straight month.
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that orders for durable goods rose 3.6 percent, matching April's gain. Most of the increase was because of a rise in commercial aircraft orders, which tend to fluctuate sharply from month to month. Still, businesses also ordered more computers, communications equipment, machinery and metals. 
A category of orders that is viewed as a proxy for business investment plans -- which excludes the volatile areas of transportation and military goods -- rose 1.1 percent. That matched similar gains in April and March, suggesting that businesses are growing more confident in the economy.
This category of orders had not increased for three straight months since the fall of 2011. The consecutive increases raised hopes for a pickup in American manufacturing in the second half of the year.
Some economists had feared that orders that reflect business investment would be weak in May. Paul Ashworth, an economist at Capital Economics, said the pickup in orders should translate into a stronger economic growth in the July-September quarter.
Manufacturing in the United States has struggled this year, in part because economic weakness around the world has slowed the demand for American exports. Economists said that some businesses may also be acting more cautious because of deep federal spending cuts that began in March. One measure of manufacturing activity fell in May to the lowest level in four years.
Overall demand for durable goods, which are items expected to last at least three years, rose to a seasonally adjusted $231 billion in May, or 7.7 percent more than the level a year ago.
The Commerce Department report showed that the demand for transportation products increased 10.2 percent in May, led by a 51 percent surge in orders for commercial aircraft. Orders for motor vehicles and parts fell 1.2 percent.
Excluding transportation, orders increased 0.7 percent in May. The rise in April was 1.7 percent.
Orders for heavy machinery rose 1.2 percent. Demand for computers increased 1 percent. And demand for primary metals like steel rose 0.9 percent. Orders for communications equipment increased 12.6 percent.

HEADLINE: Ecuador Risks Trade Problems With U.S. if It Grants Asylum to Snowden

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN and MARK LANDLER; William Neuman reported from Quito, Ecuador, and Mark Landler from Washington. Maggy Ayala contributed reporting from Quito.

 BODY:
QUITO, Ecuador -- President Rafael Correa of Ecuador has more than just the ire of United States to consider as he weighs an asylum request from Edward J. Snowden, the fugitive intelligence contractor trying to dodge American authorities.
Mr. Correa has some tangible factors to think about as well -- namely Ecuadorean exports like fresh-cut roses and frozen broccoli.
In recent months, Mr. Correa's government has been in Washington, lobbying to retain preferential treatment for some key Ecuadorean products. But that favored status, which means keeping thousands of jobs in Ecuador and cheaper goods for American consumers, could be among the first casualties if Mr. Correa grants asylum to Mr. Snowden.
While the downside for Ecuadorean rose growers, artichoke canners and tuna fishermen (whose products also get preferential treatment) is clear, the material benefits of granting asylum to Mr. Snowden are far less so. The decision could ultimately rest on the combative personality of Mr. Correa and his regional ambitions. 
''The risks are enormous,'' said Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a policy group in Washington. Referring to Mr. Correa, he said, ''It would bring the United States down very hard on him.''
Mr. Correa, fresh off a landslide re-election victory, glories in a fight. He relishes tweaking the United States and may aspire to take on the mantle of leader of the Latin American left that was once worn by Hugo Chvez, the loudly anti-imperialist president of Venezuela, who died in March.
''Rhetorically, he aspires to be a leader, and this may be a situation that's hard for him to resist just given his nature and his temperament,'' Mr. Shifter said.
Relations with the United States have been rocky almost since Mr. Correa first took office in 2007. He stopped American antidrug flights from an Ecuadorean military base. In 2011, he kicked out the American ambassador, angered by a diplomatic cable revealed by WikiLeaks that suggested he was aware of police corruption and looked the other way.
Last year, he gave asylum in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London to the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, on the grounds that he risked persecution and possibly the death penalty if he were to be charged in the United States for revealing secret State Department cables and other materials.
The two countries exchanged ambassadors again last year, but things have not always gone smoothly for the new American envoy, Adam E. Namm.
Last month, Mr. Correa, who has warred continually with the news media in his country, reacted angrily after Mr. Namm attended an event in favor of freedom of expression that was organized by the National Journalists Union. Mr. Correa called Mr. Namm a meddler and warned him to behave. The foreign minister, Ricardo Patio, said darkly that the next time he might get more than just a warning.
The last sustained high-level contact between the two countries may have come in 2010, when Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton visited Ecuador. During that visit, Mr. Correa told her, ''We're not anti-American; we love America,'' and he described his years as a student at the University of Illinois as the happiest of his life.
But Mrs. Clinton pressed him on his government's crackdown on the news media, and when an Ecuadorean journalist challenged him about his policies at a news conference, the president rebuked him while Mrs. Clinton watched stone-faced.
The most likely casualty of sheltering Mr. Snowden would be the trade preferences, which have been in place since the early 1990s. Originally designed for several Andean nations, Ecuador is the last remaining recipient. But the preferences, which applied to about $429 million in non-oil exports last year, expire at the end of July unless they are renewed by Congress.
That renewal was already in doubt, not least of all, officials said, because the oil giant Chevron has been lobbying hard against Ecuador. The campaign is part of Chevron's response to an $18 billion penalty against the company ordered by an Ecuadorean court in a case over environmental damages related to oil drilling in the Amazon.
But Ecuador has begun its own campaign to keep the preferences, including a Web site called Keep Trade Going, that urges Americans to contact their legislators to ask them to vote in favor of the pact.
At the same time, Ecuador has staked out a fallback position, petitioning to include roses, frozen broccoli and canned artichokes in a separate trade program, the Generalized System of Preferences. That decision is controlled by the White House, so Ecuador is essentially asking President Obama's help in getting around opposition in Congress.
Mr. Obama must decide by Monday whether he will include those items -- a move that becomes increasingly thorny as the standoff over Mr. Snowden continues.
The question remains how heavily Mr. Correa will weigh such economic considerations.
''It is something that will adversely affect the Ecuadorean economy,'' said Dan Restrepo, an adviser to Mr. Obama on Latin American policy until last year. ''But I don't know whether it's enough to stop him.''
Analysts said that if Mr. Correa gives asylum to Mr. Snowden the United States could also try to isolate Ecuador politically, asking allies in the region to step up pressure on issues like press freedom. The same weekend that Mr. Snowden's asylum request was made public, Mr. Correa signed a new media law that critics say would quash much critical coverage of the government.
But Orlando Prez, the director of El Telgrafo, a government-owned newspaper, said that granting asylum to Mr. Snowden should not provoke a confrontation with the United States. ''What is at play is to guarantee human rights,'' he said. ''Rather than hurt Ecuador it puts it in a kind of political vanguard in Latin America.''
Many in Latin America feel that the Obama administration has not made relations in the region a priority, and the episode may become another example of Washington's waning influence.
The standoff last year over Mr. Assange, who took refuge in Ecuador's embassy in London to escape being sent to Sweden, where he is wanted for questioning on allegations he sexually assaulted two women, gave Mr. Correa a chance to portray himself as the defiant leader of a tiny country standing up to a world power. Mr. Snowden's request allows him to do the same again.
Both cases also helped Mr. Correa defend himself against charges that he is too harsh with the press, allowing him to portray himself as a champion of transparency.
Mauricio Gndara, a former ambassador to London who is critical of Mr. Correa, said the president aspired to become an admired Latin American leftist like Mr. Chvez or Fidel Castro.
''How much damage it does to Ecuador is another matter,'' Mr. Gndara said. ''They want to go beyond Chvez, they want to challenge the world.''

HEADLINE: Report Finds Lapses in United States Aid Efforts in Haiti

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

 BODY:
MEXICO CITY -- The agency managing some of the United States' signature projects to rebuild Haiti after the 2010 earthquake has yet to spend a large amount of the money Congress authorized and has scaled back planned housing because of delays and complications, according to a report Tuesday by a government watchdog.
The report, by the Government Accountability Office, raised concern among members of Congress who have questioned how well taxpayer funds are being spent in Haiti, more than three years after the January 2010 quake devastated large parts of the country. 
The report focused on the United States Agency for International Development and $651 million appropriated to it in 2010, out of a total of $1.14 billion Congress authorized then for rebuilding Haiti.
The agency, the report found, had spent just 31 percent, or $204 million, of its allocation, and Congress lacks information to track spending and the progress of reconstruction programs because State Department reporting requirements under the law ended last September.
The report found management lapses in a major aid agency housing program, including underestimated or inaccurate cost projections that have swelled spending on the project -- to $97 million from $59 million -- while reducing the number of housing units to be built.
Where the agency once planned to build 15,000 homes for 75,000 to 90,000 people, its latest target is 2,649 homes for up to 15,900 people. The Government Accountability Office said the shortfall arose in part from the complexity of acquiring land titles in Haiti, a well-known problem there, as well as the difficulty of working with the Haitian government, which demanded that the homes have flush toilets -- despite the country's limited sewage treatment.
A big portion of Agency for International Development money, $170.3 million, went toward a power plant and port for an industrial park in northern Haiti that was the centerpiece of United States reconstruction efforts and had been heavily promoted by the State Department and former President Bill Clinton.
But the project had mixed results. Although the aid agency completed the power plant under budget, the port, crucial to the industrial park's long-term success, is two years behind schedule ''due in part to a lack of U.S.A.I.D. expertise in port planning in Haiti,'' the report said, and is now vulnerable to cost overruns.
''U.S.A.I.D. funding will be insufficient to cover a majority of projected costs,'' the report said.
Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the Florida Republican and House Foreign Affairs Committee member who requested the report, said it was ''alarming and showcases the need to further investigate and ensure that U.S. taxpayer dollars are not being wasted or abused in Haiti.''
In a written statement, an agency senior manager, Beth Hogan, said the report captured ''some of the challenges we continue to work to overcome in our development cooperation with Haiti.''
''Reconstructing Haiti is a long-term challenge,'' she said. ''The goal was never to spend the money within three years of the earthquake, but to invest in sustainable projects that will contribute to Haiti's long-term economic growth and development.''
Agency officials said the report did not give a full picture of post-quake aid to Haiti. They said that of the total $2.3 billion currently available for Haiti's recovery, more than $1.3 billion had been disbursed and all of the $1.3 billion for humanitarian relief immediately after the earthquake had been spent.

HEADLINE: Housing Market Shrugging Off Rise in Mortgage Rates

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

 BODY:
Mortgage rates may be inching up, but they have not put a damper on the American housing market's rebound.
The Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller home price index on Tuesday showed a 12 percent increase in prices in 20 cities from April 2012 to April 2013, the largest gain since early 2006, when home values began to level off in advance of the market collapse. The rate of new-home sales also picked up to its quickest pace since July 2008.
The gains added to months of stronger showings in housing, a market that can infuse the economy with spending on big-ticket items like furniture and dishwashers. But the data released on Tuesday covered a period before comments last week by Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, caused a further jump in interest rates, raising fears that the market's momentum could stall.
On Tuesday, many housing experts shrugged off that concern, noting that the effect of a single factor like mortgage rates would be tempered by other forces like prices, wages and changes in employment. Moreover, any rise in interest rates could cut both ways, with some potential buyers encouraged to try to make a deal sooner to get ahead of further increases. 
For now, though, the biggest factor in the market, real estate agents say, is a low number of homes for sale, and that did not change after the Fed's announcement.
''For our low-$100,000 buyer, it's almost impossible to find a house right now,'' said Renae Jackson, an agent in Houston, recounting a flurry of bidding wars. She acknowledged that if mortgage rates increased too much it would cause a pullback, but said she believed ''whoever it is'' that controls interest rates would be cautious.
''I don't think they're going to take it that high that fast -- they don't want to see the economy crash again,'' she said.
Mortgage rates are not specifically under the control of the Federal Reserve, and they are subject to a wide variety of market forces. But they remain near historical lows and home prices are still well below their peaks in most markets, meaning that housing is still relatively affordable for many Americans. Stuart A. Miller, the chief executive of the Lennar Corporation, one of the country's top home builders, credited recent gains to an improving economy, pent-up demand and a severe housing shortage after so little was built during the recession.
''Inventories are low for both new and existing homes, as well as for rentals,'' said Mr. Miller, whose company reported a 53 percent rise in revenue in the second quarter compared with the same period a year earlier. ''The monthly payment math continues to push families to find a way to purchase.''
Home values are 11.7 percent below their peak in the mid-2000s, according to a home price report by the Federal Housing Finance Agency that tracks mortgages, and more than 25 percent below their peak according to Case-Shiller, which includes all-cash purchases in its calculations. If mortgage rates rise to 4 percent by the end of the year, as the Mortgage Bankers Association forecasts, they will still be much lower than the rates most Americans have experienced over the last few decades. In May, the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage stood at 3.5 percent.
For budget-conscious buyers, a return to a more historically normal 6 percent interest rate would make a significant difference. The monthly payment on a $300,000 mortgage would be about $460 more at 6 percent than at 3.5 percent. But such buyers could still turn to alternatives like adjustable-rate mortgages.
Leah Berk, a business school student who is searching for a condo in the popular Boston-area town of Brookline, said she was much more concerned about finding the right property than about rising mortgage rates.
''I'm really at the beginning of my search, so I'm not looking at the interest rates super-duper carefully,'' she said. ''My parents, when they bought their house 30 years ago, the interest rates were 17 percent. So with that in mind, if I can get an interest rate that's 4 or 4.5 percent, that's fine.''
While home prices are bound to soften if mortgage rates keep rising, at this point in a recovering market, rising prices and even rising mortgage rates are likely to help rather than hurt. In the short term, both may push fence-sitters to step up their timetable to catch rates and prices before they rise further. In the big picture, they provide some assurance that a house may once again be a prudent investment.
Several analysts warned that the steep price gains of recent months would slow in the second half of the year, in part because of rising interest rates.
''Today's Case-Shiller numbers may reflect where the housing market has been in some of the frothier metros, but they are not indicative of where it's headed,'' said Stan Humphries, the chief economist at Zillow, the real estate Web site. ''The housing market worm has turned over the past few weeks.''
Peter Schiff, the chief executive of the brokerage firm Euro-Pacific Capital and one of the few who foresaw the housing bust, said that low interest rates were creating another bubble that is outpacing wage growth and putting housing out of reach of many potential buyers. At the same time, he said, prices might fall again if homeowners who have been waiting for a recovery and investors who have been buying up houses are tempted to sell to take advantage of current conditions.
The Case-Shiller figures, which track prices in 20 markets, show a wide variety across the country. While the average increase was 12.1 percent, houses in the New York metropolitan area were up only 3.2 percent over the year, while homes in San Francisco rose a sharp 23.9 percent. Some of the markets hardest hit during the recession produced some of the largest one-year gains, with Atlanta, Detroit and Las Vegas each rising around 20 percent.
Los Angeles showed a gain of nearly 19 percent over the last 12 months, while Boston, Chicago and Denver were closer to 10 percent.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency, which issued its own price index report on Tuesday, reported its strongest gains in the western part of the United States and the weakest in New England and the mid-Atlantic region. The agency, which looks at all mortgages sold or guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, said prices were up 7.4 percent in April over the previous year.
In a separate survey, new homes were selling at a rate of 476,000 a year in May, up 2.1 percent from April, the Commerce Department reported.

HEADLINE: E.C.B. Chief Defends Bond-Buying Program

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
BERLIN -- Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, on Tuesday again defended its bond-buying program, saying that the strategy was even more important now after recent market turbulence caused by other central banks around the world. 
Mr. Draghi, in a speech in Berlin that did not mention any central bank by name, said the offer to buy bonds issued by heavily indebted countries ''is even more essential now as we see potential changes in the monetary policy stance, with associated uncertainty, in other jurisdictions of the global economy.''
In the United States, the Federal Reserve has upset markets by indicating that it could taper off its emergency stimulus measures next year. The Fed has been buying longer-term bonds in the open market, depressing long-term interest rates and lifting stocks and bonds.
Meanwhile, the Chinese authorities have tried to rein in excessive lending, leading to a spike last week in interbank borrowing rates. Japan has also said it will add large monetary stimulus.
The E.C.B. has not bought any bonds since announcing its plan last year. But the mere offer has pushed up government bond prices and taken financial pressure off indebted governments by lowering their borrowing costs. The bond-buying help would only be available to countries that sign a bailout agreement with the euro zone's rescue fund and promise in writing to take steps to reduce their debts and deficits.
Germany is home to some of Mr. Draghi's biggest critics. Skepticism toward rescue measures for indebted countries is widespread among Germans, who would be the biggest financial backers of any bailout because of the size of their economy. In Germany, the E.C.B. bond-buying plan is also being challenged in the Federal Constitutional Court and was opposed by the German central bank.
Mr. Draghi also rejected the argument that the program would transfer risk of loss from indebted countries to better-off ones, ''over and beyond risks that are inevitable and inherent'' in running one monetary policy for 17 countries.
He stressed that troubled countries could not get help from the bond purchase without committing to reforms. Because of the program, he said, ''the euro area is a more stable and resilient place to invest in than it was a year ago.''

HEADLINE: What Happened to Europe?

BYLINE: By GILES MACDONOGH

 BODY:
It all looked like a pretty good idea in 1951: A world war had come to an end only six years earlier and a cold one followed in its wake. Old enemies were about to become new friends.
The first step was barter. Instead of milking the defeated nation's resources -- the ancient way of war -- they could be shared: You have coal, we have steel; we'll swap. This fair trade was at the heart of the Treaty of Paris, the beginning of the European Coal and Steel Community, the seed that became the mighty European Union.
By 1951, political advantage could be matched by practical necessity. The German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer wanted to see his Federal Republic brought in from the cold, and Charles de Gaulle accepted that as Germany would always be France's neighbor, it was better to have it as a friend. The Low Countries, Luxembourg and Italy lumped in too. 
Political unity was still a long way off. Jean Monnet, the spiritual father of the European Community, put it best when he declared that there would be ''no peace in Europe if states re-establish themselves on the basis of national sovereignty.'' Cooperation and the winding up of the nation state was the way to end wars between European ''brothers.''
That political dimension was introduced when the Treaty of Rome, which encompassed limited cooperation in defense and politics, came into force in 1958. Henceforth the body was to be known as the European Economic Community, and as the E.E.C. grew, this political dimension became its sticking point -- particularly after Britain finally acceded in 1973.
While Britain has benefited hugely from the trading advantages of the Union, it has always fought any loss of ''sovereignty'' and occasionally invoked a ''special relationship'' with the United States to explain its reluctance to seal the knot.
When political union raised its head again at Maastricht (1993) and Lisbon (2009), not to mention the lesser milestones of Amsterdam and Nice, Britain's bellyaching became all the louder. Particularly unpopular were the social ukases issued from Brussels, which according to British ''skeptics'' ran counter to common sense.
At Maastricht, the E.E.C. became the European Union and the implications for those who wanted to retain sovereignty much more menacing. ''Euro-skepticism'' spread to other countries besides Britain. The real crunch, however, came with the introduction of the euro, now used in 17 of the 27 member states but fiercely resisted in Britain.
In the eyes of euro-skeptics the euro is so much more than just a coin. It is not only a metaphor for loss of sovereignty but for German domination. The common currency, it seems, is the first Panzer Division of the Fourth Reich, and Angela Merkel is now pilloried in some countries -- notably Greece -- as a closet Hitler.
Never has a coin enjoyed such symbolic importance. In Britain, not only our currency (reformed beyond recognition by Edward Heath when he introduced decimalization in 1971) is at risk, but our historic freedoms and our British way of life.
If we believe the Cassandras, the European Union is now teetering on the brink of collapse. The bailing out of Greece, Ireland and Portugal merely adds to their arguments. Euro-skeptic Britons are particularly smug about the euro now, though our levels of unemployment are hardly anything to brag about. Prospects for young people in Britain are not really greater than anywhere else in Europe.
Some of us pro-Europeans wonder how such a noble and laudable idea should have hit the reefs. Possibly the rapid welding of industrial and post-industrial economies to essentially rural nations was a mistake. Some of the fringe nations of the E.U. have hurtled forward at a dizzy speed.
When I first went to Portugal in 1980, the proposed motorway to cover the 170 miles from Lisbon to Porto petered out 20 miles north of the capital to re-emerge 10 miles south of Porto. In between it occasionally descended into a dirt track. Portugal joined the E.E.C. in 1986. Its airports and motorways now put ours to shame. I was there at the end of May. The country is hardly recognizable.
Romania is rural and post-Communist. It joined the E.U. in 2007. When I visited in the second week of June I saw Transylvania crisscrossed by motorway viaducts and the clapped-out cooperative wineries are being turned into state-of-the-art juicing plants by E.U. grants.
All of which contrasts strikingly with the pitted roads plied by peasants in horse-traps. Euro-skeptics hold that these good-for-nothing economies get all the funding from Brussels, but if you look carefully in Scotland or Northern Ireland, you'll find they've been busy there, too.
The notion that ''we'' are paying for backward nations is dear to the opponents of the European Union. Nigel Farage, leader of the U.K. Independence Party, which campaigns for British withdrawal, has recently been on a fact-finding mission to Bulgaria and Romania. His principal fear is that impoverished Balkan people are going to flood into Britain after the restrictions on movement are lifted next Jan. 1. He proposes that we leave the E.U. before then to avoid the deluge.
Farage is not alone. Marine Le Pen's National Front is a much greater force in French politics than the U.K. Independence Party in Britain. Most striking is the recent creation of AfD, Alternative for Germany, an anti-euro party. Germany has always been the rock upon which the E.U. was founded and has always been ready to see the political advantages of both the Union and the euro. AfD campaigns for a looser union, but, it should be added, they do not propose quitting the E.U.
It has now been 68 years since the end of World War II, and in Western and Central Europe at least, peace has reigned for the longest period in modern history -- trouncing the calm that ran from Waterloo to the Crimean War by nearly two decades.
It would be a pity to forget a century of good, hard work or the 60 years we have spent burying our differences and throw it all away at the toss of a coin.

HEADLINE: Rivals Oppose Proposed Google Concessions on Displaying Search Results

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- A group of technology and media companies on Tuesday ratcheted up pressure on the European antitrust authorities to reject a preliminary deal with Google and subject the search giant to far tougher terms involving search and advertising.
The companies are concerned that Google's proposals to settle the antitrust case being considered by the European Commission would enhance, rather than diminish, Google's reach. Google already accounts for more than 90 percent of Internet searches in some European Union countries and the vast majority of its revenue comes from advertising linked to search services. 
''It would be better to do nothing than to accept Google's proposals,'' said Thomas Vinje of FairSearch, the coalition of Google rivals that held the news conference on Tuesday. ''The proposals would make things worse rather than better,'' he said.
Joaqun Almunia, the E.U. antitrust commissioner, warned Google last month that he would probably need to ask for more concessions to satisfy the critics of the proposed settlement over whether its Internet search engine favored the company's own Web offerings to the detriment of competitors.
Google, having avoided antitrust charges in the United States, offered formal concessions in Europe early this year. The commission began so-called market testing of those concessions in April. If ultimately accepted by Mr. Almunia, the concessions would allow Google to avoid a finding of unlawful behavior and a possible fine of as much as 10 percent of its annual global revenue.
But Google's critics said Tuesday that the changes offered were not sufficient.
''This is self-advertising, what they are proposing here, nothing more and nothing less,'' said Moritz von Merveldt, the senior legal counsel at ProSiebenSat.1, a German broadcasting company in the online marketing field.
Mr. von Merveldt said his company was part of group that brought a case against Google in Germany alleging unfair online competition but is not directly involved in the European case.
Google has not indicated it would agree to make further concessions.
''Our proposals are meaningful and comprehensive,'' Kent Walker, a Google lawyer, said Monday in a blog post. Google had ''focused on addressing the commission's specific concerns, and we think we did a pretty good job,'' he wrote.
In a barb apparently aimed at would-be rivals, Mr. Walker added that, ''we build Google for users, not Web sites.''
Many of those people speaking on Tuesday were involved directly or indirectly in the market testing of the remedies proposed by Google.
Christoph Klenner, the secretary general of the European Technology & Travel Services Association, which includes two members, Expedia and Odigeo, which have filed complaints against Google, said one proposal -- putting blue highlighted links to rival sites -- would be ineffective at encouraging users to click on alternatives.
''The conversion rate of those blue links is absolutely insignificant,'' Mr. Klenner said. He declined to give further details on the study carried out by a member of the association. He asserted that other solutions proposed by Google, like labeling search results on which Google makes money, would have ''no significant impact'' and that ''the only thing that really counts in search is the position on the search result page.''
Michael Weber, the director of an online mapping service called hot-map.com in Hanover, Germany, criticized the way the E.U. inquiry was being conducted.
Mr. Weber said that a previous study conducted with German academics that used eye tracking, to test if placements of Google's own services had a strong effect on user choices, showed that only about 20 percent of users clicked on alternatives to Google Maps.
Mr. Weber said he wanted to conduct a follow-up study after market testing began in April. But ''we were initially only given one month to respond and you can't do a serious scientific study that's big enough and also diverse enough to represent'' European consumers in that time frame, he said.

HEADLINE: In U.S., a Rekindled War Over Abortion

BYLINE: By LUISITA LOPEZ TORREGROSA

 BODY:
NEW YORK -- As the Republican-controlled House of Representatives approved this month the most restrictive abortion bill to come out of Congress in at least a decade, abortion rights defenders mounted a full-blown campaign to blunt what they instantly labeled ''a new war on women.''
''The House of Representatives just passed the most extreme national anti-choice bill we've seen in recent years,'' said Jess McIntosh, the communications director of Emily's List, which supports female Democratic candidates and is one of the largest political action committees in the United States. ''It's blatantly unconstitutional and decimates the rights of every single woman in the country,'' she told me by e-mail immediately after the vote on June 18. ''This attack on our hardest-fought rights cannot go unanswered.'' 
Her boss, Stephanie Schriock, the head of Emily's List, took the fight directly to the Republicans. ''It's clear that jobs, the economy and the well-being of American women are not priorities for the G.O.P., which just jumps from one piece of terrible anti-woman legislation to the next,'' she said. ''Women rejected the Republican agenda by historic margins in 2012, but it's clear the G.O.P. hasn't learned its lesson.''
There is in fact little chance that the House measure, which would ban abortions after 22 weeks of pregnancy, will see the light of day in the Democratic-controlled Senate and White House.
But it has undeniably had an effect: Abortion is back on center stage in the countdown to the midterm elections next year, and the vote in the House served to put the spotlight on several key states where anti-abortion forces have quietly made significant inroads.
Prodded by public revulsion at the Philadelphia physician who was found guilty of murder for killing babies after botched late-term abortions and citing a scientifically unproven theory that fetuses at 22 weeks can feel pain, House Republicans and conservative lawmakers in state legislatures have reinvigorated the debate about abortion and have had some success in limiting it.
This is happening not only in Republican-led states. For instance, on Friday in New York, considered among the most liberal of American states, the State Senate, which is controlled by Republicans and breakaway Democrats, refused to pass the Women's Equality Act, which included a provision to ensure abortion rights in the state.
''It's unfortunate that political grandstanding has triumphed in New York State to the detriment of gender equality,'' said Lauren Hersh, the New York director of Equality Now, an international organization working for justice for women and girls. With the recent House vote in mind, she said, the New York measure ''would have furthered women's rights to reproductive health at a time when they are being eroded around the country, not only at the state level, but also at the federal level.''
In the past three years, at least 11 states have passed laws restricting abortions at or near 22 weeks, the same limit imposed by the House's Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. South Carolina and Wisconsin are considering similar bans; Arkansas and North Dakota have passed abortion restrictions; and in Ohio, an anti-abortion bill would require transvaginal (invasive) ultrasounds.
In Texas, spurred by Governor Rick Perry, a Republican, the State Senate passed a bill on June 18 that would close all but five abortion providers in the state. This came after the state had curbed funding for Planned Parenthood clinics. But the legislators put on hold, pending legal challenges, a provision similar to the House-passed bill to limit abortions at 22 weeks of pregnancy.
Abortion opponents get a boost from national polls that show that abortion rights do not enjoy overwhelming public support, unlike other hot social issues like same-sex marriage and gun control. Polls vary, and none of them seem conclusive -- which of course helps to fuel controversy and prompts each side to dig up surveys backing their positions.
Representative Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, speaking on Fox News last Saturday, brought up a poll showing that some 60 percent of Americans opposed second-trimester abortions. Ms. Blackburn led the anti-abortion legislation on the House floor, though the bill's author was Representative Trent Franks of Arizona, who enraged some women with a comment that few rapes resulted in pregnancies. But Ms. Blackburn raised eyebrows, too, when she seemed to suggest that the House bill could lead to fewer rapes.
In any case, a rekindled war over and between women has moved once again to the front lines in the American political and policy scene.
And it resonates well beyond U.S. borders.
''What is happening in the United States signals to the rest of the world that there is far more work to do to break down barriers to accessing safe abortion for women everywhere,'' Pamela W. Barnes, the president and chief executive of the nonprofit global women's health organization EngenderHealth, said in an e-mail.
In Engender's 70 years of experience, she said, ''what is constant is that women, no matter how they live, will go to great lengths to end an unwanted pregnancy, even risking their lives.''

HEADLINE: Housing Numbers Reassure Investors

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks rose by the most in nearly two weeks on Tuesday after data showed business investment and the housing recovery continued apace, reassuring investors worried about the Federal Reserve's plans to reduce its huge monetary stimulus.
Analysts said the gains were propelled by a mix of buyers: hedge funds as well as small and wealthy retail clients attracted by the market's recent drop. Position trimming by institutions because of recent volatility pulled the market back from its highs in the final minutes of trading.
The gains, led largely by financial stocks, came even as the latest drop in bond prices indicated higher interest rates. A lightly bid two-year government debt auction disappointed bond traders who were looking for bargain-minded investors to buy Treasuries hard hit in the recent market sell-off. 
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 100.75 points, or 0.69 percent, to 14,760.31, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 14.94 points or 0.95 percent, to 1,588.03. The Nasdaq composite added 27.13 points, or 0.82 percent, to 3,347.89.
While the S.& P. is up 11.2 percent in 2013, the recent trend has been negative. The benchmark index has dropped below both its 14-day and 50-day moving averages, which are seen as indicators of near-term market direction. The S.& P. is down about 2.7 percent in June.
''I think investors have kind of come to the conclusion that 'O.K., we've made a kneejerk reaction to what the Fed has said, and now we've taken some deep breaths and we can reassess,' '' said Mike Binger, senior portfolio manager at Gradient Investments in Minneapolis. ''This little correction has given people a chance to get back into the market who haven't been in and haven't participated at all this year.''
The S.& P. 500 gain of just under 1 percent was the biggest since June 13 and was the market's most broad-based advance since the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, set off a global rout in financial markets, begun last week, by laying out a road map for the end of $85 billion a month in bond purchases.
The declines have been broad and have come on heavy volume, indicating selling by investors with large positions. Even with Tuesday's gain, the index remains down 4.9 percent from its high of 1,669.16, which was reached on May 21.
Data on durable goods orders, sales of new homes and consumer confidence all topped analysts' expectations. The April Case/Shiller report on home prices also exceeded forecasts. If this run of strong economic figures continues, it could mollify those worried about lack of Fed support.
Housing stocks were among the strongest of the day after the data and also after Lennar posted strong results, pointing to a solid housing recovery. The stock rose 0.7 percent to $35.23 and the PHLX housing sector index climbed 1.4 percent.
Wells Fargo, the biggest mortgage lender in the country, rose 1.26 percent to $40.30. Citigroup led the gains by large-cap banks with a 3.4 percent rise.
Volume was again above average, with 6.73 billion shares traded on American exchanges. More than three-fourths of stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange advanced.
In government bonds, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 18/32 to 92 17/32, sending the yield up to 2.61 percent from 2.54 percent late Monday.

HEADLINE: Democrat Wins Special Election for Kerry's Senate Seat

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
BOSTON -- Representative Edward J. Markey, a Democrat who has toiled for almost 40 years in the House in both the majority and minority, won a promotion to the Senate on Tuesday in a victory over Gabriel Gomez, a Republican who has never served in elective office.
Mr. Markey, 66, succeeds John Kerry, who stepped down this year to become secretary of state, and he will provide a reliable vote for President Obama's agenda, which seemed to be just what voters wanted. 
''The Senate needs to be controlled by Democrats,'' said Pam Wechsler, 52, a prosecutor, as she voted Tuesday morning in the West End of Boston.
With almost all precincts reporting, Mr. Markey had won 55 percent of the vote to Mr. Gomez's 45 percent.
''Like you, I'm tired of gridlock,'' Mr. Markey told a jubilant crowd packed into the ballroom of the Boston Park Plaza Hotel, ''but I will never compromise on our principles.'' He said he would lead a ''green revolution'' and put steelworkers and ironworkers to work in a new economy.
Mr. Markey's election does not change the balance of power in the Senate, where Democrats have 54 votes and Republicans have 46. But Democratic control had already slipped by one this month after Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey died and was succeeded by an interim Republican.
Mr. Markey's win came as a surprise to no one. Every poll in the state showed him leading Mr. Gomez, though by varying margins, since the primaries ended two months ago.
Mr. Markey's biggest advantage was that his views were in line with those of most voters in deep blue Massachusetts. With a much bigger war chest, which he used to flood the airwaves with ads, he campaigned consistently on his support for abortion rights and a ban on assault weapons and reminded voters constantly that Mr. Gomez opposed both.
As the campaign went on, Mr. Markey added arguments that Democrats had used successfully in previous Senate races -- that his opponent wanted to cut Medicare benefits, raise the eligibility age for Social Security and give special tax breaks to corporations.
For his part, Mr. Gomez repeatedly cast Mr. Markey, who was first elected to Congress in 1976, as a relic who had little to show for his decades in Washington. He cast himself as a ''new kind of Republican'' who supported same-sex marriage, expanded background checks for gun purchases and a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. But he could not convince enough Massachusetts voters that he would vote independently of the national Republican Party.
While the Markey campaign feared that Mr. Gomez would attract millions of dollars in outside money from special interests, that backing did not materialize in a serious way.
Mr. Markey himself did not exactly set the electorate on fire. He was the consensus choice of the Democratic establishment, which wanted to focus on one candidate early in hopes of avoiding a repeat of 2010, when a Republican, Scott P. Brown, won the special Senate election to fill the seat of Edward M. Kennedy, who died in 2009.
Mr. Markey ran a cautious campaign that relied heavily on big Democratic stars, including President Obama, Michelle Obama, former President Bill Clinton, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Elizabeth Warren.
''Democrats are getting the outcome they were supposed to get, but they had to put a lot of firepower into it,'' said Jennifer Duffy, a senior editor at The Cook Political Report. She characterized the Democratic juggernaut, including an extensive field operation that made contact with three million voters over the last five days, as backup insurance that the loss of 2010 would not be repeated. On Tuesday alone, the party organized 7,200 volunteers to get out the vote.
''This victory has less to do with Ed Markey and more with the fact that he's the Democrat,'' she said. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee took considerable credit for the victory Tuesday night.
''We recruited Ed Markey into the race, worked with him to build a campaign team with the best Senate talent from Massachusetts and around the country, and secured commitments early on from top Democratic leaders that they would actively support the Democratic nominee,'' Guy Cecil, the committee's executive director, said in a statement.
Looking ahead to other Senate races next year, he said that winning in Massachusetts ''was an important first step in our efforts to preserve the Democratic majority.''
Senator Jerry Moran of Kansas, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, was upbeat, declaring that Mr. Gomez had forced the Democrats to spend millions to drag Mr. Markey ''across the finish line in the most liberal state in the country.''
And he all but announced that Mr. Gomez would challenge Mr. Markey in November 2014, when Mr. Markey will have to defend the seat for a full six-year term. ''Today marks the end of the first mile in the marathon to permanently fill the Massachusetts Senate seat,'' Mr. Moran said. ''Gabriel Gomez is well prepared to win that marathon over the next 16 months.''

HEADLINE: Obama Unveils New Plans To Address Climate Change

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama, declaring that ''Americans across the country are already paying the price of inaction,'' announced sweeping measures on Tuesday to reduce greenhouse gas pollution and prepare the nation for a future of rising temperatures.
Embracing wholeheartedly an issue that could define his legacy but is sure to ignite new political battles with Republicans, Mr. Obama said he would use his executive powers to require reductions in the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by the nation's power plants.
The carbon cuts at power plants are the centerpiece of a three-pronged climate-change plan that will also involve new federal funds to advance renewable energy technology, as well as spending to fortify cities and states against the ravages of storms and droughts aggravated by a changing climate.
Mr. Obama waded more deeply than he has before into the dispute over the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, which would carry heavy crude oil from Alberta to depots and refineries in the Midwest and on the Gulf Coast. He said he would not approve the 1,700-mile pipeline if it was shown that it would ''significantly'' worsen climate change. 
The president's comments were ambiguous: He did not specify what aspects of the project he was including or what level of climate impact he considers ''significant.'' Opponents and backers of the pipeline found support for their positions in his remarks.
On the broader climate challenge, however, Mr. Obama was unequivocal. Saying that science had put to rest the debate over whether human activity was responsible for warming the earth, he told an audience at Georgetown University, ''The question now is whether we will have the courage to act before it is too late.''
''As a president, as a father and as an American, I am here to say, we need to act,'' Mr. Obama said to students and others gathered in a sunbaked quadrangle, mopping his brow with a handkerchief, as if to dramatize his point. ''I refuse to condemn your generation and future generations to a planet that's beyond fixing.''
It was by far Mr. Obama's boldest attempt to grapple with one of the seminal challenges of the time. But it also starts a clock ticking, with the president aiming to draft and put into place a complicated set of rules in just two years, to meet his pledge of reducing the nation's greenhouse gas emissions 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020.
While Mr. Obama dwelt on what he said was the less partisan nature of antipollution movements in the past, his reliance on executive branch regulations and other administrative actions, which do not require Congressional approval, is an acknowledgment that legislation to tackle climate change would be a near-impossibility in a deeply divided Congress.
Republicans were quick to condemn the measures, saying they constituted a government overreach that would constrict energy production and strangle the nation's economic recovery.
''These policies, rejected even by the last Democratic-controlled Congress, will shutter power plants, destroy good-paying American jobs and raise electricity bills,'' the House speaker, John A. Boehner, said in a statement.
Even the timing of the speech ran into headwinds, coming in a week of major Supreme Court decisions, the drama over the travels of the National Security Agency leaker Edward J. Snowden and a debate in Congress over immigration reform.
White House aides said they had long planned for Mr. Obama to deliver the speech before July 4 and that it was important to announce the measures as early as possible because of the length of time needed for the Environmental Protection Agency to finalize the regulations.
But the president's broader proposals were somewhat overshadowed by his reference to Keystone. Mr. Boehner's spokesman, Brendan Buck, said, ''The standard the president set today should lead to speedy approval of the Keystone pipeline.''
In a draft environmental impact statement issued in March, the State Department concluded that the net impact of the pipeline on the climate would be small, because even if it was not built, the oil would still be extracted and sold in other markets.
Still, Mr. Obama suggested the State Department would have to go further to justify the $7 billion project than it had up to now. The president said the pipeline's net effects on the climate would be ''absolutely critical'' to his decision whether to approve it.
''Allowing the Keystone pipeline to be built requires finding that doing so would be in our nation's interests,'' he said. ''And our national interest will be served only if this project does not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution.''
Russell K. Girling, the chief executive of TransCanada, the company seeking a permit to build the pipeline, said the project easily met Mr. Obama's criteria. He said that multiple reviews had found that the Canadian oil would move to market by truck, rail or other pipelines if Keystone were not built -- methods that are less clean and efficient.
Opponents said they were pleased by the president's statement, saying it raised another hurdle to the project.
''Any fair and unbiased analysis of the tar sands pipeline shows that the climate effects of this disastrous project would be significant,'' said Michael Brune, president of the Sierra Club.
For Mr. Obama, the speech addressed a promise he made as a candidate in 2008 to tackle the threat of a climate change. During his first term, climate change took a back seat to the financial crisis, and then to his decision to push health care reform.
Advocates for the power industry say the government is the wrong agent to reduce carbon emissions, given that the falling price and expanded use of natural gas has already helped reduce them.
''The administration needs to explain why it needs old-style, command-and-control regulation when the market is moving in that direction anyway,'' said Scott H. Segal, who represents utilities at the law firm Bracewell & Giuliani.
Democratic lawmakers who have pushed climate measures were jubilant, however, with Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island saying it could open the door to further Congressional action.
Representative Henry A. Waxman, the California Democrat who pushed cap-and-trade legislation intended to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions, said of Mr. Obama's package, ''It's good for the economy, it's good for environment, it's good for the U.S.''
Mr. Waxman's legislative partner, Representative Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, on Tuesday won a special election to fill John Kerry's Senate seat. (Mr. Kerry is now secretary of state.) Mr. Markey, some analysts said, benefited in that race by promoting his climate credentials.
Among those who have waited more than four years for Mr. Obama to act, the reaction this week was mostly relief.
''He's going after the heart of the problem,'' said Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University. ''This is a watershed, assuming he follows through.''

HEADLINE: Dropping Out Of College, And Paying The Price

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
David Beltrn has a solid understanding of the benefits of a college education. The 22-year-old from Queens -- a journalism major at Brooklyn College -- has seen too many friends drop out only to find themselves working at a fast-food counter or at a construction job. ''They are getting by, but they are not very happy.''
And yet Mr. Beltrn says he probably wouldn't have gone to college full time if he hadn't received a Pell grant and financial aid from New York State to defray the costs. He has also heard too many stories about people struggling under an unbearable burden of student loans to even consider going into debt. ''Honestly, I don't think I would have gone,'' he said. ''I couldn't have done four years.''
And that would have been the wrong decision. 
His reasoning is not unusual. The rising cost of college looms like an insurmountable obstacle for many low-income Americans hoping to get a higher education. The notion of a college education becoming a financial albatross around the neck of the nation's youth is a growing meme across the culture. Some education experts now advise high school graduates that a college education may not be such a good investment after all. ''Sticker price matters a lot,'' said Lawrence Katz, a professor of Harvard University. ''It is a deterrent.''
College graduation rates in the United States are continuing to slip behind, according to a report published on Tuesday by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, failing to keep pace with other advanced nations.
In 2000, 38 percent of Americans age 25 to 34 had a degree from a community college or a four-year institution, putting the nation in fourth place among its peers in the O.E.C.D. By 2011, the graduation rate had inched up to 43 percent, but the nation's ranking had slipped to 11th place.
This from perhaps the first nation to try mass college education, graduating more students from college than anybody else. Graduation rates in the United States among 55- to 64-year-olds are higher than in any industrial country except Canada and Israel -- reflecting the nation's head start.
What's most troubling, perhaps, is that Americans are actually enrolling in college and then dropping out halfway through -- when they've probably already incurred a bunch of debt and won't benefit from the better job prospects that come with a degree.
More than 70 percent of Americans matriculate at a four-year college -- the seventh-highest rate among 23 developed nations for which the O.E.C.D. compiles such statistics. But less than two-thirds end up graduating. Including community colleges, the graduation rate drops to 53 percent. Only Hungary does worse.
And the most perplexing part of this accounting is that regardless of cost, getting a degree is the best financial decision a young American can make.
According to the O.E.C.D.'s report, a college degree is worth $365,000 for the average American man after subtracting all its direct and indirect costs over a lifetime. For women -- who still tend to earn less than men -- it's worth $185,000.
College graduates have higher employment rates and make more money. According to the O.E.C.D., a typical graduate from a four-year college earns 84 percent more than a high school graduate. A graduate from a community college makes 16 percent more.
A college education is more profitable in the United States than in pretty much every other advanced nation. Only Irish women get more for the investment: $185,960 net.
What's to be done?
Democratizing higher education is an urgent challenge. A study published Wednesday by the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution in Washington underscores how inequities in education are hampering social and economic mobility, contributing to entrenched income inequality.
The study points out that half of Americans in the top fourth of the income distribution have a college degree. Among the poorest fourth of Americans, fewer than one in 10 graduated from college. And the gap is growing. The college graduation rate of high-income Americans born in the 1980s was 20 percentage points higher than in the 1960s. Among low-income Americans, it advanced only 4 percent.
Every year federal, state and municipal governments spend a total of more than $9,200 per student in college, the O.E.C.D. estimates. Perhaps they could do more. According to the O.E.C.D., they make a profit of $231,000 on each American who graduates from college -- mostly through higher income taxes and lower unemployment payments.
Increasing financial aid can increase the odds of keeping a student in college. But it can be expensive and not very cost-effective. Some students getting aid wouldn't graduate anyway, and others would have graduated without it.
Eric Hanushek, a professor at Stanford University, argues that there is something inherently unfair about subsidizing students only when they reach college. ''Subsidies to higher education are bonuses for the people who already are coming out ahead,'' he told me in an e-mail. ''These bonuses are paid partially by the people who were not the winners -- the ones who did not attend college. Therefore, transfers are made from the less well off to the more well off.''
Other ideas look promising. A study by Caroline Hoxby, a professor at Stanford University, and Sarah Turner, a professor at the University of Virginia, concluded that providing high-achieving students from low-income backgrounds with personalized information about their college options would cost only $6 per student but could vastly increase their applications and acceptance to high-end colleges. Reconfiguring college loans -- for instance by making debt repayments contingent on wages after college -- might help young Americans overcome their fear of an enormous pile of debt.
Yet if the problem is not getting more Americans to enroll in college but to get those enrolled to finish it, we need to understand why it is that Americans drop out at such disproportionate rates -- despite the promise of a high payoff at the end. Getting more Americans successfully through college requires ensuring that once they get there, they can reap the enormous profits of the experience.
And that looks likely to be a more complicated task than providing more college grants.
Many students are arriving in college without the needed preparation. In 2009, American 15-year-olds scored in 17th place in international reading tests -- among 65 nations rich and poor. They scored in 27th place in math and 23rd in science -- well below top achievers in other advanced countries. Studies have found that American students are disproportionately disadvantaged, compared with those of high-performing nations on international tests.
The pattern suggests that the main obstacle keeping Americans from a college education emerges long before they reach college.
''As we have larger proportions attending college, we are undoubtedly dipping down further in the preparation of students for college,'' Professor Hanushek said. ''This, in turn, leads to greater proportions of students dropping out before they complete a B.A. degree.''
This may call for a different approach to improve the nation's college graduation rates. The best policy may require taking the money spent today to subsidize public higher education and using it to better prepare students before they get there.

HEADLINE: Forgoing a Fight, Senators Confirm Commerce Secretary

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senators pick their battles, and by Tuesday, members in both parties had decided not to have one with President Obama over his nomination of Penny Pritzker, the billionaire hotel heiress, to be commerce secretary. In a 97-to-1 vote, they confirmed her to join the cabinet.
The lone dissenter was Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the socialist independent who caucuses with Senate Democrats. 
When Mr. Obama announced in May his choice of Ms. Pritzker, 54, to join his second-term economic team as head of the eclectic Commerce Department -- its responsibilities vary widely and include federal business programs and weather forecasting -- rumblings from the right and left suggested trouble.
Allies of organized labor expressed concern about union clashes with the Pritzker family's Hyatt Hotel chain, where Ms. Pritzker has been a board member. At the same time, senior Republicans led by Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa said Ms. Pritzker would have to answer for investments in offshore tax havens just as Mitt Romney had to in the 2012 presidential race.
After Mr. Obama's 2008 election, Ms. Pritzker, a financial supporter of the president from Chicago, withdrew from consideration for the same job after similar issues surfaced. During her recent confirmation hearings, she had to acknowledge an error understating her income on federal disclosure forms by tens of millions of dollars.
Yet only Mr. Sanders voted against her.
''We need a secretary of commerce who will represent the interests of working Americans and their families, not simply the interests of C.E.O.'s and large corporations,'' he said in statement afterward. ''Workers at Hyatt have been unjustly fired for trying to form a union to collectively bargain for better wages and benefits. Unfortunately, Ms. Pritzker chose not to defend those employees.''
Republicans, who have battled other Obama nominees, including the former Republican senator Chuck Hagel in his defense secretary bid, decided not to try to block the pro-business nominee of a lesser department. They are wary of being seen as obstructionists and mindful of a threat from the Democratic majority leader, Senator Harry Reid, to force a change in filibuster rules that protect the minority unless Republicans ease their frequent opposition.
''With the Pritzker confirmation, every single one of the President's Cabinet nominees that Sen. Reid brought to the floor have been confirmed,'' Don Stewart, the spokesman for the Republican minority leader, Mitch McConnell, said in a post on Twitter.
Yet that leaves two cabinet nominations, along with some judicial choices, that Mr. Reid has not brought to a vote because of the prospect of Republican filibusters. Gina McCarthy, who has been named to head the Environmental Protection Agency, and Thomas E. Perez, the nominee for labor secretary, await approval. A third cabinet nominee, Anthony R. Foxx, the mayor of Charlotte, N.C., is expected to be confirmed this week as transportation secretary.
In a statement after Ms. Pritzker's confirmation, Mr. Obama said that ''Penny will be a key member of my economic team as we continue to work to grow our economy and strengthen the middle class.''
The responsibilities of the Commerce Department also include oceans policy, travel and tourism. But its secretary is most often a president's liaison to business, as Ms. Pritzker is expected to be for Mr. Obama.
The job has been vacant since John E. Bryson resigned for medical reasons last June. His deputy, Rebecca M. Blank, has been acting secretary but is to become chancellor of the University of Wisconsin, Madison in July.

HEADLINE: China Is Sold on America

BYLINE: By JULIE CRESWELL

 BODY:
First, it was the Japanese. Moneymen from Tokyo blew into the United States to buy famous pieces of the American landscape, from Rockefeller Center in New York to the Pebble Beach Golf Links in California.
Now, about a quarter-century later, another set of deep-pocketed foreign buyers is pushing ever deeper into United States real estate: the Chinese.
Undaunted by Japan's real estate misadventures in the 1980s -- some Japanese investors wildly overpaid for United States property, and Japan eventually suffered one of the biggest property market collapses in history -- Chinese investors are fanning out in the United States. 
What began with a few isolated purchases two years ago has become a hunt for trophy properties and billion-dollar deals. So far, the kind of fears that arose in the 1980s -- unfounded talk that Japan was ''buying up'' America -- have not surfaced this time. To the contrary, the Chinese, or at least their money, are being welcomed, even celebrated.
Some caution that China could quickly retreat, as Japan did, if its economy worsens. Signs of economic weakness in China have been mounting, and the country's financial system has recently come under stress. Those concerns could dissipate if Beijing steps in to ease strains in the nation's banking industry and to spur growth, but many economists see real and growing dangers within China's economy.
And yet in recent weeks, several big deals in New York City have set real estate circles abuzz. Zhang Xin, a Chinese business magnate and chief executive of the largest commercial real estate developer in Beijing, joined forces with the Safra family of Brazil to buy a large piece of the General Motors Building in Midtown. Dalian Wanda Group, a big Chinese developer, said it intended to build a luxury hotel in Manhattan. (Wanda is also planning to build a hotel in London.)
The deals go beyond shimmering glass-and-steel towers: Chinese and Hong Kong investors have also become the second-largest foreign buyers of United States homes, after the Canadians.
''They're just getting started,'' said Steve Collins, the international director at Jones Lang LaSalle Capital, a real estate services firm that recently held conferences for potential buyers in Shanghai and Beijing. ''There's just been some incredible wealth creation there.''
For the moment, the Chinese government is encouraging the investments and even helping to finance them. The state-owned Bank of China has become the largest foreign lender in commercial real estate deals in the United States, replacing big European banks. Beijing is eager to diversify its investments. The Chinese government owns more than $1 trillion of United States Treasury securities, but those investments generate little return given how low interest rates are.
''The political support for investments beyond U.S. Treasuries has increased significantly over the last couple of years and that has encouraged Chinese investors to look at real estate in big, stable markets like New York or other big cities,'' said Thilo Hanemann, a research director the Rhodium Group, a firm that analyzes global business and economic trends.
The Chinese aren't limiting themselves to megadeals. Some purchases have been relatively small by the standards of commercial real estate. Ms. Zhang, who is the chief executive of SOHO China and one of the richest women in the world, paid about $600 million in 2011 for a 49 percent stake in the Park Avenue Plaza, a Midtown Manhattan skyscraper. That same year, the real estate arm of the HNA Group, a Chinese airline company, saved an office building at 1180 Sixth Avenue from foreclosure for $265 million. HNA also bought the boutique Cassa Hotel in Times Square.
Chinese investors or firms have also bought large hotels in California, including the Sheraton Universal in Universal City; the Crowne Plaza in Burlingame, near the San Francisco airport; and the Hilton Ontario in Ontario. They have also purchased a riverfront parcel in Toledo, Ohio, and, earlier this year, an office building in Morristown, N.J.
Chinese firms and investors are also betting that the potential returns in American commercial property markets will be higher than in other areas of the world. The market for office, industrial and retail property appears to have bottomed out. Office vacancy rates have fallen and rent prices have stabilized amid signs of economic improvement. And while competition is heating up -- three Manhattan office buildings have sold for more than $1 billion so far this year -- many of the big bidders and lenders from Europe have pulled back as their home economies struggle.
In addition to buying commercial real estate, China is emerging as a powerful force in financing other players' deals. In particular, the Bank of China, China's premier lender and one of the country's four major state-run banks, has assumed an increasingly large role. ''A few years ago, the U.S. branches of German banks were the top three or four foreign lenders for commercial property deals, now it's the Bank of China,'' said Matthew Anderson, a managing director at Trepp L.L.C., a data and analytics firm that tracks bank lending.
Chinese development firms are also lining up large United States commercial real estate projects. In February, China Vanke, a development company, made its first North American investment when it formed a joint venture with Tishman Speyer to build luxury condominiums in San Francisco. Another Chinese developer has agreed to provide funding for a $1.5 billion project that will transform 65 industrial acres in Oakland, Calif., into a waterfront neighborhood with 3,100 homes.
And the Chinese have even arrived in hipster central: Williamsburg, Brooklyn. A Chinese firm has purchased a site and plans to build a 216-unit condo project there.
Some analysts say the Chinese money flowing directly into real estate pales in comparison with the money that is moving through private investments or real estate funds.
In recent years, China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange, which manages foreign exchange reserves, agreed to invest $500 million in a $13 billion real estate fund overseen by the Blackstone Group, a Wall Street investment firm.
China's main sovereign wealth fund, the China Investment Corporation, has taken direct stakes in properties but has also invested more billions of dollars in real estate funds overseen by large private investment funds.
''The overwhelming majority of Chinese capital is getting into the commercial property market through third parties,'' said Dan Fasulo, a managing director at Real Capital Analytics. ''They're getting billions of dollars into the system almost unnoticed.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P. in House Leaves Immigration Bill in Doubt

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With the Senate days away from passing the most significant immigration legislation in a generation, House Republicans say they feel no pressure to act quickly on a similar measure, leaving the fate of the bill very much in doubt despite solid bipartisan Senate support.
''We have a minority of the minority in the Senate voting for this bill,'' said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma, referring to the 15 or so Republicans expected to back the Senate measure. ''That's not going to put a lot of pressure on the majority of the majority in the House.''
Two senior House Republican leadership aides were more blunt when speaking privately: Speaker John A. Boehner has no intention of angering conservative voters and jeopardizing the House Republican majority in 2014 in the interest of courting Hispanic voters on behalf of a 2016 Republican presidential nominee who does not yet exist.
If anything, the politics of a gerrymandered House where Republican lawmakers have much more to fear politically from the right than from the left could push many Republicans to oppose a conservative alternative to the Senate's plan. 
Even advocates of a comprehensive immigration bill that includes a pathway to legalization for unauthorized immigrants now in the country say that Senate passage as early as Friday would not change House sentiment quickly.
''The House is not going to get logrolled by the Senate,'' said Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, who lost his bid to be vice president last year in part because of the Republican Party's abysmal showing with immigrant voters. ''We'll have a more methodical, patient way of doing this.''
The outcome of Monday's crucial vote in the Senate on added border security provided evidence of the difficulty of getting an immigration measure produced in the Democrat-controlled Senate through the Republican-held House. All of the Senate's Republican leadership opposed the border plan. States represented by the 15 Senate Republicans who backed the proposal have 56 Republican House members, and senators from two of the states -- South Carolina and Mississippi -- split. The states represented by 30 Republican senators who opposed the border plan or indicated they would -- a good gauge of local political sentiment -- have 123 Republican members of the House.
''Can we pass a House bill? It's a very open question,'' said Representative Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, a leading voice among a shrinking group of moderate Republicans. For Republicans, the stakes are high and the crosscurrents are strong. Advocates of the Senate bill say the future of the national Republican Party could rest on how this issue plays out. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who helped write the measure, said Tuesday that ''the passion level'' among Hispanic voters on the immigration issue ''is as high as on any issue I've observed.''
''If we can't grow our numbers, particularly among Hispanics, it's pretty hard to win the White House in 2016,'' said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, another of the bill's authors. ''Don't get me wrong. Conservatism sells, and after eight years of Obama, people will be looking around for someone new. But it's hard to sell your economic agenda if they think you're going to deport their grandmother.''
On the other hand, a vote for legislation like the Senate bill could hold real peril for House Republicans, whose solidly Republican districts reward politicians who take the most conservative positions on issues. A new poll by National Journal found that nearly half of Republican voters, 49 percent, said a lawmaker who backs legislation offering a pathway to citizenship would lose their support. Thirty percent said it would make no difference. Only 15 percent said such a vote would make them more likely to back their incumbent.
''I think most members look at this with a great deal of trepidation,'' Mr. Cole said.
What the House's methodical approach yields may determine the ultimate fate of immigration legislation in the 113th Congress. If the House can pass its own immigration bill, lawmakers will have a counteroffer to bring to the voters next year -- even if the House and Senate bills cannot be reconciled into a final package for President Obama to sign.
That dynamic played out in 2006, when the Senate passed a comprehensive immigration bill, the House passed a measure bolstering border security without offering new paths to legal immigration, and both bills died with the 109th Congress.
But a sizable group of conservatives fear that passing any immigration bill in the House would set up House-Senate negotiations stacked to yield a final deal that would be much closer to the Senate's plan than the House's. If that group, in opposition, joins balking Democrats, they could ensure that no conservative immigration bill would pass.
In that case, lawmakers from both parties say pressure from Republicans alarmed about the broad political consequences of inaction could mount on House Republican leaders to move toward the Senate's position -- or even take up the Senate bill without changes. That dynamic has played out twice this year. In January, House Democrats -- with a minority of House Republicans -- passed a Senate-White House compromise to avert massive tax increases and sudden across-the-board spending cuts, after House Republicans sunk the speaker's more conservative version of the legislation.
In February, a Republican version of the Violence Against Women Act crashed on the House floor, prompting Republican leaders to allow the House to pass the Senate's version -- again relying on a majority of Democratic votes.
''Be a speaker, lead the Congress, let Democrats vote,'' Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, on Tuesday urged Mr. Boehner.
It will likely take months for the issue to play out. Mr. Boehner has called a July 10 meeting of all House Republicans to hash over a way forward. In the meantime, the House Judiciary Committee will continue passing a series of piecemeal bills that already include a border security bill, an agriculture guest worker plan, and, this week, measures to create a fortified employment eligibility verification system and to expand immigration for science, technology, engineering and mathematics experts.
House Republican leadership aides say the House might bundle those measures into a package to bring to House-Senate negotiations or draft a new, more comprehensive version, depending on the mood of Republicans after the Fourth of July recess.
Republican lawmakers see little chance of action until this fall or winter. After Congress's August recess, lawmakers will return to Washington to confront two unavoidable fiscal challenges. First, comes Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year, when a government shutdown looms over sharp differences between the House and Senate over spending levels. That will be followed quickly by the next showdown over the government's statutory borrowing limit, which House Republicans will use to try to force concessions from President Obama on taxes and entitlement programs like Medicare.
An immigration battle is a distant second to those matters, Republicans say.
''I don't know why we'd get embroiled in this fight, which is apt to be very divisive in the conference, before we take care of the more immediate issues,'' Mr. Cole said.

HEADLINE: Poll Finds Rural Voters Are Divided on Federal Role

BYLINE: By STEVEN YACCINO

 BODY:
Voters in some of the nation's most rural areas, long considered a mainstay of small-government sentiments, have mixed views about the role federal policies should play in their lives, according to polling released Tuesday by the Center for Rural Affairs. 
Surveying more than 800 small-town and countryside residents across the Midwest, the Great Plains and the South, the rural advocacy group found that people were evenly divided about whether Washington should make more effort to strengthen rural communities or whether such involvement ''will do more harm than good.''
The polling, released just days after a farm bill failed to pass the House of Representatives, paints a nuanced portrait of rural America, one with a strong belief in reducing government spending and regulations, but increasingly in want of more effective policies that promote job training, infrastructure investment and education programs for low-income children outside of cities.
''Rural voters get put in a box of being uniformly antigovernment,'' said Chuck Hassebrook, executive director of the center, based in Nebraska. ''But they are not slaves to any ideology.''
Forty-two percent of those polled said they were Republicans; 25 percent Democrats; and 25 percent independent.
The telephone poll was conducted by a bipartisan polling team of Lake Research Partners and the Tarrance Group from May 28 to June 3 and has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.
The survey also showed the rural economy is more diverse than many people believe. More than 8 in 10 of the rural Americans surveyed did not rely on agriculture for a significant chunk of their income, and nearly 6 in 10 said too much federal aid goes to the largest farms.
Mr. Hassebrook said Washington has been slow to notice the change. ''There's not nearly as many farmers as there used to be,'' he said. ''There may be more votes to be found for members of either party by supporting policies that invest in small-business development.''
With the economy rebounding slowly in some areas, 59 percent said the federal government had at least some responsibility to help the ''working poor advance economically.'' At least 8 in 10 supported job training, Medicaid for health care, and tax refunds for low-income Americans.
''They want a hand up but not a handout,'' said Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster who worked on the report. Rural voters feel they have been overlooked by politicians, he said, and could make that clear in future elections. ''If Republicans take them for granted and you had a Democratic candidate that addressed those things that they should also be getting to help them get a step up on the economy like other areas of the country,'' he said, ''I think there would be some traction.''

HEADLINE: Cut Adrift by Its Would-Be Rescuer, Seaport Museum Seeks a Lifeline

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
Wanted: One responsible steward for a beleaguered museum that chronicles New York City's maritime history through ships and artifacts and has been under water literally and figuratively over the last few years -- struggling to pay the bills, and then flooded by Hurricane Sandy.
Such is the sorry state of the South Street Seaport Museum, now that the Museum of the City of New York has decided to pull out of running the institution, having deemed its current condition unworkable. The city's Department of Cultural Affairs has said it will try to find ''another entity'' that can take over the organization. If no group comes forward, the museum's fate will be decided in consultation with state officials; closing it and dispersing its collection would be a possibility. 
The city said it was too early to discuss possible successors or a timetable, but decisions about the institution's future are pressing. The museum's building in Lower Manhattan has been closed since April because of problems with its electrical systems, which were damaged by Sandy. All but one of its historic ships are out of commission and in various states of disrepair.
Moreover, the question hanging over the institution is, if the City Museum couldn't make a go of the Seaport Museum, how will any other organization do any better?
There are not many obvious candidates. The City Museum stepped up partly because its collection overlapped with that of the Seaport Museum. A spokeswoman for the New-York Historical Society said she could not comment on whether it would consider taking over. At Mystic Seaport in Connecticut, which manages four national historic landmark vessels in addition to 520 others, Stephen C. White, the president, said, ''I would say we have our hands full.''
''We're all saddened here by this news,'' Mr. White added. ''It's a real blow to the maritime history. There's probably no more important port than the South Street Seaport in New York City, and the Seaport Museum did a good job of telling that story.''
The South Street Seaport played a significant role in the city's early history, developing from a small cluster of wharves into part of the nation's leading port and making New York an international center of commerce.
Founded in 1967, the museum, at 12 Fulton Street, explores the city's maritime history through paintings, ship models, tools and scrimshaw, along with a fleet of 11 vessels that includes historic ships and service boats, many moored in the East River. While the museum has always been small, it is considered an important component of the Seaport, particularly of its Pier 17, where the Howard Hughes Corporation of Dallas plans to transform the marketplace into a three-story retail and entertainment center.
The city's Economic Development Corporation is ''committed to a museum that reflects the history of the area,'' the agency said in a statement. ''We believe this is an important goal, not only culturally, but also economically.''
Several people involved in reviewing the museum's affairs for the past few years said it is possible that the museum could resume its identity as an independent organization.
But it would need a base of committed donors, and it does not have a strong track record of running itself. Over the last decade it has closed its library building, given away its collection of two million artifacts excavated in Lower Manhattan, offered its ships for adoption and been in arrears to the Economic Development Corporation for rent and utilities.
At one point its former chairman, the developer Frank J. Sciame, lent the museum $3 million to cover operating expenses like payroll. In 2011, 7 of its 21 trustees resigned, and the museum furloughed 32 employees -- half of the staff -- delaying future exhibitions and effectively eliminating its curatorial and development departments.
That said, the City Museum had made significant progress since it assumed management in October 2011 with a $2 million grant from the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. It upgraded the Seaport Museum building, expanding gallery space and installing a new lobby, and presented 18 exhibitions, several of which were well received.
It has overseen ship repairs, including improving the hull and deck of the Wavertree and replacing the deck of the Ambrose, both with grants from the city. Another ship, the Pioneer, has been taking people out for excursions under a lease with New York Water Taxi.
The City Museum reopened the Seaport Museum's 19th-century printing shop, Bowne & Company Stationers, for business and opened a new custom letterpress business, Bowne Printers, next door.
The museum's annual operating budget -- $3.1 million this year -- is balanced.
And Susan Henshaw Jones, who has been directing both institutions, gave the Seaport Museum some serious sweat equity, trekking downtown from the City Museum on Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street every single day after the storm to manage the cleanup and try to boost morale.
''If the Seaport Museum doesn't exist there, somebody's going to want to recreate it -- the seaport was central to New York City's becoming a great city,'' Ms. Jones said. ''I don't think it is viable as it stands right now, but maybe the next entity will be able to unleash additional dollars, because it would be so sad for the city to lose the Seaport Museum.''

HEADLINE: Standoff in China Drags On For U.S. Man Held by Workers

BYLINE: By DAN LEVIN; Patrick Zuo and Shi Da contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- An American business executive being held hostage by employees at his medical supply plant on the outskirts of the capital spent a fifth day on Tuesday in a surreal standoff that has highlighted the dearth of legal protections in China for foreign investors and workers.
The executive, Chip Starnes, 42, a founder and president of Specialty Medical Supplies, was kept out of sight Tuesday afternoon, with local government officials insisting that he was merely busy with his lawyers in negotiations. 
''He is completely free within the factory; it's just that he has stuff to do,'' said Chu Lixiang, an official with the government-run labor union in Huairou, a district of Beijing.
The dispute, which has drawn a throng of police officers, Chinese reporters and American diplomats to the factory, began when the company, which is based in Coral Springs, Fla., closed its injection molding division and gave roughly 30 employees what Mr. Starnes described in a telephone interview on Tuesday night as a generous severance package.
The division, which manufactured medical goods like lancets and insulin syringes, is being moved to India. But rumors soon spread that Mr. Starnes was planning to close the entire plant and flee without paying the rest of the workers, which happens often in China.
Although he explained that the remaining workers were not being laid off, about 100 employees barricaded the exits on Friday and stopped him from leaving until he agreed to give them compensation identical to that given to the laid-off employees, a sum he contends would bankrupt the company.
Since then he has been trapped within the factory grounds, occasionally appearing at the barred window of his office looking haggard and in the same clothes he has worn since Friday. Over the weekend, local officials coerced him into signing contracts that met some of the workers' demands, even as employees kept him awake with bright lights and loud noises.
In the interview, Mr. Starnes bemoaned his fate, saying local officials were pressing him to provide lavish compensation to workers who were not scheduled to be laid off. ''The union just wants to do anything that will calm the people,'' he said. ''They are asking me to commit business suicide.''
Workers paint a starkly different picture of a company that has not paid its employees in weeks as news spread that Specialty Medical was moving some operations to India. ''We have been given an i.o.u. for two months and all assembly lines have stopped,'' said one manager, who gave only his surname, Wang. ''We went without work. What were we going to do?''
Mr. Starnes rejected the accusations of unpaid wages. ''That's ridiculous,'' he said, citing the payroll schedule. ''They were all paid on Monday.'' The factory was producing goods right up until the workers went rogue, he added.
China often favors economic development over labor rights, leaving workers with little recourse to resolve salary disputes. Sometimes, those who feel cheated turn to intimidation or violence.
In February, a factory owner in south China's Guangxi Autonomous Region was kidnapped from a hotel by two contractors who claimed that he owed them $618,000. A month earlier, a migrant worker in Shandong Province stabbed the relatives of a construction contractor, killing the man's 5-year-old nephew, over what news reports said was a $245 debt. In December, 14 women died in a fire at a bra factory in Guangzhou, which the police determined had been set by a worker upset over $490 in unpaid wages.
Western business executives say foreign companies are especially vulnerable to the strong-arm tactics of employees who have little faith in the Chinese legal system.
One business executive in Beijing described how workers at his company got wind of an impending closing and took managers hostage even before plans for compensation had been made public.
He said the crisis was defused by the local government, backed by the police, although officers sided with the workers.
''It's easy in China to agitate around a foreign employer,'' said the executive, who asked that his identity and his company's be kept secret because he still does business in China. ''This society is accustomed to using tools of mass mobilization, and when a spark erupts in the wrong place, things can quickly get out of control.''
Diplomats say they are relatively helpless when a foreign business owner is embroiled in such disputes. Officials from the United States Embassy visited Mr. Starnes on Monday, but could do little more than check on his welfare and make sure that he had access to his lawyers.
In the meantime, Mr. Starnes is unsure how the dispute can be resolved in a way that persuades his employees to come back to work. ''They hear a rumor and there's a big payday possibly, they'll stick together,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Two Court Rulings Related to Race

 BODY:
To the Editor:
There has hardly been a clearer example of judicial overreach and legislating from the bench than the disgraceful Supreme Court ruling on Tuesday striking down a key part of the Voting Rights Act (nytimes.com, June 25).
The 15th Amendment forbids the denial or abridgment of the right to vote by any state or the United States on account of race or color. And it gives to Congress the exclusive right to enforce the amendment by appropriate legislation. 
Congress decides what is appropriate, not the courts. Congress has reauthorized the act every time it came up for renewal. Only if there is a showing that a provision or its execution conflicts with the Constitution can the court act. Otherwise it must defer to Congress's judgment.
That the five justices who voted to strike part of the law questioned its necessity, which is a policy judgment, not a judicial one, shows how contemptuous they are for the law when it conflicts with their conservative principles.
ORIN HOLLANDER Jamison, Pa., June 25, 2013
To the Editor:
Re ''Justices Step Up Scrutiny of Race in College Entry'' (front page, June 25):
The Supreme Court had an opportunity in Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin to further support affirmative action programs and should have taken it.
Born of a pernicious divide in the nation along the lines of race, gender and religion that has seen the powerful hold down the powerless in contravention of the principles of a free and equal society, affirmative action has sought to redress the wrongs and correct our course.
Some speak of the benefits of affirmative action: the talents of many who might otherwise be lost to discrimination can only help a nation always in need of them. However, even if those benefits were not apparent, affirmative action has always represented a rational response to the malicious injury caused by racism, sexism and the like.
We do not have to seek diversity in America. We are diverse. Rather, our social contract demands that we continue to keep the nation free from the fear and prejudice that has and continues to deprive some of their most basic of civil rights. And that course should continue until those shackles become relegated to ancient history.
BRUCE NEUMAN Sag Harbor, N.Y., June 25, 2013
To the Editor:
Lee Bollinger, president of Columbia University, writes an eloquent defense of affirmative action as a means to promote ''social justice'' (''A Long, Slow Drift From Racial Justice,'' Op-Ed, June 25).
In essence, however, he justifies the continued use of affirmative action to remedy historical wrongs that neither afflict many families who today benefit from it nor have been caused by those who indirectly pay the price of these programs.
While racial quotas are unconstitutional, the use of race as a ''factor'' in admissions decisions is invariably a subterfuge whereby colleges achieve quotas of minority students that otherwise would be unlawful. In 2013, and with an African-American twice elected president, why should the child of professional, college-educated and relatively affluent African-American parents receive any form of preference solely on account of race?
As a matter of public policy, our principal concern should be to make higher education more readily available and affordable to students -- of whatever race -- from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, whose parents cannot provide the private schools, piano lessons, SAT tutors and other advantages that well-to-do parents can. In sum, affirmative action should focus on distinctions of economic class, not race.
Despite the fiction of America as a land of equal opportunity, disparities in wealth largely produce the disparities in opportunity and experience, educational and otherwise, that divide us throughout our lives.

HEADLINE: The Perils of Significant Misunderstandings in Evaluating Medicaid

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: Knowing the difference between the practical significance of findings and statistical methodology is crucial in evaluating health care policies and other issues, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago. He is the author of "The Redistribution Recession: How Labor Market Distortions Contracted the Economy." 
Whether you like or dislike the Affordable Care Act, it helps to understand the distinction between statistical significance and practical importance.
Taxpayers want to know whether the government programs they pay for actually make a difference, so measurement is a critical part of policy evaluation. That's where econometric and statistical analysis comes in: gather data under various policy implementations and try to measure the differences.
Take the act's major expansion of Medicaid benefits, going to able-bodied adults living at or below 133 percent of the poverty line (without regard to asset ownership), which will occur in most states at the beginning of next year. Will the expansion make adults healthier? 
An important study, published in The New England Journal of Medicine in May, set out to help answer the question by examining an Oregon-specific Medicaid expansion in 2008. In their short summary of conclusions, the authors wrote, "Medicaid coverage generated no significant improvements in measured health outcomes." Opponents of the Medicaid expansion quote that sentence, telling us that we might not want to expand a health program that doesn't actually make people healthier. Proponents of the expansion acknowledge the conclusion, too, and try to help readers find encouraging results elsewhere in the study.

Among the proponents, Ezra Klein wrote, "The health care itself didn't work as well as we hoped." In same issue of The New England Journal of
Medicine where the study appeared, a separate editorial noted, "Medicaid coverage did not significantly improve blood-pressure control, cholesterol levels or glycated hemoglobin levels," but insisted that the study demonstrated that Medicaid provided "considerable financial protection" and "dramatically improved access to care." Josh Barro wrote that the study "did not find significant effects on the physical health measures that were tracked," adding, "This is bad news for advocates of the Medicaid expansion."
In the 2008 book "The Cult of Statistical Significance: How the Standard Error Costs Us Jobs, Justice and Lives," Deirdre McCloskey and Stephen Ziliak warned that applications of statistics can and do go awry. They scold analysts who
look only for a probability of success in the crossing - the existence of a probability of success better than 0.99 or 0.95 or 0.90, and this within the restricted frame of sampling - ignoring in any spiritual or financial currency the value of the prize and the expected cost of pursuing it.
When a study measures a statistically significant difference, that only means that the difference probably is not an artifact of an insufficient study sample size, and that a similar difference would most likely be found in other samples. When a difference is not found to be statistically significant, it is possible that other samples will find differences in the opposite direction.
Statistical significance has little to do with "significance" as understood by laymen, who think of practical importance when they read that term. Professors McCloskey and Ziliak urge those citing statistics to recognize the distinction and pay attention to practical importance.
The commentators on both sides of the Medicaid debate made exactly this error. At best, they use "significance" in the statistical (and, in a journalism setting, esoteric) sense without cautioning people what it means, leaving practical importance as a footnote or side comment. Perhaps the commentators themselves misunderstand the study and think it found only practically unimportant differences. (I thank Darius Lakdawalla, a founding partner of Precision Health Economics, for bringing to my attention this issue with the Medicaid debate; see also commentaries by Jim Manzi and the Incidental Economist blog).
Economists are supposed to distinguish statistical significance from practical significance and sometimes do (as in a study by Jesse Rothstein of the University of California, Berkeley), but at least two economists have joined the commentators this time.
Table 2 in the study of Oregon published in The New England Journal of Medicine shows that 16.3 percent of the control sample without access to Medicaid had elevated blood pressure. The effect of Medicaid coverage is (with 95 percent confidence, according to the study) somewhere between -7.2 percentage points and +4.5 percentage points. By the standard of statistical significance, the study is consistent with the view that a Medicaid expansion would reduce elevated blood pressure prevalence from 16.3 percent to, say, 10 percent. (An effect of -6.3 is within what statisticians call the confidence interval.)
I'm not sure what Ezra Klein was hoping for, but a practical person could well interpret that kind of reduction as health care that does "work." (Note, however, that the study is also consistent with the view that Medicaid has no effect, because 0.0 is also in the confidence interval.)
The same table shows that 5.1 percent of the control sample had glycated hemoglobin high enough to be considered an indicator that diabetes is severe and not well-controlled. The effect of Medicaid coverage on the prevalence of this condition is between -4.4 and +2.6 percentage points. Cutting prevalence from 5.1 to, say, 3 is practically important and consistent with the findings of the study.
To put it another way, the only way the study could have found a statistically significant result here would be for Medicaid to essentially eliminate an important symptom of diabetes in a two-year time frame. Medicaid coverage could be quite valuable without passing that standard (even the Supreme Court has looked at this issue and concluded that statistical significance is not the only reliable standard of causation).
The authors of the study appear to be aware of these issues, because they note toward its end, "Our power to detect changes in health was limited by the relatively small numbers of patients with these conditions." If you are wondering why so much of the article, especially its front page, fails to qualify its use of "significance" as statistical, the authors tell me that the journal editors insist that authors use the word "significance" when they really mean "statistical significance," in order to shorten the sentences. Perhaps that's why the journal has a history of spawning misunderstandings like this; see Chapter 16 of "The Cult of Statistical Significance." (I asked the journal's editors to respond on this point and have not yet heard back.)
If the Oregon study prevents even one state from expanding its Medicaid program, Affordable Care Act proponents could assert that, as Professors McCloskey and Ziliak predicted, emphasis on statistical significance has proven to be deadly. Even if you think, as I do, that the law has fatal flaws, the Oregon study of Medicaid is not the place to find them.

 NEWS Ever since flash floods struck a mountainous area of northern India last week, 60 Indian military and civilian helicopters have been navigating fog, rain and treacherous Himalayan valleys looking for survivors and recovering bodies as part of the biggest airborne rescue and recovery operation in the history of the Indian military. As of Tuesday, the operation had rescued more than 12,000 people. The flooding, which began June 16, triggered by monsoons, has killed at least 1,000. But the rescue operation is not without hazards of its own. On Tuesday, a helicopter crashed into a mountain, killing 19 aboard. Hari Kumar reports from Dehradun, India.

HEADLINE: U.S. Is a 'Hacker Empire,' Says Chinese Military Analyst

BYLINE: DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW


HIGHLIGHT: A Chinese military expert spoke for over an hour on Xinhua, the state-run news agency, about how the United States is a &#8220;hacker empire&#8221; and China must protect itself by strengthening its online security. 

 BODY:
BEIJING - For more than an hour Wednesday morning, a Chinese military analyst excoriated the United States over what state-run media here calls "Prismgate" - the revelations of National Security Agency surveillance by Edward J. Snowden, a former N.S.A contractor.
Speaking in a Q&A with Xinhua, the state-run news agency, Wang Changqin, whom Xinhua described only as a "military expert" but elsewhere is identified as a professor at the Academy of Military Science of the People's Liberation Army of China, called the U.S. a "hacker empire." 
America stole people's secrets, including economic secrets, he said.
"America has many faces," Mr. Wang said, in comments that were often colorful and colloquial, perhaps reflecting the fact they were likely aimed for consumption by millions of ordinary Chinese.
It played many roles, including as protector of Internet freedoms and symbol of online morality and security, he said. But, "as common folk here say, no matter how often you 'play a role,' eventually the stuffing comes out," he said. "Prismgate has shown us America's stuffing."
"Before, for a variety of reasons, we never had sufficient evidence. But now we have the evidence and everyone knows more than ever: it's not that other people are 'harming' it," the U.S., "but that it is 'harming other people. Especially China," said Mr. Wang.
He accused U.S. companies of using the fruits of the surveillance to make economic profit, and said, in a speech laced with moral admonition: "Persisting in evil brings about one's own destruction."
"This hegemony clearly violates human fairness, justice and the innate sense of right and wrong," he said. "If America doesn't learn lessons from this, stop its hegemonic behavior and truly return to a harmonious way of dealing with the people of the world, get onto the path of cooperation and win-win, in the end it will 'drop a rock on its own feet,'" he said, using a proverb. "When you fall on the road of no return that is 'becoming an empire,' you can't get up again."
Mr. Wang said there were about 1,000 military and civilian online hackers mining China's secrets at the N.S.A's secretive eavesdropping organization, the Office of Tailored Access Operations, or TAO. Earlier this month, Foreign Policy magazine reported the office had "successfully penetrated Chinese computer and telecommunications systems for almost 15 years, generating some of the best and most reliable intelligence information about what is going on inside the People's Republic of China."
Mr. Wang is not a ranking state official, but his workplace - the country's top military academy in Beijing - and the venue of the comments made them noteworthy.
A drumbeat of criticism had been growing earlier this year in the U.S. that China was hacking its military and commercial secrets, including this one in the New York Times that cited three authors of a new book, who do research for the U.S. government, saying it amounted to aimed at leapfrogging development and overtaking the West with legally or illegally procured technology.
It was notable that Mr. Wang hit back at the allegations very early in the session, which lasted a little over one hour and was posted live on Xinhua.
"Under the influence of its propaganda, a lot of people believed: China's development wasn't just reliant on 'hard work,' 'resourcefulness' and 'doing one's utmost'", he said. "Envious and jealous, they inferred that China must have used many 'crooked roads and paths', the so-called 'original sin' theory."
"So 'framing' China had the biggest audience. As for the complaints, they used their technology and superior media to cause a bit of noise from time to time: hey my Web site has been attacked, hey that Website has been attacked. Yelling around in that way, yelling that it was a lot, going on a long time, turning up the volume, people who didn't know easily believed it. Not long ago they shouted: the People's Liberation Army hacked us. And that time it wasn't just subordinates who yelled it but the 'big boss,' Obama, who yelled along, even said, this is 'stealing America's property'," he said.
"This time, everyone understands: in the end they were yelling themselves hoarse to cover their own thievery!" By tapping in to China's text message networks and the systems backbone at Tsinghua University, one of the country's biggest, as Mr. Snowden alleged in his leaks, "how much Chinese property did they steal!" "America is slipping from being a 'hacker empire' to being a stealing money empire," he said.
China had to protect itself by strengthening its own online security, he said.
Earlier in June, not long after Mr. Snowden's allegations became public, James Mulvenon, a vice president at Defense Group Inc., a technology company in the Washington D.C. area, said U.S. firms did not use information gleaned from surveillance operations against terrorist threats for their commercial advantage, because, among other reasons, and speaking only on a practical level, "they would not know how to distribute the spoils fairly."
In an email, Mr. Mulvenon said, "most of the countries we deal with have single, state-affiliated 'national champions' in each sector, so it is easy for their intel services to provide commercial secrets to them."
"By contrast, the USG faces the prospect of anti-trust lawsuits from the private sector companies that did NOT receive the goods. For example, if the USG stole Huawei's LTE technology, who would they give it to? Cisco? Juniper? Both? What about startups in the 4G sector? Because of this problem, they don't steal commercial secrets for anyone. Of course, the Chinese do not believe us when we tell them this, since the U.S. is the only country in the world with these kind of scruples, but there it is," said Mr. Mulvenon.

HEADLINE: Bridging the Income Barrier at Top Colleges

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: A report calls for the expansion of a recent experiment aimed at persuading highly qualified low-income students to apply to leading colleges. 

 BODY:
The Hamilton Project, a Washington group affiliated with the Brookings Institution, has released a report calling for the expansion of a recent experiment aimed at persuading highly qualified low-income students to apply to top colleges. 
Only 34 percent of high-achieving high school seniors in the bottom fourth of income distribution attended any one of the country's 238 most selective colleges in a recent year, according to research conducted by Caroline M. Hoxby of Stanford and Christopher Avery of Harvard. Among top students in the highest income quartile, the figure was 78 percent.
The experiment intended to change the situation, conducted by Ms. Hoxby and Sarah Turner of the University of Virginia, mailed information packets about colleges mostly to high-performing, lower-income students. The packets included information on financial aid, admissions standards and graduation rates. Students who received the information were substantially more likely to attend top colleges - colleges with more resources and higher graduation rates - than students who did not receive them.
The Hamilton Project argues for an outside group, like the College Board, to help expand the experiment. It also suggested varying it - sending the information earlier than the senior year of high school, for instance - and allowing researchers to study its effectiveness.
In making its case, the group presented a series of charts on inequality and education in the United States. One notes that the cognitive ability of very young children does not differ much across income groups, suggesting there is a large pool of untapped academic talent among poorer children:
But the differences across income groups in how much parents spend on their children's educational enrichment have grown significantly in recent decades:
Those growing gaps have helped increase the gaps in school performance by income group ...
... and cause top colleges to be filled overwhelmingly with upper-income students:
The fact that so few low-income students attend top colleges is especially important because many nonselective colleges have low graduation rates. And a college degree remains the most reliable escape route from poverty:

HEADLINE: Wall Street's Tortoise and the Hare

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: The Royal Bank of Canada has risen up the ranks in stock trading in the United States by embracing restraint and prudence. | Italy faces potentially billions of euros in losses on derivatives contracts, The Financial Times reports. | Chinese investors are pushing ever deeper into United States real estate. 

 BODY:
WALL STREET'S TORTOISE AND THE HARE | The most successful firms on Wall Street are often those that are fastest and most opaque. But the Royal Bank of Canada has risen up the ranks in stock trading in the United States by "embracing a rather Canadian restraint and prudence," Nathaniel Popper writes in DealBook.
"At the center of the efforts by the bank's New York trading desk is a technology that actually slows its customers' orders so as to evade high frequency traders. And unlike nearly every other large bank in New York, it has elected not to open its own dark pool, where banks privately carry out customer trades away from the public exchanges," Mr. Popper writes. "Over all, it has risen to become the ninth-largest broker for American stocks last year, up from the 18th-largest in 2010, according to the brokerage and research firm Abel/Noser." On Tuesday, the bank's executives in Canada announced plans to create a new exchange in Canada that aims to be less hospitable to high-speed traders than the Toronto Stock Exchange. 
ITALY STUNG BY DERIVATIVES | According to a confidential report by the Treasury in Rome, Italy faces potentially billions of euros in losses on derivatives contracts it restructured at the height of Europe's economic crisis, The Financial Times reports. The report, the newspaper says, describes the restructuring last year of eight derivatives contracts with foreign banks with a total notional value of 31.7 billion euros, or about $41.3 billion. The report leaves out details and does not name the banks, but it appears that the restructuring allowed the Treasury "to stagger payments owed to foreign banks over a longer period but, in some cases, at more disadvantageous terms for Italy," the newspaper reports. The government report also does not specify the potential losses the country faces, but "three independent experts" estimated a potential loss of roughly 8 billion euros, or $10.4 billion, according to the newspaper.
ON THE AGENDA | The hedge fund manager David Einhorn is in Las Vegas to play in the One Drop High Roller tournament of the World Series of Poker. HD Supply Holdings is expected to price its initial public offering this evening. Monsanto reports earnings this morning, and Bed, Bath & Beyond reports earnings after the market closes. Roger Altman, chairman of Evercore Partners, is on CNBC at 7 a.m. Robert Nardelli, senior adviser at Cerberus Capital Management, is on Bloomberg TV at 7 a.m.
RUBENSTEIN'S LATEST PURCHASE | David M. Rubenstein, co-founder and co-chief executive of the Carlyle Group, has added another piece of Americana to his collection. The private equity tycoon bought a copy of the first newspaper printing of the Declaration of Independence for $632,500 on Tuesday, with plans to display it publicly, Reuters reports.
CHINESE IN U.S. PROPERTY DEALS | About a quarter century after Japanese investors came to the United States in pursuit of property, "another set of deep-pocketed foreign buyers is pushing ever deeper into United States real estate: the Chinese," Julie Creswell writes in The New York Times. "Undaunted by Japan's real estate misadventures in the 1980s - some Japanese investors wildly overpaid for United States property, and Japan eventually suffered one of the biggest property market collapses in history - Chinese investors are fanning out in the United States."
"What began with a few isolated purchases two years ago has become a hunt for trophy properties and billion-dollar deals. So far, the kind of fears that arose in the 1980s - unfounded talk that Japan was 'buying up' America - have not surfaced this time. To the contrary, the Chinese, or at least their money, are being welcomed, even celebrated."

HEADLINE: Proposed Guidelines Could Require Banks to Raise Billions in Capital

BYLINE: JACK EWING


HIGHLIGHT: The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued a revised proposal on how banks should calculate their so-called leverage ratios. If put into force, the new rules would probably fall hardest on large European institutions like Deutsche Bank and Barclays. 

 BODY:
FRANKFURT - Big European banks may be required to raise billions of euros in new capital, making them less risky but potentially putting them at a disadvantage to their American rivals, underguidelines issued Wednesday by an organization that coordinates global bank regulation.
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which includes regulators from the United States, Europe, Japan and other major economies, issued a revised proposal Wednesday on how banks should calculate their so-called leverage ratios, a measure of how much of other people's money lenders use to conduct business. 
 If put into force, the new rules would probably fall hardest on large European institutions like Deutsche Bank and Barclays, which tend to use a high proportion of borrowed money to do business or have large portfolios of derivatives.
American banks have faced controls on leverage for decades, while most European banks have not. As a result, Europe's banks may have to struggle harder to comply with the new rules. ''This will essentially be the first time European banks will be subject to a leverage ratio,'' said Andrew S. Fei, a lawyer in the New York office of Davis Polk who specializes in bank regulation.
While highly technical, the proposed rules are at the center of efforts to ensure that taxpayers never again have to bail out big banks amid a financial crisis. Banks have lobbied intensively for rules that allowed them to risk large amounts of borrowed money, which provides them the opportunity to increase profits. But the guidelines issued Wednesday appear to reflect warnings by many economists that bank risk remains too high.
Stefan Ingves, chairman of the Basel Committee and governor of the Swedish central bank, said the rules would also eliminate discrepancies in the way leverage was calculated in different countries.
''This ensures investors and other stakeholders will have a comparable measure of bank leverage, regardless of domestic accounting standards,'' Mr. Ingves said in a statement.
The proposed guidelines come amid signs that, elsewhere in Europe, the political will to rein in bank risk is flagging. Euro-zone finance ministers met in Brussels on Wednesday in yet another effort to reach an agreement on a so-called banking union, in which countries would share some of the cost of recapitalizing banks.
Marathon talks on the subject last week ended in deadlock. The ministers were not expected to conclude the latest round of talks until late Wednesday or early Thursday, and it was uncertain whether they would be able to reach an agreement.
The new rules from the Basel Committee are not binding on individual countries and would not take full effect until the beginning of 2018. Banks and other interested parties have until Sept. 20 to comment on the guidelines, which could be further revised before the committee votes on the proposal.
Banks that are short of capital under the new guidelines could face market pressure to raise money well before the rules take effect. That is because, beginning in 2015, the banks would be required to disclose much more information about what kind of risk they carry on their books.
Some governments, anxious to avoid asking taxpayers to rescue banks again, have already been compelling lenders to raise more capital. The Prudential Regulatory Authority in Britain ordered Barclays last week to submit a plan by the end of the month on how the institution would increase capital and reduce leverage.
The Bank of England warned on Wednesday that banks might need to further bolster their capital because of big swings in asset prices that had taken place in recent weeks, as markets reacted to signs that the Federal Reserve in the United States was likely to scale back its stimulus measures.
''Authorities need to be alert to whether stability could be threatened by excessive leverage or liquidity risk building up in any potentially vulnerable parts of the financial system,'' said Paul Tucker, deputy governor for financial stability at the British central bank. ''That has been underlined by the abrupt correction in asset prices over recent weeks.''
Rules on leverage have been the subject of an intense, behind-the-scenes debate between bankers and regulators for several years, as well as a source of tension between the United States and Europe.
German and French regulators have pushed for rules that give banks wide discretion to estimate their risk from loans, derivatives or other assets. But American regulators, along with many economists, have argued that banks cannot be relied on to judge risk accurately.
Thomas M. Hoenig, vice chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, told an audience in Basel in April that measures of risk based on banks' own calculations created ''the illusion that these firms are well capitalized.''
In 2010, the Basel Committee proposed a leverage ratio of 3 percent, meaning that banks would need to hold about $1 in capital for every $33 in risk or other financial exposure. But there remained questions about how banks should be required to value their portfolios and calculate the ratio.
While European banks would tend to be hit hardest by the new rules, American banks could also feel pressure. Some of the methods they use to discount derivatives exposure under American accounting rules would no longer be allowed. Higher exposure would increase their need for capital.
Even with the stricter guidelines proposed Wednesday, economists expressed concern that banks were continuing to operate with thin capital cushions.
''We are still looking at very low numbers from a historical perspective,'' said Harald Benink, a professor of banking and finance at Tilburg University in the Netherlands. ''If we really want to protect the taxpayers, we need to start looking at numbers that are more ambitious.''

HEADLINE: Bumpy Rides: Brendan Koerner Talks About 'The Skies Belong to Us'

BYLINE: JOHN WILLIAMS


HIGHLIGHT: Mr. Koerner&#8217;s book recounts an epic 1972 hijacking and its aftermath. 

 BODY:
"The Skies Belong to Us," by Brendan I. Koerner, documents a time in the late 1960s and early '70s when hijacking was an alarmingly regular part of traveling the American skies. Mr. Koerner devotes most of his attention to Roger Holder, a disgruntled Vietnam vet, and Cathy Kerkow, a troubled young woman from Oregon. The pair, who hijacked a flight and took it to Algiers, eventually settled in France, where they became minor celebrities among the French left. Reviewing the book for The Times, Dwight Garner called it "such pure pop storytelling that reading it is like hearing the best song of summer squirt out of the radio." In a recent e-mail interview, Mr. Koerner discussed interviewing Holder, why it took so long for the authorities to increase airport security at the time and more. Below are edited excerpts from the conversation:
 Q. 
How did you come across this story? 
 A. 
I actually have to give credit to The New York Times. Back in October 2009, I read a Metro story about a guy named Luis Armando Pea Soltren, a former Puerto Rican nationalist who had hijacked a plane to Havana in 1968. He spent the next 41 years living in Cuba, then suddenly decided to return to the U.S., where he had left behind a wife and daughter; the Times story was about his arrest at JFK Airport. I've always been drawn to stories about fugitives and exiles, so the article got me curious about other Vietnam-era hijackers who had managed to dodge justice for years. In the course of my search for those kinds of characters, I stumbled across the names Catherine Marie Kerkow and Willie Roger Holder - the two figures who became my great obsession.
 Q. 
Why do you think that Mr. Holder and Ms. Kerkow and the hijacking phenomenon of that time weren't better remembered before your book was published?
 A. 
Skyjackers had a pretty abysmal success rate - once you commandeered a plane in American airspace, your odds of a happy ending were slim. After the epidemic ended in 1973, what folks tended to remember most about the skyjackers was their futility. Over time, it became too easy to dismiss the whole phenomenon as some comic trifle - the work of a bunch of delusional failures who dropped ransoms while jumping out of airplanes, or who mistakenly thought they'd be greeted as heroes in Havana. The era's truly compelling stories, like that of Holder and Kerkow, got lost in the shuffle.
 Q. 
How did you recreate so much of the story? You spoke to Mr. Holder - how much did you rely on your talks with him and how much did you use other documents and research?
 A. 
The Holder interviews were critical, but they were only a small piece of the entire research puzzle. I also spoke with a galaxy of people who had known him over the years: Holder's sister, his longtime girlfriend, his comrades from Vietnam, his acquaintances from Algiers and Paris, and many of the hostages he had held aboard Western Airlines Flight 701. There were also thousands of documents to sift through, including F.B.I. interviews, State Department cables, military records, transcripts from the hijacked flight and even Holder's unpublished memoirs.
 Q. 
How much time did you spend talking to him? Was he mostly cooperative and understanding of what you were trying to do?
 A. 
I started talking to him on the phone in the early summer of 2011, but I didn't fly out to San Diego to visit him until that August. We spent a solid week discussing his story, in marathon sessions fueled by coffee and (for him) Pall Mall cigarettes. He was a little wary at first, but his reserve quickly melted away. He had been trying to write his memoirs since the early 1980s, so I think he rather enjoyed the opportunity to rhapsodize about all the history he had lived through. The one thing he was touchy about, though, was photography - he wouldn't let me snap his picture, no matter how many times I asked.
 Q. 
How far into writing his memoirs did he get? And how did you find them - candid, stylish?
 A. 
Holder had some rough breaks with his memoirs over the years. He burned a first draft while living in France in the early 1980s; then the F.B.I. seized a manuscript in 1991, when Holder was being investigated for allegedly plotting another hijacking. The hundred or so pages that I read were somewhat fragmentary in nature - he wasn't great at crafting segues between his memories - but his prose was surprisingly vivid. He had very sharp recollections of his service in Vietnam and his time aboard Western Airlines Flight 701, in particular. I could tell that he had spent a lot of time pondering those pieces of his personal history, in an attempt to make sense of the unusual choices he had made.
 Q. 
Many hijackers at the time saw their actions as political protests, however vague. What was the most bizarre motivation you came across?
 A. 
Arthur Gates Barkley, an unemployed truck driver from Arizona, spent seven years disputing a $471.78 tax bill from the I.R.S. He eventually appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court to hear his case, but the justices turned him down. So in June 1970, he hijacked a plane to Washington, D.C., where he demanded a $100 million ransom to be paid out of the Supreme Court's treasury - an act of revenge against the judicial system that had betrayed him. As you can probably imagine, things didn't work out quite as Barkley had hoped.
 Q. 
The book chronicles more than a decade of hijackings. Yet security in airports over this time remained essentially nonexistent. That's hard to understand from our post-9/11 perspective. Why was no action taken for so long?
 A. 
The airlines used their political clout to frustrate a lot of efforts to tighten security. They were scared that travelers would revolt if forced to pass through metal detectors or have their bags checked. And they also figured that it was cheaper to endure periodic skyjackings than pay millions for security equipment and personnel. That sounds incredibly irresponsible in hindsight, but you have to realize that hijackers in that era were primarily interested in negotiating, not causing mass destruction. It wasn't until the very end of the epidemic that people started to awaken to the fact that, sooner or later, someone was going to crash a plane into a populated area - or a nuclear reactor.
 Q. 
Eventually, security around air travel tightened. You write: "The years that followed Watergate and the fall of Saigon would be filled with plenty of high-profile mayhem committed by men and women at their wits' ends," but hijackings were no longer part of that. Where did the mayhem get channeled instead?
 A. 
Into more run-of-the-mill violence, particularly shootings of public figures. Someone like John Hinckley Jr., who attempted to assassinate President Ronald Reagan, is a perfect example - had he been born a bit earlier, he probably would have been a skyjacker.
 Q. 
In your acknowledgments, you thank Spike Lee for giving you "a master class in storytelling." Can you elaborate on that?
 A. 
Spike optioned my first book, "Now the Hell Will Start," and he trusted me to write the screenplay, too. That was an awesome learning experience - I grew up watching Spike's movies, and here he was giving me handwritten notes about structure and dialogue. His feedback taught me so much about how to craft a cinematic narrative. And it changed the way I plan my projects - instead of writing a traditional outline for "The Skies Belong to Us," for example, I storyboarded the whole book with more than 200 sequenced images.
 Q. 
Has the new book been optioned for the movies yet? If not, do you hope it will be?
 A. 
No one has optioned it yet, but I would certainly love for that to happen. The book's atmosphere is deeply influenced by a bunch of tremendous movies, especially the full six-hour version of Olivier Assayas's "Carlos." I must have watched that thing a half-dozen times while writing the book.
 Q. 
Are you on the trail of another story for a new book yet?
 A. 
I have a few ideas percolating, but to be honest, I need a little time to breathe. This book took a lot out of me, as my long-suffering wife and kids can attest. I'm aiming to steal some days this summer to clear my head and get back in the creative flow. Oh, and clean my desk - it's a disaster right now.

HEADLINE: Mazda Unveils the All-New 2014 Mazda 3

BYLINE: BENJAMIN PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: The grille design for the 2014 Mazda 3 sheds the so-called smile, and over all the car includes many features not common in a compact. 

 BODY:
If you haven't already seen photos that were leaked all over the Internet before Mazda's official unveiling of the 2014 Mazda 3 in Manhattan on Wednesday morning, the all-new compact is a looker. With proportions reminiscent of long-nose, short-rear-deck pony car glory, the new Mazda 3 is the latest example of the company's Kodo design language. 
"I've been telling people we're going to get rid of the Smile. We got rid of the Smile," said Derek Jenkins, director of design for Mazda's North American operations. He is, of course, referring to the cartoonish grille grins the company's past generation of models wore. Kodo cars have a five-pointed grille opening that, set between two sinister headlamp eyes, looks more like a puckish attack scowl.
Mazda's handsome Kodo design language - we're told that kodo means "soul of motion" - has already made its way from those sleek concept cars brought to international auto shows over the last few years to production models like the CX-5 compact crossover and the Mazda 6 midsize sedan. Finally, with even the ever strong-selling, but often lackluster Toyota Corolla getting a facelift for next year, Mazda got to its popular compact, applying Kodo magic to the Mazda 3 as well.
The new Mazda 3, which is a few inches longer than the outgoing model, but a couple hundred pounds lighter, will also have many features not common in the compact car segment, which Mazda says is its bread and butter. Among them are a head-up display system for speed, r.p.m. and by-direction navigation information, new navigation and infotainment systems, a rear-view camera, adaptive front lighting, a lane departure warning system and adaptive cruise control.
Although a diesel power plant option is not likely, Mazda said, the company's high-compression 2-liter and 2.5-liter Skyactiv 4-cylinder gasoline engines will be options for the new Mazda 3. Jeremy Barnes, a spokesman for Mazda, said that specific horsepower and fuel economy numbers would be available in a few weeks, as would transmission options, pricing and an unveiling of the new sedan model.
"It will be priced competitively in the heart of the segment," he said.
Mazda said the first new Mazda 3 models will be built in Japan. Later, after the company opens a new plant it plans to open in Mexico in the spring of 2014, Mazda 3 production will be shifted there. The 2014 Mazda 3 should be available in dealerships in September of this year.

HEADLINE: Immigration and Fiscal Policy

BYLINE: ANNIE LOWREY


HIGHLIGHT: Analysts are split on how a change in immigration law would affect the federal budget, though the Congressional Budget Office has concluded it would reduce the deficit. 

 BODY:
An overhaul of immigration law would reduce the federal deficit. That's the conclusion of a broad range of studies, from the libertarian Cato Institute to the conservative American Action Forum to the liberal Center for American Progress. Wait, it would really increase the deficit. That's the analysis of the Heritage Foundation and the Center for Immigration Studies. But hang on a second. Immigrants have little impact on the federal deficit. That's what the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development thinks.
Needless to say, the impact of immigration on the budget is a complicated question, and a subject of lively debate. In no small part, that is because economists disagree on what to measure. The effect of pending legislation, or of current immigration? All immigrants or just undocumented immigrants? By household or by individual? In one fiscal year or over a lifetime? Different metrics produce different results. 
That said, economists broadly agree that immigration is great for the earnings and productivity of the immigrants themselves, and that it often has a net benefit for the whole economy, even if there are winners and losers. (That's called the "immigration surplus.")
The immigration legislation currently under consideration would likely have a positive fiscal impact, reducing the deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars. According to a recent report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the Senate bill would slash the deficit by $200 billion over the next 10 years and $700 billion for the decade after that. (As a share of the overall economy, which is likely to exceed $400 trillion in the next 20 years, that is fairly trivial.) The deficit reduction would come from both increasing spending and increasing revenue. Over the course of a decade, the government would pay out an additional $262 billion on programs like Medicaid, but it would see its revenues go up by $459 billion, too.
It is worth noting that legislation bars certain immigrants, such as undocumented workers who would win provisional status, from receiving a broad swath of government benefits for years. That helps keep the bill's costs down. It's also worth noting that the C.B.O. thinks the broad economic impact would be significant, increasing the size of the labor force, raising average wages in the long term, bolstering capital investment and increasing productivity. Ultimately, the bill would increase real economic output by 3.3 percent in 2023 and 5.4 percent in 2033, the C.B.O. thinks.
Among the others who have examined the issue, the O.E.C.D. study looked at the impact of immigration on the fiscal situation across a range of wealthy nations over a decade, and found it to be negligible. But it did say that conditions in the United States, such as a younger immigrant base and more limited public benefit programs than European countries, made it more likely to experience a net fiscal gain from immigration.
The Heritage Foundation analysis, in contrast, contends that newly legal immigrants can be expected to benefit from a wide variety of public services (not all attributable to the federal budget) that will far outstrip the immigrants' tax payments. Though it says that in an interim period, "tax payments would increase more than government benefits," the conservative research group predicts that the ultimate availability of means-tested welfare and medical benefits to immigrants who currently lack legal status would incur a net fiscal cost of $106 billion a year, along with a net burden of $160 billion a year in Social Security and Medicare costs when the immigrants retire.
In terms of state and local budgets, there is no good estimate of the impact of an immigration overhaul. In its recent report, the C.B.O. noted that the "influx of new immigrants would cause state and local governments to experience both greater demand for services and an increase in revenues, potentially affecting their budget balances." But it said it had not analyzed the full effects. Prior local or regional studies of immigration, or of changes to immigration law, have found both positive and negative fiscal impacts, again largely depending on what and how economists chose to measure.

HEADLINE: A.I.G.'s Former Chief Can Pursue Narrower Suit Against U.S.

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: A federal judge has ruled Maurice R. Greenberg can continue with claims that shareholders of A.I.G. lost tens of billions of dollars when the government attached onerous terms to the financial crisis bailout of the insurance giant. 

 BODY:
The former chief executive of the American International Group, Maurice R. Greenberg, can pursue a lawsuit against the United States government over the financial crisis bailout of the insurer, though in narrower form, a judge ruled on Wednesday. 
Mr. Greenberg can continue with claims that shareholders of A.I.G. lost tens of billions of dollars when the government attached onerous terms to the $182 billion rescue, Judge Thomas C. Wheeler of the United States Court of Federal Claims ruled on Wednesday.
But the judge threw out so-called derivative claims in which Mr. Greenberg sought to fight on behalf of his former company. In his ruling, Judge Wheeler said the board of A.I.G. had acted in good faith when it decided not to join the lawsuit earlier this year.
Mr. Greenberg, through his investment vehicle Starr International, has "failed to allege particularized facts that create a reasonable doubt as to the good faith or reasonableness of the board's investigation of Starr's demand," the judge ruled, granting motions by A.I.G. and the government to dismiss the derivative claims.
At the same time, the decision leaves intact Mr. Greenberg's direct claims against the government on behalf of himself and other shareholders, denying a motion by the government to dismiss those claims.
"We are pleased that the Court of Federal Claims has denied the motion of the United States and permitted Starr International to pursue the claims of two classes of A.I.G. shareholders for tens of billions of dollars that the government took without just compensation and/or illegally exacted in 2008 and 2009," David Boies, the prominent trial lawyer representing Mr. Greenberg, said in a statement. "We look forward to continuing discovery in this action and getting ready for trial in the fall of 2014."
Wednesday's decision allows A.I.G. to distance itself from the lawsuit, which set off a storm of controversy when The New York Times reported in January that the board of the insurer was weighing whether to join it. Several lawmakers expressed alarm that A.I.G. might sue its savior.
After choosing not to join with its former chief, A.I.G. in April sought to bar Mr. Greenberg from suing on its behalf. The insurer said at that time that its directors "had every right to decide, in the exercise of their business judgment, that suing the government for its rescue of A.I.G. is not the right thing for A.I.G. to do."
The essence of Mr. Greenberg's claims against the government is that the A.I.G. bailout shortchanged investors and violated their Fifth Amendment rights. The Treasury Department has said that the claims "have no merit whatsoever, and we will continue to defend the case vigorously."

HEADLINE: Who Frets Most About Student Debt

BYLINE: ANNIE LOWREY


HIGHLIGHT: As Congress appears to falter in its efforts to stop interest rates on certain student loans from doubling, an Urban Institute study sheds light on those most worried about repaying their debt. 

 BODY:
In a matter of days, interest rates on certain student loans are set to double, and Congress appears to be faltering in its efforts to reach a deal to keep them down. 
These efforts come as the total value of student-loan debt continues to swell, passing the $1 trillion mark by some measures. Economists believe that this burden is delaying major spending decisions and household formation among young workers, and that it might depress their wealth accumulation over time.
Granted, those taking out loans are often seeking a degree that comes with rich rewards in the workplace. College graduates earn, on average, 84 percent more than people with just a high school diploma. And millions of Americans have student-loan burdens that are manageable given their incomes.
But a new report from the Urban Institute sheds some light on those most concerned about their student debt.
Some results are not surprising. Lower-income borrowers are more worried than those with higher incomes. Having financially dependent children means more stress, too. But there are a number of interesting factoids:

        
Women are not more likely to have student-loan debt than men, but they are more worried about paying it back.
        
Concern is basically even across age groups, though younger workers are much more likely to have student-loan debt than older workers.
        
People who live in the Northeast also seem to be particularly concerned.
        
Even controlling for household income, those without full-time jobs tend to be more worried.

HEADLINE: What if We're Looking at Inequality the Wrong Way?

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: The question of how to measure the dollar gap between classes in America has economists riled up. 

 BODY:
Richard V. Burkhauser, a professor of public policy at Cornell and an adjunct scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, is fast becoming a champion of the right, challenging the conventional wisdom about income inequality.
The last time Burkhauser appeared in this column, he had provided ammunition for conservatives to dispute liberal orthodoxy on the issue of growing inequality (along with co-authors Jeff Larrimore and Kosali Simon).
That ammunition was contained in a 2011 paper, "A 'Second Opinion' on the Economic Health of the American Middle Class," which lent support to the conservative cause.

By defining income as "post-tax, post-transfer, size-adjusted household income including the ex-ante value of in-kind health insurance benefits," Burkhauser and his co-authors achieved two things: a diminished degree of inequality and, perhaps more important, a conclusion that the condition of the poor and middle class was improving.
The 2011 Burkhauser paper found less inequality than other measures, but did not claim that income inequality did not exist: from 1979 to 2007, Burkhauser argued, those in the bottom quintile saw incomes increase by 26.4 percent, but those in the top quintile saw their incomes grow 52.6 percent. Those in the top 5 percent saw a 63 percent increase in their income. 
Now Burkhauser and his allies have returned with a new paper, "Levels and Trends in United States Income and Its Distribution," which was publishedearlier this month. In the 2013 paper, written with Larrimore and Philip Armour, Burkhauser has come up with statistical findings that not only wipe out inequality trends altogether but also purport to show that over the past 18 years, the poor and middle classes have done better, on a percentage basis, than the rich.
The debate over income inequality has been going on for decades. It remains bitterly disputed. In an e-mail, James Wetzler, the former chief economist of Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation who also served as New York State Tax Commissioner, described some of the complexities of the debate to me:
You get different answers depending on whether you measure income before or after taxes and transfers, whether you count fringe benefits (mainly health insurance), and whether you look at families or households, and whether you count the big hitters as the top 20% or the top 1 percent. Counting health care mutes the increase in inequality, but that really means that most of the increase in working class incomes has been siphoned off to medical providers. Looking at households has the same effect. Including transfers is interesting because middle class transfers like Social Security and Medicare have grown faster than transfers to poor people like welfare and food stamps. Taxes, of course, have become less progressive, at least until this year.
Douglas A. Hibbs Jr., a former professor of economics at the University of Gothenburg, wrote me that Burkhauser's 2013
discussion of proper income concepts and the problems implementing those in available data is excellent. I doubt many or any who know the lay of the land would object. The favored 'income' concept for analysis of annual changes in inequality, namely annual consumption plus annual changes in net wealth, is exactly on target.
In the highly charged atmosphere of the inequality debate, however, Burkhauser's work has provoked harsh criticism.
Lawrence Katz, a Harvard economist, wrote in an e-mail that the data used by Burkhauser in his 2013 paper
are not up to the task. And the results are likely to be greatly overstated and hinge on what seem to me to be rather implausible assumptions in which the authors impute the annual accrual of capital gains income from quite poor household data on asset classes combined with the assumption that everyone gets the average rate of return so that no one is lucky, no one is skilled in investing. If you eliminate the possibility of anyone doing really well in terms of their investments, you can make it look like the capital incomes of the top end did not do so well.
Emmanuel Saez, a University of California, Berkeley, economist considered by many to be a leading expert on income trends, wrote:
For the U.S., you should not trust any paper on top incomes that uses Current Population Survey data. Survey data cannot get at top incomes well because the surveys have too small samples of top earners to be reliable. That's the very basic reason why our research on top incomes estimated with tax data adds value. In a nutshell, Burkhauser et al. will never say anything interesting about top incomes if they start from CPS data, although they might say interesting things on bottom 99 percent incomes.
Edward N. Wolff, an economist at New York University, noted in an e-mail that work he did with Ajit Zacharias, using methods similar to Burkhauser's, reached the opposite conclusion:
I am surprised by the Burkhauser result. We did something very similar in 2012 and did not find his result. We included imputed rent to owner occupied housing and a yearly estimate of annual capital gains (both realized and unrealized). Our data went through 2007. If anything, we find a sharper rise in inequality using our measure of comprehensive income than using standard income.
Along the same lines, Timothy Smeeding of the University of Wisconsin, writing with Jeffrey P. Thompson, measured income trends from 1989 to 2007 and concluded that "inequality measures peaked in 2007 at their highest levels in 20 years."
The following charts reflect the scope of the challenge Burkhauser has mounted to liberals, including President Obama, who worry about upward distribution of income.
First, take a look at Figure 1, a 2011 Congressional Budget Office chart showing significant inequality in the distribution of income gains from 1979 to 2007. Many on the left consider work done by the C.B.O. to be the gold standard of inequality measurement:
Burkhauser's 2011 methodology worked to make the pattern appear far less extreme, as illustrated by Figure 2:
In his 2013 paper, Burkhauser and his two co-authors have completely upended the thrust of Figures 1 and 2.
The charts in Figure 3 and Figure 4 are derived from data in the 2013 Burkhauser paper, which covers the years from 1989 to 2007.
Figure 3 shows the percentage change in income by quintile and for the top 5 percent using Burkhauser's measure of "household size-adjusted post-tax, post-transfer income plus in-kind income" plus "accrued capital gains, including housing."
And Figure 4 shows the percentage change in income by quintile and for the top 5 percent using the same measures as in Figure 3, but adding "accrued gains including housing and privately held businesses."
If - a virtually impossible if - the economic and policy-making community were to reach even a rough consensus in support of Burkhauser's 2013 analysis, the victory for the right would be hard to overestimate.
If Burkhauser's approach was accepted, it would render moot the basic political and philosophical tenets of the Obama presidency, which he expressed most articulately at the start of the last presidential campaign:
For most Americans, the basic bargain that made this country great has eroded. Long before the recession hit, hard work stopped paying off for too many people. Fewer and fewer of the folks who contributed to the success of our economy actually benefited from that success. Those at the very top grew wealthier from their incomes and their investments - wealthier than ever before. But everybody else struggled with costs that were growing and paychecks that weren't - and too many families found themselves racking up more and more debt just to keep up.
Not only would Burkhauser lay waste to a core liberal argument - inequality is worsening - but his claim that a declining share of income is going to the wealthy could be used to justify further tax cuts for the affluent in order to foster top-down investment and growth, just as Republicans justified the Reagan tax cuts of 1981 and the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003.
Burkhauser et al. achieve their reversal of past income distribution data by amending the definition of income developed in their 2012 paper - "post-tax, post-transfer, size-adjusted household income including the ex-ante value of in-kind health insurance benefits" - to incorporate another accounting tool: "yearly-accrued capital gains to measure yearly changes in wealth."
Although "yearly-accrued capital gains" sounds innocuous, it is a game changer.
Burkhauser attempts to measure the year-to-year increase in taxpayers' assets - stocks and bonds, housing and privately held businesses - and to count those annual increases as income. Increases in the value of such assets do not show up in tax data because they are taxed by the federal government only when the asset in question is sold and the increased value is realized as taxable gains.
Burkhauser and his co-authors provided me with the following four-paragraph explanation to clarify their logic:
Consider a couple with one child making $50,500 (2013 dollars) in 1989 before considering capital gains (this is roughly the mean income of the middle quintile). This couple owns a home worth $120,000, $10,000 of taxable investment assets and about $3,000 in IRA accounts, but didn't sell any assets in the year so no capital gains appear on tax returns. This is in-line with the assets of a middle-income household in 1989. In line with the average asset appreciation in the year, the value of the couple's house increased by about $800 in the year and the value of their investments increased by $3,000. So their income including accrued capital gains was $54,300.
In 2007, the couple at the same point in the distribution would make $61,000 before capital gains. This is a 20% increase. The couple owns a home worth $185,000, has taxable investment account assets of $30,000 and retirement account assets of $20,000. Again, this is in-line with the assets of a middle-income household in 2007. In line with the average asset appreciation in the year, the value of the couple's house fell by $8,500 while their investments increased by $1,750. So their income including accrued capital gains was $54,250. So the incomes of couples at the middle of the distribution are basically flat once including accrued capital gains.
Now consider a high-income couple with one child making $200,000 (in 2013) dollars in 1989 (this is roughly the mean income of the top 5%) excluding capital gains, but sold stock for a capital gain of $20,000 in the year so $220,000 appears on their tax return. This couple owns a home worth $300,000 and has investments of $150,000. This is in-line with the assets of a middle-income household in 1989. In line with the average asset appreciation in the year, the value of this couple's house increased by about $2,000 in the year and the value of their investments increased by $35,000. So their income including accrued capital gains was $237,000 ($200,000 of earned income plus $37,000 of accrued capital gains).
In 2007 a couple at the same point in the distribution would make $230,000 and may have sold assets to make about $65,000 in taxable capital gains for a total income on their tax return of $295,000 - an increase of 34%. Looking at their assets this couple owns a home worth $500,000 and has investments worth $500,000. In line with the average asset appreciation in the year, the value of this couple's house fell in value by about $23,000 and the value of their investments increased by about $18,000. So their income including accrued capital gains was just $225,000. So when using this measure more in-line with Haig-Simons (a classic economists' definition of income), the income of the couple fell by 5% - worse than that of the middle income couple.
The Burkhauser approach does a number of things. First, it spreads and flattens income from capital gains over the duration of ownership. For a wealthy individual who makes a huge killing selling stock or a businesses, his or her income does not spike in the year of the sale, but emerges instead as a series of yearly incremental gains.
For assets that have been held for a long time, the Burkhauser system effectively backdates much of currently realized capital gains onto earlier years. This is especially significant in calculating income gains from the current sale of assets purchased in the 1980s and 1990s, since much of the added value was acquired in those earlier decades. "The high taxable realized capital gains income observed on tax returns today are not necessarily a reflection of higher current incomes," Burkhauser and co-authors write in the 2013 paper, but are instead "more likely to be a residual effect of previously accrued capital gains that are only now being realized."
In a series of e-mail exchanges with me, Burkhauser justified his methodology as follows:
You want to use the accrual value this year in your concept of income this year since that is how much your capital changed this year and that is how much your income this year changed because of it. If you have a stock that increases in value this year, you have the option to sell at the end of the year for a gain now so your available resources increased even if you don't sell. The fact that you did not realize those gains this year simply means that you "saved it."
I raised the following question:
Is it a fair measure of a person's well-being to include unrealized capital gains? Their house or other assets may have increased in value, but their standard of living has not changed.
Burkhauser's reply:
You are asking me if "it is fair" to use this concept? This is a profound question. I think it is, but will save a longer answer for the day you invite me for at least two beers.
The unfairness of Burkhauser's approach is clearly acute at the bottom and middle of income distribution. The most common large asset for those on the bottom rungs is a house. Burkhauser would increase the income of those below the median lucky enough to own a home by the annual appreciation in the value of the home through 2007. For many of these families, however, selling their home is not an option. In Burkhauser's view, their income goes up even if their living conditions remain unchanged.
It is important to note that Burkhauser is respected by his peers; his critics, including some friends, do not accuse him of ideological bias. In addition to A.E.I, he has received support from such center-left institutions as the Pew Foundation, Brookings Institution and the Russell Sage Foundation.
Giving the quality of Burkhauser's work a favorable review, Daron Acemoglu, an economist at M.I.T., responded to my inquiry by email:
Burkhauser is a very serious researcher, and knows the data well. The point they make is a valid one: because of our tax code, people realize capital gains in some years and not others, but this doesn't really mean that income inequality is higher in the years they realize the capital gains. Capital income conceptually corresponds to a wealth/stock measure (I become richer this year even if I don't realize any of my capital gains, but I know that my portfolio's value has doubled).
Acemoglu cautioned, however, that the "problem is that in such things, especially when it is a difficult task based on lots of new data sources, the devil is in the details. It's pretty hard to judge those details without doing a substantial amount of work." Acemoglu's conclusion: "Bottom line: conceptually there is a valid point here, and this is a serious paper. The rest is to be determined."
"Rich Burkhauser's work is really the state of the art - the most important research on inequality being done, in my view," Scott Winship, of the Brookings Institution, e-mailed me. Winship voiced some concern over the reliability of the statistical data used by Burkhauser, but concluded:
All that said, I think Rich's paper is incredibly disruptive for many fields of research in labor economics and other social sciences, and potentially it could change our entire view about rising inequality over the past few decades.
Many others commenting on the Burkhauser paper were less complimentary.
Isabel V. Sawhill, a senior fellow in economic studies at Brookings, wrote:
Really weird. Markets up; housing prices up; but people with a lot of investment in both have falling incomes when include portfolio and housing gains in their incomes over this period? How could this be?
In addition, Sawhill raised a fundamental question about the validity of using accrued but unrealized capital gains: "You can't use accrued gains to pay for basic living costs. They are not income; they are paper gains."
Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, contended in an e-mail that the method of calculating capital gains used by Burkhauser and his co-authors "strikes me as more than a little off-base":
If they want to make a big point of saying that middle and low income people would not have been harmed by inequality over the years 1989-2007 if they could have all sold their homes at peak bubble prices, they are welcome to do so, but that seems more than a bit silly to me. We know what this measure would look like today with the real value of homes down by around 30 percent and homeownership rates in the bottom two quintiles down by around 10-15 percent. Are we supposed to ignore that fact?
Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at Brookings, replied to my inquiries with the most comprehensive commentary:
In calendar 2008 stock prices fell so much that I lost two or three times our household's annual labor income (pre- or post-tax). In 2009 stock and bond prices rose so much I recouped a sizeable share of those losses, probably an amount that was at least 50% larger than our annual labor income. So, in 2008 my (Burkhauser) income put me in the bottom 2 percent or 3 percent; in 2009 it put me in the top 5 percent.
Burtless continued:
The problem with the authors' estimates of accruing capital gains is that those numbers are wholly made up based on a prediction that everyone is equally successful in finding homes, stocks, bonds and other assets to invest in. But they're not: Some people are wildly successful, and get into the 1%; others are horribly unsuccessful and become paupers (or receive foreclosure papers); and most earn mediocre returns that are - surprise! - a bit lower than the economy-wide average.
Burkhauser et al. measure the period from 1989 to 2007 because those are both peak years in the business cycle. This timing results in a failure to account for the consequences of the 2008-9 financial crisis and the subsequent struggle toward recovery accompanied by persistent high levels of unemployment.
On Monday The Wall Street Journal reported that
Nearly 12 million Americans were unemployed in May, down from a peak of more than 15 million, but still more than four million higher than when the recession began in December 2007. Millions more have given up looking for work and no longer count as unemployed. The share of the population that is working or looking for work stands near a three-decade low.
During the post-crisis years 2009-11, according to the Pew Center, the wealthiest seven percent of the nation saw the mean value of their assets grow by 28 percent, to $3.17 million from $2.48 million, while the bottom 93 percent saw their net worth drop by 4 percent, to $133,816 from $139,896.
From September 2008 to October 2012, there were an estimated 3.9 million completed home foreclosures. The median market value of the foreclosed houses was $242,400 - the kind of homes owned by middle income Americans.
In May, the St. Louis Federal Reserve reported that United States households had regained less the half of what they lost in the Great Recession. In 2008 and 2009, a total of $16 trillion in household wealth disappeared, and in the subsequent years, only 45 percent of those losses have been regained. The Washington Post reported in May that "most of the improvement in household wealth [since the 2008 meltdown] was due to gains in the stock market, which primarily benefit wealthy families. That means the recovery for other households has been even weaker."
The families that suffered the most in the meltdown and its aftermath, according to the St Louis Fed report, were the most vulnerable: the less well educated, minorities and the young, many of whom had little in savings but had accumulated high debt levels.
Wealth trends since the 2008 crash, shown in Figure 5, demonstrate an extraordinary growth in inequality, suggesting that Burkhauser's findings - restricted to his carefully tailored definition of income - are fatally flawed as an instrument to assess the current real-world position of the poor and middle class compared with the very rich:
A key purpose in measuring both wealth and income is to determine what kind of standard of living is possible for those at the top, the middle and the bottom. Do individuals, families and households have enough to provide for themselves, perhaps most importantly for their children? Do they have the financial resources to enter the highly competitive global marketplace?
On that score, Burkhauser's use of "yearly accrued capital gains" fails the test of measuring what is most significant to know in policy making and in assessing the true quality of life in America.

HEADLINE: Cost of Public Projects Is Rising, and Pain Will Be Felt for Years

BYLINE: MARY WILLIAMS WALSH


HIGHLIGHT: The recent sell-off in bonds has hit hard in the municipal market, forcing governments to pay higher interest rates for crucial infrastructure projects. 

 BODY:
States and cities across the nation are starting to learn what Wall Street already knows: the days of easy money are coming to an end.
Interest rates have been inching up everywhere, sending America's vast market for municipal bonds, a crucial source of financing for roads, bridges, schools and more, into its steepest decline since the dark days of the financial crisis in 2008.
For one state, Illinois, the higher interest rates will add up to $130 million over the next 25 years - and that is for just one new borrowing. All told, the interest burden of states and localities is likely to grow by many billions, sapping tax dollars that otherwise might have been spent on public services. 
The same concerns about rising rates that have buffeted the world's stock markets recently have also affected the market for municipal bonds. The muni market, despite a modest rally on Wednesday, is headed for one of its worst months in years.
Much as home mortgage rates are making home buying a bit more costly as they rise, so, too, are the rates at which states and cities borrow money. Public officials - and taxpayers - may feel the effects for years. Perversely, the places with the greatest distress are likely to see their borrowing costs rise most.
Over the last few days Georgia, Philadelphia, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York and others have delayed sales of new bonds, citing the precipitous plunge in prices that is driving up interest rates.
Gov. Pat Quinn of Illinois attributed the extra cost to the state's failure to shore up its finances, particularly its rickety pension system. Illinois has the lowest credit rating of any state, and as interest rates rise they tend to rise fastest for the weakest borrowers.
"Borrowing money when you're already in debt doesn't seem like a good idea to me," said Felicia Hill, a 44-year-old Chicago woman who wondered how the state could bear the rising cost. "I think it could have waited, when we have bigger problems in Illinois."
The sell-off in the municipal bond market has followed the general rout in the overall bond market, which was set off when Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, indicated that the strength of the economic recovery might allow the central bank to pull back on its $85 billion-a-month bond-buying program earlier than anticipated.
The Fed was not buying municipal bonds, but the market reacted anyway. Investors expected interest rates to rise, and because prices move in the opposite direction, the values of the municipal bonds they already held dropped.
Investors apparently started selling, not wanting to be the last one out. That caused a flood of bond sales. For the week ended June 19, $3.368 billion flowed out of mutual funds that hold tax-exempt municipal bonds, according to the Investment Company Institute. The outflow for the previous week was $3.236 billion.
Such sell-offs tend to hit the municipal bond market hard because it has many individual investors who buy bonds to hold them, either directly or through mutual funds, rather than financial institutions that trade them quickly.
"The mutual fund's customer has proven to be fickle in these volatile periods, and you get the sticker-shock effect," said Chris Mauro, the head of municipal bond strategy at RBC Capital Markets. The trend starts to feed off itself and can last for a long time, he said. "As they liquidate, there's pressure on the mutual funds to raise cash, which puts more selling pressure onto the market."
Some analysts thought the sell-off was made worse by the actions of Detroit as it flirted with bankruptcy. The city's emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, proposed inflicting severe losses on its bondholders earlier this month as he struggled to keep the city from declaring what would be the largest municipal bankruptcy in history. That prompted investors to sell Detroit bonds, and raised questions about whether Detroit's approach could set an example that other distressed cities would follow.
Some local governments that had planned to issue bonds this week decided to wait and see whether the market improved. But Illinois was among those that could not afford to wait. It had been conserving money by delaying road maintenance and the building of new schools.
Abdon Pallasch, an assistant state budget director, cited in particular the risk of delaying reconstruction of the city's commuter rail system in hopes of obtaining better rates on the bonds, which have a total value of $1.3 billion. He said service had been halted on the Red Line, Chicago's oldest, inconveniencing 80,000 commuters a day.
Mr. Pallasch said that state finance officers had calculated the state's $130 million market penalty by comparing the rate Illinois will pay on these bonds with the rates being paid on similar bonds issued by states with AA ratings. That, he said, was Illinois's credit rating before the state's pension problems boiled up.
Illinois has shortchanged its pension system for many years and has now fallen so far behind that it cannot catch up without diverting money away from other programs. Governor Quinn has tried several times without success to push pension overhauls through the legislature. Moody's Investors Service downgraded the state's credit to A3 in June, soon after one failed legislative effort, and Fitch went to A-, the equivalent in its ranking system.
Although those ratings are the lowest of any state, they are still several notches above junk grade.
Governor Quinn said that the state was paying an average interest rate on the bonds of 5.042 percent. He called on lawmakers to enact pension changes "by July 9, so we can stop the bleeding, prevent future downgrades and jump-start Illinois's economy."
Daniel Berger, senior market strategist for Thomson Reuters Municipal Market Data, said the pension-related downgrades cited by the governor were important factors but not the only ones.
He said that market conditions had driven the interest rate on a typical 10-year municipal bond up by more than one percentage point since the beginning of May. The rate for longer-maturity bonds were more than 1.25 percentage points higher.
"He's ignoring the adverse market conditions," Mr. Berger said.
 Ben Strauss contributed reporting from Chicago. 
An article on Thursday about the effect of rising interest rates on the municipal bond market, using information from an Illinois official, misstated that state's credit rating from Moody's Investors Service. It is A3, not A2.

HEADLINE: Rare Visit Underscores Tangles in Obama's Ties to Africa

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR, NICHOLAS KULISH and LYDIA POLGREEN; Michael D. Shear reported from Dakar; Nicholas Kulish from Nairobi, Kenya; and Lydia Polgreen from New York. Rick Lyman contributed reporting from Johannesburg.

 BODY:
DAKAR, Senegal -- As a freshman senator from Illinois, Barack Obama told a packed auditorium in Kenya's capital, ''I want you all to know that as your ally, your friend and your brother, I will be there in every way I can.''
But he will not be there. President Obama, who Wednesday began his second trip to sub-Saharan Africa since taking office, will skip his father's homeland once again, a reflection of the many challenges that his administration has faced in trying to make a lasting imprint across the continent.
Despite decades of American investment to promote stability in the volatile region of East Africa, Kenya just elected a president indicted by the International Criminal Court, accused of bankrolling death squads driven by ethnic rivalry. It was the outcome that Washington had desperately tried to avoid, and Mr. Obama's advisers determined that a photo op of the American president shaking hands with a man awaiting trial was not one they needed.
''It just wasn't the best time for the president to travel to Kenya at this point,'' said Benjamin J. Rhodes, Mr. Obama's deputy national security adviser. 
For Africans across the continent, the election of an African-American president signaled a transformative moment in their relationship with the United States, one that would usher in a special understanding of their hopes and needs.
But Mr. Obama's own aspirations for changing Africa have been strained by security threats that have been mounting across vast stretches of its territory, by the spotty human rights records of nations that the United States has worked with to contain them -- and by the president's notable absences from the continent where his father was born.
His two immediate predecessors in the White House made big gambles and left large legacies on the continent, but Mr. Obama has struggled to gain much traction on his stated aims in Africa: consolidating democracy, protecting women's rights and reducing hunger. Some wonder whether this trip may be his best opportunity.
''This is the last chance for the administration to salvage an Africa legacy,'' said Todd Moss, a senior fellow of the Center for Global Development, a research group in Washington. ''But it is very late in the day.''
Mr. Obama's only previous visit to sub-Saharan Africa as president was a brief stop in Ghana in 2009, despite the heightened economic and strategic stakes at play on the continent, home to some of the world's fastest-growing economies and some of its most vexing security problems.
China's top leaders, by contrast, have busily traveled to dozens of African countries in recent years, investing billions of dollars in natural resources, building infrastructure on a vast scale and giving rise to criticism that the United States is ceding a rising region.
Mr. Obama's aides acknowledged the breadth of activity by China and other nations, but they said the president's trip would deliver a message that the United States intended to ''be present'' in matters concerning Africa.
''We can send a signal of increased U.S. engagement through this trip,'' said Mr. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser.
As the president flew to Senegal on Wednesday to begin a tour that will also take him to South Africa and Tanzania, the White House press secretary, Jay Carney, said the administration's approach to Africa was similar to the one it had taken toward Asia, where Mr. Obama has insisted on greater attention and investment.
The Obama administration has spent billions of dollars on aid to Africa every year, building on a rapid expansion under President George W. Bush. And while Mr. Obama's achievements in Africa may not always be flashy, they are not inconsiderable, said J. Stephen Morrison, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
''There has been no big vision, big-ticket stuff, but there is plenty of senior-level, grind-it-out diplomacy,'' Mr. Morrison said, adding that Mr. Obama has made Mr. Bush's AIDS and malaria initiatives much more efficient and effective. He also cited the administration's vital role in improving Somalia, a country whose troubles have bedeviled several American presidents.
For many, Mr. Obama's presence has been more evident on the battlefield. He pushed for the NATO military campaign that helped topple Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya, launched deadly strikes against extremists in Somalia, spent hundreds of millions of dollars to train African armies to fight Islamist militancy across the Sahara and set up a drone base in Niger -- all while continuing to support less-than-democratic allies like Ethiopia and Uganda.
Angry over the administration's antiterrorism policies, a ''NO-bama'' coalition of lawyers, students and trade unions in South Africa is promising a National Day of Action on Friday, the day the president is expected to arrive there. Student groups say they will protest when Mr. Obama is scheduled to receive an honorary degree. The South African Muslim Lawyers Association delivered a 600-page brief to the South African government that it called the ''Obama Docket,'' demanding that the president be arrested for war crimes when he lands in the country.
Mr. Obama, the first American president with personal roots in this continent, remains immensely popular in Africa, and any visit from him has deep symbolism and historic meaning. But because his trips emphasize the loftier side of his ambitions for the continent -- focusing on ideals, not the complex realities that often undermine them -- his itinerary options are somewhat limited.
Beyond the political tension with Kenya, many other African nations are essentially off limits. Safety issues, deeply flawed elections, human rights violations and logistical roadblocks often make visits impossible, unworkable or undesirable.
Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa and an important strategic partner for the United States. But many Nigerian officials and human rights groups have accused the nation's army of summary executions and other abuses in its battle with Boko Haram, a militant group that has been waging a war against the government.
Ethiopia has been a close ally in combating Islamist militants in the volatile Horn of Africa and is a major recipient of United States aid. But its government is considered one of Africa's most repressive, ruling out it, too, as a presidential stop.
''Senegal, Tanzania and South Africa, those are good, solid, safe choices,'' Mr. Morrison said. ''They don't have the edge you might get if you'd chosen a few other alternatives.''
For Tanzania, Mr. Obama's arrival means the chance to play host to arguably the two most powerful people on the planet in just over three months. In March, Xi Jinping visited the nation's largest city, Dar es Salaam, on his first tour abroad as China's new president, promising aid, scholarships and the transfer of new technology. Mr. Obama will also find himself following in Mr. Xi's recent footsteps in South Africa.
But for those in countries that are not a destination, Mr. Obama's weeklong trip will be a reminder of how much of the continent he has missed.
''We expected him to come,'' said Paul Okindu, 40, one of five men working at Obama Shoe Shine in Nairobi, Kenya. ''We are so disheartened that he decided not to.''
The local media in Kenya have been referring to the decision to skip Kenya as a ''snub'' of President Uhuru Kenyatta, whose office announced that he would travel to Russia, China and Japan while Mr. Obama was in Africa.
''There are some who are very disappointed that he is trying to embarrass his motherland and show them they are not that important,'' said Gerishon Ikiara, a senior lecturer at the Institute of Diplomacy and International Studies at the University of Nairobi. ''The message is quite clear that he is not happy with Kenya.''
Caroline Odengo, 34, a teacher in the Nairobi slum of Kibera, said the challenges that Kenya faced were all the more reason for Mr. Obama to visit. ''We're waiting for his voice,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Against All Odds, a State Senator Fights to Lead New Jersey

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
UNION, N.J. -- It didn't take long for someone to say outright what others were thinking.
As State Senator Barbara Buono offered a handshake at a table at the Mark Twain Diner here, a man returned her smile, then asked, ''What are you running for?''
''I'm running for governor, against Chris Christie,'' Ms. Buono replied.
''It'll never happen!'' the man declared. He turned back to his omelet. 
Ms. Buono laughed gamely and grasped his shoulder: ''You've got to have faith!''
As she campaigns across the state, it can seem like faith is the only thing on Barbara Buono's side.
Mr. Christie -- ''The Governor,'' as his first television spot proclaimed him, with a firmness suggesting that even people in Peoria might identify him as such -- has raised triple the money she has. Polls consistently show him beating her by 30 points. He is a regular on national television, eating doughnuts on David Letterman's couch and helping to host the ''Today'' show. People magazine writes about his date nights. President Obama wanted to hang out with him. So did Prince Harry.
While -- and sometimes because -- Mr. Christie has a knack for turning potentially bad circumstances to his advantage, Ms. Buono's fate is such that even potentially good developments have worked to her disadvantage.
When Senator Frank R. Lautenberg died this month, it opened up the possibility that Ms. Buono would run on the Democratic ticket with Cory Booker, the well-known mayor of Newark who is running for Mr. Lautenberg's seat. But Mr. Christie, sensing this might work to Ms. Buono's advantage, decided to put the Senate seat on a special-election ballot three weeks before his contest with Ms. Buono. That not only denied her Mr. Booker's coattails, it ensured that more money and attention would go to the Senate race, and created the possibility of voter fatigue -- or confusion -- in November.
Still, Ms. Buono, who stepped up to run when Mr. Booker and many better-known Democrats declared the challenge too daunting, seems determined to play it plucky.
She insists that her life has been about succeeding against long odds. She grew up poor and lost her father when she was 19; she worked her way through college and law school and went on food stamps when a fire forced her from her apartment. When county bosses tried to block her from running for her first legislative seat, she ran anyway and won. When state party leaders denied her a spot at the Democratic National Convention last summer, she borrowed a floor pass from a friend in another state to get in.
Mr. Christie, a Republican, is not without vulnerabilities: property taxes have increased more than 18 percent under him, the state's unemployment rate remains well above the national average, and ratings agencies have declared his budgets unsound. Editorial pages have hammered his decision to spend $24 million on the special election three weeks before Election Day; a recent Rutgers poll showed just 12 percent of voters agreed with it. With 700,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans, this is -- theoretically -- a blue state.
And as Ms. Buono noted repeatedly, the governor himself won in 2009, despite being hugely outspent.
But Mr. Christie was running against a Democratic incumbent whom many Democrats loathed. Ms. Buono is running against a Republican whom polls show many Democrats like. That includes several Democratic Party leaders who have endorsed the governor. Meanwhile, last month, former Gov. Brendan T. Byrne, at 89 a beloved figure in the Democratic Party here, suggested Ms. Buono quit. ''Barbara is a nice lady, and I love her,'' he said. ''But this is not the year for her.''
Ms. Buono tried to brush it aside. ''I've been underestimated my whole career,'' she said.
The race is a contest of contrasts.
Mr. Christie, 50, has long struggled with obesity, and opted for lap-band surgery after concluding that exercise and diet regimes were not working. Ms. Buono, who will turn 60 next month, is a trim evangelist for the clarifying power of a daily five-mile run.
Where he is voluble and brash, she measures her words. He has an unusual gift before audiences, fluidly using folksy stories about his parents to explain his political philosophy. She is warm but private; colleagues who have worked closely with her struggled to name her friends and said they had never heard the life story she now tells on the trail.
But like Mr. Christie, Ms. Buono warms to a fight.
Last month, she collected her first endorsement from a Republican mayor, in the working-class town of Spotswood. The governor already has several Democratic mayors endorsing him. When a reporter asked the mayor whether he had heard any displeasure from the governor's office, Ms. Buono jumped to the microphone with a big smile to reply: ''Not yet!''
She was born in Newark, the youngest of three daughters to a teacher and a supermarket butcher who had immigrated from Italy. The family soon moved to the second floor of a house in Nutley, a middle-class suburb just west of New York City.
Ms. Buono's parents slept on a pullout couch in the living room so she and her sisters could have the bedroom. After her father died of a heart attack when she was 19, she moved in with her oldest sister, and later to Newark, where an apartment fire prompted her to make an appointment with a welfare office that she was too humiliated to keep, she recalled. She moved in with her grandmother instead. She went on food stamps briefly, and now says she went to law school figuring it was a reliable way to stave off poverty.
She scoffs when people say she has guts to run against Mr. Christie.
''This doesn't take courage,'' she said. ''What takes courage is being without a job, being without a place to live, having your very existence in jeopardy.''
She worked for a time in the public defender's office, then started a law firm with her husband, where she worked on and off while raising four children in Metuchen, a town of good schools and comfortable homes in Central New Jersey. (The couple divorced in 1997. She married Martin Gizzi, a neurologist with two children from a previous marriage, in 2002.)
Someone at a Mommy and Me class asked her to serve on the town cultural arts commission, then the town council president suggested she run for a seat on the council. She lost her first run, but ran again and won in 1992.
When an Assembly seat came open in 1994, the county political boss pushed another candidate. Ms. Buono bought a street map and plotted out where the county Democratic committee members lived, then visited each to appeal for their vote in person. They nominated her.
She was elected to the State Senate in 2001 and became first woman to lead the budget committee, and later the first woman to serve as majority leader.
But even from those perches she tussled with party leaders, holding up the budget of Gov. Jon S. Corzine, a fellow Democrat, because it did not require state workers to contribute more toward their pensions. In 2011, her party pushed her out of the leadership after she voted against a bill that did require increased contributions to pensions, but also required state workers to pay more in health benefits. She argued that the changes in health benefits should be negotiated in collective bargaining.
Her supporters call it a principled stand. ''I love the idea that our nominee actually believes in things,'' said Assemblyman Joseph Cryan, another former majority leader who paid a price for bucking his party. ''I always thought the Democratic Party was supposed to be about helping the other guy. We have forgotten that. She's lived it.''
But other Democrats say it was evidence of her failure to forge relationships in a business built on them.
Ms. Buono is counting, again, on a run from the outside. As Mr. Christie's popularity soared after Hurricane Sandy, one prominent Democrat after another concluded that it would be too expensive and too embarrassing a challenge. The list included not only the celebrated mayor of Newark, but the State Senate president, a former governor, a congressman and the head of the state Democratic Party. Ms. Buono, meanwhile, had already declared her candidacy and begun chipping away at endorsements.
In January, George E. Norcross III, a Democratic political boss whose blessing is considered essential, urged his party to rally around her candidacy ''in the absence of anyone else.''
Even though the big names still get more attention -- as she is reminded in every joint appearance with Mr. Booker -- she has continued to work to bolster her poll numbers and name recognition.
At the diner in Union, Dave Castner and Ray Edwards, two sheet-metal workers, seemed happy to hear someone was running against Mr. Christie, arguing his policies favored the wealthy over the working class -- the case Ms. Buono is trying to make.
''He comes off as Everyman, he's got the nice Jersey attitude, but you see what he's doing, it's not helping us,'' Mr. Castner, 43, said after shaking Ms. Buono's hand. ''I was lucky enough to have my wife stay home and raise my kids. You don't see that much anymore.''
Later that day, Ms. Buono arrived at a diner in Edison for an interview fresh from taping a local television show. As she was leaving the station, William J. Palatucci, one of Mr. Christie's chief political advisers, was arriving.
''This is how he shook my hand,'' she said, demonstrating a handshake that was more of a hand slip.
''He shook my hand normally,'' her press aide said.
''Really?'' Ms. Buono said, sounding more excited than offended. She laughed. ''Maybe he thought he would break me.''

HEADLINE: Green Light On Suit

BYLINE: By WILLIAM ALDEN

 BODY:
The former chief executive of the American International Group, Maurice R. Greenberg, can pursue a lawsuit against the United States government over the financial crisis bailout of the insurer, though in narrower form, a judge ruled on Wednesday. 
Mr. Greenberg can continue with claims that shareholders of A.I.G. lost tens of billions of dollars when the government attached onerous terms to the $182 billion rescue, Judge Thomas C. Wheeler of the United States Court of Federal Claims ruled on Wednesday.
But the judge threw out so-called derivative claims in which Mr. Greenberg sought to fight on behalf of his former company. In his ruling, Judge Wheeler said the board of A.I.G. had acted in good faith when it decided not to join the lawsuit earlier this year.
Mr. Greenberg, through his investment vehicle Starr International, has ''failed to allege particularized facts that create a reasonable doubt as to the good faith or reasonableness of the board's investigation of Starr's demand,'' the judge ruled, granting motions by A.I.G. and the government to dismiss the derivative claims.
At the same time, the decision leaves intact Mr. Greenberg's direct claims against the government on behalf of himself and other shareholders, denying a motion by the government to dismiss those claims.
''We are pleased that the Court of Federal Claims has denied the motion of the United States and permitted Starr International to pursue the claims of two classes of A.I.G. shareholders for tens of billions of dollars that the government took without just compensation and/or illegally exacted in 2008 and 2009,'' David Boies, the prominent trial lawyer representing Mr. Greenberg, said in a statement. ''We look forward to continuing discovery in this action and getting ready for trial in the fall of 2014.''
Wednesday's decision allows A.I.G. to distance itself from the lawsuit, which set off a storm of controversy when The New York Times reported in January that the board of the insurer was weighing whether to join it. Several lawmakers expressed alarm that A.I.G. might sue its savior.
After choosing not to join with its former chief, A.I.G. in April sought to bar Mr. Greenberg from suing on its behalf. The insurer said at that time that its directors ''had every right to decide, in the exercise of their business judgment, that suing the government for its rescue of A.I.G. is not the right thing for A.I.G. to do.''
The essence of Mr. Greenberg's claims against the government is that the A.I.G. bailout shortchanged investors and violated their Fifth Amendment rights. The Treasury Department has said that the claims ''have no merit whatsoever, and we will continue to defend the case vigorously.''

HEADLINE: Struggling to Measure An Economic Impact

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
An overhaul of immigration law would reduce the federal deficit. That's the conclusion of a broad range of studies, from the libertarian Cato Institute to the conservative American Action Forum to the liberal Center for American Progress. Wait, it would really increase the deficit. That's the analysis of the Heritage Foundation and the Center for Immigration Studies. But hang on a second. Immigrants have little impact on the federal deficit. That's what the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development thinks.
Needless to say, the impact of immigration on the budget is a complicated question, and a subject of lively debate. In no small part, that is because economists disagree on what to measure. The effect of pending legislation, or of current immigration? All immigrants or just undocumented immigrants? By household or by individual? In one fiscal year or over a lifetime? Different metrics produce different results. 
That said, economists broadly agree that immigration is great for the earnings and productivity of the immigrants themselves, and that it often has a net benefit for the whole economy, even if there are winners and losers. (That's called the ''immigration surplus.'')
The immigration legislation currently under consideration would likely have a positive fiscal impact, reducing the deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars. According to a recent report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the Senate bill would slash the deficit by $200 billion over the next 10 years and $700 billion for the decade after that. (As a share of the overall economy, which is likely to exceed $400 trillion in the next 20 years, that is fairly trivial.) The deficit reduction would come from both increasing spending and increasing revenue. Over the course of a decade, the government would pay out an additional $262 billion on programs like Medicaid, but it would see its revenues go up by $459 billion, too.
It is worth noting that legislation bars certain immigrants, such as undocumented workers who would win provisional status, from receiving a broad swath of government benefits for years. That helps keep the bill's costs down. It's also worth noting that the C.B.O. thinks the broad economic impact would be significant, increasing the size of the labor force, raising average wages in the long term, bolstering capital investment and increasing productivity. Ultimately, the bill would increase real economic output by 3.3 percent in 2023 and 5.4 percent in 2033, the C.B.O. thinks.
Among the others who have examined the issue, the O.E.C.D. study looked at the impact of immigration on the fiscal situation across a range of wealthy nations over a decade, and found it to be negligible. But it did say that conditions in the United States, such as a younger immigrant base and more limited public benefit programs than European countries, made it more likely to experience a net fiscal gain from immigration.
The Heritage Foundation analysis, in contrast, contends that newly legal immigrants can be expected to benefit from a wide variety of public services (not all attributable to the federal budget) that will far outstrip the immigrants' tax payments. Though it says that in an interim period, ''tax payments would increase more than government benefits,'' the conservative research group predicts that the ultimate availability of means-tested welfare and medical benefits to immigrants who currently lack legal status would incur a net fiscal cost of $106 billion a year, along with a net burden of $160 billion a year in Social Security and Medicare costs when the immigrants retire.
In terms of state and local budgets, there is no good estimate of the impact of an immigration overhaul. In its recent report, the C.B.O. noted that the ''influx of new immigrants would cause state and local governments to experience both greater demand for services and an increase in revenues, potentially affecting their budget balances.'' But it said it had not analyzed the full effects. Prior local or regional studies of immigration, or of changes to immigration law, have found both positive and negative fiscal impacts, again largely depending on what and how economists chose to measure.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Legal Blow to Sustainable Development

BYLINE: By JOHN D. ECHEVERRIA. 
John D. Echeverria is a professor at Vermont Law School.

 BODY:
STRAFFORD, Vt. -- LOST amid the Supreme Court's high-profile decisions on affirmative action, voting rights and same-sex marriage was another ruling that may turn out to have a profound impact on American society. The court handed down a decision on Tuesday that, in the words of Justice Elena Kagan, will ''work a revolution in land-use law.''
While that may sound obscure, the decision in Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Management District will result in long-lasting harm to America's communities. That's because the ruling creates a perverse incentive for municipal governments to reject applications from developers rather than attempt to negotiate project designs that might advance both public and private goals -- and it makes it hard for communities to get property owners to pay to mitigate any environmental damage they may cause. 
The court's 5-to-4 decision, with Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. writing for the majority, arose from an order issued by a Florida water management district denying an application by Coy A. Koontz Sr. to fill more than three acres of wetlands in order to build a small shopping center. The district made clear that it was willing to grant the permit if Mr. Koontz agreed to reduce the size of the development or spend money on any of a variety of wetlands-restoration projects designed to offset the project's environmental effects. Because Mr. Koontz declined to pursue any of these options, the district denied the permit.
Mr. Koontz, who is now deceased, went to court and claimed that the permit denial constituted a ''taking'' under two Supreme Court precedents, Nollan v. California Coastal Commission and Dolan v. City of Tigard. These cases established that when the government approved a development subject to certain conditions, like a requirement that a developer dedicate an easement to the public, the conditions would be deemed an appropriation of private property unless the government could show a logical relationship and a ''rough proportionality'' between the conditions imposed and the projected effects of the development.
The Florida Supreme Court rejected Mr. Koontz's takings argument on two grounds. First, it interpreted Nollan and Dolan as being limited to cases in which the government has issued a permit subject to a condition -- not in those in which a permit has been denied. Second, it ruled that Nollan and Dolan applied only when the government's condition took an interest in some tangible property (like demanding an easement, for example), not when a government imposed a generalized requirement on someone to spend money.
In what can fairly be described as a blockbuster decision, the Supreme Court has reversed the Florida court on both points.
Leaving the majority's legal reasoning aside, the Supreme Court's ruling is likely to do some serious real-world damage. As Justice Kagan correctly explains in her dissent, the decision will very likely encourage local government officials to avoid any discussion with developers related to permit conditions that, in the end, might have let both sides find common ground on building projects that are good for the community and environmentally sound. Rather than risk a lawsuit through an attempt at compromise, many municipalities will simply reject development applications outright -- or, worse, accept development plans they shouldn't.
''Nothing in the Takings Clause requires that folly,'' Justice Kagan said. But arguably it does now.
As for the second part of the majority's ruling, that Nollan and Dolan apply to permit conditions requiring the general expenditure of money, that will also have unfortunate consequences. Cities and towns across America routinely attach fees and other payment obligations to permits, for example, to support wetlands mitigation banks, to finance roads, to pay for new schools or to build affordable housing.
While, to be sure, such mandates must be reasonable under the Constitution, the revolutionary and destructive step taken by the court in Koontz is to cast the burden on the government to justify the mandates according to the heightened Nollan-Dolan standard. This is contrary to the traditional court approach of according deference to elected officials and technical experts on issues of regulatory policy. Moreover, this heightened standard will result in a huge number of costly legal challenges to local regulations.
Consider the challenges of waste disposal. Many communities impose development-impact fees on developers if a proposed project would require expanding waste-disposal sites or building new ones. Before Koontz, a developer could raise a constitutional challenge if the charges were unreasonable, but judges typically deferred to local governments in such cases.
After Koontz, developers have a potent new legal tool to challenge such charges because now the legal burden of demonstrating their validity is on the communities themselves.
In the wake of this under-the-radar ruling, the cost of protecting a community from a harmful building project now lies not with the developer but with the local residents and taxpayers. It's hard to fathom that the framers of the Constitution would call this either fairness or justice.

HEADLINE: G.D.P. Estimate Lowered To 1.8% for First Quarter

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The government on Wednesday cut its estimate for first-quarter economic growth, offering a cautionary note on the recovery as the Federal Reserve ponders curtailing its monetary stimulus. 
Gross domestic product expanded at an annual rate of 1.8 percent in the quarter, the Commerce Department said. The economy was previously reported to have grown at a pace of 2.4 percent after a gain of just 0.4 percent in the final three months of last year.
Almost all categories were revised lower, with the exception of home construction and government. Many economists had expected G.D.P. growth would be unrevised.
The biggest surprise was the pace of consumer spending, which grew at 2.6 percent, not the 3.4 percent rate previously estimated. The revision to consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity in America, sliced more than a half percentage point off the G.D.P. growth rate.
Economists cautioned against reading too much into the data given its backward-looking nature, but said it could weigh on the Fed as it considered scaling back its bond buying.
''At the margin, it tilts them a little bit less strongly toward the tapering they were talking about a week ago,'' said Sam Coffin, an economist at UBS in New York.
The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said last week that the central bank could trim later this year the $85 billion in bonds it is buying each month and would most likely bring the program to a close by mid-2014.
Those comments led to a sharp sell-off in stock markets and drove the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note to a nearly two-year high.
But a range of strong economic data on Tuesday -- from business spending plans to home prices -- bolstered investor sentiment.
After closing higher on Tuesday, stocks resumed their ascent on Wednesday. Bonds were also up on the day, with yields falling.
The G.D.P. report showed that home building grew at a rate of 14 percent in the first quarter, but a jump in mortgage rates on the back of Mr. Bernanke's remarks threatens to cool the sector.
Even given the revision, consumer spending picked up from the fourth quarter despite a rise in taxes, and recent gains in consumer sentiment suggest households are not pulling back.
Growth was also weighed down by weak exports, which contracted at a pace of 1.1 percent in the first quarter, probably in a reflection of a global economic slowdown. They had previously been reported to have expanded.

HEADLINE: Brussels Official, Criticizing France, Turns Up Heat on a Tense Relationship

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

 BODY:
PARIS -- The French budget deficit is rising. President Franois Hollande is at historical lows in the polls. His divided Socialist Party placed third behind the far-right National Front in a parliamentary by-election. And if government ministers are to be believed, all these difficulties are caused by Brussels -- the European Commission and its president, Jos Manuel Barroso.
To some degree, the squabbling reflects the current economic and political strains in France. But it also highlights the longstanding tensions between national governments and the European Union bureaucracy, which has taken on an especially powerful role since the Continent's financial crisis upended politics and economies. That tension is stoking ideological passions on the left and the right across Europe, with potentially critical implications, at a time when popular skepticism about the European experiment is running high.
In this case, the problem began with an interview that Mr. Barroso, a center-right former Portuguese prime minister, gave to The New York Times just before the Group of 8 summit meeting in Northern Ireland. The issue was whether France would block the beginning of talks on a free-trade agreement between the United States and the European Union over its ''cultural exception'' -- its effort to promote domestic film, television and audiovisual productions through subsidies and quotas. 
Mr. Barroso called the French vow to block the talks ill-judged and French criticism of globalization ''reactionary,'' harming the goal of cultural diversity rather than protecting it. He said the perceived threat from the United States was overblown by those who ''have an anti-global agenda'' and added, ''It's part of this anti-globalization agenda that I consider completely reactionary.'' He said Europe could not be sealed off. ''Some say they belong to the left, but in fact they are culturally extremely reactionary.''
Mr. Barroso, himself a former young Maoist, is unlikely to get a third term as commission president next year, and his criticism of the French left was neither original nor especially harsh.
But his comments about France created an immediate and loud reaction in France, with criticism from Mr. Hollande and his culture minister, Aurlie Filippetti, as well as the far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen and the leftist minister Arnaud Montebourg. Less than a year before European parliamentary elections, which are expected to reflect deep anti-Brussels sentiment in many nations, Mr. Barroso has become a symbol for the kind of Brussels bashing that is feeding both far-right and far-left political tension in France and elsewhere in Europe.
The Socialist Party was eliminated from a runoff by the National Front in a by-election in southwest France, and after the seat was narrowly won on Sunday night by the center-right Union for a Popular Movement, Mr. Montebourg said: ''Mr. Barroso is the fuel of the French National Front, that's the truth. He is the fuel of Beppe Grillo,'' referring to the leader of the populist Five Star Movement in Italy, which won a quarter of the vote of the lower house of Parliament in February's election.
Mr. Montebourg, who himself ran for the presidency on a platform of ''deglobalization'' and is the minister for industrial renewal, said: ''The European Union is paralyzed. It does not respond to any of the people's aspirations in the industrial, economic or budgetary fields and in the end it provides a cause to all the anti-European parties.''
Ms. Le Pen, exulting in her far-right party's strong showing, herself called Mr. Barroso ''a catastrophe for our country and our continent'' and a symptom of ''a European system gone mad.''
In an editorial, Le Monde said, ''Mr. Barroso, you are neither loyal nor respectful.'' Le Point said Europe did not need friends like Mr. Barroso, while the business newspaper Les chos complained about ''the Europe of invective'' doing nothing to advance the debate.
Mr. Barroso said at first through a spokesman that he was not criticizing the French government, but those in France who have those views. Of course, a number of them are indeed in the government, which helps explain the reaction.
Then he waded back into the fray. At a news conference on Monday, he said, ''It would be good if some politicians understood that they will not get very far by attacking Europe and trying to turn it into a scapegoat for their problems.'' He then added, ''Some left-wing nationalists have exactly the same views as the far right.''
In a statement, the European Commission said French politicians should defend Europe ''against nationalism, populism and jingoism'' instead of ''attacking globalization.''
The Frenchman who is European commissioner for the internal market, Michael Barnier, a former center-right agricultural minister, told France 2 television that Mr. Montebourg's ''absurd'' remarks were the latest attempt by France under the Socialists to ''shirk its responsibilities.''
But the Socialists ''won't be shirking for very much longer because the moment of truth will arrive at some point; it's arriving for the minister,'' said Mr. Barnier, citing Germany's better economy ''under the same commission.''
Mr. Barnier said, ''I've had enough of hearing ministers in my country, politicians from left and right, saying that it is all somebody else's fault.''
Mr. Barnier's statements struck some as odd, given that he was fiercely protectionist as Nicolas Sarkozy's agriculture minister, defending restrictions on genetically modified food and a ban on American chicken because it was bathed in chlorine to kill bacteria.
The Paris-Brussels spat continues and has moved beyond the cultural exception, of course, reflecting the difficulties of a Socialist government that finds itself caught in a triple-dip recession, with record unemployment and rising budget deficits, despite getting two years' grace from the same European Commission to meet budget deficit targets. And Mr. Hollande now faces the delicate task of overhauling his nation's pension system without sparking national strikes and worker unrest.
France's Socialist Party has always been ambivalent about Europe, having split badly in 2005 over a referendum on a European constitution, which failed. Mr. Hollande favored the constitution, while the current foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, was a leader of the opposition. Mr. Hollande has recently said he supports a closer political union of the nations that use the euro, including a permanent president -- considered a shift in traditional French views.
But the more left-wing element of his party and government are deeply reluctant to give any more power to Brussels, especially over the economy and the labor market.
Pascal Lamy, a Socialist who heads the World Trade Organization and is considered a dark-horse candidate for prime minister, on Tuesday criticized both Mr. Barroso and Mr. Montebourg for ''exaggerated'' and ''simplistic'' views. But he saved his real fire for Mr. Montebourg.
''I think the thesis of deglobalization is a reactionary thesis, like all those theses that call for a return to the past,'' Mr. Lamy told Europe 1 radio. ''What matters is not the past but the future.''

HEADLINE: The Price? You'll Need To Lie Down

BYLINE: By STEVEN KURUTZ

 BODY:
The luxury-goods market is in a constant arms race with itself. New products must be more extravagantly produced and priced than the already extravagant goods that were sold before, and global recession be damned. Case in point: the Royal Bed from Savoir, priced at an absurd $175,000. 
Savoir, a British company founded in 1905 to make beds for the Savoy Hotel in London, already sells a line of five-figure beds. The No. 1, as their top model is called, has a ''topper'' pad stuffed with Latin American horse tail and Mongolian cashmere and costs about $80,000.
The Royal Bed boasts these materials in both topper and mattress, as well as enough woven silk to be strung from New York to Miami and almost halfway back. More important, it has a marketing story: only 60 Royal Beds are being made in honor of the 60th anniversary of the Queen's coronation, and threading on the backboard crest was done by the Royal School of Needlework, which had a hand in Kate Middleton's wedding dress. The bed made its debut at Kensington Palace, as part of an exhibition on the bedchamber of the 17th and 18th century royal court.
The Royal Bed rolled into New York this week and was accepting visitors in a stark gallery-like room at the Swiss Institute in SoHo. Gold silk fabric and a draped canopy seemed out of touch with today's cleaner design, but Alistair Hughes, Savoir's managing director, said, perhaps rightly, ''I think this would look fabulous in a brutalist apartment.''
Did it look like a $175,000 bed?
Yes. But it also looked ersatz, like something a Hollywood set designer could whip up with chintz fabric and glue.
Did it feel like a $175,000 bed?
It's hard to say. The mattress was certainly plushy. But after a certain point, you achieve maximum comfort, no matter if the horse tail comes from Latin America or Eastern Ohio. Beyond that, it's just luxury for luxury's sake.

HEADLINE: Summer Discontents -- and More to Come?

BYLINE: By PAUL KENNEDY

 BODY:
As I write, on a sunny Saturday morn shortly before Midsummer's Day, the profusion of colors and scents from dozens of roses and other plants in my garden arouse my senses, the birds fill the air with song and a butterfly flits from bloom to bloom. The long, lazy summer is upon us. Did not the English poet Robert Browning capture this serenity with his words, ''God's in His Heaven; all's right with the world''?
But the problem with this serene portrait is precisely that all is not right with the world. Indeed, large parts of our planet seem as troubled as could be, and others appear close to disaster. 
In sharp contrast to those bucolic scenes outside my windows, there also lie within the house my usual reading menu: newspapers, magazines and reports from think tanks and strategic-studies institutes. All this constitutes a heavy brunch indeed, and not just because of the sheer amount of reading material, but also -- and especially -- because of the gravity of the contents.
Which of these stories will still be headline news in a few years' time? Which will be entering the history books? Brazilian upheavals that, if imitated, could alter the economic priorities of the entire Latin American region? The political struggle for Turkey's mind and soul -- and Egypt's? The end of Pakistan as a viable, functioning state? Growing authoritarianism in Moscow, and defensive xenophobia in Beijing? The further fraying of the European project, and the turn to populist, chauvinistic movements? And, watching all this, an increasingly dysfunctional American government, with a public too deeply concerned about their own problems to pay much attention (apart from brief responses to human disasters) to the world abroad?
Is it any surprise that managers at the World Bank, I.M.F. and U.N. secretary general's office are privately very scared, whatever their public statements may say? What might be their most profound worry? My guess is that it could be the following: While all of these discontents definitely have their own local causes, perhaps something bigger is at work that makes our troubles more common in nature.
Inside so many nations, citizens sense that the pace of economic change -- always inequitable in its distribution of benefits -- has become much more uneven. And as the gap between haves and have-nots widens everywhere, dissatisfaction grows, political parties splinter, and secessionist groups raise their heads.
It does not matter that a country's G.D.P. is growing nicely if there is serious maldistribution of the benefits -- witness the unrest across Brazil. Even the mere perception of an unjust economic order and a corrupt elite may be enough to fan the flames.
In many places, youth unemployment and street agitation can easily intertwine with longstanding ethnic and religious prejudices. Across the Middle East in particular, as religious and secularist parties tussle, the thin crust of civilization is cracking badly.
This, of course, is not the first time that widespread discontent against the ''unfair'' economic and political order has arisen. The 1960s witnessed such worldwide unrest, often with more radical agendas for change and calls for revolution. And in October 1930, The Economist was wringing its hands at the extent to which ''our economics and our politics are perpetually falling out of gear with one another'' thus producing ''a series of jolts and jars and smashes in the social life of humanity.''
Perhaps the only difference nowadays is that the pace of disruptive technological and economic change is much faster, and that the size of populations affected is so much greater. The ballyhoo about the increasing number of billionaires needs to be set alongside the vast increases in the numbers of the economically desperate and displaced.
If this gloomy thinking is more or less true, then the recent U.N. report ''World Population Prospects'' should give us all cause for thought. Its new forecast for total world population by 2050 raises previous estimates by 300 million people, which reflects ''increasing fertility rates in populous countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa,'' according to The Economist.
Conceding that long-term forecasts are tricky, the report points to world population growing from 7.2 billion today to 9.6 billion by 2050. Of the ''advanced'' economies, only the United States, because of its higher fertility and immigration rates, will remain among the 10 most populous countries. Traditional powers Russia, Japan, Germany and Britain will all have been relegated to the second or third decentiles, relatively prosperous perhaps but in the demographic dustbin of history. Other, chiefly Asian and African nations will be bursting at the seams, their megacities co-existing with great rural poverty.
Some political structures will appear absurd: Russia, Britain and France, three of the current, permanent, veto-bearing members of the U.N. Security Council, will have a combined population less than that of Indonesia.
Yet all such absurdities pale beside the really important implication of the World Population Prospects report -- that the vast majority of these additional members to the human race will be born into a grinding, resentful poverty that is supposed to exist cheek-by-jowl with the luxurious new hotel resorts, Himalayan ''base camps'' and exclusive yacht facilities being constructed all over ''exotic'' spots in Asia, Africa and Latin America.
We cannot in good conscience -- actually, whatever our conscience is -- exist in a world in which the rich forever get richer, and billions of poor people languish, assuming that they will not protest their fate. Already, as the old farmer's saying goes, the worms are turning. What will the world look like should 4 billion people ever turn against the current systems? Now is the time to think about such matters. Even among the bird song.

HEADLINE: The Bane of Palestinian Infighting

BYLINE: By KIMBERLY MARTEN

 BODY:
The resignation of two Palestinian prime ministers in quick succession has left the Palestinian Authority leadership in limbo even as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry seeks to accelerate negotiations toward a two-state settlement.
But naming a new prime minister will accomplish little in furthering a settlement unless the Palestinians can also overcome the patronage, corruption and infighting in their security forces. This would require a change not only in the way the Palestinian Authority operates, but also in the approach of Israel, the United States and others involved.
Building a Palestinian state requires real reform of the Palestinian defense, intelligence and police forces. International confidence and investment will only come once violence is controlled and law-based rule is accepted. 
Despite massive international assistance, including over $500 million from the U.S. State Department in recent years, reform of the West Bank security forces has frayed. No prime minister can pull it back together alone.
As the Palestinian Authority prime minister from 2007 until he stepped down earlier this month, Salam Fayyad was hailed as the leader of a technocratic revolution in the West Bank, and he made security-sector reform a priority. Fayyad strove to replace the corrupt and intimidating militias of the Arafat era with professional security forces who earned the respect of the population. His efforts won broad international support.
The hope was that Israel would find a reliable security partner in this rebooted version of the Palestinian Authority, smoothing the way to a two-state solution. Indeed the security situation for Israel improved markedly. The P.A. kept its end of the bargain, working with the Israel Defense Forces to contain radical Hamas activity in the West Bank and prevent attacks against Israel. With new training, the security forces also brought street crime in the West Bank under control.
But old patronage networks ultimately proved stronger than the technocrats. Fayyad never managed to control the rat's nest of overlapping Palestinian security agencies, whose constant infighting was encouraged by struggles within President Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah party.
Much of the training supported by the United States and the European Union was conducted in Jordan, away from traditional Palestinian bases, in hopes that months away from home would cement a new professional ethos. Yet old neighborhood and clan ties continued to be used in recruitment and some of the most powerful Palestinian security organizations remained outside the reform regimen.
And much as in Afghanistan, various U.S. agencies ended up working at cross purposes. While the State Department and Pentagon cooperated with U.S. allies to create and fund training programs designed to overcome corruption in the security forces, the C.I.A. reportedly remained tied to agencies that operated outside these channels, continuing the traditional patronage system.
The situation was made worse by Israel. The Israeli military talked a good game but severely limited the activities and resources of P.A. security forces. It is understandable that Israel distrusts the Palestinian leadership and any Palestinian armed force. But placing strict limits even on P.A. imports of non-lethal equipment from the United States and Europe, as well as on the ability of various Palestinian police and security forces to coordinate their law-enforcement activities by radio, severely undermined their effectiveness. Israel also sharply limited the ability of Palestinian security forces to move about the West Bank, making it hard for them to capture common criminals.
These restrictions have quashed the development of pride and optimism among the security forces in a future Palestinian state.
The consequences of all these developments were tragically evident in the West Bank area of Jenin. Jenin had been a showpiece of security-sector reform. U.S.-funded and Jordanian-trained P.A. forces swept through in 2008, arresting militias which had long spread terror and extortion among residents. Israel joined the international community in announcing a Jenin Development Plan, offering special economic and agricultural assistance and eased security restrictions for merchants. It was Fayyadism at its best.
But the 2011 assassination of a respected theater director heralded the return of gang-style violence in Jenin, and in May 2012 the home of Jenin's reformist governor was attacked by gunmen, leading to an overnight battle. When the dust settled, it became clear that factions inside the supposedly reformed security forces had been fighting one another for control over territory and patronage in Jenin. At least two of the senior officers who were arrested had recently undergone U.S.-funded training in Jordan.
Violent patronage-based infighting is the bane of state-making. The only way for reform of the security forces to succeed -- and for international confidence and investment in the West Bank to grow -- is for all the involved parties (the Palestinian Authority and Fatah, Israel, the United States, its European allies and all of their agencies) to focus on rule-based professionalism, not personal patronage.
To do so requires a transformation in the thinking of both Palestine and the international community. That, and not a new prime minister, is the path to stable statehood in Palestine.

HEADLINE: China to Welcome South Korean Leader, 'an Old Friend'

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ; Bree Feng contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- China, which has long been North Korea's benefactor, will signal its displeasure with Pyongyang again on Thursday when it welcomes President Park Geun-hye of South Korea for an elaborate banquet and a highly anticipated meeting with China's leader, President Xi Jinping, who has called her ''an old friend.''
Ms. Park's visit will contrast with the furtive, hastily arranged appearances in Beijing recently of two North Korean officials, a senior military officer and a diplomat, who were scolded by their Chinese hosts for North Korea's growing arsenal of nuclear weapons. 
And Ms. Park, 61, the daughter of an anti-Communist dictator, is coming to China before the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, who is supposed to be China's ally.
At the top of the agenda for her visit, according to both sides, will be North Korea and, specifically, how South Korea and China can together push Mr. Kim toward giving up his nuclear weapons.
The symbolism of a frustrated China, which is North Korea's benefactor, joining hands with South Korea, an ally of the United States, in calling for a Korean Peninsula free of nuclear weapons will send a clear and unpleasant message to the North, analysts say.
''When the leaders of the two countries meet reporters, they will say they have reached some consensus on denuclearization of the peninsula,'' predicted Wang Junsheng, professor of Asian affairs at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
That would be a demonstration of a new solidarity in the relationship between China and South Korea. The previous president of South Korea, Lee Myung-bak, did not have China's support, Mr. Wang said.
Ms. Park, who speaks Chinese and has shown an admiration for Chinese culture, will be arriving at a time of turmoil among China's foreign policy specialists, who are debating whether North Korea should be considered an ally or a liability.
The constituencies in China's hierarchy who stand by North Korea appear to be dwindling, but the People's Liberation Army and segments of the Communist Party remain in favor of keeping North Korea on Beijing's side, Chinese experts say.
After North Korea conducted a third nuclear test this year, China voted in favor of economic sanctions against North Korea at the United Nations. Since then, Beijing has called for the resumption of the six-party talks -- involving China, Japan, Russia, the United States, South Korea and North Korea -- that are aimed at ridding North Korea of its nuclear weapons.
Those talks collapsed in 2008 when North Korea walked out, and though Ms. Park has shown more warmth to China on North Korea than her predecessor, she has said she is not in favor of ''talks for talks' sake,'' a position that coincides with the view in Washington.
Indeed, as a leader well regarded by President Obama -- Ms. Park made her first overseas visit to Washington after assuming the presidency this year -- she could well become a channel between the United States and China on North Korea, experts say.
''The Chinese leaders will try to tell her that China is firm on denuclearization and will encourage a return to six-party talks,'' said Sun Zhe, director of the Center for U.S.-China Relations at Tsinghua University in Beijing. ''We need to have some more joint South Korea and China efforts. Strengthening the South Korean-China relationship will send a clear message to North Korea.''
On the eve of Mrs. Park's arrival, The Beijing Morning Post flattered her with a profile headlined ''China Hand.'' It told how Zhao Yun, a Chinese military general of the early third century, is one of her favorite characters. She can sing Chinese songs and likes Sichuan cuisine, the profile said. Her autobiography, ''Steeled by Despair, Motivated by Hope,'' leads the Chinese Amazon list of biographies of political figures.

HEADLINE: Deadline Near With No Deal On Loan Rates For Students

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With only five days before interest rates on student loans are scheduled to double, the Senate majority leader rejected a proposed bipartisan solution that has now scrambled alliances and muddied political attacks for both sides.
Barring a last-minute breakthrough, 7.4 million university students will see rates on their federal Stafford loans jump to 6.8 percent from 3.4 percent on July 1.
''I hope that people start looking at truly compromising and working on something that fixes it,'' said Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, whose conciliatory proposal was shot down Wednesday by fellow Democrats, including Majority Leader Harry Reid. ''You've got rates going up to 6.8 percent. That's unfathomable, and it doesn't have to happen.'' 
For weeks, Congressional Democrats have been anticipating that the standoff over student loan interest rates would be a political boon. In college student newspaper advertisements, on social media platforms and in town hall meetings, Democratic lawmakers cast themselves as the saviors of low, subsidized lending rates, battling Republicans intent on subjecting college loans to the whims of the financial markets. They banked on Republicans caving and extending the fixed, 3.4 percent rate for at least a year, just as they did a year ago when a similar deadline loomed.
But instead House Republicans passed their own student loan bill in May, then went on the offense, saying the Democrats were the ones who have failed to act responsibly. President Obama complicated the politics with his own student loan proposal, which was somewhat similar to the Republican plan. The issue was buried beneath bigger news events: an immigration battle in the Senate, scandals swirling in the House, government eavesdropping revelations and a flurry of significant Supreme Court decisions.
Then with the deadline looming, Mr. Obama abandoned the bully pulpit and headed to Africa.
All that has left Democrats divided and Republicans crowing.
''We could and should get this done for the students of our country,'' Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, said Wednesday.
A glimmer of hope peeked through Washington's cloudy skies Wednesday when five senators -- three Republicans; one independent who leans Democratic, Angus King of Maine; and Mr. Manchin -- unveiled what they billed as a breakthrough.
The proposal would fix all new student loans to the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond rate, plus 1.85 percentage points. Graduate student loans would be 3.4 percentage points above the 10-year rate.
But a conservative Democrat and a Maine independent proved to have no sway with most Democrats, who protested that the proposal lacked a hard cap on interest rates to protect against market fluctuations. They also objected to interest rates that would earn the government $1 billion over 10 years. A spokesman for Mr. Reid quickly shot down rumors that a deal was at hand.
''There's not been a willingness by our Republican colleagues yet to focus on a real cap,'' said Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan and one of the negotiators trying to reach a deal. ''And over time what we've seen in the proposals actually goes higher than doubling the rates.''
Senators Tom Harkin of Iowa and Jack Reed of Rhode Island, both Democrats, will rush new legislation to the Senate on Thursday to freeze the 3.4-percent rate for one year while lawmakers try to reach a long-term agreement in a broader higher education law. But even the bill's authors acknowledge it almost certainly will not be able to get a vote before Congress leaves for a weeklong July Fourth break.
Instead, the legislation would make the fixed rate retroactive to July 1. Since most university students do not sign loan documents until early August, ''we have a little wiggle room, but not a lot,'' said a Senate Democratic aide involved in the drafting.
Democratic leaders, once convinced they could win a clear victory over Republicans, were reduced Wednesday to arguing that allowing interest rates to double would be better than fixing loans to fluctuating market rates.
''I don't know,'' Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat, said with a shrug. ''Student groups said: 'Let it double. We'd rather see it double to 6.8 than the alternatives we've heard.' ''

HEADLINE: Major Indexes Post a Second Day of Gains

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The stock market is focusing on the positive.
Major stock indexes rose for a second day on Wednesday, in the first two-day stretch of gains since the Federal Reserve gave a timetable for scaling back its economic stimulus. 
Even news that the economy grew at a much slower annual rate in the first quarter than previously estimated -- 1.8 percent versus 2.4 percent -- did not damp the buying. In fact, it convinced some traders that the Fed could extend its easy money policies beyond next year. That would most likely benefit the economy and the stock market.
The market's gains were decisive. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 149.83 points, or 1 percent, to 14,910.14. All 10 sectors in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index were higher, led by health care and utilities.
Investors also seemed to realize that they dumped too many stocks last week, when they panicked after the Fed outlined plans on how it might wind down its stimulus measures.
''The sell-off was a little bit overdone,'' said David Coard, head of fixed-income sales and trading at Williams Capital Group in New York. ''Sometimes you've got to take a breather.''
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 15.23, or 1 percent, to 1,603.26. The Nasdaq composite index gained 28.34, or 0.9 percent, to 3,376.22. The rise in stocks extended Tuesday's rally, which was propelled by favorable reports on housing, manufacturing and consumer confidence.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell for the first time since June 14, slipping to 2.54 percent from 2.61 percent. The note increased 19/32 to 93 4/32.
The price of gold plunged $45.20, to $1,229.60 an ounce, its lowest price in three years. The reasons for the sell-off were not entirely clear. Investors tend to buy gold when they are looking for a safe place to put money. They did that Wednesday by buying stocks in dividend-rich, stable sectors, like utilities and government bonds.
The markets have been volatile for weeks, since Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, started hinting that a pullback in stimulus programs would start soon. In the last 25 trading days, the Dow has had 17 triple-digit swings, split almost evenly between ups and downs.
Still, some investors were already turning their attention toward company earnings and away from the Fed. In earnings, they saw reason for caution, not optimism.
Analysts say they expect earnings to grow about 3 percent, though that is down from estimates as high as 15 percent a year ago, according to S&P Capital IQ. Revenue is expected to fall by 0.3 percent.
''We're not seeing any significant bottom-line growth,'' said Chip Cobb, senior vice president of BMT Asset Management in Bryn Mawr, Pa. ''It's all been cost-cutting measures.''
Friday is the last trading day for the second quarter, which could also make the market's moves erratic. Money managers will be looking to get out of their holdings and book profits for clients before then.

HEADLINE: The End Of Fannie And Freddie?

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
On Tuesday, Senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, and Senator Bob Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, introduced a complicated bill that is intended to solve, once and for all, the problem known as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. You can be forgiven for missing this piece of news. Between Edward Snowden and the Supreme Court, it was easy enough to overlook.
But it's not unimportant. It has now been nearly five years since Fannie and Freddie were put into conservatorship by the Treasury Department. Since then, we have been through the financial crisis, the housing crisis and the foreclosure crisis. Although the housing market has come a long way back, the market for private mortgage-backed securities -- that is, bundles of mortgages sold to investors without a government guarantee -- remains moribund. Believe it or not, the much-maligned Fannie and Freddie have kept the housing market alive by taking on the credit risk for most plain-vanilla mortgages, especially that most sacred of sacred cows, the 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage. 
Indeed, ever since the creation of mortgage-backed securities in the 1970s, this has been a critical role of Fannie and Freddie; their ''wrap'' helped give investors the confidence to buy securities stuffed with thousands of mortgages they were never going to inspect individually. Currently, an incredible 77 percent of the mortgages being made in America are guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie.
Yet this can't last forever. Conservatorship was supposed to be temporary. Although Fannie and Freddie are now making a gaggle of money, for complicated reasons having to do with the way the Treasury Department originally set up the conservatorship, that money is not reducing the government's $180 billion bailout of the two companies.
Meanwhile, many Republicans have been screaming that the financing of housing should be left to the private market and that Fannie and Freddie must be put out of business. (They believe, wrongly, that Fannie and Freddie caused the financial crisis.) And the Obama White House -- shocker! -- has punted.
Thus we have Corker-Warner. (The bill has six other co-sponsors, three from each party.) The first thing to note about it is that, by god, it actually would eliminate Fannie and Freddie; the two companies are supposed to be wound down within five years.
But does that mean the private market will take over? Not a chance. Warner told me that although the bill would insist that private capital absorb the first 10 percent of any losses, the federal role remains critical. A new federal agency would be established to explicitly guarantee losses beyond that. And the bill would create programs to help make homeownership possible for low-income Americans, just like Fannie and Freddie once did. Those ads Fannie and Freddie used to run showing diverse Americans smiling in front of their home-sweet-homes could easily be replayed by supporters of Corker-Warner.
When I asked Corker how he planned to sell the bill to his fellow Republicans, he said, ''This is a pragmatic approach. To have liquidity in the market, you have to have some government insurance.'' He said it as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. As for the social mission, he told me that the country would be better served having that mission explicitly dealt with by the federal government than to have it ''embedded'' as part of two companies that were always more concerned with maximizing profits.
I don't doubt that he's right about that. One of the big problems with the old Fannie Mae-Freddie Mac model is that because they were publicly traded companies that also had a government component, their goals were constantly at war with each other. There was too much about them that was implied rather than stated outright. Warner and Corker both stressed that the country was better served by having things like government guarantees of mortgages out in the open, rather than implied as it was in Fannie's and Freddie's heyday.
Yet Corker-Warner has its own unstated assumption, namely that ''the 30-year fixed mortgage is a social entitlement,'' as Karen Petrou, the managing partner of Federal Financial Analytics, puts it. Almost no other country offers a 30-year fixed mortgage, because 30 years is unacceptably risky to the private market -- without a government backstop. The 30-year fixed is also at the heart of the idea that owning one's home is the American Dream. Part of the reason Corker-Warner is so complicated is that it has to do backward somersaults to create a mechanism that will maintain the viability of the 30-year fixed mortgage.
The question of whether the country should even have a 30-year fixed mortgage -- or whether those who want one should pay for it, rather than relying on a broad government guarantee, or whether encouraging everyone to own their own home should be government policy -- is what the country should be debating. By comparison, the debate about Fannie and Freddie is the same thing it's always been: a sideshow.

HEADLINE: Mandatory Federal Cuts Hurt Private Sector, Too

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Congress's $85 billion, across-the-board budget cuts may not have brought the economy to a halt, as many once feared. But they are having a negative effect on jobs in the private sector, according to an analysis of the industries whose head count is most dependent on federal funds.
It is no surprise that some of the companies that are hurting are closely associated with military spending, which was specifically targeted to absorb about half of the cuts from the so-called sequester that began March 1. But many of the businesses experiencing the most pain are those that provide a wide range of services, like plumbing and maintenance.
''We're kind of invisible,'' says Robert M. Sacco, general manager of Aleut Facilities Support Services, based in Colorado Springs, Colo., ''until your toilet overflows.'' 
Contractors say they are trying to make do by picking up other projects where they can, but private sector and state and local government demand has also been weak or shrinking in recent years. Many in the facilities support field, a business category that includes janitorial, maintenance, trash disposal, guard and security, mail routing, reception and laundry services, say they are frustrated by the lack of public awareness about how defense budget cuts affect workers who are not performing stereotypical military functions.
''They just kind of left us hanging,'' said James M. Galligan, chief executive and founder of Strategic Consulting Alliances, a small business in Maryland that employs veterans to do things like clean bathrooms and repair roofs on government properties. ''In midstream the government just sort of cut its funding in half, but I, of course, still have to pay for my workers' health care and taxes and everything else.''
As a result, he resorted to layoffs earlier this year that brought his total payroll down to 50 from about 80.
Mr. Galligan's and Mr. Sacco's companies both provide facilities support services; about 43 percent of the sector's jobs are directly or indirectly paid for by military and other national security operations.
That makes it one of top five sectors that are most reliant on military spending to pay employees. The others in the top five are ship and boat building; aerospace product and parts manufacturing; scientific research and development services; and navigational, measuring, electromedical and control instruments manufacturing, based on calculations by The New York Times using Labor Department methodology. (The calculations involve looking at which industries receive government allocations, and then determine where hiring occurs when production rises or falls in one of those industries. For example, if the Pentagon spends money on fighter planes, that affects employment in the aerospace industry as well as upstream companies like metal manufacturers.)
''There is a huge amount of public sector employment today that is actually in the private sector,'' said Justin Wolfers, an economics and public policy professor at the University of Michigan. ''Who is a public sector worker used to be a simple thing and now it's not.''
Across the five industries that are most sensitive to changes in military spending, employment fell at an annual rate of 2.5 percent in March and stayed flat in April, the latest month for which seasonally adjusted data are available. In all other sectors, by contrast, employment grew at annualized rates of about 1.6 percent in March and 1.7 percent in April.
Before the start of the sequester on March 1, employment at private companies heavily dependent on military spending had been more closely tracking employment in the rest of the economy, though the numbers were somewhat uneven. Military payrolls have been declining almost every month since November 2011 in response to the drawdown in American wars abroad.
These are just the sectors that are most directly hit by Pentagon cutbacks; economists fear that the sequester will ripple through the rest of the economy in more subtle ways, as downsized or furloughed government workers and contractors spend less money at their local businesses. The federal government has shed 45,000 jobs since the sequester began, and federal workers who were working part time but wanted full-time work numbered 55,000 in May, up from 38,000 a year earlier.
Government cutbacks, not just the sequester and other federal budget cuts but also several years of state and local government layoffs, appear to be an important factor in holding back the economic expansion. ''The great puzzle in this recovery is why it's not quicker, particularly relative to other recoveries,'' Mr. Wolfers said. ''The sequester is one of the many insults that been hurled at the recovery so far.''
Some government contractors said that their problems started even before the sequester officially began in March, partly because months of debate over Congressional budget cuts made government agencies and military bases wary about how much money they'd have available to spend.
In May 2012, for example, Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque reduced the number of times it had its bathrooms and other facilities cleaned from every other day to twice a week, according to Brian Ammerman, associate vice president of business operations at Adelante Enterprises, a nonprofit that employs people with disabilities and whose facilities support services division holds the custodial contract with Kirtland.
In other cases, new contracts have been delayed, including projects to make government buildings more energy-efficient. ''There are expected jobs that we've been tracking for several years that we knew were supposed to hit in the first quarter of this year that we haven't seen yet,'' said Dave Mannix, director of the federal market for Sebesta Blomberg, another firm that has facilities management and other technical and engineering contracts with both public and private sector clients. ''There were things that were supposed to be up for contract in the second quarter, and we haven't seen those yet either.''
Even companies that have not been affected so far are concerned about the pipeline for future government work.
''Fiscal year 2014 is going to be a bad year,'' said Mario Burgos, president of the Burgos Group, a small business in Albuquerque that provides a variety of technical, administrative and management services to federal clients, including the Navy, the Air Force and the Bureau of Land Management. ''The largest amount of contract awards comes in this last fiscal quarter, which ends in September. Well, that's also the time that the government employees who make those award decisions, who get those contracts out, are all being furloughed.''
Mr. Burgos said his company had been enjoying a good year so far, mostly by casting its net more broadly and bidding on contracts at agencies the company had not previously worked for. Nonetheless, he has resisted expanding because of uncertainty over the next federal fiscal year, which begins on Oct. 1, and whether existing contracts, typically awarded on a five- or 10-year basis, might be canceled.
''It really makes us hesitant to invest in infrastructure, like additional people or additional tools, since we don't know what could be taken away,'' he said. ''Usually one of the nice things about federal contracting is that you can plan on a longer time frame, as opposed to with business-to-business projects where somebody new gets hired and then they change their mind about the project. But now even in government work we don't know what's going to happen month to month.''

HEADLINE: Sweating the Small Stuff

BYLINE: By TIM M cKEOUGH

 BODY:
The architect Daniel Libeskind has made a name for himself with major urban projects like the master plan for the World Trade Center site and the Jewish Museum in Berlin. But a growing part of his work involves design on a much smaller scale: furniture, building products, household accessories. He sees it as a natural extension of the architecture. 
''Why just do the structure in the raw and then leave somebody to decorate it?'' said Mr. Libeskind, 67. ''It's a privilege to design at a small scale because it's so intimate and so direct.''
While his head office in New York still focuses on the big stuff, part of his Milan office is now dedicated to designing ''everything you need for a home,'' he said, ''or a place where you're working.'' So far, that includes things like door handles for Olivari, serving pieces for Alessi and a tub for Jacuzzi. Another recent project is the Paragon lamp for Artemide, a hinged task light that stands as straight as a skyscraper but can also curl down to illuminate something close up.
Over the years, Mr. Libeskind said, he has collected numerous designer lamps, and has come to the conclusion that a task light must meet two criteria. ''First of all, it has to be something beautiful,'' he said, ''because it's an object that sits on a table.'' But it also has to be functional, not only ''in terms of the kind of light it throws,'' he said, but also ''how you change the light and how you move the lamp.''
In search of a few examples, Mr. Libeskind began at Foscarini, in SoHo, where he admired the Magneto, a lamp that uses a magnetic sphere to connect the head and the base, an arrangement that allows it to be positioned in various ways. ''It's never been done before,'' Mr. Libeskind said, ''and that's one of the ways I judge design.''
It was also surprisingly functional. ''This is almost like a flashlight,'' he said, pulling the head off the base.
At Luceplan, he picked out the Mix lamp. ''It's interactive,'' he said, experimenting with the flexible gooseneck. Also, he said, scrutinizing the serpentine form, ''I like that it's not completely familiar.''
At Flos, Mr. Libeskind went for a classic: the 1980 Gibigiana lamp by Achille Castiglioni, which uses a mirror to bounce light down to a work surface. ''I like this reflective light,'' he said, ''and that the source isn't visible.''
Another classic he liked was the 1954 Tripod desk lamp by Serge Mouille, from Design Within Reach. Even after all these years, he said, its sculptural appeal still felt forward-looking. In fact, he speculated, ''the designer of the space shuttle may have seen this lamp.''

HEADLINE: Cost of Public Projects Is Rising, And Pain Will Be Felt for Years

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH; Ben Strauss contributed reporting from Chicago.

 BODY:
States and cities across the nation are starting to learn what Wall Street already knows: the days of easy money are coming to an end.
Interest rates have been inching up everywhere, sending America's vast market for municipal bonds, a crucial source of financing for roads, bridges, schools and more, into its steepest decline since the dark days of the financial crisis in 2008.
For one state, Illinois, the higher interest rates will add up to $130 million over the next 25 years -- and that is for just one new borrowing. All told, the interest burden of states and localities is likely to grow by many billions, sapping tax dollars that otherwise might have been spent on public services. 
The same concerns about rising rates that have buffeted the world's stock markets recently have also affected the market for municipal bonds. The muni market, despite a modest rally on Wednesday, is headed for one of its worst months in years.
Much as home mortgage rates are making home buying a bit more costly as they rise, so, too, are the rates at which states and cities borrow money. Public officials -- and taxpayers -- may feel the effects for years. Perversely, the places with the greatest distress are likely to see their borrowing costs rise most.
Over the last few days Georgia, Philadelphia, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York and others have delayed sales of new bonds, citing the precipitous plunge in prices that is driving up interest rates.
Gov. Pat Quinn of Illinois attributed the extra cost to the state's failure to shore up its finances, particularly its rickety pension system. Illinois has the lowest credit rating of any state, and as interest rates rise they tend to rise fastest for the weakest borrowers.
''Borrowing money when you're already in debt doesn't seem like a good idea to me,'' said Felicia Hill, a 44-year-old Chicago woman who wondered how the state could bear the rising cost. ''I think it could have waited, when we have bigger problems in Illinois.''
The sell-off in the municipal bond market has followed the general rout in the overall bond market, which was set off when Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, indicated that the strength of the economic recovery might allow the central bank to pull back on its $85 billion-a-month bond-buying program earlier than anticipated.
The Fed was not buying municipal bonds, but the market reacted anyway. Investors expected interest rates to rise, and because prices move in the opposite direction, the values of the municipal bonds they already held dropped.
Investors apparently started selling, not wanting to be the last one out. That caused a flood of bond sales. For the week ended June 19, $3.368 billion flowed out of mutual funds that hold tax-exempt municipal bonds, according to the Investment Company Institute. The outflow for the previous week was $3.236 billion.
Such sell-offs tend to hit the municipal bond market hard because it has many individual investors who buy bonds to hold them, either directly or through mutual funds, rather than financial institutions that trade them quickly.
''The mutual fund's customer has proven to be fickle in these volatile periods, and you get the sticker-shock effect,'' said Chris Mauro, the head of municipal bond strategy at RBC Capital Markets. The trend starts to feed off itself and can last for a long time, he said. ''As they liquidate, there's pressure on the mutual funds to raise cash, which puts more selling pressure onto the market.''
Some analysts thought the sell-off was made worse by the actions of Detroit as it flirted with bankruptcy. The city's emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, proposed inflicting severe losses on its bondholders earlier this month as he struggled to keep the city from declaring what would be the largest municipal bankruptcy in history. That prompted investors to sell Detroit bonds, and raised questions about whether Detroit's approach could set an example that other distressed cities would follow.
Some local governments that had planned to issue bonds this week decided to wait and see whether the market improved. But Illinois was among those that could not afford to wait. It had been conserving money by delaying road maintenance and the building of new schools.
Abdon Pallasch, an assistant state budget director, cited in particular the risk of delaying reconstruction of the city's commuter rail system in hopes of obtaining better rates on the bonds, which have a total value of $1.3 billion. He said service had been halted on the Red Line, Chicago's oldest, inconveniencing 80,000 commuters a day.
Mr. Pallasch said that state finance officers had calculated the state's $130 million market penalty by comparing the rate Illinois will pay on these bonds with the rates being paid on similar bonds issued by states with AA ratings. That, he said, was Illinois's credit rating before the state's pension problems boiled up.
Illinois has shortchanged its pension system for many years and has now fallen so far behind that it cannot catch up without diverting money away from other programs. Governor Quinn has tried several times without success to push pension overhauls through the legislature. Moody's Investors Service downgraded the state's credit to A3 in June, soon after one failed legislative effort, and Fitch went to A-, the equivalent in its ranking system.
Although those ratings are the lowest of any state, they are still several notches above junk grade.
Governor Quinn said that the state was paying an average interest rate on the bonds of 5.042 percent. He called on lawmakers to enact pension changes ''by July 9, so we can stop the bleeding, prevent future downgrades and jump-start Illinois's economy.''
Daniel Berger, senior market strategist for Thomson Reuters Municipal Market Data, said the pension-related downgrades cited by the governor were important factors but not the only ones.
He said that market conditions had driven the interest rate on a typical 10-year municipal bond up by more than one percentage point since the beginning of May. The rate for longer-maturity bonds were more than 1.25 percentage points higher.
''He's ignoring the adverse market conditions,'' Mr. Berger said.
Ben Strauss contributed reporting from Chicago.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Fad-Loving Japan May Derail a Sony Smartphone

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Sony's Xperia Z smartphone, which went on sale in February, has already sold almost a million units by some estimates. But NTT DoCoMo, Japan's largest mobile carrier, will soon stop selling it.
The Xperia Z has not even hit the United States market yet: T-Mobile says the model will make its debut on its network in the coming weeks.
But it is already a has-been in Japan. DoCoMo has turned its attention to a new phone, the Sony Xperia A -- a model with fewer features that has not won the stellar praise showered on the Z.
''It's time for a new model,'' said Mai Kariya, a DoCoMo representative in Tokyo. ''We're finished with the Xperia Z, and now focusing on the Xperia A.'' 
As Sony banks on smartphones to turn around its struggling electronics business, it faces an increasingly bothersome obstacle at home: the demands of Japan's powerful cellphone carriers, which remain obsessed with constant model updates.
For years, Japan's three largest mobile network companies have pressed phone makers here to update their handsets every three or four months, providing Japanese consumers a dazzling array of newfangled phones and features each season. Phones with digital TV broadcast receivers were once all the rage; a phone without it was never going to sell. Then it was thumbprint scans; you'd be hard pressed to find those on many phones today. The same is true of swiveling screens, and to a lesser extent, electronic wallets.
The fast-paced cycle is commonplace in Japanese marketing. Manufacturers deliver short runs of seasonal products to create buzz, analysts say. Pepsi Japan, for example, brings out limited-edition drinks each year: Salty Watermelon Pepsi or Pepsi Ice Cucumber. Nestle's KitKat candy bar has cycled through an eye-popping array of limited editions in Japan: green tea, pumpkin, strawberry cheesecake, wasabi and soybean to name only a few.
Even Japan's best-selling pop group, AKB48, rotates through a cast of 67 members and on New Year's Day released 16 versions of new and repackaged records.
''This is the worst of Japanese companies' excessive obsession with the new,'' said Yuichi Kogure, an associate professor in information technology policy at Aomori Public University and the author of several books on Japan's cellphone industry. ''But now the mobile phone makers are exhausted.''
Sony's Xperia Z got caught in this marketing buzz saw. DoCoMo started selling the Xperia Z in Japan on Feb. 9 as part of the carrier's spring 2013 collection, replacing the Xperia AX of the winter 2012 collection. A month later, on March 15, DoCoMo announced its summer collection of 11 new phones, with the Xperia Z replaced by the Xperia A, which went on sale last month.
The constant feature roulette has helped carriers lure customers away from rival networks. But it taxes the research and development resources of Japan's phone makers, who must meet the constant demands from carriers for new high-end features and frequent handset renewals.
Phone manufacturers here have found it impossible to achieve the economies of scale that would justify the high development costs and the slim profit margins. Because separate teams of designers at each handset maker race to build handsets from the ground up for each separate carrier, few phone makers have been able to develop a coherent global product strategy, analysts say.
The unique pace of the Japanese cellphone market largely cuts it off from the rest of the world, making it difficult for one manufacturer to make and market phones for both the Japanese and global markets, said Kenji E. Kushida, an expert on Japan's information and communications technologies at Stanford.
''The Japanese market became somewhat like the Galpagos Islands. It had great biodiversity, but was so weak to outside species,'' Mr. Kushida said.
He points to Vodafone, which moved into the Japanese cellphone market in the early 2000s. The British network operator tried to synchronize its Japanese product lineup to match its ''global standard'' handsets sold in other markets. But Japanese consumers were unimpressed by what struck them then as overly simple handsets that appeared to take a step back in functionality.
Vodafone's Japanese market share started to slide, and in 2006, it sold its operations to SoftBank.
Not every maker succumbs to this whirligig and, not surprisingly, those that don't aren't Japanese. Apple has announced a new iPhone model roughly once a year. Its iPhone 5 came out in September, and the company is not expected to introduce a new model until the fall. Samsung Electronics is focusing its resources on its sleek Galaxy S4 smartphone, which went on sale in April, a full year after its predecessor the Galaxy S3.
The scattershot efforts by Japanese handset designers could not compete with a single blockbuster product like Apple's iPhone, Mr. Kushida said. It turned out that Japanese consumers didn't want a new phone each season after all, he said, but a well-designed one.
Since its release in 2008, the iPhone has been a best seller in Japan, becoming the most popular handset here. In 2012, the iPhone led all handsets with an overall 15 percent market share, ahead of former market leaders Sharp and Fujitsu, according to data provider IDC Japan.
Looking at smartphones only, Apple's dominance in Japan is even stronger: for the first three months of 2013, Apple's mobile platform market share came to 49.2 percent, compared with Android's 45.8 percent, according to Kantar WorldPanel, which tracks mobile phone sales.
Sony's Xperia Z, which runs on the Android operating system, was shaping up to be Japan's greatest challenger to the iPhone as well as to another global blockbuster, Samsung's Galaxy series. The Xperia Z won rave reviews for its sleek aluminum case, sharp five-inch display, fast-capture camera and high-definition video.
The Xperia Z has topped sales charts, selling at least 630,000 units in Japan in its first 10 weeks, according to the data provider, GfK Japan. DoCoMo had said that it aimed to sell about a million units in Japan, and analysts agree that sales here are now approaching that number. Sony's chief executive, Kazuo Hirai, has repeatedly promoted the Xperia Z's strong sales in Japan as one of the few bright spots in its money-losing electronics sector.
Still, production of the Xperia Z has ceased for the Japanese market, and the model will no longer be available in Japan once stock runs out at retail stores across the country, both Sony and NTT DoCoMo said. ''The Japanese market operates on a far quicker life cycle than markets overseas,'' said Yu Tominaga, a Sony spokesman in Tokyo. ''Demand changes fast here, but we are set up to respond to that,'' he said.
The big question is whether Sony can develop a coherent global smartphone strategy without being distracted by the ever-changing needs of its home market. A lot rides on Sony's gaining on its archrivals, Apple and Samsung, in the smartphone market with the new Xperia A, which has been topping sales charts here since mid-May.
Sony is starting to shift its focus beyond Japan's shores. On Tuesday in China it announced the Xperia Z Ultra, which Sony bills as the slimmest large-screen handset on the market. The company said it wasn't sure when that model might sell in Japan.
If Sony can score more successes overseas and gain market share there, it could start shifting the lopsided power dynamics between Japan's carriers and handset makers, analysts say. A wave of consolidation has shrunk the number of Japanese cellphone manufacturers to five, from 11 five years ago, bolstering the influence of the survivors. For its latest summer season, NTT DoCoMo gave top billing to smartphones from Sony and Samsung, breaking its tendency to give all manufacturers equal play to keep them competing.
Despite DoCoMo's many demands, solid support from a carrier with more than 60 million subscribers in a nation of 127 million people can be a boon. DoCoMo has been offering steep discounts on the Xperia A, and is advertising the model heavily in Japan's subways and on television. That blitz has helped Sony more than double its share to 36 percent in the four weeks to early June, according to BCN, beating Samsung at 13 percent, and even Apple, whose share for that period dropped to 25 percent.
Still, Sony remains far behind Samsung in the global smartphone market. Sony shipped 30 million smartphones last year, compared with Samsung's 218 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Apple shipped about 137 million iPhones.
''I think more people here are starting to realize that the way its mobile phone industry works is unsustainable,'' Mr. Kogure said. ''And manufacturers like Sony have long realized that they can't remain beholden to the whims of the Japanese market.''

HEADLINE: Dalai Lama: No More 'Wolf in Monk's Robes'?

BYLINE: DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW


HIGHLIGHT: There are small signs, still unconfirmed, that China may be rethinking some aspects of its policy towards Tibet, where about 120 people have burned themselves to death in protest at repressive rule in recent years. 

 BODY:
BEIJING - 4:45 p.m. | Updated Is a little bit of fresh air blowing in Tibet after more than two decades of rigid policies by Beijing, and recently, around 120 self-immolations by Tibetans protesting those policies?
Maybe. (An ongoing, rare visit to Tibet by the United States ambassador to China, Gary Locke, is also piquing interest.) 
Here are some startling comments about a possible loosening of policy, from Tsering Namgyal, a writer and journalist based in New York, writing in Asia Sentinel earlier this week (Mr. Namgyal was citing the Tibetan language website Khabda.org.)
"In an abrupt and unexpected reversal of policy, Chinese government officials have told monks in some Tibetan areas that they are now free to 'worship' the Dalai Lama as a 'religious leader,'" Mr. Namgyal wrote.
The policy is being described as an "experiment," Mr. Namgyal wrote. Some monks have been told they can stop criticizing the Dalai Lama, as they have often been required to in the past, and can stop describing him as "a wolf in a monk's robe," said Mr. Namgyal, referring to an announcement apparently made at a meeting on June 14 in a Buddhist school in Qinghai province, at the appointment of a new Communist Party secretary. The meeting was attended by high-ranking ethnic Tibetan and Chinese officials, said Mr. Namgyal.
The goal? To separate the Dalai Lama's religious and political roles.
"'As a religious person, from now on you should respect and follow His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama," the new policy document cited by Mr. Namgyal ran, "but in terms of politics you are not allowed to do so. Politics and religion should go separate ways."
Today, too, the United States ambassador Gary Locke is in Tibet, on a trip that began on June 25 and ends tomorrow, and was approved by the Chinese authorities, his first since becoming ambassador in 2011 and the first visit by a U.S. ambassador since 2010, said an embassy spokesman, Nolan Barkhouse.
Mr. Locke is visiting the Tibetan Autonomous Region "with members of his family and several officials from the embassy and consulate general in Chengdu," said Mr. Barkhouse. "The purpose of this visit is to increase familiarity with local conditions in the Tibetan Autonomous Region and meet with officials and residents there," he said.
Foreign reporters have long been barred from visiting Tibet except for infrequent, carefully-managed tours organized by officials, and Chinese reporters also face restrictions; diplomats have problems gaining access and even regular tourists, from time to time. Mr. Locke addressed that: he "discussed the importance opening up access to Tibet for U.S. diplomats and diplomats from other countries, for foreign journalists and foreign tourists," said Mr. Barkhouse. "He also emphasized the importance of preserving the Tibetan people's cultural heritage, including its unique linguistic, religion and cultural traditions."
Next Saturday, July 6, is the Dalai Lama's 78th birthday. For decades, hardline policy makers in Beijing are said to have believed that the eventual death of the Dalai Lama, (the spiritual leader of Tibetans has lived in exile since March 1959; here it says there were fears he would be assassinated,) would help solve its problems in Tibet.
There has been speculation whether the new president, Xi Jinping, whose influential family has ties to Tibet and whose father is pictured below meeting with the Dalai Lama's brother, 26 years ago, would be able to craft a new policy.
Mr. Xi's predecessor, Hu Jintao, a party leader of Tibet before becoming president, was seen as a conservative on the Tibet issue.
Earlier this month, a voice from within the party establishment spoke about Tibet in an interview with the Hong Kong-based news magazine Yazhou Zhoukan. Jin Wei, a researcher at the Central Party School in Beijing, appeared to urge a more flexible policy.
As the power-holder in the region, the Communist Party - which is officially atheist and has long believed economic development would undermine opposition in Tibet - must accept the central importance of non-material values to Tibetans, she was quoted as saying in the interview on this blog, in Chinese.
"If there can be new thinking and a breakthrough of the deadlock, not only would it further social stability and avoid the creation of hard-to-heal ethnic wounds, it would have a positive influence on other ethnic minorities in the country," Ms. Jin said. And help improve China's international image, she added.
Tibet isn't the only part of this vast country where Beijing is having real trouble. Yesterday, 27 people were killed in Xinjiang, the far-western, mostly Muslim region, in a dawn "riot" that official media attributed to "knife-wielding mobs" but Chinese analysts cited by the Global Times, a newspaper that is part of the People's Daily Group, attributed to "terrorists".
Meanwhile, in a new report, Human Rights Watch says millions of Tibetans have been rehoused and relocated since 2006 as part the "Build a New Socialist Countryside" and "New Socialist Villages" campaigns. This link provides aerial images of what the group says is the Tibetan countryside before and after, showing changes.
The 115-page report, "'They Say We Should Be Grateful': Mass Rehousing and Relocation in Tibetan Areas of China," documents extensive rights violations, the group said.

President Obama's aspirations for changing Africa have been strained by mounting security threats, spotty human rights records and by his notable absence from the continent where his father was born. Michael D. Shear, Nicholas Kulish and Lydia Polgreen.
The South African government is struggling with the issue of how to reconcile the voracious, concern-driven appetite for news of Nelson Mandela's health with the deep sensitivities of South Africans for whom he is much more than a simple leader. Declan Walsh reports from Johannesburg.
The Europe-wide scandal surrounding the substitution of cheaper horse meat in what had been labeled beef products caught the most attention from consumers, regulators and investigators this year. But in terms of food fraud, regulators and investigators say, that is just a hint of what has been happening as the economic crisis persists. Stephen Castle and Doreen Carvajal report.
Ecuador signaled it may take its time with Edward J. Snowden's application for asylum, raising the possibility that Mr. Snowden, the fugitive former security contractor wanted in the United States, could spend weeks in legal limbo. David M. Herzenhorn and Rick Gladstone report.
 ARTS A district court in Amsterdam has ordered the Anne Frank House to return a collection of archives to the Frank family foundation. Scott Sayare reports.

HEADLINE: In Berlin, Walls on the Wall

BYLINE: OLIVIA SNAIJE


HIGHLIGHT: A German photographer who documents the barriers dividing lands &#8212; and people &#8212; around the world is preparing to show his work on what&#8217;s left of the Berlin Wall. 

 BODY:
The German photographer Kai Wiedenhfer was a student when the Berlin Wall fell in November 1989. It was the most "positive and exciting political event that I witnessed in my life," he said. "It deeply moved me and never left me."
Twenty-three years later Mr.Wiedenhfer, now 47, is preparing to plaster 36 photographs on 364 meters of one the longest remaining portions of the Berlin wall that divided the city for 28 years. His exhibition,"Wall on Wall," will be at Mhlenstrasse, on a part of the wall overlooking the River Spree. The photos show walls that divide people, cultures and territories in Ireland, Iraq, Cyprus, Palestine, Morocco, North and South Korea and between the U.S. and Mexican border. 
Mr.Wiedenhfer first thought of exhibiting his images on the Berlin Wall when he photographed the wall built by the Israeli government in occupied Palestinian territories in 2003, returning every six months to document the construction. The series of panoramic photographs depict life in the shadow of the wall (they were published in a book in 2007). The photographer had concluded that barriers are "proof of human weaknesses and errors, the inability of human beings to communicate with each other."
Neil Burgess, an agent based in Britain who represents photographers such as Sebastiao Salgado and Annie Leibovitz, is a longtime supporter of Mr.Wiedenhfer's work and is assisting him with the project. Adrienne Goehler, a former cultural minister of the Berlin government and former head of the academy of fine arts in Hamburg, is curating the exhibition.
It took Mr.Wiedenhfer five years to receive permission for the project from the city of Berlin. The permit was finally granted when Mr.Wiedenhfer's proposal included a variety of images of walls taken between 2006 and 2012 after his experience in Palestine. The aim, he said, is to stress that walls and border fences are no solution to today's global political and economic problems.
The back and forth with the Berlin municipality did take a toll on Mr.Wiedenhfer and Ms. Goehler, however.
"It almost drove us crazy," said Ms. Goehler. "We had all kinds of offers to do the exhibition if we left out the wall in the West Bank. The most astonishing fact was that officials had this idea that walls have only one narrative. What is most important for me is the human aspect - that these walls are separating people."
In all, Mr.Wiedenhfer made 21 trips for his project, which is also planned as a book, to be published in German and English, called "Co-Frontiers."
Mr.Wiedenhfer worked in Northern Ireland in the 1990s,and was dismayed, when he returned to Belfast in 2008, to see construction of what are called "peace lines" stretching over 34 kilometers. Images of this stark barrier and others-the highly controlled wall and border between North and South Korea; the dilapidated wall in Nicosia, Cyprus; barriers in Ceuta and Melilla - fragments of Spain in Morocco; a wall in Baghdad built by the U.S. Army, or the nine-meter high concrete wall snaking through the West Bank are among the images that will be on view.
Taken with large-format panoramic cameras, Mr.Wiedenhfer's photographs will be next to a segment of the wall that has recently became a subject of intense controversy: Developers hope to tear down a portion of it in order to erect luxury apartment buildings; protesters have been fighting to retain the wall as a historical monument.
Given the history of tagging and street art on the wall, Ms. Goehler said she would be very interested in the public's reaction. Mr.Wiedenhfer recently conducted a three-week experiment in Berlin exhibiting his photograph of the barrier in Tijuana; it was left undamaged.
"Nothing happened, people respected it," said Ms. Goehler, who hopes the exhibition will travel to countries where there are walls. "I would be so happy if my prognosis were correct-that people can make the difference between quality and junk. It is an open and collective process, a space for debate."
"The Berlin Wall was proof that peace begins only when they fall." Said Mr.Wiedenhfer.
 "Wall on Wall" will be on view through July.

HEADLINE: I.P.O.'s Hit Market Turbulence

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: The market turmoil of recent weeks is affecting a range of companies seeking to go public. | Heads of Wall Street firms cheered the Supreme Court decision on gay marriage. | The Securities and Exchange Commission plans to test a new policy of requiring admissions of wrongdoing, according to a report. | States and cities are learning that the days of easy money are coming to an end. 

 BODY:
I.P.O.'S FACE TURBULENCE | The market turmoil of recent weeks is affecting a range of companies seeking to go public, DealBook's Michael J. de la Merced reports. HD Supply, a former Home Depot division that serves construction and maintenance contractors, priced its stock sale at $18 a share on Wednesday, well below its expected range. Tremor Video, a leading video advertising network, priced its offering at $10 a share, below an anticipated range of $11 to $13, according to a person briefed on the matter. The CDW Corporation, a technology products retailer, priced its shares at $17, the low end of an already-reduced range.
Markets that recently seemed ebullient have turned shaky on concerns that the Federal Reserve will soon begin pulling back on its economic stimulus. With the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index down nearly 3 percent over the last month, some investors in I.P.O.'s are pushing for better terms from sellers and underwriters. "What we've been seeing are deals that are being reconfigured," said David Menlow, the president of IPOfinancial.com, a research firm. "Some companies will be able to endure such a process, while others won't." 
It's an unwelcome turn for companies owned by private equity firms, which are eager to sell their holdings. Many of these companies took on significant amounts of debt in their takeovers, especially those struck at the height of the credit boom in 2007, Mr. de la Merced writes. Both HD Supply and CDW disclosed that they would use the proceeds from their I.P.O.'s to pay down their obligations.
WALL STREET CHEERS DECISION ON GAY MARRIAGE | The Supreme Court rulings on Wednesday that bolstered gay marriage prompted bouts of celebration around the country. Among the gratified were the heads of Wall Street firms. "This is good for our company and clients, but more importantly, it's the right thing to do," Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said in a statement. "The rights of all people are important and must be protected."
"Marriage equality lowers burdens and challenges imposed on employers, and will lead to building successful businesses and a strong American economy," Goldman Sachs said in a statement, according to Bloomberg News. On Twitter, Lloyd C. Blankfein, the firm's chief executive, said: "Today's decisions help define who we are as a people, whether or not we are part of the group directly affected."
In a pair of rulings, the Supreme Court decided that married same-sex couples were entitled to federal benefits, and effectively allowed same-sex marriages in California. Some experts noted that the ruling on benefits could be good for corporations, simplifying administrative duties and making it easier to recruit workers.
S.E.C. TO TEST POLICY OF ADMITTING GUILT | "Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement chiefs have drawn up a hit list of impending cases where officials intend to test their new policy of requiring admissions of wrongdoing when settling civil charges, according to people close to the agency," Jean Eaglesham reports in The Wall Street Journal. "The handful of likely target cases include a planned enforcement action against a company alleged to have made illicit profits by charging investors undisclosed markups on top of commissions, one of the people said."
ON THE AGENDA | ConAgra reports earnings before the market opens, while Nike reports earnings this evening. Data on personal income and spending in May is out at 8:30 a.m. Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs is on CNBC at 4 p.m. Henry M. Paulson Jr., a former Treasury secretary, is on CNBC at 4:30 p.m.
STRESS IN MUNICIPAL BOND MARKET | States and cities are learning that the days of easy money are coming to an end, Mary Williams Walsh writes in DealBook. "Interest rates have been inching up everywhere, sending America's vast market for municipal bonds, a crucial source of financing for roads, bridges, schools and more, into its steepest decline since the dark days of the financial crisis in 2008."
"For one state, Illinois, the higher interest rates will add up to $130 million over the next 25 years - and that is for just one new borrowing. All told, the interest burden of states and localities is likely to grow by many billions, sapping tax dollars that otherwise might have been spent on public services. The same concerns about rising rates that have buffeted the world's stock markets recently have also affected the market for municipal bonds. The muni market, despite a modest rally on Wednesday, is headed for one of its worst months in years."

HEADLINE: Hawaiian Airlines Offers New Service to Asia and the Pacific

BYLINE: CHRISTINE NEGRONI


HIGHLIGHT: Hawaiian has became the first United States airline to offer service to Auckland, New Zealand, opening a route from New York and its 10 other American cities via Honolulu, breaking a long, long trip into two nearly equal flight segments. 

 BODY:
From the New York area to Australasia, the air travel choices have been few; either go west to pick up a trans-Pacific flight from San Francisco, Dallas or Los Angeles, or fly first to Dubai or Hong Kong and transfer there. 
But in March Hawaiian became the first United States airline to offer service to Auckland, New Zealand, opening a route from New York and its 10 other American cities that breaks a long, long trip into two nearly equal flight segments.
For travelers departing from New York's Kennedy International Airport, Hawaiian now offers service through Honolulu to Auckland, and Sydney and Brisbane, Australia, as well as destinations in Japan, Korea and, in July, Taipei.
By using Honolulu as a transfer point, the airline is using a hub-and-spoke plan that has been very successful for fast-growing global airlines like Singapore and Emirates, although there are significant differences, according to Peter Ingram, chief commercial officer at Hawaiian Airlines.
"We are not situated geographically to serve as a midpoint connection destination - as is Dubai - except between Oceania and North America and Southern Asia and North America. Our route map is ideal for connections between Oceania and Southern Asia and many sought-after travel destinations in North America."
To further encourage travelers to choose Hawaiian over other airlines that serve Asia and the Pacific from New York, the airline offers what it calls a "procrastination vacation," a free stopover of unrestricted length in Honolulu for those who want a dual-destination holiday.
With the lowest-priced economy fares to Auckland about $1,899 on Hawaiian, ticket prices are competitive with Air New Zealand's flights leaving from Los Angeles and San Francisco.

HEADLINE: Yes, We Have No Inflation

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: Inflation remains subdued, which sounds like a good thing. But it is best in moderation, economic research suggests, and it insulates the economy from a bigger fear: deflation. 

 BODY:
Inflation remained sluggish in May. Prices continued to rise at the slowest pace in at least half a century, up just 1.1 percent over the previous year, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said Thursday. While some other measures of inflation are rising a little more quickly, the Federal Reserve regards this one as most accurate. 
Slow inflation may sound like a good thing, but it's not. Particularly not now.
Economic research suggests that inflation is best in moderation. Price increases lead to wage increases, which makes it easier to repay existing debts, like mortgages, and more attractive to incur new debts, like borrowing to start a company.
Inflation also functions as a kind of economic WD-40, easing shifts in the allocation of resources. It is easier for struggling companies and industries to adjust by withholding cost-of-living increases than by seeking to impose wage cuts.
Perhaps most importantly, moderate inflation keeps the economy at a safe distance from deflation, or general price declines, which can freeze activity as would-be buyers wait for lower prices. Such a buffer would be particularly valuable now because the Fed is already stretching the limits of its ability to stimulate the economy, leaving the United States unusually vulnerable to any new shocks.
Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, fears deflation. He insisted as an academic that central banks can and should ensure moderate inflation, and he has sought to live those lessons as a policy maker. Minimizing the risk of deflation has been a major motivation for the Fed's stimulus campaigns, and perhaps their most successful achievement.
But he and other Fed officials have shown relatively few signs of concern lately. The Fed's most recent policy statement, and its economic projections, both released last week, show that Fed officials expect the pace of inflation to increase gradually.
In part, that is because they already are doing a great deal to prevent deflation. It also reflects the curious stability of inflation expectations in recent years, suggesting the Fed has convinced investors that it is willing to do more as necessary. Finally, there are technical reasons to think that the pace of inflation is probably not quite so low as the current reading, reflecting the imprecision of the process.
"There are a number of transitory factors that may be contributing to the very low inflation rate," Mr. Bernanke said last week. "For example, the effects of the sequester on medical payments, the fact that nonmarket prices are extraordinarily low right now. So these are some things that we expect to reverse and we expect to see inflation come up a bit. If that doesn't happen, we will obviously have to take some measures to address that. And we are certainly determined to keep inflation not only - we want to keep inflation near its objective, not only avoiding inflation that's too high, but we also want to avoid inflation that's too low."

HEADLINE: Kerry Proposes U.S.-India Push on Carbon and Climate

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Secretary of State John Kerry keeps the pressure on India to join in efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions. 

 BODY:
Shortly after prodding India in a New Delhi speech to find ways to cut greenhouse gas emissions, Secretary of State John Kerry sent a "Your Dot" piece emphasizing that he sees this as a partnership between two dynamic, innovative democracies. Here's Kerry's fresh pitch, followed by my initial reaction:
I was in India this week for the fourth U.S.-India Strategic Dialogue, joined by my friend from Massachusetts and one of the smartest, most creative leaders in government, Energy Secretary Ernie Moniz.
Every time I visit India, it's as if I set foot in a different country, a country racing forward to meet the economic and development demands of modernity, a boisterous democracy where debate is a prized commodity. 
But the country I visited this week was also grappling with the impact of extraordinary flooding responsible for the heartbreaking loss of lives and livelihoods.
Here, too, extreme weather events are causing unbelievable disruption and dislocation - and India is not alone: extreme weather events are increasing all over the world and 12 of the hottest 14 years on record have occurred since 2000.
Just last week, the World Bank reported that within the next generation that same warming atmosphere could lead to widespread water and food shortages, historic heat waves, prolonged droughts, and more intense flooding. And tragically, India is a primary candidate for all four. India helps feed the world, but extreme heat could actually cut in half yields of the most productive areas, wreaking havoc on global food prices. The Himalayan glaciers are receding, threatening the supply of water to almost a billion people.
What does that tell us? It underscores the imperative that we act forcefully and cooperatively on climate change, not because of ideology, but because of science.
The global climate challenge is about opportunity, security, even our very survival in the long term. These challenges are interconnected and we have the opportunity - right now - to address them in ways that move our economies forward and deliver tangible benefits to the global community.
The good news is that if we address climate change the right way, it's not going to hurt our economies; it'll actually grow them. Staring us in the face today is one of the greatest economic opportunities of all time - the clean energy market. The new energy market is a $6 trillion market and its fastest growing segment by far is clean energy. [His office said this figure comes from an estimate for the global energy market made by the venture capitalist John Doerr.] This is not just about air and water and weather, it's about job creation, capturing investment, and improving our economies.
My time in India, fortuitously, came on the eve of President Obama announcing a series of domestic measures to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Our decisive action at home empowers us to make more progress internationally on the shared global challenge of climate change. We in the United States recognize our responsibility to lead on climate action and we are committed to doing our part by taking significant actions to reduce our own emissions. Under President Obama, the United States has done more to combat climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions than ever before, both at home and abroad. And the announcement just this week of actions that include cutting domestic carbon pollution from new and existing power plants and increasing the use of renewable and clean energy sources puts tangible action behind our words.
India and the United States are particularly well-positioned to roll up our sleeves and cooperate to address climate change. We have strong foundations to build on together, and I believe that by joining forces, India and the United States can make this leap for the benefit of both our countries and the world. We can, I believe, do so in a way that erases the anxiety (quite understandable) in a country like India that wants to grow and develop just as we did in the 1800s and 1900s. But the beauty of today's technology is that India can grow clean - an option the United States didn't have during our time of economic transformation from an agrarian to an industrialized nation. We can work on this together. That is why we announced this week the formation of a U.S.-India Working Group on Climate Change to seek new ways to find solutions and push the curve of discovery. This new Working Group will allow us build on our common values and seize the common possibilities that lie ahead of us.
My bottom-line take away from my climate and energy discussions in India? The world's largest democracy and the world's oldest democracy, both scientific leaders, can and must do more together to confront the climate challenge - and if we get it right, our partnership can be an example for the world.
Kerry will likely face resistance in seeking lockstep commitments, of course, given that India's prime challenge is bringing reliable electricity and affordable fuels by any means to its billion-plus citizens - some 400 million of whom were unaffected by last year's blackouts because they have no access to electricity at all.
As I've written, some of that new energy can and should come through a push on renewable sources, particularly in villages that are unlikely to be on a conventional power grid for years, if ever. But many parts of India could use energy provided by any means.
In his New Delhi speech, Kerry spoke of India joining "China and the United States and other major economies in order to rapidly develop joint technology and pilot programs for low- or no-carbon strategies." This is a sound idea, but could rub Indian officials the wrong way.
More than a few times, Indian diplomats and officials have told me they bristle every time they see India lumped with China in discussions of obligations to eschew fossil fuels, given that India's per-capita energy use is less than a third that of China.
Still, Kerry is right that the prosperous, urban side of India, with a straining, highly inefficient electrical grid, traffic-choked streets and other sources of energy waste, can do plenty to cut emissions even as it boosts energy access.
One opportunity was unmentioned in Kerry's speech and this post: the chance for the United States to help India develop its shale gas, an energy source that India is keen on tapping and that is cleaner than other fossil fuel choices. As with China, nurturing partnerships that spread best drilling practices for gas can be a win for climate and clean air - if gas is developed in place of coal (or dirty diesel). [Grist has some reactions from an environmental campaigner in India.]
Over all, there's a lot of promise in nurturing a partnership between the United States and India on expanding energy choices that work for the long haul. I hope Kerry keeps at it.

HEADLINE: When Fed Transparency Fails, Go Zen

BYLINE: JARED BERNSTEIN


HIGHLIGHT: With the market reacting feverishly to the comments of Ben Bernanke, the chairman might do well to adopt a more philosophical tone, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Jared Bernstein is a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington and a former chief economist to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. 
Last week, when the markets began roiling in reaction to statements by Ben S. Benanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, I heard the former Dallas Fed president Bob McTeer wonder if this might have been a good time for the Fed chief to say less, not more. At the time, I thought that was wrong. If you've got a policy of trying to be transparent, it looks conspicuous and worrisome if you stop trying. 
But after watching recent events, I'm beginning to think Mr. McTeer had a point. More than transparency, the issue is that because their decisions are going to be influenced by incoming data, Mr. Bernanke is able to say "what" but not "when." That is, he can say: at some point we're going to start unwinding ... can't say when ... probably pretty soon ... though maybe not, if the data turns.
That message has done more harm than good. Everyone knows that the Fed cannot be in full-bore stimulus mode forever. That markets reacted badly to that "news" may seem strange, but the volatility is more related to when, not what. And since he can't say when, there's no new information in there, expect that "when" is maybe closer than you thought.
Perhaps that last part is somehow useful, but I agree with another Fed bank president, Narayana Kocherlakota of Minneapolis, who "said that the lack of clarity is causing investors to overreact," The Washington Post reported.
"The questions about the front end are really questions about the back end," he said. "What is economically a minor tweak in monetary policy is seen as having big consequences."
The first part of that quote, about how the front end is the back end, led me to this solution. If Mr. Bernanke continues to feel compelled to speak out, he should do so in Zen terms, emulating more the "I Ching" than monetary textbooks. Some suggestions:
On tapering: "Though the rains have led to a rich bounty, they must cease and allow the sun to naturally warm the fields."
On rate increases: "That which was down, must eventually be up. Bounds of zero must become unbound."
On incoming data: "The wise man follows the path. Though the path is unknown today, it will be revealed tomorrow ... and then there's revisions, of course."

HEADLINE: Stronger U.S. Growth Ahead

BYLINE: PHILLIP SWAGEL


HIGHLIGHT: Four forces &#8212; immigration reform, expanded energy production, a housing upturn, and clarity about financial regulation &#8212; are shaping up to support stronger growth and job creation, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Phillip Swagel is a professor at the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland, and was assistant secretary for economic policy at the Treasury Department from 2006 to 2009. 
While recent stock market gyrations betray investor concerns over the resilience of the recovery as the Fed contemplates the end of easy money, the prospects for growth in the United States look brighter not much further ahead. There are always risks and challenges that could derail an optimistic forecast - some of them are highlighted below - but four powerful forces coming together over the next year are poised to support stronger growth and job creation. These positive drivers are lasting benefits from immigration reform, expanded energy production and exports, the long-awaited housing upturn, and an increased measure of certainty in the financial industry as the main elements of the postcrisis regulatory overhaul fall into place.
 Immigration 
The politics of immigration reform remain uncertain, but the economic benefits are clear and vast (a point made last week in this space by Simon Johnson). People are the essential raw ingredient for America's economy, and immigration reform means more of them will work and contribute to our society - in the sunlight rather than the shadows. 
As estimated by the Congressional Budget Office, immigration reform would translate into job creation, business and household spending, and higher tax revenue that would offset attendant costs. The calculus improves over time, with the benefits widening as future generations blend into and renew the United States. Immigration reform would allow more foreign graduates of our top universities (including my institution, the University of Maryland) to stay and contribute rather than leaving the country.
Past generations of immigrants played key roles in entrepreneurship and innovation in tech hot spots like Silicon Valley, and there is every reason to expect a similar dynamic going forward. The political reality is that the benefits from high-skilled immigrants are connected to a policy that addresses all immigrants, not just those with degrees. The economic positives are too big for policy makers to leave on the table. And if nothing else, the demographic imperative of the future electorate provides an offset to present-day political qualms. I see immigration reform as a bipartisan achievement for this Congress and an economic boon for the nation.
 Energy 
Expanded use of technologies like hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, and horizontal drilling for extraction of oil and natural gas have contributed to increased domestic energy production that has added to output and job creation. The immediate benefits are seen in the booming economies of shale-laden states like North Dakota, but Americans stand to gain more broadly from lower energy prices and from higher incomes generated by energy exports. While private-sector actions so far have been the key to unleashing the energy revolution, decisions by the federal government and individual states are likely to increase production and further strengthen the economy over the next several years.
The Obama administration has already approved expanded exports of natural gas, which in turn would be expected to foster domestic production. A crackdown on coal-fired power plants as part of the president's climate action plan announced on Tuesday will add incentives to generate electricity with cleaner-burning fuels like natural gas. According to the 2013 Economic Report of the President (Figure 6-3 on page 196), the shift in this direction already accounted for 40 percent of the reduction in the nation's carbon dioxide emissions from 2005 to 2012. Other policy decisions to allow increased natural gas production will be made at the state level. Even those states that have held fracking at bay, such as New York, seem likely to come around as environmental concerns are addressed.
As with immigration, the economic stakes are too high to ignore, with the possibility of hundreds of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of tax revenue (these figures are from a study sponsored by interested parties but carried out by a reputable economic consulting firm and seem reasonable as an order of magnitude of the potential benefits). An early indication of the economic attraction can be seen in California, where the State Assembly recently declined to move forward with anti-fracking legislation. 
Expanded oil-related activities involve similar economic considerations, though the politics are trickier because President Obama faces determined opposition from his political supporters to the expansion of drilling and the construction of pipelines like the Keystone XL that would transport Canadian petroleum into the American refining and distribution system. Even so, the president in his climate address hinted that the pipeline would be approved, and presumably similar economic calculations would factor into other decisions, like speeding up federal approvals of drilling applications. Expect such announcements to trumpet "unprecedented" (a favorite word of this White House) environmental safeguards. But energy production will increase, with state and federal governments increasingly supportive rather than wary.
 Housing 
The signs of the housing revival are now widespread, with gains over the past year in home prices, sales, and construction starts for both single-family homes and apartment buildings (the Department of Housing and Urban Development provides a monthly update of housing information and administration policy efforts). The foreclosure rate remains elevated nationally but has generally declined since the peak in early 2010, leaving fewer empty homes and distressed sales to hold down housing prices. Rising home prices likewise have left fewer families underwater on their mortgages (owing more than their homes are worth) and thus a smaller number at risk of losing their homes. 
The uptick in housing demand from the gradual job market recovery will be joined by a powerful demographic trend, as millions of Americans who doubled up with roommates or stayed in their parents' basements move out to form new households. To be sure, housing activity has not returned to the bubble levels seen before the financial crisis, and the recovery is proceeding unevenly across the country. But the upswing is palpable and poised to continue.
 Financial Sector Regulation 
Finally, increased regulatory certainty will translate into a financial sector that more effectively fulfills its role of connecting the savings of Americans and others around the globe with productive investments. Lending conditions have eased since the financial crisis, but credit remains tight in parts of the economy, notably for small businesses. These hiccups are by far not a result of tighter regulation alone - and a new regulatory regime was badly needed after the financial crisis. But many of the provisions in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulatory reform legislation required federal regulators to spell out regulations, and this vital work has lagged. 
The June 2013 progress report from the Davis Polk law firm reports that only 153 of 398 required Dodd-Frank rules have been completed while 128 have not yet even been proposed for comments. Still, important progress has been made, notably in setting up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and bringing greater transparency to derivatives trading (including work to improve derivatives markets begun at the New York Fed under Timothy Geithner before he became Treasury secretary in early 2009). 
Financial firms might not like the added regulations (and whether any such complaints are justified is a topic for the future), but they will adapt once the rules of the road are clear. By next year, regulators will have spelled out additional rules for derivatives activity, bank capital requirements, the enhanced prudential regime for large banks and other systemically important financial institutions, and possibly the Volcker Rule that will determine allowable bank activities. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is making progress putting together its new approach to dealing with the failure of systemic financial institutions.
Not every rule will be settled, but considerable progress is near - more than is apparent than from a simple count of outstanding regulations. Some of the Dodd-Frank provisions could stand to be improved (and I am co-director of a project aimed at doing just that), but having the main ones finally in place will help relieve lingering credit market strains and provide a meaningful boost to the financial sector and the overall economy.
 Other Factors 
To be sure, key economic challenges remain to be tackled. Tax reform could contribute to economic growth and simplify the tax code while maintaining progressivity. Entitlement reform is needed as part of an approach to addressing the government's looming fiscal imbalance. The start-up of the Affordable Care Act looks rocky and its long-term effects remain uncertain. Drag from chronic ills in Europe and the possibility of a slowdown in China could likewise affect the United States.
All of those risks are out there and more. But the four positives of immigration, energy, housing, and financial reform represent powerful forces that will boost the economy over the next year and beyond. A revival of solid growth after six years of recession and slow recovery would give Americans confidence in their prospects for finding a good job and moving up the economic ladder. Better growth, moreover, would provide a more conducive political and social environment in which to tackle some of the longer-term economic challenges facing the United States. These possibilities make the policy decisions on immigration reform and energy all the more important.

HEADLINE: A World of Rising Health Care Costs

BYLINE: EDUARDO PORTER


HIGHLIGHT: A report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development suggests that the increase in medical costs in many countries in the coming decades is likely to be even steeper than in the United States. 

 BODY:
Americans are used to hearing that health care will bust the budget. The Congressional Budget Office projected last year that Medicare, Medicaid and other government health programs would eat up 9.6 percent to 10.4 percent of the nation's gross domestic product by 2037, crowding out many other vital programs. 
But a new report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development suggests that the United States is not the only country that will struggle to contain public spending on medical care. In fact, costs are likely to increase slightly less in the United States than in other industrialized countries and some big developing countries around the world.
Public spending on medical services has slowed much more sharply in other countries since the financial crisis hit government budgets around the industrial world. Government health expenditures across the O.E.C.D. grew only 0.1 percent in both 2010 and 2011, on average, after growing 4.9 percent a year between 2000 and 2009. In Greece they plummeted more than a quarter over those two years. In Britain they contracted by 2 percent. In the United States, by contrast, government health spending grew 3.3 percent in 2010 and 2.2 percent in 2011.
But health spending is expected to pick up as the economy recovers. The organization lays out two possible paths. In one, health care costs keep rising at the pace of the last decade or so - powered not only by growing incomes and the aging of the population but also by rapid medical inflation, technology advances and more intensive delivery.
Along the other, unspecified policy changes - perhaps like the Affordable Care Act - manage to slow spending to what would be justified by aging and income only.
If it is not contained, government spending on health will rise to almost 12 percent of G.D.P. on average across the 34 O.E.C.D. nations, from 5.5 percent in the second half of the last decade. In the United States it will rise to 13.2 percent from 7.1 percent.
And in some poor developing countries, it will rise even faster. In China, for instance, health spending would rise to 8.3 percent of G.D.P. in 2060 from 1.9 percent in the second half of the 2000s.
Budgets will be easier to meet if health spending is tamed. Under the assumption that this happens, the O.E.C.D.'s public budget for health care eats up only some 8 percent of the economy by 2060. In the United States it takes up 9.3 percent.
But nothing, it seems, will stop public spending on health care from rising.

HEADLINE: An Old Champion Returns for Mortgage-Based Bonds

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: The new firm run by Lewis S. Ranieri, who in the 1980s helped pioneer the mortgage-backed security, sold $251 million of them in a single deal. 

 BODY:
Lewis S. Ranieri helped pioneer mortgage-backed securities in the 1980s. On Thursday, his new firm priced its first mortgage bond deal.
With the recent turmoil in the bond markets, however, the offering was not without drama. The structure of the offering was changed to offer buyers more protection against losses, according to a person briefed on the matter who was not authorized to speak about the private deal.
The firm, Shellpoint Partners, of which Mr. Ranieri is chairman, sold $251 million in residential mortgage-backed securities tied to loans that are not backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. The largest portion of the deal was sold at a rate of 2.85 percentage points above ultrasafe government debt, according to the person briefed on the deal. 
Through a spokesman, Mr. Ranieri and Shellpoint declined requests for comment.
Bond prices have fallen since the Federal Reserve indicated that it planned to start reducing the stimulus it has used to keep interest rates low since the financial crisis.
For residential mortgage bonds without government backing, the fall has been steep. After a rapid climb in 2012, prices of these bonds began to stumble this year and have fallen about 3.5 points on average since the beginning of June, according to an index of prime and subprime mortgage-based securities from Markit.
"You had this panic that rates were rising, and you had all these redemptions coming out of bond funds," said Ken Shinoda, portfolio manager on the mortgage-backed securities desk at DoubleLine Capital. "There were a lot of things not trading."
Few know this market like Mr. Ranieri, 66, who ran the mortgage group at Salomon Brothers in the 1980s and rose to become vice chairman of the firm. A college dropout from Brooklyn, Mr. Ranieri started in Salomon's mailroom before distinguishing himself as a trader.
"He was a bull in a china shop," said Robert F. Dall, a onetime boss of Mr. Ranieri. "He was a guy who knew lots about lots of things and was not loath to say so."
By 1987, Mr. Ranieri was pushed out of Salomon, and he began a second career as a private investor. As the financial crisis unfolded, he watched as mortgage bonds and other, more exotic mortgage-based products fell in value.
"I used to think we had done something important and good, and then, unfortunately, we had the last bubble," Mr. Ranieri said in a speech last week at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington. "The system we built showed the cracks and the clay feet."
To Mr. Ranieri's mind, there is another problem today: that the government still controls Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage finance giants it rescued in the financial crisis. That level of involvement by the government is "unacceptable," Mr. Ranieri said.
But as the last-minute restructuring of Thursday's deal showed, investors remain nervous about the types of investments Mr. Ranieri is pushing, which do not have government backing.
In addition, the Shellpoint deal had some features that raised eyebrows among prospective buyers. The security includes a number of loans to foreign nationals and real estate investors, in addition to a relatively high concentration of properties in California, according to a report by Fitch Ratings.
And yet, Mr. Ranieri remains determined to bring the market back to life.
"Hello," he said in his speech last week. "I'm Dr. Frankenstein."

HEADLINE: The Up-in-the-Air President

BYLINE: TIMOTHY EGAN


HIGHLIGHT: Obama&#8217;s policies are sound and have majority support. It&#8217;s his fear of taking the fight to Republicans that is so maddening. 

 BODY:
It was cool, as media moments go, when President Obama called from Air Force One to congratulate the plaintiffs in the California gay marriage case on Wednesday. They were in the middle of a live television interview when the voice of the president was delivered, via cellphone, from high over the Atlantic.
But it was also emblematic of the leadership style of this brainy, tightly drawn president: too often, he phones it in from 35,000 feet, far from the sweat, grime and blood of the battlefield of politics. 
This week was historic, as the most activist Supreme Court in at least 40 years continued to rewrite the laws of the land. Under Chief Justice John G. Roberts - who famously said he would rule as an umpire, not a player - the court has done far more to change daily life than the president, or those inert sluggers in Congress.

The gay rights decisions got most of the attention. But in gutting the Voting Rights Act, the court made it easier for states to put up racial and class barriers to the most basic American right. And continuing its lopsided defense of business interests, the court made it much more difficult to win a sexual harassment case. They narrowed the definition of boss, the harasser, to someone who can hire and fire. And the person who sets the work schedule or assigns the task - just another colleague!
Looming large, as ever, is the 2010 decision allowing corporations to spend limitless amounts of money to influence elections. They can do it now in newly redrawn, gerrymandered districts designed to hold back the inevitable.
In contrast to all this life-changing, work-defining, election-shaping Big Stuff, President Obama continues to give limp speeches and moan about how he can't get anything done with a Congress of Neanderthals and talk-radio spawn. An activist court, a passive president and a feeble Congress - such is the current balance of power.
Obama gave a speech in Northern Ireland last week that could have been one for the ages, perhaps tying his own Irish and African-American heritage to a world shaped by the polyglot politics of the future. Instead, he joked about his eighth cousin, Henry - "also known as Henry the Eighth." Haha. Then he stewed with Vladimir Putin in a painful press op.
On Tuesday of this week, the African-American who would likely not be president without the Voting Rights Act gave a muted shrug to the seismic wave from the court, limply saying that he was "calling on Congress to pass legislation." That's worked so well for him in the past.
The same day, Obama unveiled his proposals to fight climate change. Despite the heat and humidity of the day - optics to go with atmospherics - Obama seemed more dutiful than alarmed. He broke a sweat, barely, in calling for emissions controls over the worst belchers of CO2. It was a good start. But he seemed to lay out the groundwork for approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline, setting a standard with enough wiggle room in favor of the tar sands oil delivery system. To say the obvious: the speech will not join the words of Thoreau or Leopold in Earth Day tributes.
On Thursday, while visiting the slave-sorting house on an island off Senegal, Obama uttered mush when he could have soared. "Obviously," he said, "for an African-American president to be able to visit this site, I think, gives me even greater motivation in terms of human rights around the world."
Another president was at the same site not so long ago. "At this place, life and liberty were stolen and sold, human beings were delivered and sorted," he said. And in America, "enslaved Africans heard the ringing promise of the Declaration of Independence and asked the self-evident question, then why not me?" That was George W. Bush, and it was one of his best speeches.
At home, the president continues to get his clock cleaned on the brutal sequestration cuts, a result of his pact with the aforementioned mindless Congress. Obama did not have enough muscle to marshal through something favored by 90 percent of the American people - background checks to keep criminals and crazy people from getting guns.
He's allowed himself to get boxed in by lawmakers who refuse to make laws, who spend their official days on phony scandals. It came out this week that the Internal Revenue Service flagged "progressive" groups seeking tax-free status, just as they went after conservative political organizations. Oh, so there's no massive White House harassment of political enemies on a scale of Watergate? Not even close. The man steering the congressional witch hunts, Representative Darrell Issa, has lost all credibility. And yet he's been largely unchallenged by the president's forces.
Issa is typical of Obama's opponents; they are laughable, unserious people. Consider Mike Huckabee, who still has enough followers that he could credibly run for the Republican presidential nomination. His reaction to this week's rulings on gay marriage: "Jesus wept." John Boehner? Give the speaker of the House a smoke and another glass of merlot. Senator Ted Cruz? Almost anything he says is enough to make Jesus weep.
Obama's policies - on immigration, marriage equality, tax fairness, guns - are sound and have majority support. His opponents are holding back history, and the will of the people. If Obama gets immigration reform (doubtful, with House intransigence), he will have a terrific legacy, along with health care and saving the American economy from a recession that still cuts deep in Europe.
It's the way he runs the executive branch, his fear of taking the fight to Republicans, that is so maddening. Several governors now are trying to withhold expanded federal health care for the poor, just to spite Obama. He ought to be in those states, calling out the governors who are actively trying to hurt the governed.
Instead, he's defensive, forced to defend his presidency as still being alive and well. Obama doesn't have to be Lyndon B. Johnson, twisting elbows to shape history. But maybe he can hire an L.B.J. Leaders find a way.
Out of nowhere (actually, Texas), this week came the mesmerizing spectacle of an underdog legislator, Wendy Davis, standing up to the bullies who run her state. "Something special is happening in Austin tonight," Obama said, by way of his bloodless, official Twitter account on the night of her filibuster. At least he noticed. Now he can he follow the example.

HEADLINE: Quants Ask: What Crisis in the Humanities?

BYLINE: JENNIFER SCHUESSLER


HIGHLIGHT: Two recent reports have prompted handwringing over the low percentage of college students majoring in humanities. But some commentators look at the statistics and ask, is there really a problem? 

 BODY:
Two recent reports on the beleaguered state of the humanities have had pundits of all stripes scrambling to explain what many see as a dismal statistic: the proportion of college students graduating with degrees in subjects like English or history has fallen to a mere 7 percent in 2010, down from 14 percent in 1966.
Is the state of the economy to blame? The obsession with the so-called STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, math)? The anti-humanities rhetoric of right-wing politicians? The ideological excesses of left-wing professors? 
Now one number-crunching historian has pointed the finger in an unexpected direction: women.
At the blog Sapping Attention, Ben Schmidt, a doctoral candidate in history at Princeton University, notes that between 1950 and 2002, the percentage of male college students who major in the humanities nationally remained steady at roughly 7 percent. The percentage of female college students majoring in the humanities, however, fell dramatically, to 9 percent from 15 percent.
To Mr. Schmidt, this gives the lie to the idea, advanced in a recent Op-Ed column by David Brooks of the New York Times, that the humanities "committed suicide" by focusing on "class, race and gender" at the expense of eternal questions. Instead, he suggests (tongue in cheek), they may have been murdered by egalitarians who made other fields more welcoming to women.
Some women may have shifted to the sciences. But the biggest change, according to charts Mr. Schmidt made a few years ago as part of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences Humanities Indicators Project, may be business majors.
"Between 1970 and 1985, women jumped from 10 percent of all business degrees to 50 percent," he wrote in an e-mail. Within the liberal arts, he added, the biggest shift was to the social sciences and what survey data nebulously referred to as "interdisciplinary liberal arts."
Mr. Schmidt's gender analysis is only the latest quantitative assault on the "crisis in the humanities" story that has taken hold since the release of the two reports, produced by the American Academy of Arts and Sciencesand by Harvard University.
In a post earlier this month, Mr. Schmidt, who is completing a fellowship at Harvard's"Culturomics" project, which aims to study human culture quantitatively, noted that the big plunge in humanities majors in fact came in the 1970s, following an anomalous boom in the 1960s. (The past decade, contrary to popular perception, has not seen large declines.)
Nate Silver of The New York Times blog FiveThirtyEight has also weighed in. The panic over the seemingly dismal number of humanities majors, he says in a recent post, has omitted one crucial fact: far more
Americans are attending college than ever before.
The crucial statistic, he says, is not the percentage of college graduates who receive humanities degrees, but the percentage of the entire college-age population who earn such degrees.
The number of college graduates, he says, is much higher than in 1971, when there were 26.7 bachelor's degrees granted for every hundred 21-year-olds in America. By 2011, that number had risen to 43.4, an increase of about 60 percent.
True, the distribution of degrees has shifted from English and history toward more obviously job-friendly fields like marketing, health care administration and criminal justice. "But these degrees may be going to students who would not have gone to college at all in prior generations," he writes.
Even English - named the seventh most useless major last year by Newsweek - may not be in such bad shape, Mr. Silver says, or at least not any worse shape than before. The overall percentage of the college-age population receiving English degrees - roughly 1.1 percent of all 21-year olds in America - is roughly the same as it was 20 years ago, he notes.
Mr. Silver sees a similar pattern in many of the STEM fields, which are often presumed to thrive at the expense of the humanities. The fields that do see big increases, both in relative and absolute terms, are ones like hospital administration, criminal justice and business, which feed students into jobs that might not have required a college degree at all 20 or 30 years ago.
The real question, Mr. Silver maintains, is not how many students major in the humanities, but how much of a humanities education nonmajors receive.
"Perhaps we should at once encourage and require college students to take coursework in English - and tell them to be wary about majoring in it," he writes.
But is an English degree really such a bad investment? At The Atlantic, Jordan Weissman cites a 2011 study from Georgetown University's Center on Education and the Workforce showing that in 2010-2011, recent graduates with degrees in English and history had unemployment rates of 9.8 percent and 9.5 percent, respectively - nearly on par with graduates in computer and math fields (9.1 percent) or psychology and social work (8.8 percent), and ahead of economics majors (10.4 percent) and political science majors (11.1 percent).
"Score one for the lit nerds," Mr. Weissman writes.

HEADLINE: The Case for Women

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: More power for women is inevitable, and a very good thing, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Simon Johnson, former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is the Ronald A. Kurtz Professor of Entrepreneurship at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management and co-author of "White House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters to You." 
The joke among insiders is that the initials of the International Monetary Fund actually stand for "it's mostly fiscal," a reference to the predilection of that organization to see all economic issues ultimately in terms of tax and expenditure policy.
In an incisive speech on Monday, Heidi Crebo-Rediker, the chief economist at the United States State Department, challenged the I.M.F. to understand that women are central to the process of economic growth and development - and to place this fact at the center of how it interacts with member countries. (The State Department has posted a full transcript of the speech, which, along with a subsequent discussion, were held at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, where I am a senior fellow; I was not involved in organizing the event). 
By all indications, Ms. Crebo-Rediker will prevail in her discussions with the I.M.F., and this will be a very good thing. A more interesting question is how her points about the rising economic and political power of - and opportunities for - women will play out in the United States.
At the event on Monday, far from pushing back against any of Ms. Crebo-Rediker's suggestions, Minouche Shafik, deputy managing director at the fund, welcomed the approach and emphasized that the I.M.F. had already taken steps in this direction. It makes no sense to bias tax policy against women who work, yet that is what happens in a number of countries as Ms. Shafik emphasized (as an example, see this discussion of what is known as the marriage penalty in the United States). And expenditure policy can also make a big difference - think about parental leave or affordable and high-quality child care. By some estimates (based on Australian data), a 50 percent reduction in the cost of child care can increase the labor supply of young mothers by 6.5 to 10 percent.

Other policies that discourage labor force participation of women should also be assessed in I.M.F. reports, including measures that reflect whether women have full access to all levels of education and whether they can move up to positions of the highest responsibility. Getting more women into jobs is especially important for countries with low growth and aging demographics - among other things, it would help sustain the viability of many pension systems.
Women work hard everywhere. The question is in part whether this work is remunerated and picked up in official gross domestic product statistics. But the bigger issue is whether women have access to all available opportunities.
At the event, Carly Fiorina, former head of Hewlett-Packard and a former Republican senatorial candidate in California, stressed the fundamental injustice behind denying women opportunities. All problems become more manageable, Ms. Fiorina asserted, when women are allowed to exercise their full potential and to become more involved in management - whether this be public health (for which maternal health and education consistently prove crucial), managing savings and investment (e.g., the microcredit movement built around responsible women) and running big global companies (unfortunately, women are still in a small minority on corporate boards in the United States and most other places).
Ms. Crebo-Rediker also has good timing in calling for the I.M.F. to take these issues more seriously. In Japan, the potential importance of increasing women's labor-market participation has been clear for at least 20 years, and this is a prominent goal of the new Abe administration (supported by the I.M.F.). However, progress has been slow.
Similarly, southern Europe could get a great boost from increasing opportunities for women; this would be a smart way to apply the general notion of "structural reform." Caroline Freund, a colleague at the Peterson Institute, pointed out this could also help the troubled economies of North Africa (as the World Bank noted in this 2003 report and in the more recent "Opening Doors: Gender Equality and Development in the Middle East and North Africa").
How does increasing the opportunities for women play politically? Ms. Fiorina offered the most plausible explanation regarding why there is resistance: this is about power. No one likes to give up power, and in some societies the rise of women's rights seems threatening to people (presumably men) who are in entrenched positions. Ms. Fiorina struck a chord with the audience when she asserted that the bigger obstacle is that not enough people are outraged at the lack of full rights for women in many countries.
But this raises a fascinating question for modern American politics. Can Ms. Fiorina or other Republicans persuade more women to support them at the polls?
In the United States context, there has been a gender gap between Democrats and Republicans at least since the 1980s - although others see the origins of this in the 1970s (as Nate Silver did in a 2012 analysis for The New York Times). A survey of attitudes from the Pew Research Center suggests that women and men disagree on some key party-line issues, including how much support the government should provide to older and younger Americans, on whether we do enough to protect the environment and on marriage equality.
While we do not have accurate exit-poll data before 1972, there are strong indications that women have not always voted Democratic. Women got the right to vote at the national level when the 19th Amendment became law in August 1920 (I like this timeline, which points out that many American women had the right to vote before they lost it, at least in some states.)
From the available evidence, it seems clear that women voted for Hoover and Eisenhower more than did men. According to Jo Freeman, "Hoover was so popular that he became known as 'the woman's candidate.'"
After Hoover, there was not much difference in female-male political preferences until 1952, when "polls of voters done before and after that election found women were 5 percent more likely to vote for Eisenhower than were men, though both gave him a majority."
Again, I'm quoting from the Freeman essay, which goes on to say: "Historically, it was the Republican Party that was the party of women's rights, and the Democratic Party that was the home of anti-feminism. After the new feminist movement rose in the 1960s-70s, the parties switched sides."
If Ms. Crebo-Rediker is right, and I think she is, women are already becoming a stronger economic and political force in the United States, with ever more impact domestically and around the world.
The next head of the Federal Reserve may well be a woman - all the indications point to President Obama choosing Janet Yellen, the current vice chairwoman. I'm greatly encouraged by colleagues who contend that the choice of Ms. Yellen will improve monetary policy and make regulatory policy more effective.
Whoever becomes president would do well to pick a woman as secretary of the Treasury. I have long advocated that this position go to Sheila Bair, former head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. She would be most effective on fiscal and banking policy under either a Democratic or a Republican presidency.
In fact, it is quite likely that the next president of the United States will be a woman - perhaps Hillary Clinton, Ms. Crebo-Rediker's former boss, or perhaps someone else. In any case, the next administration will, I hope, promote a larger number of distinguished women to prominent positions of national leadership.
And these women and their colleagues can push on an open door at the I.M.F. - currently headed by a woman, Christine Lagarde. he fund and other organizations should be encouraged to emphasize the importance of female opportunities, representation and participation for economic development around the world.

Museums
Brooklyn Museum: 'LaToya Ruby Frazier: A Haunted Capital' (through Aug. 11) This preternaturally mature body of work by a 31-year-old photographer connects bedrooms and streetscapes, the suffering of loved ones and the afflictions of a ''distressed municipality'' (the state's official term for Ms. Frazier's hometown, Braddock, Pa.). Simultaneously introspective and extroverted, it's composed of arresting black-and-white photographs that sometimes look like studio portraits or social documentaries but aren't fully at home in either category. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg) 
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'John Singer Sargent Watercolors' (through July 28) Sargent fans and watercolor hobbyists will be in heaven with this exhibition's more than 90 watercolors from the first decade of the 20th century, all from the collections of the Brooklyn Museum and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and all representing picturesque scenes in Europe. Sargent pioneered the kind of loosely gestural yet clearly representational watercolor painting that today's popular culture adores. He has his detractors, though, who may profit from re-examining their prejudices in light of this beautiful show. 200 Eastern Parkway, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Gravity and Grace: Monumental Works by El Anatsui' (through Aug. 4) Born in Ghana and long a resident of Nigeria where he maintains a productive studio, El Anatsui has for the past decade been creating spectacularly large, fabric-like sculpture from countless numbers of liquor-bottle caps linked together with twists of copper. The work weaves together ideas about colonialism, politics and economics, and is absolutely gorgeous. The Brooklyn show, which originated at the Akron Art Museum in Ohio, also includes a number of the artist's earlier and now-overlooked carved wood pieces, which are well worth studying. 200 Eastern Parkway, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)
&#x2605; The Cloisters: 'Search for the Unicorn: An Exhibition in Honor of The Cloisters' 75th Anniversary' (through Aug. 18) The lonely subject of the ''Unicorn Tapestries'' is united with others of its species in ''Search for the Unicorn,'' honoring the 75th anniversary of the Cloisters. Drawn from the Met's holdings and from other public and private collections, it includes manuscripts, paintings, decorative objects and ''unicorn horns'' (actually the tapered, spiral-patterned tusks of the narwhal). The show is a gateway to various fantasy worlds, some of them beyond the scope of medieval Western Europe; a page from the ''Shahnama,'' the Persian ''Book of Kings,'' shows the monarch Iskandar (otherwise known as Alexander the Great) fighting off the one-horned, equine Monster of Habash. 99 Margaret Corbin Drive, Fort Tryon Park, Washington Heights, (212) 923-3700, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: 'James Turrell' (through Sept. 25) At once ravishing and hokey, ''Aten Reign,'' the show's centerpiece, turns the museum's famed rotunda into the bliss-out environmental art hit of the summer: an immense, elliptical, nearly hallucinatory play of light and color achieved with elaborate scrims and computerized lighting that might oxymoronically be called a meditative spectacle. Four other installation works from the 1960s and '70s outline the single-minded trajectory of this leading proponent of the Light and Space movement and also provide a simpler, more direct, more mindful experience of, in his words, ''seeing yourself see.'' 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423 3500, guggenheim.org. (Roberta Smith)
&#x2605; International Center of Photography: 'A Different Kind of Order: The ICP Triennial' (through Sept. 22) The fourth, and best, edition of the International Center of Photography's triennial turns out to be that extremely rare thing in New York City these days, an exhibition of contemporary art for adults. The up-to-the-minute emphasis is on the continuing and enveloping impact of digital technology on photography. The results, as seen here, couldn't be more varied and gripping in content. This is a show that's in touch with the big, live, real world out there beyond Frieze New York. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Jewish Museum: 'Jack Goldstein x 10,000' (through Sept. 29) The first American museum retrospective of this brilliant but elusive artist, organized by the Orange County Museum of Art, is both a celebration and a cautionary tale. It revels in Goldstein's posthumous influence as it reveals the tragic disconnect of his life and his art, the desire to disappear complicated by an intense careerist drive. This exhibition offers (in addition to paintings, sculptures and Goldstein's signature films of the late 1970s) a rare look at the early, performance-based films: works like ''Milk,'' in which the persistent banging of a fist on a table finally topples a glass, or ''Spotlight,'' in which a beam chases the artist around an empty room. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Jewish Museum: 'As it were ... So to speak: A Museum Collection in Dialogue With Barbara Bloom' (through Aug. 4) Ms. Bloom, invited to organize a show from elements of the museum's collection, has turned to the Talmud for inspiration. Weaving together real and fictional narratives, historical and literary sources, she creates new and often ambiguous contexts for ceremonial and decorative objects like Torah pointers, Kiddush cups and spice containers. Somehow she manages to quote Nietzsche, Freud, Leonard Cohen, Joan Didion, the Bible and various Wikipedia entries, all without losing her own probing, skeptical voice. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'African Art, New York, and the Avant-Garde' (through Sept. 2) Timed to the centennial of the Armory Show of 1913, this exhibition tells the story of African art's debut in cutting-edge New York museums and galleries with exceptional candor. It makes clear that early-20th-century Americans received Modern art and African art as a single import, derived from French and Belgian colonies, distilled in Paris and presented on these shores by a few tastemaking dealers and collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'At War With the Obvious: Photographs by William Eggleston' (through July 28) In 36 transcendentally beautiful photographs shot in the Mississippi Delta region in the 1970s and early '80s, this pioneer of color photography captured those kinds of sacred moments when something you ordinarily would pass by without a thought -- a children's swing set overgrown by weeds, an abandoned gas station, a basket of fake flowers hanging on someone's front door -- suddenly takes your breath away. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Cambodian Rattan: The Sculptures of Sopheap Pich' (through July 7) Born in Cambodia in 1971, Soheap Pich first came to international attention in 2009 with a series of openwork, basketlike rattan sculptures that looked as light as air, but carried serious ideas in images of half-built cities, viscera, flowers and bombs. His impressive Met show is embedded in the permanent Asian collection. It starts outside the Chinese painting galleries, continues in mezzanine space usually devoted to South Asian material, and concludes in the galleries of Southeast Asian art with a gorgeous suspended Buddha. (An exhibition of new work is on view through June 14 at Tyler Rollins Fine Art, 529 West 20th Street, in Chelsea.) (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Civil War and American Art' (through Sept. 2) If you've seen ''Photography and the American Civil War'' at the Met, you might suppose that viewing another exhibition about the war would be redundant. It's not. With outstanding works by Frederic Edwin Church, Sanford Robinson Gifford and Winslow Homer, this gripping show sheds expansive light on the nation's experience of its own fratricidal conflict. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Photography and the American Civil War' (through Sept. 2) As intellectually fascinating as it is emotionally wrenching, this exhibition is sure to be remembered as one of the great museum photography shows ever. Its more than 200 photographs include expansive images of battlefields and war-ruined towns; wallet-size portraits of soldiers; preciously framed daguerreotypes; political campaign buttons; a doctor's documents of horrifically wounded soldiers; portraits of loved ones in lockets; and a series depicting the hanging of five co-conspirators in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln by the photographer Alexander Gardner. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Ken Price: A Retrospective' (through Sept. 22) Tableware? Toys? Genetic accidents? Objects d'art? The ceramic sculptures of Ken Price suggest all these possibilities. To the market's old, divide-and-label query ''Is this art or craft?,'' Price offered one, finessing answer: ''Yes.'' And right he was. You see the rightness instantly in the Met retrospective, which is one of those ideal shows: perfect size, great design (by Frank Gehry), pretty near faultless art. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. Ideal, too, in a plainer way, is a concurrent survey of the artist's works on paper, ''Ken Price: Slow and Steady Wins the Race,'' running through Aug. 18 at the Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org. (Cotter)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Punk: Chaos to Couture' (through Aug. 14) This entertaining exhibition proves that high fashion rarely looks quite as frivolous and cluelessly 1 percent-ish as when it upgrades aspects of the obstreperous punk sartorial mode, adding gold-plated safety pins, careful rips and holes, and a feigned DIY look that can involve materials like garbage bags or cellophane. Cleverness abounds. A few designers absorb and transform punk attributes, but most garments simplistically scream punk. Not for nothing do they call the show's organizing department the Costume Institute. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Roof Garden Commission: Imran Qureshi' (through Nov. 3) Visitors to the Met's rooftop will discover something shocking: the stone terrace is splattered with paint the color of dried blood so that it resembles the scene of some terrible crime. Looking closer at the areas of spillage, viewers will find they have been delicately altered. With deft white and red brush strokes, the Pakistani artist Imran Qureshi has worked into the raw paint a pattern suggestive of leafy shrubbery and flower petals, turning the whole into a politically fraught, allegorical mix symbolizing dualities of life and death and hope and despair. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Velzquez's Portrait of Duke Francesco I d'Este: A Masterpiece from the Galleria Estense, Modena' (through July 14) This single-painting exhibition highlights a portrait made at a delicate diplomatic moment during the Thirty Years' War; the painting is on loan to the Met in part because the museum that normally houses it, the Galleria Estense in Modena, is repairing damage from a 2012 earthquake in the region. It's a chance to see another commanding Velzquez at this already well-stocked museum, and to appreciate that this artist's politically savvy portraits are more than just tools of statesmanship. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; MoMA PS1: 'Expo 1: New York' (through Sept. 2) A sprawling, multisite extravaganza including a multitude of installations, shows-within-shows and events, ''Expo 1: New York'' offers few answers but raises many provocative questions about the current and future state of our planet's unsettled human and natural ecology. Attractions at PS1 range from a beautiful show of pictures by the beloved nature photographer Ansel Adams to a refrigerated room containing chunks from an Icelandic glacier by Olafur Eliasson. On 53rd Street, next to the Museum of Modern Art, ''Rain Room'' invites viewers into a chamber where steady precipitation ceases wherever bodies are detected by high-tech hardware. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Morgan Library & Museum: 'Subliming Vessel: The Drawings of Matthew Barney' (through Sept. 2) With its Gospels and reliquaries, the Morgan Library is at the right place for the first survey of graphic work by the most medievalizing of American contemporary artists. Encased in thick, pale, plastic frames, Mr. Barney's drawings of the past two decades have the look of precious pages from sacred books displayed on iPads. His images, with their emphasis on redemption through fleshly mortification, suggest sources in heroic epics and penitential religion, filtered through Sade and extreme sports. A display of collage-like storyboards for his films confirms the occult glamour of the personal cosmology he has developed, which feels as artificial and addictive as a video game. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; El Museo del Barrio: 'La Bienal 2013: Here Is Where We Jump' (through Jan. 4) Much of the work by the 37 artists in the seventh edition of El Museo's Bienal is budget-conscious in its materials and modest in size, scaled to small studios. Maybe exactly because of such restrictions, the show is thoughtful and personal, uneven in parts, solid as a whole. It's also a product of that old-fashion thing, the ethnically specific museum. Even with definitions of ethnicity stretched all kinds of ways -- what does ''Latino'' really mean anymore, anyway? -- the issue of identity remains at the core of such institutions, and informs much of the work in this show. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Museum of Arts and Design: 'Against the Grain: Wood in Contemporary Art, Craft and Design' (through Sept. 15) This sixth show in the museum's Materials and Process series is a big improvement on its predecessors, mostly because it feels more artist- and designer-driven. Representing the Chelsea gallery contingent are Alison Elizabeth Taylor, with marquetry installations; Phoebe Washburn and Leonardo Drew, with scrap-wood sculptures; and Roy McMakin, with slyly repurposed found furniture. From the design-fair circuit come functional works like Mark Moskovitz's ''Facecord,'' a sideboard that looks like a stack of firewood when the drawers are closed, and Maarten Baas's knife block in the shape of a head (which seems destined for the MoMA design store). 2 Columbus Circle, Manhattan, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Ellsworth Kelly: Chatham Series' (through Sept. 8) Together again for the first time in 40 years, the 14 two-panel Chatham paintings from 1971 offer giddy instruction in the weights, measures and balances of strong color -- red, blue, green, yellow, black and white. The works -- abutting rectangles that form an inverted L -- seem to expand or contract as you move around the gallery. An adjoining display of 40 small collages from 1951 shows Mr. Kelly laying out some of the stringent abstract vocabulary that he has mined ever since. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Claes Oldenburg: The Street and the Store' and 'Claes Oldenburg: Mouse Museum, Ray Gun Wing' (through Aug. 5) Pop Art is based on two things: ordinariness and eating. It's about daily consumption; the democratic appetite, ravenous for meat, sweets, life on the street, and getting more of everything, cheap. No artist cooked up a tastier version of the primal Pop recipe than Claes Oldenburg did in New York in the late 1950s and early '60s. The art he made in that brief, fecund time is the focus of a two-meals-for-the-price-of-one MoMA feast. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Bill Brandt: Shadow and Light' (through Aug. 12) With nearly 160 works ranging from photographs of London in the 1930s and during World War II to nearly abstract Surrealist nudes from the 1950s and '60s, this impeccable survey makes a strong if slightly over-edited argument for Brandt as one of the founders of modern photography. It sticks to vintage prints and brings a wonderful lucidity to a persistent balance of art and humanity that is, as it is frequently described: strange, mysterious and irresistible. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Performing Histories (1)' (through Aug. 5) An awareness of the uprisings, protests, occupations and revolutions erupting around the globe is present in ''Performing Histories (1),'' a show of video, film and photographic work recently acquired by MoMA. Insurrection and resistance pervade the Romanian artist Ion Grigorescu's film ''Dialogue With Ceausescu'' (1978), while the feminist personal as political is employed in Martha Rosler's ''She Sees in Herself a New Woman Every Day'' (1976) and Sharon Hayes's four-channel video ''The Interpreter Project'' (2001). Andrea Fraser's two videos connect politics and the museum. In one she describes how scientific philanthropy in the 19th century directed wealth to museums and other public institutions rather than the poor, while another video delves into how MoMA itself interacted with revolutionaries and communists, like the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Martha Schwendener)
&#x2605; Neue Galerie: 'Koloman Moser: Designing Modern Vienna 1897-1907' (through Sept. 2) Along with his better known colleague, Josef Hoffmann, Moser co-founded the Wiener Werksttte, the consortium of designers and artisans that produced some of the 20th century's most beautiful objects. Focusing on Moser's most productive years, this gorgeous exhibition presents more than 200 exquisitely elegant works, including books, glassware, metal pieces, ceramics, jewelry and furniture. 1048 Fifth Avenue at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Johnson)
New Museum: 'Adhocracy' (through July 7) The term ''adhocracy'' was coined by the futurologist Alvin Toffler, who predicted that innovative, ad hoc forms of organization would replace more bureaucratically entrenched structures in business and government. This crowded design exhibition presents a variety of self-empowering things that people can make and do for themselves like build their own furniture and bicycles; make new appliances from functional parts of old, broken ones; raise money for bigger projects by means of Kickstarter; and, more problematically, make their own functional handguns using 3-D printers. 231 Bowery, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Johnson)
New Museum: 'Llyn Foulkes' (through Sept. 1) Although poorly organized, this exhibition devoted to a great American original contains several one-of-a-kind masterpieces. Displayed in a small, dark corner room where it glows uncannily, partly by virtue of real lights built into it, ''Pop'' (1985-1991) is a 10-foot-wide marvel of comic magic realism and meticulous craftsmanship. In a homey, wood-paneled living room, the main character, a portrait of the middle-aged artist, sits in a paisley-patterned armchair, staring with bugged-out eyes, evidently driven to catatonic paralysis by what he's seeing on the television. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Rubin Museum of Art: 'Lisa Ross: Living Shrines of Uyghur China' (through July 8) In 2002, traveling in the desert region of far western China, the New York photographer Lisa Ross encountered a variety of wind-battered religious markers, including corral-like fences built around trees and boxlike wooden enclosures swathed in cloth -- all either shrines to Sufi saints and objects of religious pilgrimage or graves of devotees. This beautiful show is a record of Ms. Ross's repeated visits to monuments that were meant to be spiritually functional, formally arresting and fleeting. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Hopper Drawing' (through Oct. 6) With more than 200 drawings, two dozen sketchbook pages and an essential bonus of 21 paintings, this landmark exhibition takes us behind the curtain of stillness that makes Hopper's art so riveting to reveal as never before how he used preparatory studies to synthesize reality, memory and imagination. Some of his greatest paintings -- ''New York Movie,'' ''Nighthawks'' -- and other gems are here. An overview indicates how the young Hopper shaped and toughened his versatile gifts into a singular vision. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)
Galleries: Uptown
&#x2605; 'Gardening by the Book: Celebrating 100 Years of the Garden Club of America' (through July 27) This wonderful show presents more than 125 illustrated tomes about flowers and gardening from four centuries. Loaded with marvels of acute observation and exacting draftsmanship, it begins with Emanuel Sweert's illustrated catalog of more than 500 bulbs and flowers thought to have ignited the Tulipmania craze and ends with first editions of books by the environmentalist Rachel Carson. It is altogether a terrific treat for minds and eyes. Grolier Club, 47 East 60th Street, Manhattan, (212) 838-6690, grolierclub.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Paul McCarthy: 'Life Cast' (through July 26) One of the outstanding shows of the artist's career is best viewed as a single piece. Three fanatically realistic life-size sculptures of naked humans are paired with two video installations that reveal the meticulous casting process behind their ecstatic, mysterious exactitude. The piece is a homage to -- but also perhaps penance for -- Marcel Duchamp's ''tant Donns'' and its obsessive focus on the female sex. Hauser & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, Manhattan, (212) 794-4970, hauserwirth.com. (Smith)
'Salvaging the Past: Georges Hoentschel and French Decorative Arts from The Metropolitan Museum of Art' (through Aug. 11) This sometimes arcane but highly effective assemblage of rare furnishings, artifacts and a smattering of art and printed matter resurrects a once-renowned French interior designer whose collections -- and displays -- of 18th-century French decorative material and Medieval art were purchased en bloc by J. P. Morgan and given to the Met. They formed the nuclei of the museum's holdings in these areas, helped shape its departmental structure and influenced the arrangement of its galleries in numerous ways. Bard Graduate Center: Decorative Arts, Design History, Material Culture, 18 West 86th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3023, bgc.bard.edu. (Smith)
Galleries: Chelsea
Laddie John Dill: 'Elementary' (through July 26) At the end of the 1960s the West Coast Light and Space artist Laddie John Dill began producing electric light works out of blown glass tubes in a lush palette of jewel-bright colors. Here, nine of these works, all from 1971, are installed in one room at regular intervals creating a trippy visual chamber music. Elsewhere, glowing constructions of glass panes in geometric arrangements could be models for updates of Stonehenge, monuments for a new cosmic paganism. Nyehaus, 358 West 20th Street, (212) 366-4493, nyehaus.com. (Johnson)
Jeff Ladouceur: 'Amen' (through July 12) In Mr. Ladouceur's funny, skillfully drawn cartoon world the ego is always in danger of dissolution. The panoramic ''Braided Sea (Flood Walker)'' pictures terrific swirling waves on which a little guy in a monk's robes rides on a small raft at one end. Looking closely you see that the waves have big, stretchy eyes, suggesting the sense of a self carried away by its own stormy feelings. ZieherSmith, 516 West 20th Street, (212) 229-1088, ziehersmith.com. (Johnson)

Jane Alexander: 'Surveys (From the Cape of Good Hope)' (through July 29) The Cathedral of St. John the Divine is an occupied zone this spring, with a transient population of unearthly beings camped out in its chapels and aisles. Neither angels nor devils, though suggesting both, the figures in the sculptural tableaus and related photographs were all created by the South African artist Jane Alexander. And while haunted by her country's history of apartheid, the work has no single meaning, no sum-upable content. Instead, painstakingly calibrated ambiguity leaves this strange and wonderful show open to political speculation and spiritual interpretation. Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, 1047 Amsterdam Avenue, at 112th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 316-7490, stjohndivine.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; 'Alice Aycock Drawings: Some Stories Are Worth Repeating' (through July 13) A Minimalist turned unabashed fantasist, the sculptor Alice Aycock is one of the more visionary figures to have emerged from the New York art scene of the 1970s. Her imagination is especially active on paper, as seen in this two-part show at the Grey Art Gallery and the Parrish Art Museum in Water Mill, N.Y. It's best to begin at the Grey, where diagrams and maquettes conjure Duchamp-esque machines and proposals for ''non-functional architecture'' -- for instance, the medievalesque ''City of the Walls'' -- are accompanied by free-associative film treatments. At the Parrish, earlier renderings of fantastical machines and architecture give way to games: elaborate, multicolored drawings based on tantric diagrams, ancient illuminated manuscripts and 19th-century British game boards, among other sources. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart. Parrish Art Museum, 279 Montauk Highway, Water Mill, N.Y., (631) 283-2118, parrishart.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Simon Dinnerstein: 'The Fulbright Triptych' (ongoing) This little-known masterpiece of 1970s realism was begun by the young Simon Dinnerstein during a Fulbright fellowship in Germany in 1971 and completed in his hometown, Brooklyn, three years later. Incorporating carefully rendered art postcards, children's drawings and personal memorabilia; a formidable worktable laid out with printmaking tools and outdoor views; and the artist and his family, it synthesizes portrait, still life, interior and landscape and rummages through visual culture while sampling a dazzling range of textures and representational styles. It should be seen by anyone interested in the history of recent art and its oversights. German Consulate General, 871 United Nations Plaza, First Avenue, at 49th Street, (212) 610-9700, germany.info.

&#x2605; Smithsonian American Art Museum: 'Nam June Paik: Global Visionary' (through Aug. 11) Including a large and fascinating trove of material from the Nam June Paik archive, acquired by the Smithsonian from the artist's estate in 2009, this survey of the avant-garde musician, multimedia wizard and video art pioneer (1932-2006) looks startlingly current despite the preponderance of analog televisions and other obsolete hardware. It makes clear that contemporary artists like Christian Marclay, Jon Kessler, Cory Arcangel, Ryan Trecartin and Haroon Mirza owe a great deal to Mr. Paik's tweaked TV sets and frenetic, technically innovative videos.

Last Chance
&#x2605; 'Mel Bochner: Proposition and Process: A Theory of Sculpture (1968-1973)' (closes on Saturday) This beautiful exhibition is a veritable time capsule. It shows the artist's pioneering Conceptual works in a setting redolent of the early artist-oriented, pre-retail era of SoHo -- which is when they were made. Defiantly modest, they parse Minimalist space, measuring it openly with non-Minimalist objects (small stones, walnuts, burned matches) often annotated with writing or drawing in chalk, repeatedly locating the place where language, counting and dimensional experience overlap, to the confusion and excitement of eye and mind.

'Ellsworth Kelly at Ninety' (closes on Saturday) An impressive three-part display of new work (mostly from 2012) reveals a seasoned artist who is doing some of his boldest work. Some introduce new forms (but are actually derived from his early collages). Others expand on more recent works with changes in material and color. Keep an eye out for ''Black Form II,'' ''Yellow Relief Over Blue,'' ''Gold With Orange Reliefs'' and the four-panel ''Curves on White.''

&#x2605; Ralph Fasanella: 'A More Perfect Union' (closes on Saturday) If Fasanella (1914-97) had been a trained painter, his political beliefs might have resulted in predictable Social Realist paintings. Instead, this child of the working-class Bronx largely taught himself and evolved an altogether sharper and more original manner, politically and pictorially. This fantastic little five-decade survey summarizes his development and his ability to weave history, architecture and layered social criticism into remarkable tapestry-like compositions that teem with human activity good and bad, homey details and a spectrum of glowing colors.

Dan Fischer: '1000 Horsepower Heart' (closes on Saturday) Combining aspects of Giorgio Morandi's intimate focus and Myron Stout's small abstract drawings with his own brand of Photorealist-appropriation, Dan Fischer continues to make small, exacting, labor-intensive graphite copies of well-known photographs of famous artists and artworks. Subjects here include portraits of Georgia O'Keeffe, Gerhard Richter, Roy Lichtenstein and Picasso's painting ''Guernica,'' as well as works by Brancusi, Bruce Nauman and Sherrie Levine. Each drawing is a feat of representation and an act of homage that converts the infinitely reproduced into something discernible only with the naked eye.

Jeff Koons: 'Gazing Ball' (closes on Saturday) In his latest series, the artist everyone loves to hate could be said to revisit his ''Banality'' series of the late 1980s. He appropriates blazing white plaster casts of well-known Greco-Roman sculptures -- the ''Farnese Hercules,'' ''Sleeping Satyr (Barberini Faun)'' and ''Belvedere Torso'' -- and accents each with a blue mirrored ball of the yard-ornament variety to add irony and visual pizazz. Fighting clich with clich, they are neither especially good or bad, just average Koons. David Zwirner, 525 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2070, davidzwirner.com. (Smith)
Jeff Koons: 'New Paintings and Sculptures' (closes on Wednesday) Hastily assembled as a retort to Mr. Koons's ''Gazing Ball'' exhibition now at David Zwirner, this exhibition reveals the artist to be both highly productive and uneven. His Photo Realist paintings are uniformly lifeless. The best works are a magenta stainless steel balloon sculpture inspired by the Venus of Willendorf and an inflatable gorilla, rendered in a dark material that resembles plastic or bronze but is actually polished granite. Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-1111, gagosian.com. (Smith)
'Nancy Lorenz: New Work' (closes on Saturday) Operating in the gap between painting and the decorative arts, Ms. Lorenz's latest efforts add to the history of modernist abstraction by way of seemingly gestural marks and lines fashioned from mother-of-pearl inlaid in surfaces of silver, white gold or palladium. It makes for a striking specificity. Her compositions are based on drawings of various weather conditions off the coast of Ireland, and are most convincing when seas are becalmed, and the marks meander, least when Turneresque storms of slashing lines prevail. Morgan Lehman, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 268-6699, morganlehmangallery.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; Laurel Nakadate: 'Strangers and Relations' (closes on Saturday) As indicated, the solitary people in these large color photographs are either strangers or (very distant) relatives. All agreed to pose, standing in the middle of nowhere at night, illuminated only by stars, moon and a flashlight wielded by the artist. This subtly comedic DIY approach emphasizes the trust between photographer and subject, and viewers' tendency to focus on faces. The isolation and darkness envelops all of these in Ms. Nakadate's ongoing exploration of intimacy. A deep, wonderful show. Leslie Tonkonow Artworks + Projects, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-8540, tonkonow.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; 'Not Over: 25 Years of Visual AIDS' (closes on Sunday) On its quarter-century anniversary, Visual AIDS has organized a constellation of exhibitions, events and performances, the centerpiece being ''Not Over: 25 Years of Visual AIDS.'' The show has two basic messages: that the AIDS plague continues in the present, and that the loss to art is incalculable. International statistics confirm the first story; this bracing show of artists confirms the second. Although its subject is disaster, the art chosen by Kris Nuzzi and Sur Rodney (Sur) is alive and well. La MaMa Galleria, 6 East First Street, East Village, (212) 505-2476, lamama.org/lagalleria. (Cotter)
Marc Quinn: 'All the Time in the World' (closes on Saturday) Four much enlarged, bronze sculptures of seashells made by high-tech 3-D replication seem, at first, like pointless baubles for rich collectors. But they reveal an unexpected inner beauty both literal and metaphorical, as their polished interiors cause their interiors to warmly glow as if supernaturally illuminated from within. Implicitly vaginal, these seeming products of phallic ambition become objects of oceanic, feminine mystery. Mary Boone, 541 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 752-2929, maryboonegallery.com. (Johnson)

HEADLINE: A Nation Of Mutts

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Over the past few decades, American society has been transformed in a fit of absence of mind. First, we've gone from a low immigrant nation to a high immigrant nation. If you grew up between 1950 and 1985, you grew up at a time when only about 5 percent or 6 percent of American residents were foreign born. Today, roughly 13 percent of American residents are foreign born, and we're possibly heading to 15 percent.
Moreover, up until now, America was primarily an outpost of European civilization. Between 1830 and 1880, 80 percent of the immigrants came from Northern and Western Europe. Over the following decades, the bulk came from Southern and Central Europe. In 1960, 75 percent of the foreign-born population came from Europe, with European ideas and European heritage. 
Soon, we will no longer be an outpost of Europe, but a nation of mutts, a nation with hundreds of fluid ethnicities from around the world, intermarrying and intermingling. Americans of European descent are already a minority among 5-year-olds. European-Americans will be a minority over all in 30 years at the latest, and probably sooner.
If enacted, the immigration reform bill would accelerate these trends. It would further increase immigration levels. According to the Census Bureau, roughly 20 million immigrants will come to this country under current law. The Congressional Budget Office expects another 16 million under the new provisions.
It would boost the rise of non-Europeans. Immigration would be more global. Hispanics are now projected to make up 30 percent of the U.S. population by 2050. We would hit that mark sooner with reform.
In other words, immigration reform won't transform America. It will just speed up the arrival of a New America that is already guaranteed.
As we stand on the cusp of this New America, it's understandable to feel some anxiety. If you take sociology and culture seriously, it's sensible to wonder whether this is the sort of country we want to be. Can we absorb this many immigrants without changing something fundamental?
Let's make some educated guesses about what the New America will look like. It will almost certainly be economically dynamic. Immigration boosts economic dynamism, and more immigration would boost it more. There would also be a lot of upward striving. Immigrant groups tend to work harder than native groups. They save more. They start business at higher rates than natives.
My colleague Anne Snyder delineates several possible changes to the social fabric. Basically we are witnessing the end of the old ethnic-racial order. Traditionally, mainstream America has been defined by the big block of whites, while other big blocks -- blacks, Hispanics, Asians -- occupied different places on the hierarchy.
Soon there will be no dominant block, just complex networks of fluid streams -- Vietnamese, Bengalis, Kazakhs. It's a bit like the end of the cold war when bipolar thinking had to give way to a radically multipolar mind-set.
Because high immigration is taking place at a time of unprecedentedly low ethnic hostility, we're seeing high rates of intermarriage. This creates large numbers of hybrid individuals, biracial or triracial people with names like Enrique Cohen-Chan. These people transcend existing categories and soften the social boundaries between groups.
This won't lead to a bland mlange America but probably a move to ethnic re-orthodoxy. As Alvaro Vargas Llosa points out in his book, ''Global Crossings,'' the typical pattern is that the more third-generation people assimilate, the more they also value their ethnic roots. We could soon see people with completely unaccented English joining Chinese-American Federations and Honduran-American Support Networks.
The big divides could be along educational lines, not ethnic ones. Because educated people intermarry at higher rates, we could have an educated cosmopolitan class with low ethnic boundaries and a fair bit of integration in white-collar workplaces. Then, underneath, there could be a less-educated, more-balkanized layer, with high residential and professional segregation and more ethnic hostility.
We could also see more ethnic jostling between groups. The most interesting and problematic flashpoint may be between immigrants and African-Americans. We now have this bogus category, ''minority,'' in which we lump the supposed rainbow coalition of immigrants and blacks. But, in fact, tensions between ''minority'' groups could soon be more plainly obvious than any solidarity.
Finally, it would make sense that the religion of diversity, which dominates the ethos of our schools, would give way to an ethos of civic cohesion. We won't have to celebrate diversity because it will be a fact. The problem will be finding the 21st-century thing that binds the fluid network of ethnic cells.
On the whole, this future is exciting. The challenge will be to create a global civilization that is, at the same time, distinctly American. Immigration reform or not, the nation of mutts is coming.

HEADLINE: China and South Korea Reaffirm Efforts Aimed at North

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN; Bree Feng contributed reporting from Beijing, and Rick Gladstone from New York.

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- The leaders of China and South Korea agreed at a summit meeting in Beijing on Thursday to work together to resume six-nation talks aimed at ending North Korea's nuclear weapons programs, calling them a ''serious threat'' to stability in East Asia.
A joint statement issued after the meeting between the leaders, President Xi Jinping of China and President Park Geun-hye of South Korea, also said they had agreed on the importance of faithfully carrying out United Nations Security Council resolutions that called for sanctions against North Korea, as well as a multilateral agreement in 2005 under which the North was obliged to give up its nuclear weapons programs in return for economic and diplomatic benefits. 
Although South Korea and China have separately declared their opposition to North Korea's nuclear weapons programs many times, their leaders speaking in one voice at a rare joint press appearance carried diplomatic symbolism: South Korea is the North's archrival, while China is its biggest ally. ''Both sides confirmed that denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and keeping peace and stability there were in their common interest, and they agreed to make joint efforts to that end,'' the statement said.
Although the statement said Ms. Park and Mr. Xi agreed to take ''active efforts to create positive circumstances for the resumption of the six-party talks,'' it did not divulge any details.
''We hope all sides seize this opportunity and work together to return to the six-party talks at an early date,'' Mr. Xi said during his meeting with Ms. Park, according to a statement from the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
For her part, Ms. Park said she and Mr. Xi agreed that the North's possession of nuclear weapons could not be tolerated ''under any circumstances.''
The six-nation talks, of which China is the host, have been stalled since 2008. North Korea has since conducted its second and third nuclear tests and launched long-range rockets that were seen as a cover for testing technology for intercontinental ballistic missiles. Besides China and South Korea, the nations involved in the talks are the United States, North Korea, Japan and Russia.
Although China endorsed United Nations sanctions against North Korea after its recent nuclear tests, it has championed the talks as a key effort to end the North Korean nuclear crisis. In contrast, South Korea and the United States, its ally, have grown increasingly reluctant to engage North Korea with yet another round of negotiations unless the North shows signs that it is serious about giving up its nuclear weapons.
Both have said they opposed ''talks for talks' sake'' with North Korea. Attempts to restart government dialogue between North and South Korea collapsed in mutual recriminations this month, and their relations remain chilly.
Ms. Park arrived in Beijing on Thursday for a four-day visit that included her first formal meetings with Mr. Xi and Prime Minister Li Keqiang since she was elected in December. She has vowed to enlist China's help in her drive to end North Korea's nuclear programs and its provocative behavior.
Although China is North Korea's biggest source of diplomatic and economic support, their trade is a fraction of the mutual trade between China and South Korea. Beijing has shown signs of frustration with its longstanding Communist ally in Pyongyang, especially after the North's long-range rocket launching in December and its third nuclear test in February.
It has since supported tightening United Nations sanctions, cracked down on North Korean banking activity and pressed Pyongyang to agree to return to disarmament talks when its envoy visited Beijing last month. Kim Kye-gwan, North Korea's veteran negotiator on nuclear issues, told Zhang Yesui, the Chinese vice foreign minister, during discussions last week that it was ready to join any form of meeting, including the stalled six-party talks, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
The friendly meeting between the Chinese and South Korean leaders came as the United States escalated its sanctions on North Korea, blacklisting Daedong Credit Bank, a related company and a North Korean nuclear research official. The action, announced by the Treasury Department, was part of what it called ''our ongoing efforts to disrupt North Korean financial networks supporting the regime's illicit ballistic missile and weapons of mass destruction programs and proliferation activities.''
Under the American sanctions, dealings with blacklisted entities and individuals are prohibited, and any assets they may have under American jurisdiction can be seized.
David S. Cohen, the Treasury under secretary in charge of American financial sanctions, said the timing of the action was purely coincidental to the meeting in Beijing. ''We are committed to increasing the sanctions pressure on North Korea until it complies with its international obligations,'' he told reporters in a telephone news conference.
The United States has been far more aggressive than China in its financial sanctions on North Korea. But doubts remain that Beijing will apply the kind of economic pressure against North Korea that Washington and Seoul want. A common view among regional analysts is that although it is unhappy with the North's nuclear ambition, Beijing will keep the North as a buffer against the United States and South Korea, rather than pushing the North Korean government too hard and risking instability on its border.
Ms. Park is scheduled to continue her discussions with senior Chinese leaders on Friday, meeting with Mr. Li and Zhang Dejiang, leader of China's legislature and a graduate of Kim Il-sung University in North Korea. She is also scheduled to deliver a speech at least partly in Chinese to students at Tsinghua University in Beijing this week.
Ms. Park also plans to become the first South Korean president to visit the city of Xi'an, in Mr. Xi's home province, Shaanxi, where many South Korean companies have invested.

HEADLINE: Pentagon Is Updating Conflict Rules In Cyberspace

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon is updating its classified rules for warfare in cyberspace for the first time in seven years, an acknowledgment of the growing threat posed by computer-network attacks -- and the need for the United States to improve its defenses and increase the nimbleness of its response, the nation's top military officer said Thursday.
The officer, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also said that, globally, new regulations were needed to govern actions by the world community in cyberspace. He said that the Chinese did not believe that hacking American systems violated any rules, since no rules existed. 
Discussing efforts to improve the Pentagon's tools for digital defense and offense, General Dempsey said the military must be ''able to operate at network speed, rather than what I call swivel-chair speed.''
''Cyber has escalated from an issue of moderate concern to one of the most serious threats to our national security,'' he said. ''We now live in a world of weaponized bits and bytes, where an entire country can be disrupted by the click of mouse.''
Under a presidential directive, the Pentagon developed ''emergency procedures to guide our response to imminent, significant cyberthreats,'' and is ''updating our rules of engagement -- the first update for cyber in seven years,'' he said. This effort has resulted in the creation of what General Dempsey called an interagency ''playbook for cyber.''
During a speech at the Brookings Institution, a policy research center, General Dempsey said these new ''standing rules of engagement'' for military actions remained in draft form, and had not yet been approved.
In his first major address on the new, virtual domain of computer warfare, General Dempsey gave an outline of what a significant attack might look like, and how the United States might respond.
If the nation's critical infrastructure came under attack from poisonous code over a computer network from overseas, the first effort would be gathering information on the malware and the systems under attack. Network defenses would be in place, as ''our first instinct will be to pull up the drawbridge and prevent the attack, that is to say, block or defend,'' he said.
If the attack could not be repulsed, the new playbook calls for ''active defense,'' which General Dempsey defined as a ''proportional'' effort ''to go out and disable the particular botnet that was attacking us.'' It is notable that, in this situation, the line between active defense and offense might be blurry.
''If it became something more widespread and we needed to do something beyond that, it would require interagency consultation and authorities at a higher level in order to do it,'' he said. Although these plans are classified, his statement indicated that the rules for responding in an escalated manner in cyberspace, or with a conventional retaliation, would require decisions by the civilian leadership.
General Dempsey's speech drew a clear distinction between the nation's two major efforts in cyberspace. The military's role is in defending computer networks and, if so ordered by the president, carrying out offensive attacks. That is related to, but separate from, the intelligence community's efforts to gather intelligence in cyberspace. Several of those highly classified intelligence-gathering programs were exposed via leaks from a former contract worker for the National Security Agency.
Assessing adversaries in cyberspace, General Dempsey said that China, in particular, had chosen a niche in stealing intellectual property. ''Their view is that there are no rules of the road in cyber,'' General Dempsey noted. He said American and Chinese officials would meet over coming days to discuss ways to ''to establish some rules of the road, so that we don't have these friction points in our relationship.''
The military headquarters responsible for computer-network warfare, the United States Cyber Command, will grow by 4,000 personnel with an additional investment of $23 billion, General Dempsey said. (Cyber Command and the National Security Agency are led by the same officer, Gen. Keith B. Alexander.)
''We are doing all of this not to address run-of-the mill cyberintrusions, but to stop attacks of significant consequence -- those that threaten life, limb and the country's core economic functioning,'' General Dempsey said.

HEADLINE: For Gay Immigrants, Marriage Ruling Brings Relief and a Path to a Green Card

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court's decision on Wednesday to strike down the federal law against same-sex marriage brought a stunning improvement in the lives of Steven Infante, an immigrant from Colombia, and his American husband -- less than an hour after the ruling was announced.
Mr. Infante and his spouse, Sean Brooks, were on their way to an immigration court in Manhattan where Mr. Infante would face what might have been his last hearing before he would be deported from the United States. 
But just before they arrived, the couple's lawyers heard the news from the Supreme Court.
''I thought it must be good news, because they were screaming like a soccer game, 'We won 5 to 4,' '' Mr. Infante said, referring to the justices' tally in ruling that the law, the Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA, was unconstitutional. Instead of ordering Mr. Infante's expulsion, the immigration judge examined the decision and cleared the way for him to remain in this country with his husband as long as he wanted, as a legal permanent resident.
For gay Americans married to foreigners, the impact of the federal marriage act had been severe, leaving many living in fear that they could be separated from their spouses. After the Supreme Court invalidated the law, the change for many couples promises to be significant and swift.
For most American citizens, it is relatively easy to obtain a permanent resident visa, known as a green card, for a foreign-born spouse. But because of DOMA, tens of thousands of citizens in binational same-sex marriages had not been able to apply for green cards for their partners. The immigrants ran out of options to remain here legally. Over the years, many couples chose exile, moving to countries that offered residency to same-sex couples.
But with DOMA out of the way, lawyers said, no large obstacles remain in immigration law to prevent American citizens, and also immigrants who are already legal permanent residents, from starting to apply for green cards for their same-sex spouses.
To make that clear, Janet Napolitano, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, confirmed on Wednesday that her department would move quickly to adapt. ''Working with our federal partners, including the Department of Justice, we will implement today's decision so that all married couples will be treated equally and fairly in the administration of our immigration laws,'' she said.
Lavi Soloway, an immigration lawyer who has represented many same-sex binational couples, including Mr. Infante and Mr. Brooks, said, ''There will be immediate tangible effects on the lives of lesbian and gay couples who have been struggling for a very long time.''
Mr. Infante and Mr. Brooks were among the first couples to see results of the DOMA decision. Mr. Infante, 34, had been living in the United States since 1999, and he met Mr. Brooks, now 46, almost a decade ago. They married in New York in 2011, one month after marriage became legal in the state. By then, Mr. Infante's visa had expired, and immigration authorities denied his petitions to regain his legal status and placed him in deportation proceedings.
For Mr. Brooks, a musician, ''the end of the line was clearly in sight'' for the couple's life in this country as they headed to immigration court. After their turn of fortune, Mr. Brooks was almost speechless. ''The relief,'' he said, ''and the hopefulness.''
Many other Americans have already applied for green cards for same-sex spouses, and their applications were moving slowly through the bureaucracy while Obama administration officials waited to see what the Supreme Court would do.
Mr. Soloway said that his office has 70 active applications for green cards for immigrants in same-sex marriages and that he expected to present dozens more in coming days. Immigration officials assured him on Wednesday that those applications would move toward approval if they were otherwise in order, he said.
Mr. Soloway said he would also seek to close deportations of gay immigrants married to Americans. As a matter of policy, the Obama administration has not been carrying out deportations of immigrants in same-sex couples during the past two years, but the removal orders remained open.
Beyond its immediate effects, the Supreme Court's decision eliminated prohibitions against gay immigrants that have lingered in American immigration law since 1952. A law that year prohibited any openly gay foreigners from coming to live in the United States on the grounds that they were afflicted with a ''psychopathic personality.''
''In the 1950s, Congress said if you are gay you are not good enough to be an American,'' said Rachel B. Tiven, executive director of Immigration Equality, a legal group that represents gay immigrants. ''We are finally bringing 60 years of discrimination to a close.''
But for Brandon Perlberg, a gay American lawyer living in London, the court's decision evoked more complicated feelings. His partner, Benn Storey, is British. The couple met and lived together in New York, Mr. Perlberg's home. But last year they moved to London because Mr. Storey's visa was expiring. After the move, Mr. Perlberg was unemployed for nearly a year; he spent most of his savings. While his first emotion Wednesday was elation, he and Mr. Storey face difficult choices about whether to uproot again to return to the United States.
''My life isn't coming back to me,'' Mr. Perlberg said. ''Someone else is living in my home in New York; my job isn't coming back to me.''
At least, he said, ''This gives us the choice, and there is a lot of respect in having a choice.''

HEADLINE: Consumer Spending Rises, And Home Sales Are Up

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Americans spent more in May as their income rose, encouraging signs after a slow start to the year. 
The Commerce Department said on Thursday that consumer spending rose 0.3 percent last month, nearly erasing a decline of similar size in April. Income rose 0.5 percent.
Consumers, benefiting from low inflation, spent more at retail businesses in May, notably for cars, home improvements and sporting goods.
The number of people who signed contracts to buy homes in the United States jumped in May to the highest level in more than six years, a sign home sales will probably rise in the months ahead.
The National Association of Realtors said on Thursday that its seasonally adjusted index for pending home sales rose 6.7 percent, to 112.3, last month, the highest level since December 2006. Signed contracts have risen 12.1 percent in the last 12 months.
The increase could reflect an effort by potential buyers to complete deals before mortgage rates rise further. Mortgage rates rose in May and then jumped after the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, suggested last week that the Fed could slow its bond purchases later this year.
The increase points to healthy gains in home sales in the coming months. There is generally a one- to two-month lag between a signed contract and a completed sale.
The average rate on a 30-year mortgage soared this week to 4.46 percent, the highest in nearly two years.

HEADLINE: Fed Officials Try To Ease Concern Of Stimulus End

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM; Nathaniel Popper contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The economy is the victim of a little misunderstanding, Federal Reserve officials said on Thursday, telling investors who have sent borrowing costs soaring that they are misguided in believing the Fed's stimulus campaign is about to wane.
The message, delivered in three separate but similar speeches, reflects the Fed's frustration with a broad rise in interest rates that began in May and accelerated after remarks last week by the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke.
''I don't want to be too cute about a serious matter,'' Dennis P. Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said in Marietta, Ga., ''but to make an analogy, it seems to me the chairman said we'll use the patch -- and use it flexibly -- and some in the markets reacted as if he said 'cold turkey.' ''
The speeches, including one by William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and one of Mr. Bernanke's closest allies, appeared to make an impression, helped along by upbeat domestic economic data and an easing of concerns about Chinese financial conditions. Stocks rose modestly, ending up for the third day in a row, while interest rates ticked downward, inverting the recent pattern. 
On Wall Street, the broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had risen for most of the first five months of the year, bringing it to a high of 1,669.16 on May 21. But the next day, after Mr. Bernanke first hinted at an impending change in Fed policy, stock prices began falling, and the S.& P. 500 eventually dropped 5.7 percent to a low on June 24, a few days after the most recent Fed policy statement. Since then, as Fed officials have sought to clarify their goals, the index has risen 2.5 percent, including Thursday's 0.6 percent increase.
On Thursday, the three officials emphasized that the Fed was increasingly optimistic about the durability of economic growth. And they reiterated that they expected to reduce the volume of the Fed's monthly bond purchases later this year. But the Fed's overall effort to reduce borrowing costs will continue as long as necessary, most likely for years to come.
Investors, they said, need to gently place interest rates back down on the floor.
''Market adjustments since May have been larger than would be justified by any reasonable reassessment of the path of policy,'' said the Fed governor Jerome H. Powell.
Mr. Dudley, who is also the vice chairman of the Fed's policy-making committee, was even more emphatic. Investors expecting an early exit are ''quite out of sync'' with the Fed, he said. ''A rise in short-term rates is very likely to be a long way off.''
The Fed is struggling in a world of its own creation. The central bank, seeking new ways to stimulate the economy, has sought to manage investor expectations about the path of monetary policy. By convincing investors that it will keep interest rates low tomorrow, it can reduce borrowing costs today.
In essence, the Fed is asking investors to stake vast sums on the proposition that it will do what it says. And investors, unsurprisingly, have become increasingly fearful about any sign that the Fed may change its plans.
The mainstay of the Fed's stimulus campaign is its stated intention to hold short-term interest rates near zero as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6.5 percent. It has put further pressure on longer-term rates by amassing more than $3 trillion in Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities; since last December it has expanded those holdings by an additional $85 billion a month in a process known as quantitative easing, or Q.E.
Interest rates started rising in May after Mr. Bernanke suggested that the Fed might reduce the volume of its monthly purchases later this year. Rates rose much more quickly after he said last week that the Fed was planning to do exactly that.
Mr. Bernanke insisted that the Fed was not altering its plans for short-term rates. He said the Fed was not even altering its plans for asset purchases; it was just publicizing those plans for the first time. And he emphasized that the timetable would change if the economy grew more slowly than expected.
But investors ''seem to believe that Fed officials must have become at least somewhat more willing to consider earlier hikes if they are sufficiently comfortable with the economic outlook to preannounce Q.E. tapering,'' wrote Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs.
Wells Fargo, the nation's largest mortgage lender, has raised its standard interest rate on 30-year loans to 4.625 percent, from 3.9 percent. Yields on corporate junk bonds have jumped two percentage points in less than two months.
Perhaps most strikingly, market pricing has shifted to reflect an expectation that the Fed will begin to raise short-term rates by the end of 2014, despite the fact that 15 of 19 Fed officials indicated last week they did not expect an increase until 2015.
Investors are skeptical partly because the Fed has repeatedly overestimated the pace of growth in recent years. If it repeats the mistake, it could once again end up withdrawing stimulus prematurely. Moreover, the Fed has emphasized the unemployment rate as its measuring stick. That rate has declined largely because many jobless people have stopped looking for work, raising concerns that the Fed could meet its stated goals and begin to retreat while the economy remained relatively weak.
''The chairman often talks of the misery inflicted by sustained high unemployment, but he has set the Fed on a course to stop asset purchases at a point when about five million people are likely to be missing from the labor force, compared to 2007,'' wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. ''Even allowing for policy lags, that seems startlingly unambitious.''
Mr. Dudley sought to counter these concerns by emphasizing that the Fed would adjust its efforts as necessary, and by offering a detailed account of his own reasons for increased economic optimism. ''I see persuasive evidence of improved underlying fundamentals for much of the private sector of the U.S. economy,'' he said, citing lower levels of household debt and increased lending.
Mr. Powell spoke of ''many signs that the economy is healing.''
Mr. Lockhart was more measured in his economic forecast. The government said on Thursday that prices continued to rise in May at the slowest pace in at least half a century, up just 1.1 percent over the previous year -- well below the 2 percent annual pace that the Fed considers most healthy.
Mr. Lockhart, like most Fed officials, said he expected that inflation would gradually return to a healthier pace, partly because of the Fed's existing plans for continuing stimulus, partly because expectations remained well anchored and partly because officials had concluded that the measurements were understating inflation for technical and temporary reasons.
But he noted that the sluggish pace of inflation could also be an indication of economic weakness.
''It's possible,'' he said, ''these low inflation readings indicate an economy that is weaker than I, for one, believe it is.''

HEADLINE: Obama Gets Tough on Bangladesh

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
In a move designed to push Bangladesh to improve working conditions in its clothing factories, the Obama administration on Thursday suspended the country from a trade program that grants preferential access to the American market. The decision should exert pressure on the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to do right by four million workers. 
Fires, building collapses and other preventable industrial accidents have claimed hundreds of lives in Bangladesh's booming garment industry in recent years. In April, more than 1,100 people died when a building housing several garment factories collapsed outside Dhaka, the capital. And, in November, more than 110 people suffocated and burned to death in a factory fire.
We have urged American and European companies to demand that suppliers improve working conditions and to help pay for factory renovations. But the fundamental responsibility lies with Bangladesh's leaders. Ms. Hasina has repeatedly said her government would beef up inspections and make it easier for workers to form unions, but she has not done enough to follow through. Her government recently proposed changes to the country's labor laws that would not allow workers to unionize in export-processing zones where many large factories are.
The United States grants duty-free access to imports from many poor countries under a program known as the Generalized System of Preferences. But the preferences are limited and, in Bangladesh's case, America does not grant any preferences to clothing exports, which make up the bulk of that country's $4.9 billion in annual exports to the United States. The preferences for Bangladesh apply to other products such as tobacco, sports equipment and porcelain. As a result, the suspension will not directly harm the garment workers.
The Obama administration's move could also help embolden the European Union to revoke the benefits it provides to Bangladesh, which cover more exports. Europe grants duty-free access to Bangladeshi apparel, which gives it significant leverage over Ms. Hasina's government.
There is little doubt that revoking trade preferences will hurt businesses that are not responsible for the poor conditions in clothing factories. But Western governments have a right, which they have rarely used, to suspend these benefits when countries like Bangladesh repeatedly refuse to live up to their obligations to protect the rights and lives of their workers.
Leaders like Ms. Hasina are unlikely to change policies that are unpopular with the powerful families that own clothing factories unless they are forced to do so. American and European leaders have few tools to exert such pressure, which is why they must use the ones they do have when the lives of millions of poor workers are at stake.

HEADLINE: An Evolving Merkel Doctrine

BYLINE: By JOHN VINOCUR

 BODY:
''While military force cannot be the normal continuation of politics by other means, it must never be ruled out, or even merely questioned -- as has been done by the German federal government -- as the ultimate means of dealing with dictators. Anyone who rejects military action as a last resort weakens the pressure that needs to be maintained on dictators and consequently makes a war not less but more likely. This is a grave matter.''
Did you hear that, you Assads and ayatollahs out there? That's seriously tough talk. And it came from Angela Merkel. 
A detail in passing: The statement was published in the Washington Post on Feb. 20, 2003, in response to Gerhard Schrder's refusal (''for the sake of electoral tactics,'' said Merkel back then) to have Germany join in any international action against Saddam Hussein -- even under United Nations auspices.
Now, with the United States, France and Britain approving the supply of weapons to rebel groups fighting Bashar al-Assad in Syria -- and just two years after Merkel's embarrassing rejection (alongside Vladimir Putin and China's rulers) of the West's intervention against Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya -- the chancellor has effectively rewritten her dealing-with-dictators dictum.
She now says that Germany ''in no case, and regardless of the disposition of other countries in relation to the European Union arms embargo, would deliver weapons to a civil war zone.''
Here was the world's third biggest arms merchant reaching for a convoluted explanation to steer clear of getting involved -- fighters from Iran, Iraq and Lebanon indeed disqualify Syria as a civil war zone.
Coming from a Western leader who oversees German forces in Afghanistan (while having refused to connect the word ''war'' to their presence during her first five years in office), it suggests a chancellor repositioning Germany, after its involvement in the Balkans and Afghanistan, toward its comfy old global political stance of non-engagement and righteousness.
This is not a demonstration, as Merkel ambles toward re-election in September, of a new, activist German commitment on issues of war and peace. If it defines Germany's developing world role, then it's leadership with ''beschrnkte haftung'' -- the notice on coat checks and shoe-repair tickets in Germany meaning limited liability.
Looking back on the past couple of months, Merkel has met one-on-one with Putin, Barack Obama, and China's new prime minister, Li Keqiang, without saying anything that contradicts the notion of increased German passivity.
People notice. Germany's business newspaper Handelsblatt said last week that the Americans could not share leadership with Merkel's government. Michael Inacker wrote that outside their economic role, the ''tame Germans'' were in self-imposed ''retreat'' politically and militarily, and looking for legal and moralizing excuses to avoid ''getting their hands dirty.''
Sen. John McCain, passing through Berlin a week earlier, offered a bit of sly understatement concerning German foreign policy, saying the leadership was only faintly conscious that a ''military component'' must be a part of it.
The sense that Merkel's Germany has virtually no firm geopolitical red lines of commitment, apart from its relationship with Israel, threads through a new book (''Angela Merkel, Die Kanzlerin und ihre Welt'') by Stefan Kornelius, foreign editor of the Sddeutsche Zeitung.
Kornelius, who has close relations with the chancellery, writes about the relationship between the chancellor's vision of the world and Germany's new leverage, raising the question if it can extend beyond pure German self-interest.
On Russia, for example: He asserts that Merkel ''despises'' Putin's macho style. So: could a tougher German line, rising above Germany's dependency on Russian energy supply, be forthcoming? Kornelius doesn't say yes.
Concerning America, Merkel is described as no fan of Obama. Rather, the book tells of her joining European colleagues (Nicolas Sarkozy and Gordon Brown) in asking each other if it is only to him or to her that the American president seems so ''peculiar, distant, and short on warmth.''
American power in the world is weakened, Kornelius writes, and adds that ''this is no good news for someone like Merkel'' because she ''thinks in categories of strength and superiority and prefers a strong America to an over-powerful China.'' Germany's role in Merkel's vision of living in a world of vast Chinese power? Serving as ''an economic counterweight.''
That's nice. Because when Kornelius points to a day when Merkel might have to decide between U.S. interests and Germany's economic ties to China, he cannot furnish a definitive response.
He writes instead, ''There's little doubt about which side she would pick.''
But it's a very sensitive point where an able reporter has decided he cannot be more explicit -- and it leaves the trace of a hedge concerning Merkel's inclinations.
It also sustains a kind of uncertainty, a notion of half-heartedness that surrounded the avoidance of risks by German forces in Afghanistan, or Obama's phone call to Merkel a couple of years back to say he couldn't understand her government's hesitation to close the last Iranian bank in Germany.
In Merkel's case, we're watching a halting entry into a new leadership role -- one so far without a demonstration of willingness to accept all the responsibilities that would bring Germany's friends any assurance of its resolve.

HEADLINE: When Labor Is Flexible, and Paid Less

BYLINE: By CHRYSTIA FREELAND | REUTERS

 BODY:
NEW YORK -- If you are worried about the Western middle class -- and we all should be -- you may have started to have some doubts about the virtues of flexible labor markets. In theory, flexible labor markets should make our economies more productive, and all of us richer, by making it easier for people to do the work the economy needs, and to stop doing the work it doesn't.
In practice, though, some economists who once championed flexible labor markets without reservation, like Daron Acemoglu of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, have begun to have second thoughts. Mr. Acemoglu doesn't doubt the positive economic effects of flexible labor markets, but he has begun to be concerned about their political and distributional consequences. They might help the economy grow over all, but they may also be contributing to the hollowing out of the middle class by weakening its political bargaining power. 
That's why a recent paper by Joao Paulo Pessoa and John Van Reenen, both of the Center for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics, makes such fascinating reading. Mr. Van Reenen and Mr. Pessoa set out to unravel the two big mysteries about Britain's economic performance over the past five years. The backdrop to both is the devastation that Britain, with its oversize banking sector, suffered in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.
''The big story in the U.K. is that the economy has shrunk by 2.5 percent since the pre-crisis period,'' Mr. Van Reenen told me. ''That's the longest depressed economy in this country for more than a hundred years.''
Britain's dismal economic performance certainly helps to explain the grimness of British politics at the moment, and the growing appeal of the nationalist fringe. But the story becomes more mysterious when you start investigating what is happening inside the country's shrunken economy.
Given the prolonged recession, economists would normally predict that unemployment would soar. It has risen, but, Mr. Van Reenen said, ''not nearly as much as you would expect, and not as much as in, for example, the United States,'' where the economic contraction has not been as prolonged. So, when it comes to jobs, Britain has surprised on the upside.
The second riddle is a less cheerful one -- while employment has held up relatively well, given the country's poor economic performance, productivity has plunged, an unanticipated departure from the pre-crisis trend line.
''We are 12 percent lower in productivity today than we would expect,'' Mr. Van Reenen said. ''That is the puzzle. Why has this happened? Have we gotten more stupid?''
Mr. Van Reenen and Mr. Pessoa propose a single answer to these two mysteries -- flexible labor markets. In contrast with previous economic downturns, the British economy today has a much less sheltered workforce. The result is what classical economic theory would have predicted -- the job market has adjusted more successfully to the shrinking economy than it did during previous downturns.
But that good news comes at a price: The flexibility in the British labor market has been in wages, which have shrunk even more than the economy as a whole.
''In this recession, unions are much weaker than they were in the 1980s, and we've had welfare to work reform, so there's a lot more pressure on people to find jobs,'' Mr. Van Reenen said. ''The labor market is much more flexible, which means wages fall. That is bad news for the people whose wages fall, of course, but the positive side is that employment has stayed up. Some pay is better than no pay, at least in a recession.''
It is easy to understand how Mr. Van Reenen's labor market theory explains the combination of falling real wages and relatively strong employment at a time of economic slump. What's less obvious is how weak productivity fits into the story.
He believes that, too, can be explained by flexible labor markets. Workers have become cheaper in Britain and, despite low central bank interest rates, capital is still expensive for many firms, or hard to come by. As a result, Mr. Van Reenen argues, ''instead of investing in machines, firms are keeping on workers.'' That means each hour of human work is less productive.
Mr. Van Reenen and Mr. Pessoa's paper is thought-provoking because it connects the two British economic phenomena that are inspiring a great deal of hand-wringing -- falling productivity and falling real wages -- with the one bright spot in the British economy: the relatively low increase in unemployment.
As in Germany, where job cuts were avoided thanks to more formal deals to decrease the hours and pay of a wider group of workers, Britain's flexible labor markets allowed a lot of people to weather the recession by pricing themselves into a shrunken economy.
There remains, however, a significant caveat. The relatively benign workings of flexible labor markets that Mr. Van Reenen describes are in response to the cyclical shock of a recession. British workers in the middle and across the Western industrialized world more generally are also being pressed by broader structural economic forces.
''I think the squeezed middle class is likely to continue,'' Mr. Van Reenen said. ''The combination of technological change and outsourcing is going to continue to put pressure on median wages.''
''What to do about it is the question,'' he said. ''I don't think the answer is smashing the machines or closing the borders. As we come out of the recession, this is going to be the key question of the next 20 years.''

HEADLINE: Senate, 68 to 32, Passes Overhaul For Immigration

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER and JONATHAN MARTIN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Senate on Thursday approved the most significant overhaul of the nation's immigration laws in a generation with broad support generated by a sense among leading Republicans that the party needed to join with Democrats to remove a wedge between Republicans and Hispanic voters.
The strong 68-to-32 vote in the often polarized Senate tossed the issue into the House, where the Republican leadership has said that it will not take up the Senate measure and is instead focused on much narrower legislation that would not provide a path to citizenship for the 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the country. Party leaders hope that the Senate action will put pressure on the House.
Leading up to the final votes, which the senators cast at their desks to mark the import of the moment, members of the bipartisan ''Gang of Eight,'' who drafted the framework of the legislation, took to the Senate floor to make a final argument for the measure. Among them was Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, who is one of his party's leading Hispanic voices. When Mr. Rubio finished, the other senators in the group surrounded him on the floor, patting him on the back and offering words of encouragement. ''Good job,'' one said. ''I'm proud of you,'' another offered. 
The future will show whether voters in Republican presidential primaries share that pride.
After Mitt Romney's loss in November, top Republicans immediately began formulating a way to improve the party's standing with Hispanics, who have flocked to Democrats. A group of top Republican political and business officials who support an immigration overhaul met at the downtown Washington office of the anti-tax leader Grover Norquist on Jan. 17 with memories of Mr. Romney's poor showing in their minds.
Optimism ran high at the session, which included Mr. Norquist, the former national party chairman Ed Gillespie and representatives of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Republican ''super PACs.'' Reeling from a second consecutive presidential loss and with Mr. Rubio taking the place of Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, as the face of the immigration reform movement, the strategists were hopeful that the wall of conservative opposition that blocked immigration legislation under President George W. Bush could be breached.
Now, even after the lopsided Senate vote, the prospects appear grim for the pro-overhaul Republicans. And Mr. Rubio, the 42-year-old Cuban-American who is seen as a prime White House contender in 2016, is confronting rising criticism from conservatives for pushing legislation with Democratic boogeymen like President Obama and Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York.
''Before the Gang of Eight and the immigration debate, I think many conservatives as well as some establishment Republican folks saw Senator Rubio as a possible bridge candidate between the conservative Tea Party base of the G.O.P. and more establishment G.O.P. voters,'' said Greg Mueller, a conservative public relations executive who opposed the Senate bill. ''That position is on much shakier ground today because conservatives and the Tea Party see the immigration bill as a big-government piece of legislation resembling Obamacare.''
Republicans strongly opposed to the immigration bill said they had little sympathy for Mr. Rubio.
''I don't think we're doing any damage to him,'' said Representative Tim Huelskamp, Republican of Kansas. ''I think he's done damage to himself with the amnesty bill.''
Alex Conant, Mr. Rubio's spokesman, said: ''Immigration is a personal issue for Senator Rubio, and he took it on because he thought it was the right thing to do. There may be some political implications, especially in the short term, but it wasn't an issue he believed he could ignore. We don't expect any parades for our work on this.''
On Thursday, Mr. Rubio had little cover from his party's right flank, much less a parade. Not wanting to tempt primary opponents next year, the top two Senate Republican leaders -- Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and John Cornyn of Texas -- cast ''no'' votes. And a potential 2016 presidential primary rival for Mr. Rubio, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, also voted against the legislation, despite making a show of announcing his general support for an immigration overhaul earlier in the year.
The Senate bill provides a 13-year path to citizenship for the 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the country, as well as tough border security provisions that must be in place before the immigrants can gain legal status.
The legislation -- drafted largely behind closed doors by the group of eight senators -- brought together an unlikely coalition of Democrats and Republicans; business groups and labor unions; farmworkers and growers; and Latino, gay rights and immigration advocates. Along the way, the legislation was shaped and tweaked in a series of back-room deals and negotiations that, in many ways, seemed to mirror its inception.
As late as Wednesday night, several members of the bipartisan group, including Mr. McCain and his Republican colleague Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, as well as Mr. Schumer, found themselves calling Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, trying to shore up support. In separate calls, the senators urged Mr. Christie to help persuade Senator Jeffrey S. Chiesa, Republican of New Jersey -- newly appointed by Mr. Christie -- to vote for the bill. (Mr. Chiesa was one of the 14 Republicans who voted ''yes'' on Thursday.)
The first big deal on the legislation came at the end of March, when the nation's top labor and business groups reached an agreement on a guest worker program for low-skilled immigrants. Disagreements between the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. had helped doom a 2007 attempt at a similar overhaul, but the two groups came together to create a program that would expand and shrink based on economic indicators -- like unemployment and job openings figures -- and offer a maximum of 200,000 guest visas annually.
The group of senators who wrote the legislation had originally hoped it would receive overwhelming bipartisan support -- as many as 70 votes, some senators suggested -- to help propel it through the House, and when the bill moved to the Senate Judiciary Committee, the group took pains to win bipartisan support there, too.
The bill passed through the committee, in a process that stretched over five days and included the consideration of more than 300 amendments, on a strong 13-to-5 bipartisan vote.
The bill's largest, and perhaps most critical, change came in a package that promised to substantially bolster security along the nation's southern border. The proposal, by Senators Bob Corker of Tennessee and John Hoeven of North Dakota, both Republicans, would devote about $40 billion over the next decade to border enforcement measures, including adding 20,000 Border Patrol agents and 700 miles of fencing along the southern border.
The amendment, which passed Wednesday with broad bipartisan support, helped bring along more than a dozen reluctant Republicans. But even that measure does not seem to have altered firm House resistance to the Senate bill. Speaker John A. Boehner threw cold water on any hope that the House would vote on the Senate plan, and he insisted that whatever immigration measure his chamber took up would have to be supported by a majority of his Republican conference.
''I issued a statement that I thought was pretty clear, but apparently some haven't gotten the message: the House is not going to take up and vote on whatever the Senate passes,'' he said Thursday morning. ''We're going to do our own bill.''
As daunting to the pro-overhaul Republicans as Mr. Boehner's apparent opposition is the structure of the Republican House majority, strategists say. More than 70 percent of districts held by House Republicans have a population that is 10 percent or less Hispanic, National Journal reported. And the Republican districts where there is a significant Hispanic population are in heavily conservative terrain in California and Texas.

HEADLINE: Shares Rise on Gains in Jobs, and Bond Yields Fall

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Better news on jobs and consumer spending pushed stocks higher on Thursday.
The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose for a third straight day. Bond yields fell for a second consecutive day, easing worries that a sudden spike in interest rates would hurt the economy. 
Consumer spending rose 0.3 percent in May as incomes increased at the fastest pace in three months, the government reported. The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits fell 9,000 to 346,000 last week, adding to evidence that the job market was improving modestly.
Stocks rallied since Tuesday as investors took advantage of lower prices after a sell-off that ended Monday. The plunge occurred after Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, said that the central bank could cut back on its stimulus this year and possibly end it next year, if the economy continued to improve.
The Dow sank a total of 560 points Wednesday and Thursday of last week. Even with the gains this week the index remains 293 points below where it was on June 18, the day before the Fed described how it might wind down its stimulus.
The central bank is buying $85 billion in bonds every month to contain long-term interest rates and encourage borrowing and spending. Fed stimulus has underpinned a stock market rally that started in March 2009 by encouraging investment in risky assets.
The Dow closed up 114.35 points, or 0.8 percent, to 15,024.49. The S.& P. 500-stock index climbed 9.94 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,613.20. The Nasdaq composite index rose 25.64 points, or 0.8 percent, to 3,401.86.
Nine of the 10 groups in the S.& P. 500 rose, led by financials. Only materials companies fell.
In a sign investors were again more confident about holding riskier assets, the Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks rose 16.09 points, or 1.7 percent, to 979.92, more than twice as much as the rest of the market.
The price on the 10-year Treasury note increased 18/32 to 93 22/32. The yield fell to 2.47 percent, from 2.54 percent late Wednesday. The yield climbed to 2.66 percent on Monday, the highest since August 2011. The rate has surged since May 3, when it touched 1.63 percent, its low for the year. Concern that the Fed is poised to start pulling back on its stimulus prompted investors to sell bonds, pushing the yield higher.
Investors who have added bonds to their portfolios at the expense of stocks should consider reducing their fixed-income holdings because yields are likely to rise further, said Doug Cote, chief market strategist at ING Investment Management. Bonds rallied from 2007 to 2012, years that encompassed the financial crisis and the Great Recession. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to a record low of 1.39 percent in July last year.

HEADLINE: An Old Champion Returns For Mortgage-Based Bonds

BYLINE: By WILIAM ALDEN

 BODY:
Lewis S. Ranieri helped pioneer mortgage-backed securities in the 1980s. On Thursday, his new firm priced its first mortgage bond deal.
With the recent turmoil in the bond markets, however, the offering was not without drama. The structure of the offering was changed to offer buyers more protection against losses, according to a person briefed on the matter who was not authorized to speak about the private deal.
The firm, Shellpoint Partners, of which Mr. Ranieri is chairman, sold $251 million in residential mortgage-backed securities tied to loans that are not backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. The largest portion of the deal was sold at a rate of 2.85 percentage points above ultrasafe government debt, according to the person briefed on the deal. 
Through a spokesman, Mr. Ranieri and Shellpoint declined requests for comment.
Bond prices have fallen since the Federal Reserve indicated that it planned to start reducing the stimulus it has used to keep interest rates low since the financial crisis.
For residential mortgage bonds without government backing, the fall has been steep. After a rapid climb in 2012, prices of these bonds began to stumble this year and have fallen about 3.5 points on average since the beginning of June, according to an index of prime and subprime mortgage-based securities from Markit.
''You had this panic that rates were rising, and you had all these redemptions coming out of bond funds,'' said Ken Shinoda, portfolio manager on the mortgage-backed securities desk at DoubleLine Capital. ''There were a lot of things not trading.''
Few know this market like Mr. Ranieri, 66, who ran the mortgage group at Salomon Brothers in the 1980s and rose to become vice chairman of the firm. A college dropout from Brooklyn, Mr. Ranieri started in Salomon's mailroom before distinguishing himself as a trader.
''He was a bull in a china shop,'' said Robert F. Dall, a onetime boss of Mr. Ranieri. ''He was a guy who knew lots about lots of things and was not loath to say so.''
By 1987, Mr. Ranieri was pushed out of Salomon, and he began a second career as a private investor. As the financial crisis unfolded, he watched as mortgage bonds and other, more exotic mortgage-based products fell in value.
''I used to think we had done something important and good, and then, unfortunately, we had the last bubble,'' Mr. Ranieri said in a speech last week at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington. ''The system we built showed the cracks and the clay feet.''
To Mr. Ranieri's mind, there is another problem today: that the government still controls Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage finance giants it rescued in the financial crisis. That level of involvement by the government is ''unacceptable,'' Mr. Ranieri said.
But as the last-minute restructuring of Thursday's deal showed, investors remain nervous about the types of investments Mr. Ranieri is pushing, which do not have government backing.
In addition, the Shellpoint deal had some features that raised eyebrows among prospective buyers. The security includes a number of loans to foreign nationals and real estate investors, in addition to a relatively high concentration of properties in California, according to a report by Fitch Ratings.
And yet, Mr. Ranieri remains determined to bring the market back to life.
''Hello,'' he said in his speech last week. ''I'm Dr. Frankenstein.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Obama, in Africa, Praises U.S. Ruling on Gay Marriage

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
DAKAR, Senegal -- President Obama on Thursday called the Supreme Court's decision to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act a ''victory for American democracy'' and said he had directed his administration to find ways to make sure gay couples received the benefits for which they were now eligible.
''It's my personal belief, but I'm speaking now as a president not as a lawyer, that if you marry someone in Massachusetts and you move somewhere else, you're still married,'' Mr. Obama told reporters at a news conference here during his second trip to sub-Saharan Africa since taking office. ''We're going to be evaluating all these issues.'' 
Standing next to President Macky Sall of Senegal, Mr. Obama also urged African nations that treat homosexuality as a crime, like Senegal, to make sure that gays and lesbians were not discriminated against by the government.
''When it comes to how the state treats people, how the law treats people, I believe that everybody has to be treated equally,'' Mr. Obama said. The comment prompted a retort from Mr. Sall that his country is not ''homophobic'' even though its society is not yet ready to decriminalize homosexual behavior.
Mr. Obama spoke on a wide range of subjects in his first news conference since a spate of news back home in the last week. He talked about the court's decision to strike down a part of the 1965 Voting Rights Act; the pursuit of Edward J. Snowden, who leaked documents about National Security Agency programs; and the fragile health of Nelson Mandela, the former South African president.
On the Voting Rights Act, Mr. Obama said the court had made ''a mistake'' in its ruling, saying the justices had dealt a blow to a law that was "the cornerstone and the culmination of years of struggle, blood, sweat, tears; in some cases, deaths.''
He added, ''I might not be here as president'' if the Voting Rights Act had not been passed into law decades ago.
But the president acknowledged that the Supreme Court had ruled and he urged Congress to ''simply make sure that everyone around the country can vote.''
On Mr. Snowden, who fled Hong Kong to Russia after revealing that he had leaked sensitive surveillance information, Mr. Obama said he had not personally called the presidents of China or Russia because he did not want to elevate the importance of Mr. Snowden's case. He said other nations should simply be willing to return Mr. Snowden to the United States as a matter of course.
''This is something that routinely is dealt with,'' Mr. Obama said. ''This is not exceptional from a legal perspective. I'm not going to have one case suddenly being elevated to the point where I have to do wheeling and dealing and trading.''
Cuba has been reported as Mr. Snowden's next destination, but on Thursday afternoon, a flight from Moscow to Havana took off without any sign that Mr. Snowden was on board. Asked whether he would order the military to intercept any plane Mr. Snowden might travel on, Mr. Obama said he would not.
''I'm not going to be scrambling jets to get a 29-year-old hacker,'' the president said.
Just a day before Mr. Obama is set to travel to South Africa, he expressed admiration for Mr. Mandela, who is often called Madiba, his clan name, in his own country. He is critically ill and has been hospitalized in Pretoria, South Africa, for weeks.
''I've had the privilege of meeting Madiba and speaking to him,'' Mr. Obama said. ''He is a personal hero. But I don't think I'm unique in that regard. I think he is a hero for the world. If and when he passes from this place, one thing I think we all know is that his legacy is one that will linger on for all the ages.''
Mr. Obama formally opened his visit to the African continent at the Palace of the President, where he met with Mr. Sall to discuss opportunities for greater trade and investment that could bolster the economies of both countries.
''I see this as a moment of great promise and great progress for the continent,'' Mr. Obama said. ''All too often the world overlooks the amazing progress that Africa is making.''
Mr. Obama arrived at the palace along a driveway lined with palm trees and bright orange flowers. He was accompanied by his wife, Michelle, and greeted at the palace by Mr. Sall and his wife, Mareme Sall.
In his first extended visit to Africa since becoming president, Mr. Obama's motorcade was greeted by throngs of people, including women dressed in traditional white garb to signify peace, in the downtown area of the city. Signs along the route proclaimed, ''Welcome Home President Obama.''
Some Africans have criticized Mr. Obama for what they say has been a lack of attention and investment in the continent where his father was born. The American president spent one day in sub-Saharan Africa in 2009, delivering a speech in Ghana.
''Africans have been largely disappointed, especially when they look at the focus on Africa by the previous presidents,'' said Mwangi Kimenyi, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ''They therefore have a feeling that President Obama is still not in tune with the emerging continent.''
Meanwhile, Chinese leaders have traveled extensively in Africa during the last several years, investing billions of dollars in infrastructure throughout the continent. American officials concede the challenge from China and other countries but insist that America has not been absent.
''China's paying a lot of attention to Africa,'' Mr. Obama said in his news conference. ''Brazil, Turkey, India, are heavily invested in trying to expand trade and commerce with Africa.''
Mr. Obama expressed frustration with questions from reporters on topics other than his trip. He said that too often Africa is ''not focused on by our press and our leadership back home, unless there's a crisis.''
White House officials said the president's trip would provide an opportunity for American businesses to increase their investments in African countries and to bolster trade with their counterparts on the continent.
''We, frankly, have heard a high-demand signal from the U.S. private sector for us to play an active role in deepening our trade and investment partnerships in Africa,'' said Ben Rhodes, Mr. Obama's deputy national security adviser.

HEADLINE: Native Alaska, Under Threat

BYLINE: By CALLAN J. CHYTHLOOK-SIFSOF. 
Callan J. Chythlook-Sifsof was a member of the United States snowboarding team in the 2010 Winter Olympics and is training for the 2014 Winter Olympics.

 BODY:
PARK CITY, Utah -- I TRAVEL the world on the professional ski and snowboard circuit, but I grew up in a place most will never know firsthand. I was raised in Aleknagik, Alaska -- an indigenous Yupik Eskimo village 400 air miles from the nearest chairlift and accessible only by boat and plane. It's one of the most remote places in North America.
This area is gaining attention as the proposed location of the Pebble Mine, which could end up as the largest open-pit mine in North America and threaten thousands of acres of pristine watershed and the spawning grounds of the largest wild sockeye salmon run on the planet. 
In recent years, an average of 37 million sockeye have returned every year to Bristol Bay, home to nearly half the sockeye in the world, supporting both commercial and subsistence fishing. Salmon are the economic backbone for Bristol Bay's isolated bush communities. About 12,000 people work full or part time harvesting and processing the bay's sustainable salmon.
My indigenous heritage is Yupik/Inupiat Eskimo. I was raised in an environment centered on salmon. Fishing is what every family does. It is who we are. I spent my summers on the back deck of family fishing boats working multiple fisheries. The boats and fish camps are maintained by generations of families harvesting salmon not only for income, but also for food.
I remember long days of processing hundreds of pounds of salmon, setting nets, cleaning and filleting, filling tubs of salt brine, putting fresh water in clean white buckets and hanging neat rows to dry and smoke. Enjoying the bounty over the winter, my family would affectionately praise me for my hard work and contribution to our food. When I was 8, I went into business for myself, lugging a little cooler around the boatyard, selling sodas to the fishermen, welders, port engineers and fabricators.
As a child, I had no idea what magic this life was -- it was just the way we did things. It's the way many Alaska Natives live -- through self-reliance and hard work to harvest the many gifts of the land and sea.
This subsistence way of life that is thousands of years old is threatened by the plans of a British and Canadian mining partnership to dig a huge mine in the heart of our productive, healthy watershed.
People in Bristol Bay understand how vital our renewable resources are and that risking our lands, waters and fish for a short-term mega-mine like Pebble is a terrible idea. Eighty-one percent of Native shareholders in the Bristol Bay Native Corporation -- composed of more than 9,000 Native Alaskans with ancestral ties to the Bristol Bay region -- opposed the mine in a 2011 survey. And that's despite the promises of jobs and continuing efforts by the Pebble Partnership, the proponent of the mine, to buy support through grants and giveaways to communities and hundreds of millions spent to develop the mine. This issue is deeply felt in the bay, and around Alaska, where, according to a 2011 survey commissioned by the Natural Resources Defense Council, 68 percent said no to Pebble -- in a state known for its love of resource extraction.
We know from a recent assessment by the Environmental Protection Agency (the deadline for public comments on the report is Sunday) that Bristol Bay is no place for a gigantic mine. The agency found that, depending on how much of Pebble's copper, gold and molybdenum are unearthed, as much as 90 miles of streams and up to 4,800 acres of wetlands could be destroyed. And that is the very-best-case scenario -- without any disaster involving a breach of the 700-foot-tall earthen tailings dams that are supposed to hold billions of tons of toxic mine waste forever in a wet, sensitive and seismically active area.
It's truly alarming when Pebble's chief executive officer, John Shively, blithely says that, sure, the mine will damage some salmon habitat, but the company will just build ''comparable'' habitat nearby. Or when he says that salmon fishing is not the economic ''answer for people who live out in southwest Alaska.'' His comments show a lack of understanding of salmon life cycles, habitat and ecosystems -- not to mention the people of Bristol Bay. And it should worry us all that Mr. Shively is already saying that the government or someone else may have to handle the messy aftermath of mining if ''we're not available to work on closure.''
The E.P.A. can block the mine under the Clean Water Act -- something our government has done rarely and judiciously. If ever there were a case for using this power, Bristol Bay is the place, with a fishery of global scale and value, and Native communities dependent upon salmon.

HEADLINE: Ratings Service Finds Pension Shortfall

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
Moody's Investors Service, dissatisfied with the way states measure what they owe their retirees, released its own numbers on Thursday, showing that the 50 states have, in aggregate, just 48 cents for every dollar in pensions they have promised.
That is much less than the 74 cents on the dollar that the states now report, suggesting the states are short by about $980 billion, with many local governments, like school districts, being on the hook for additional billions that they have not disclosed at all. 
The disparity suggests that politically difficult steps taken recently by many states to fix their pension problems -- raising retirement ages, requiring bigger contributions from workers, lowering benefits for new hires -- will prove insufficient, because they were based on underestimates of the problem.
Moody's new method reflects a belief, held by many economists, that states and local governments are severely distorting their pension numbers by failing to take proper account of market risks. This makes public pensions look cheaper than they are turning out to be, wreaking havoc with budgets. Moody's new method does not go as far as these economists may wish. But it does eliminate some of the distortion by converting the value of future pensions into current dollars using a high-quality taxable bond rate.
''They have moved clearly in the right direction, and for a reason which is clearly a sound reason,'' said Jeremy Gold, an actuary and economist who has been an outspoken critic of governmental pension disclosures. ''They are drawing a parallel in their own minds between bond payments and pension payments, and they're saying that whatever the market tells us about bond payments, we want to use that to measure pension payments.''
Public pension measures usually incorporate expected stock market returns, which Mr. Gold called ''extraneous.''
Moody's also said on Thursday that its analysts had decided that the states' so-called funded ratio -- the dollars in their pension funds compared with dollars promised to retirees -- was not useful for issuing credit ratings, even though the ratios are widely cited and easy to understand.
Moody's said funded ratios were good for certain things, like determining whether a state pension system was at risk of running out of money. But for ratings, it said it wanted to compare each state's pension promises with its total economic resources, whether the money was in a pension fund or not.
Measured that way, the state struggling with the most outsize pension burden is Illinois. Moody's found that its unfunded pension promises were more than three times the amount of revenue the state takes in every year through taxes and fees.
By the same measure, Nebraska's pension plan posed the least credit concern, with a shortfall of just 7 percent of the state's annual revenue. That is in large part because the benefits offered by the state of Nebraska are relatively small.
Surprises emerged when Moody's measured each state's ability to pay not by its tax revenue but by its gross domestic product. In that case, Alaska surged to the top of the list with a pension shortfall of more than one-fifth of its total output, surpassing even Illinois, which is widely considered to have America's biggest pension problems.
Alaska also scored the biggest burden when Moody's measured economic capacity on the basis of personal income. But when Moody's added Puerto Rico to its rankings, it rocketed to the top of the list, ahead of even Alaska and Illinois. The territory's pension shortfall was 59 percent of the personal income of its residents, more than eight times the 50-state median of about 7 percent. Alaska was the runner-up to Puerto Rico, with a pension shortfall 32 percent of its residents' personal income, and Illinois came in third at 24 percent.
Puerto Rico's financial burdens are of great interest to investors because it has an unusual amount of debt outstanding, much of it in mutual funds. Its rating is one notch above the junk-bond range, lower than the rating of any state.
Some states that are widely thought to have pension problems, like California, fared better than might have been expected under Moody's new rating method. That was because Moody's noted that much of what appeared to be their duty to pay pensions was really the duty of local bodies of government, like school districts. Current government accounting rules, now being changed, make it look as if those states must pay the total cost.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Obama Looks to History and Future in Senegal

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR; Adam Nossiter contributed reporting from Dakar, and Alan Cowell from London.

 BODY:
DAKAR, Senegal -- President Obama looked across the Atlantic Ocean as he stood in a stone doorway at Gore Island, a symbolically important landmark that serves as a reminder of ships bound for America bearing African slaves in shackles.
America's first black president spent about a half-hour inside the slave house on the edge of the water, walking quietly with his wife, Michelle Obama, a descendant of slaves, by his side. 
Photographers briefly captured a reflective-looking president in the ''door of no return.'' Afterward, Mr. Obama was stoic, describing the visit only as a ''very powerful moment'' that helped him to ''fully appreciate the magnitude of the slave trade,'' which for so long defined the history of blacks in the United States.
''Obviously, for an African-American, an African-American president, to be able to visit this site, I think gives me even greater motivation in terms of human rights around the world,'' he said.
Mr. Obama formally opened his visit to the African continent earlier in the day at the Palace of the President, where he met with President Macky Sall of Senegal to discuss opportunities for greater trade and investment that could bolster the economies of both countries.
''I see this as a moment of great promise and great progress for the continent,'' Mr. Obama said. ''All too often, the world overlooks the amazing progress that Africa is making.''
In his first extended visit to Africa since becoming president, Mr. Obama was greeted by some large crowds, including women dressed in traditional white garb to signify peace.
Despite that greeting, some Africans have criticized Mr. Obama for what they say has been a lack of attention and investment. As president, he spent one day in sub-Saharan Africa in 2009, delivering a speech in Ghana.
Mwangi S. Kimenyi, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said: ''Africans have been largely disappointed, especially when they look at the focus on Africa by the previous presidents. They therefore have a feeling that President Obama is still not in tune with the emerging continent.''
Meanwhile, Chinese leaders have traveled extensively in Africa in the last several years, investing billions of dollars in infrastructure throughout the continent.
American officials concede the challenge from China and other countries but insist that the United States has not been absent.
''China's paying a lot of attention to Africa,'' Mr. Obama said in his news conference. ''Brazil, Turkey, India are heavily invested in trying to expand trade and commerce with Africa.''
White House officials said the president's trip would provide an opportunity for American businesses to increase their investments in African countries and to bolster trade with their counterparts on the continent.
''We, frankly, have heard a high-demand signal from the U.S. private sector for us to play an active role in deepening our trade and investment partnerships in Africa,'' said Benjamin J. Rhodes, Mr. Obama's deputy national security adviser.
For Mr. Obama's administration, the weeklong visit to Africa is an important part of shaping policy regarding trade, security and human rights.
But for the president himself, it is also a personal journey to countries that count him as one of their own.
As he walked onto Gore Island from a ferry on Thursday afternoon, hundreds of residents of the area screamed with glee, many of them wearing white T-shirts emblazoned with his face and the words: ''Welcome home, Mr. President.''
If the slave quarters made him somber, then the long rope line packed with eager faces had the opposite effect. Mr. Obama had a broad smile on his face as he shook the many hands reaching out to touch him. He held a baby for the cameras and moved briefly to the beat of bongo drums.
Since becoming president in 2009, Mr. Obama has often deflected questions about the racial barrier he broke in that first election.
When asked about his efforts to raise the quality of life for African-Americans, he often responds by saying that he was elected to be the president of all Americans.
But here, in Africa, it is harder for him to avoid the history he has made.
In the days ahead, Mr. Obama will have more opportunities to reflect on the connection he feels with Africa. He is scheduled to deliver the marquee speech of his trip to college students in South Africa.
''This is going to be a continent that is on the move,'' Mr. Obama said at the end of a news conference in Senegal. ''It is young. It is vibrant and full of energy. And there's a reason why a lot of other countries around the world are spending a lot of time here.''
He will not visit Kenya, where his father was born. That has become a source of disappointment for many there. And anger about some of Mr. Obama's policies -- including his embrace of some of the antiterrorism efforts of President George W. Bush -- has dampened the enthusiasm for his arrival in some places.
In his remarks to reporters, Mr. Obama gave little indication of his personal motivations on the trip. Instead, he repeated his belief that the United States should not ''lose focus'' on cultivating relationships with African countries.
''The reason I came to Africa is because Africa is rising,'' Mr. Obama said. ''And it is in the United States' interests -- not simply in Africa's interests -- that the United States don't miss the opportunity to deepen and broaden the partnerships and potential here.''

HEADLINE: The Idled of Silicon Valley

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- As the Senate voted on a landmark immigration bill that would let Silicon Valley companies import more foreign engineers, some Americans remain locked in a deeply emotional argument over whether outsiders are taking jobs away from people like Joey Doernberg.
Mr. Doernberg worked in chip design, before that industry shrank, and then for a solar energy company, before that industry shrank, and has been unemployed since the middle of last year. By his own account, his skills are not ideal for the current job market. Nor does it help, he says, that at 53, he looks older than he is; youth is at a premium in his industry. So, too, is optimism.
''It's a question of convincing someone that with these skills, I can do this job, even though I haven't done it before,'' he said. ''I'm very optimistic. I know I will find a job.''
The questions of skills, jobs and nationality are a combustible mix these days. 
Silicon Valley companies, warning of an acute labor shortage, say it is too costly to retrain older workers like Mr. Doernberg, and that the country is not producing enough younger Americans with the precise skills the industry needs. Their arguments have persuaded a majority of senators to give them what they want: a provision in the immigration bill to let in many more foreign professionals.
But Americans like Mr. Doernberg and the powerful labor lobby say that what the tech industry really wants is to depress wages and bring in more pliant, less costly temporary workers from overseas. If there is such a talent shortage, they ask, why are wages for most engineers not rising faster? Labor groups have pushed for a requirement to offer jobs to equally qualified Americans before hiring foreigners, a provision that the industry has fiercely resisted.
The pitched arguments of both sides, which are likely to resurface in the House when it takes up its version of an immigration overhaul, cloud a complicated reality. There is little empirical evidence to suggest that foreign engineers displace American engineers as a whole. If anything, one recent study suggests, the growth of immigrant workers in American companies helps younger American technical workers -- more of them are hired and at higher-paying jobs -- but has no noticeable consequences, good or bad, on older workers.
''In the short run, we don't find really any adverse or superpositive effect on the employment of Americans,'' said William R. Kerr, a Harvard business professor who conducted the study on the work force of 300 American companies. ''People take an extremely one-sided view of this stuff and dismiss any evidence to the contrary.''
A recent analysis by the Brookings Institution reached a similar conclusion. It found that in the top 10 cities that bring in the largest number of high-skilled guest workers on H-1B visas, college-educated Americans -- those who could compete for jobs with high-skilled guest workers -- are not more likely to be unemployed.
At the same time, though, the industry's claims of a labor shortage may be somewhat overblown. Most H-1B workers hold entry-level positions. Economists say that bringing in more of these workers would serve to keep wages down. It also saves employers the trouble of having to retrain workers.
There is a difference between what companies say they need and want, said Peter Cappelli, a management professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. ''Saying we need people with these skills is like me saying I need a four-wheel drive,'' he said. ''They could retrain people.''
It is true that for certain categories of engineers, wages are not going up as sharply as one would expect if good engineering talent were indeed hard to find. But it is also true that engineers with certain specialties, like software development, are hard to find.
Intel, for instance, which has more than 50,000 employees in the United States, said it has 1,000 openings. Motorola Solutions said it was scrambling for software engineers. And unemployment among technology professionals is generally about half the national average, buttressing the industry's claims.
Economists say there may be other reasons for opening the door to high-skilled immigrants. In cities where there are large concentrations of such immigrants in science and engineering, overall wages tend to go up, especially among college-educated American residents, and eventually, so do housing prices, according to a study by Giovanni Peri, an economist at the University of California, Davis.
The Congressional Budget Office weighed in this week too, concluding that the growth in high-skilled immigration would lead to ''slightly higher'' productivity and in turn higher wages overall.
Already, the fight over high-skilled immigration has led to arguments and counterarguments on the Senate floor, with one side warning that jobs will go to workers from overseas and the other rallying for Americans first.
But Ardine Williams, the vice president for human resources at Intel, said that hiring Americans is not always practical. Asked about hiring unemployed engineers in this country, she said, ''I encounter those folks as well. They are skilled and have expertise outside of an area where we need engineers. In some cases they haven't kept their skills current.''
The debate over the effect of foreign engineers on American ones has obscured the critical issue of why more Americans are not going into the thriving technology sector. Students in the United States consistently rank low on global math and science tests, suggesting that relatively few are prepared to go into rigorous science and engineering programs.
In engineering programs at American universities, a little more than 40 percent of all graduate students were from abroad, according to data from the National Science Foundation. Even among Americans who do graduate with computer science or engineering degrees, a third pursue careers outside the tech sector.
Mr. Doernberg is keeping his fingers crossed. A resident of Woodside, Calif., an upscale town south of San Francisco, he spends his days scouring online job boards and attending networking sessions at diners and church halls across Silicon Valley. One of them is a Thursday morning group that meets in a church in Saratoga, a short drive from his home.
It was set up years ago by Hamid Saadat, an electrical engineer who came to this country from Iran as a graduate student in 1978, worked at a series of semiconductor companies in the area, became a United States citizen and went through the same rite of passage as Mr. Doernberg.
In 2001, just as the technology industry slumped, he lost his job. He was 47 and he soon learned one lesson. In Silicon Valley, it may not matter where you were born, but when.
''As much as we like to believe there's no discrimination, being younger usually helps,'' Mr. Saadat said.

HEADLINE: Senate Panel Starts Talks To Overhaul Tax Code

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Democratic and Republican leaders of the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday began a legislative push to simplify the tax code by asking all senators to identify what tax breaks, deductions and credits should be kept.
Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the committee's chairman, and Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the committee's ranking Republican, said they wanted to start the process by clearing the tax code of all special breaks. They gave their colleagues until July 26 to produce their so-called pardon list.
''To make sure that we clear out all the unproductive provisions and simplify tax reform, we plan to operate from an assumption that all special provisions are out unless there is clear evidence that they: (1) help grow the economy, (2) make the tax code fairer, or (3) effectively promote other important policy objectives,'' the senators told their colleagues. They also asked for proposals for changes to the tax code. 
The leaders of both the finance committee and the House Ways and Means Committee have promised a robust effort this Congress to overhaul the tax code, but they face extremely long odds. President Obama has expressed only tentative interest.
Senate Democratic leaders have offered little support, and although Republicans say it is a top priority, they have been loath to say which breaks they would sacrifice or curtail.
In concept, a simplified tax code has bipartisan appeal.
''America's tax code is broken,'' the committee's letter reads. ''The last major reform of the tax code was the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which is considered by many as the gold standard for tax reform. However, since then, the economy has changed dramatically and Congress has made more than 15,000 changes to the tax code. The result is a tax base riddled with exclusions, deductions and credits.''
In practice, the biggest tax breaks -- the mortgage interest deduction, employer tax breaks for health care benefits, deductions for state and local taxes and deductions for charitable contributions -- may prove politically more popular than true tax reform.
While groups like the Business Roundtable, which represents the chief executives of the nation's largest corporations, praised the initiative, trade associations representing specific tax breaks immediately jumped to the defense of their causes.
''Our message to lawmakers is the charitable deduction must be included in any sensible tax reform legislation. The charitable deduction is unique in that it requires individuals to give their money away for the benefit of society,'' said Sandra Swirski, executive director of the Alliance for Charitable Reform, a group formed to protect the tax deduction for giving.
Rather than having senators identify the tax breaks they want to eliminate, Senator Baucus and Senator Hatch decided that it would be politically easier to ask them which breaks should be saved. But they said saving tax breaks come at a cost: every $2 trillion in individual tax breaks added back to their ''blank slate'' would raise tax rates 1.3 to 2.2 percentage points. In other words, senators must decide between popular tax breaks and low income tax rates.
Still, some senators blanched at being handed such a responsibility. Usually, committee leaders draft a base bill and submit it to members to amend. Others said they were pleased that after three years of hearings, white papers and small breakout groups hashing over issues in the tax code, a legislative process was beginning.
''It's a deliberate process that takes the politics out of it,'' said Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland and a finance committee member.
Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, the Ways and Means chairman, who has vowed to complete a tax overhaul bill by the end of the year, welcomed Senate movement.
House Republican leaders have reserved the symbolic H.R.1 -- the first official bill of the 113th Congress -- for a comprehensive tax reform plan, but they have privately expressed concern that Mr. Camp will move forward with a contentious measure, then leave House members politically exposed when the Senate fails to follow.
''This significant step forward underscores that the Senate and House are on the same page as they work in a bicameral, bipartisan manner to fix our broken tax code,'' Mr. Camp said in a statement.

HEADLINE: China: Reshaping of Tibet Criticized

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS

 BODY:
BEIJING -- In an effort to reshape rural Tibet, the Chinese government is pursuing a mass relocation project that since 2006 has moved more than two million farmers and other people from centuries-old villages into concrete, roadside settlements that often cut off inhabitants from their traditional sources of income, according to a study released Thursday by Human Rights Watch.
Citing official figures, the report said that more than two-thirds of the region's 2.7 million people had been relocated to look-alike townships. 
The development project, called the New Socialist Countryside by planners in Beijing, is aimed at raising living standards and improving the economy in one of the poorest and most isolated corners of China. The program has provided as many as 2.1 million Tibetans with running water, electricity and access to better health care and schools.
But researchers at Human Rights Watch say the program has had a devastating impact on traditional Tibetan society by fracturing families, forcing nomads to give up their livestock and requiring many residents to pay for some of the costs of relocation, leaving them with sizable debts.
''It's a tectonic shift that is radically altering the way of life for the vast majority of Tibetans who have no say in the design and implementation of these policies,'' said Nicholas Bequelin, a senior researcher in Hong Kong for Human Rights Watch who helped write the report, which is based on official documents and on interviews with local residents. ''Many Tibetans do not know what hit them.''
Coupled with a crackdown on dissent and ''stability maintenance'' efforts that include stepped-up surveillance in communities across the Tibetan plateau, the study paints the portrait of a society increasingly shaped and managed by the state. Since its invasion by Chinese troops in 1950, the Tibetan Autonomous Region, as Tibet is officially known, has been transformed by generous investment from Beijing, but also by restrictions on religious life at Buddhist monasteries and educational policies that favor instruction in Mandarin over the Tibetan language in local schools.
Many of those policies have intensified since 2008, when deadly ethnic rioting rocked Lhasa, the Tibetan capital. Since then, long-simmering grievances have found expression in a spate of self-immolations, with at least 120 monks, nuns and ordinary Tibetans setting fire to themselves in a protest campaign that has led to even greater restrictions.
Beijing has sealed off large areas of the Tibetan plateau to outsiders, barring foreign journalists and limiting access by diplomats, Western tourists and non-Chinese researchers. Earlier this week, Gary F. Locke, the American ambassador to China, began a rare three-day visit to Tibet, the first time an ambassador from the United States had been given permission to visit the region since 2010, according to an embassy spokesman.
Robert J. Barnett, the director of the modern Tibetan studies program at Columbia University, said the plan of mass relocations was created a decade ago in response to data suggesting an alarming income gap between rural and urban Tibetans. ''Beijing wanted to bring up rural incomes to avoid unrest,'' he said. ''They've been really successful in doing that, but they got the unrest anyway.''
Such Maoist-style social engineering is not new in China, but researchers say it has an especially detrimental effect on the Tibetan nomads who for centuries ranged across the high-altitude pastures spanning Tibet and parts of four adjoining provinces. According to the state media, over the past decade more than a million herders have been resettled in townships, a relocation effort that officials often describe as voluntary.
But Mr. Barnett and other outside experts say the relocations, which are ostensibly designed to protect the ecologically fragile grasslands, are coercive, leaving nomads without the goats and yaks that sustained them. Unable to compete with ethnic Han Chinese migrant workers or educated Tibetans who speak Mandarin, many former herders survive off government subsidies and the odd construction job. Alcoholism is common, he and other experts say. ''The cultural cost of disrupting this nomadic life is hard to measure but the price is high,'' he said.
Zha Luo, an ethnic Tibetan and a rural development expert at the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, rejected the suggestion that government-run relocation programs were hurting Tibetan culture.
''It's not like they are relocated to Henan or mixed into other communities,'' he said, referring to a province in central China. ''They still keep their calendar, holidays and customs.''
He added that most Tibetans were eager for the creature comforts of modernity. ''I grew up in a herder family,'' he said. ''It is miserable in the winter. When the bitter cold comes, the elderly have no hospital to go to and no medicine.''
The new housing does not come free. Despite glowing reports in the official media that feature appreciative Tibetans, Mr. Bequelin of Human Rights Watch said that residents were sometimes required to pay up to 75 percent of the cost of new homes that even government inspectors have found deficient. A 2009 report issued by the State Council, China's cabinet, noted that some of the developments lacked ''a rational design'' or had been built in areas prone to landslides.
Still, the researchers found a degree of satisfaction among some Tibetans, especially those who had prospered from the housing boom. But many others worried about how they would survive once construction ended and government stipends ran out.
''They don't have any other skills than farming, and won't have any herds or land worth speaking of anymore,'' Tenzin Gyaltso, a villager from Gyama, told researchers. ''How is the next generation to survive as Tibetans?''
For Mr. Bequelin, the program has become another means for managing a population that has long resisted government control. Arrayed alongside major roads, the settlements make it more cost effective to provide utilities, he said, but also allow closer supervision by the authorities.
''Since the state couldn't reach the Tibetan countryside,'' he said, ''they decided the Tibetan countryside should be moved to make it more accessible to the state.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Suspend Trade Privileges With Bangladesh

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE; Stephanie Clifford contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The Obama administration on Thursday announced plans to suspend trade privileges for Bangladesh over concerns about safety problems and labor rights violations in the country's garment industry.
The administration has come under intense pressure to suspend the privileges in recent months -- first after a factory fire there killed 112 workers last November and then after an eight-story factory building collapsed in April, killing 1,129 workers.
Trade experts said the administration's decision would be a substantial blow to Bangladesh's reputation and was likely to ratchet up pressure on its government to move more quickly to improve factory safety and end what Washington sees as widespread violations of workers' rights. Administration officials said they have offered Bangladesh a road map for steps it needed to take to have trade privileges restored.
In a letter to Congress on Thursday, President Obama said he was suspending the privileges, effective in 60 days, because Bangladesh was ''not taking steps to afford internationally recognized worker rights to workers in that country.'' 
Labor unions and Democrats on Capitol Hill have been pressing the Obama administration to take the step, saying the United States needed to go beyond stern words and take strong action to convey to the Bangladeshi government that far more needed to be done to ensure factory safety.
''The U.S. decision sends a very strong signal to the government of Bangladesh that they have to do things differently, that there's a consequence to the way they've been operating,'' said Michael H. Posner, a former assistant secretary of state of human and labor rights in the Obama administration.
The suspension will revoke the breaks on tariffs that the United States gives Bangladesh under the Generalized System of Preferences, a World Trade Organization program that seeks to promote economic growth.
While Bangladesh fought vigorously to prevent the suspension, worried about the signal it sends to its citizens and to global investors, some trade experts said the suspension would be largely symbolic because it will affect less than 1 percent of America's $4.9 billion in annual imports from Bangladesh.
The tariff preferences being curtailed cover a variety of products, including tobacco and plastic bags, but do not apply to the country's garment industry, which does not have American duty-free status and represents the great bulk of that country's trade with the United States.
Bangladesh, one of 125 countries that receive American trade preferences, is allowed to export nearly 5,000 products duty-free to the United States, which buys about 25 percent of that country's $18 billion in annual apparel exports.
In a telephone interview, Michael Froman, the United States trade representative, said that Washington's experience with ''trade preferences over the years is that the importance of General System of Preferences eligibility is greater than the numbers themselves, particularly in cases where the issue of G.S.P. eligibility has gotten a fair amount of attention in Bangladesh and elsewhere.''
He added, ''We've been in dialogue with the government of Bangladesh about improving worker rights and worker safety and in the absence of sufficient action, we felt it was important to take this action.''
The Obama administration's move may have some influence on the European Union, which is also weighing whether to suspend Bangladesh's trade preferences. Action by the Europeans could have much greater impact because Europe's duty-free privileges include Bangladeshi apparel and Europe buys 60 percent of that country's garment exports.
The damage Bangladesh's other industries will face from the suspension is expected to pressure the country's garment industry to make many of the changes Washington wants. Last December, the United States sent Bangladesh a list of areas that needed improvement. The list included ending government harassment of union organizers and giving more rights to workers in the country's special export manufacturing zones.
The federal government has not been unified on the suspensions, however. The Labor Department has favored them, arguing that Bangladesh and its garment industry have been slow to improve factory safety and end violations of workers' rights to form labor unions. At the same time, some State Department officials opposed the move, saying it would damage diplomatic relations with a country that has faced Islamist threats and would undermine the economy of an already poor country.
The Bangladesh Foreign Ministry issued a statement criticizing Washington's move, saying that ''this harsh measure may bring'' new obstacles to ''an otherwise flourishing bilateral'' trade relationship. It said it hoped that the United States would soon restore the country's trade preferences and it urged Western buyers to ''continue their business with their long trusted partners'' in Bangladesh.
The administration's move on Thursday was in response to an official complaint filed by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. in 2007. The labor federation was upset about numerous deadly factory fires, a 2005 factory collapse that killed 64 workers as well as extensive efforts by Bangladeshi garment manufacturers to suppress labor unions.
The Obama administration took that complaint with new seriousness after the fire last November at the Tazreen factory, which made garments for American companies like Wal-Mart, and the collapse of the Rana Plaza building two months ago. The collapse was the most deadly accident in the history of the world's apparel industry.
''We welcome the fact that our government has finally decided to take action after we've seen all these egregious labor rights violations,'' said Cathy Feingold, director of the labor federation's international department. ''We hope this will lead to real change in Bangladesh.''
The garment industry is a major driver of Bangladesh's economy, with more than 5,000 factories that employ four million workers. Bangladesh is the world's second-largest apparel exporter after China. Its minimum wage of $37 a month, the lowest in the world, has been a huge lure for manufacturers and helped the country's garment industry expand -- with many hastily and shoddily built factories as a result.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the Obama administration have expressed concern about the treatment of labor activists in Bangladesh. In April 2012, Aminul Islam, a prominent labor organizer, was found dead, his body showing signs of torture. Bangladeshi news media reported that government security forces might have had a hand in his death.
While Mr. Posner, the former State Department official, said the Bangladeshi government had not done enough to meet American demands for workplace safety, he added, ''They probably don't have the financial resources alone to do everything that's needed.''
Mr. Posner, now a professor at the Stern School of Business at New York University, said Washington's move added pressure on American and European retailers to further improve safety. ''It increases public attention to this issue and makes clear that this is a crisis situation.''
Wal-Mart, Gap and other major American retailers are working with the Bipartisan Policy Center to develop a plan over the next few weeks to improve factory safety in the Bangladeshi garment industry. But industry and labor officials say the American retailers are unlikely to agree to a legally enforceable plan like the one that has been embraced by more than 40 European retailers.

HEADLINE: City Council Hears Plea From Fast-Food Workers

BYLINE: By E. C. GOGOLAK

 BODY:
Naquasia Legrand works at two KFC restaurants -- one in Brooklyn, where she earns $7.70 an hour, and another in Queens, where she earns $8 an hour. Last week, she told a New York City Council committee on Thursday, she barely had enough money to buy a MetroCard and to feed herself. 
''There comes times when I have to decide if I want to pay my phone bill, pay the rent, or buy food for my family,'' said Ms. Legrand, 22, who lives in a two-bedroom apartment in Canarsie, Brooklyn, with her aunt, grandmother and cousin. ''Just because people have jobs these days doesn't mean they're doing good.''
Ms. Legrand was among dozens of fast-food restaurant workers and advocates who attended a hearing on low wages and wage theft.
Just before the hearing, about 100 people attended a rally on the steps on City Hall, demanding higher wages for the city's 50,000 fast-food employees. Together they chanted, ''We can't survive on seven twenty-five,'' referring to the minimum wage in New York State.
The economic reality for the city's fast-food workers is bleak. According to the advocacy group New York Communities for Change, fast-food workers in the city make on average between $10,000 and $18,000 a year, well below the Census Bureau's poverty income threshold level of about $23,000 for a family of four.
Low pay, however, is not the only problem. A number of workers who testified before the Council's Committee on Civil Service and Labor said they were not paid for the overtime they had worked.
A study issued last month by Fast Food Forward, a coalition of groups seeking to improve conditions for fast-food workers, found that about 80 percent of employees in the industry in New York City had experienced some form of wage theft in the past year.
Shenita Simon, a mother of three who works at a KFC in Brooklyn, said that to avoid paying her overtime, the manager would make her clock out even though she was still working. Yum Brands, which operates and licenses KFC, as well as Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurants, did not respond to phone calls on Thursday for comment.
Councilman Michael C. Nelson, the committee's chairman, said, ''When fast-food restaurants fail to pay their workers all the wages due to them it diminishes the workers' ability to support their families and increases their reliance on public benefits programs.''
As fast-food workers struggle to make ends meet, more people are working in the industry in New York City. According to the New York Labor Department, the number of jobs in the fast-food industry in the city has grown by 55 percent since 1999, a rate 19 times greater than the city's overall private sector employment growth.
It appears that the state may be preparing to crack down on employers who abuse the rights of hourly low-wage workers.
Last month, Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman announced that he was investigating the wage practices of several fast-food restaurants and a fast-food parent company suspected of cheating their workers out of wages. The names of the businesses were not disclosed.

Previews and Openings
'Choir Boy' (in previews; opens on Tuesday) The first new work by Tarell Alvin McCraney to be presented in New York since his breakthrough trilogy ''The Brother/Sister Plays,'' this reflection on the repression of gay sexuality via religion had a well-received premiere last fall at the Royal Court Theater in London. Set in an all-black prep school where a student struggles for acceptance in the gospel choir, the play was commissioned by Manhattan Theater Club. Trip Cullman directs a cast that includes Chuck Cooper and Austin Pendleton. City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (David Rooney) 
'The Designated Mourner' (in previews; opens on July 21) In a joint venture to celebrate the 40-year theatrical collaboration between the writer and performer Wallace Shawn and his frequent director, Andr Gregory, the Public Theater and Theater for a New Audience are presenting a two-part salute. First up is Mr. Shawn's 1996 play, a series of interlocking monologues in which three artist-intellectuals reflect on the hard-right turn taken by their unnamed, once-liberal country. Mr. Gregory reunites the cast of his celebrated 2000 New York production, Mr. Shawn, Deborah Eisenberg and Larry Pine, for the occasion. The celebration will continue in October with the American premiere of Mr. Shawn's latest play, ''Grasses of a Thousand Colors.'' Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Rooney)
'Julius Caesar' (opens on Friday) A relative newcomer among the city's alfresco summer classical theater offerings, Smith Street Stage's Shakespeare in Carroll Park initiative is now in its fourth year, presenting modern-dress productions with live original music. In a bid to shed new light on the tragedy of the Roman leader, Sarah Dacey Charles has been cast in the title role, skewing the perspective to consider the obstacles encountered by women who break through the political glass ceiling. Discrimination against same-sex couples also comes into play via the union between the female Caesar and her wife Calpurnia. Carroll Park, in front of Robert Acito Park House, Carroll Street, between Court and Smith Streets, Brooklyn, smithstreetstage.org. (Rooney)
'Nobody Loves You' (in previews; opens on July 18) The manufactured romantic drama of a TV dating show collides with the authentic emotional connection of a real relationship, creating complications for a philosophy grad student in this new musical with book and lyrics by the playwright Itamar Moses, and music and lyrics by Gaby Alter. Michelle Tattenbaum directs this Second Stage production, with an eight-member ensemble that includes Leslie Kritzer, Lauren Molina and Rory O'Malley. Choreography is by Mandy Moore, an Emmy winner for her work on ''So You Think You Can Dance.'' Second Stage Theater, 305 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422, 2st.com. (Rooney)
Broadway
'Annie' James Lapine's revival of the singing comic strip from 1977 is merely serviceable. But its smiley-faced mixture of hope and corn scratches an itch in a city recovering from a recession and a hurricane. Theatergoers may occasionally feel the urge both to mist up and throw up, but Lilla Crawford is a nigh irresistible Orphan Annie. With Anthony Warlow and Jane Lynch as Miss Hannigan (2:25). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Ben Brantley)
&#x2605; 'The Assembled Parties' Richard Greenberg's play about the decline of an affluent family is a throwback to a time when Charm -- with a capital C -- was a cardinal virtue in theater. It is also smart, sad and so impossibly well-spoken you may feel like giving up on conversation. Lynne Meadow directs a fine cast led by a singularly Charming Jessica Hecht (2:35). Samuel J. Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Kinky Boots' Cyndi Lauper has created a love-and-heat-seeking score that performs like a pop star on Ecstasy. This Harvey Fierstein-scripted tale of lost souls in shoe business, in which a young factory owner (Stark Sands) teams up with a drag queen (Billy Porter), sometimes turns into a sermon. But it's hard to resist the audience-hugging charisma of the songs in this Tony winner for best new musical (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Macbeth' Alan Cumming portrays the Scottish general who would be king, and all the other significant roles, in this one-man race through Shakespeare's tragedy, set in a mental institution. Mr. Cumming's virtuosity and the gothic inventions of the directors, John Tiffany and Andrew Goldberg, impress, but while the actor effectively differentiates the roles, he never fully inhabits any of them (1:40). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Charles Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'Matilda the Musical' The most satisfying and subversive musical ever to come out of Britain. Directed by Matthew Warchus, with a book by Dennis Kelly and addictive songs by Tim Minchin, this adaptation of Roald Dahl's novel is an exhilarating tale of empowerment, told from the perspective of that most powerless group, little children. Bertie Carvel is priceless as their schoolmistress nemesis (2:35). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Motown: The Musical' A dramatically slapdash but musically vibrant joy ride through the glory days of the Detroit music label founded by Berry Gordy. Mr. Gordy's book is sketchy and obvious -- you want to plug your ears whenever the music stops. But the music is, of course, some of the greatest R&B ever recorded, and the performers mostly electric (2:40). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood)
'The Nance' Playing a gay burlesque performer whose onstage specialty is mincing effeminacy, Nathan Lane combines shiny expertise and dark conviction to sometimes devastating effect, in this strained if heartfelt play by Douglas Carter Beane. Not even Mr. Lane, though, can reconcile all the disparities the script asks him to weave together. Jack O'Brien is the estimable director (2:25). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Pippin' Diane Paulus sends in the acrobats for her exhaustingly energetic (and now Tony-winning) revival of Stephen Schwartz and Roger O. Hirson's 1972 musical. As for the 99-pound story at the center of this muscle-bound spectacle -- the one about the starry-eyed son of Charlemagne (Matthew James Thomas) -- that's there too, if you look hard. With Patina Miller and a delightful Andrea Martin (2:35). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella' This ultimate and most enduring of makeover stories, via the team who gave us ''Oklahoma!,'' has been restyled by the director Mark Brokaw and the writer Douglas Carter Beane into a glittery patchwork of snark and sincerity, with a whole lot of fancy ball gowns. Laura Osnes and Santino Fontana are the appealing leading lovers (2:20). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'The Trip to Bountiful' Michael Wilson's slow-handed staging of Horton Foote's 1953 drama about an old woman's journey into the past is most notable for its remarkable star, Cicely Tyson, who seems thoroughly rejuvenated by her return to Broadway. The attractive supporting cast includes Cuba Gooding Jr., Vanessa Williams, and in a lovely, low-key performance, Condola Rashad (2:10). Stephen Sondheim Theater, 124 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike' Portraying a woman mired in what appears to be a permanent midlife crisis, the marvelous comic actor Kristine Nielsen provides much of the laughing gas in Christopher Durang's uneven but intermittently delightful riff on Chekhovian themes. David Hyde Pierce and Sigourney Weaver also star in this Tony-winning play directed by Nicholas Martin (2:30). John Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
Off Broadway
'Around the World in 80 Days' This stage version of the Jules Verne novel is an odd combination of steampunk and vaudeville. The actors' shameless mugging grows annoying after a while, but the pace stays brisk and the energy level high (1:30). New Theater at 45th Street, 354 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (866) 811-4111, aroundtheworldinnyc.com. (Neil Genzlinger)
&#x2605; 'Buyer & Cellar' Jonathan Tolins has concocted an irresistible one-man play from the most peculiar of fictitious premises -- an underemployed Los Angeles actor goes to work in Barbra Streisand's Malibu basement -- allowing the playwright to ruminate with delicious wit and perspicacity on the solitude of celebrity, the love-hate attraction between gay men and divas, and the melancholy that lurks beneath narcissism. In the capable hands of the director Stephen Brackett and the wickedly charming actor Michael Urie, this seriously funny slice of absurdist whimsy creates the illusion of a stage filled with multiple people, all of them with their own droll point of view (1:30). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 868-8444, smarttix.com. (Rooney)
'Cougar the Musical' Three older women find themselves attracted to younger men, two against their better judgment. The concept seems made for bus tours, but imagination, appealing numbers with original melodies and theme-transcending jokes lift this show well above the level of ''Menopause: The Musical'' and its ilk (1:30). Fridays and Saturdays only. St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Anita Gates)
'Cuff Me: The Fifty Shades of Grey Musical Parody' What can I possibly say that isn't said by the title of this production? Here's one thing: It's not exactly great theater, but I'd still rather see ''Cuff Me'' than read the novel upon which it's based (1:30). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Claudia La Rocco)
'The Explorers Club' Nell Benjamin's intermittently funny but mostly blunt-witted comedy, directed by Marc Bruni, features a lively cast in a farcical story of tweedy members of a British science club fretting over whether to admit a female member, played by Jennifer Westfeldt (1:35). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Isherwood)
'Far From Heaven' Hinting at shimmering vistas beyond picket-fence conformity, Kelli O'Hara's soprano provides the poetry in this generally prosy adaptation of Todd Haynes's 2002 film about a beleaguered housewife in Eisenhower-era Hartford. Though Scott Frankel and Michael Korie have written some alluring songs, the show often seems to confine its wonderful star, and her character, to two dimensions (2:15). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Brantley)
'5 Lesbians Eating a Quiche' This frolicsome play, about a women's club in 1956, ventures into such heady excesses of absurdism, it deserves to be called Mama-ist. (Dada wouldn't do at all.) As written by Evan Linder and Andrew Hobgood, with Sarah Gitenstein directing, ''Quiche'' takes a giant leap from punning smirkiness into the outer space of nonsense (1:15). Friday and Saturday only. Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, Manhattan, snappletheater.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Fried Chicken and Latkes' Rain Pryor, the daughter of the comedian Richard Pryor (who died in 2005), stars in this effervescent solo show, which recounts her upbringing in a biracial household (her mother is Jewish) in Beverly Hills, Calif. Ms. Pryor, who sings and portrays a range of characters (including, poignantly, her father in a spot-on impression) is an ebullient performer with a robust singing voice. She lives in Baltimore now, but her outsize personality is built for Broadway (1:30). Actor's Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Andy Webster)
&#x2605; 'Gibraltar' James Joyce fans will appreciate this ''Adaptation After James Joyce's 'Ulysses,' '' a play that focuses on Leopold and Molly Bloom. Patrick Fitzgerald, who wrote it, and Cara Seymour play a range of characters. True to the book, they also suggest a good deal about the bond between Joyce and Nora Barnacle, his uneducated wife, indispensable muse and model for Molly (1:55). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (Webster)
&#x2605; 'Here Lies Love' An invigorating poperetta, conceived by David Byrne, that sets a new standard for audience participation. Or do I mean coercion? In this heady show about the heady life of Imelda Marcos, staged with infinite inventiveness by Alex Timbers, all the world's a dance floor, and all the men and women (including the audience) merely disco rats (1:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'A Kid Like Jake' Daniel Pearle's smart, fluent drama explores the emotional complications that arise for a young couple (the excellent Carla Gugino and Peter Grosz) during the arduous process of obtaining a place for their 4-year-old son at one of Manhattan's exclusive private schools. Jake favors ''gender-variant play,'' such as dressing like Cinderella (1:40). Claire Tow Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (800) 432-7250, telecharge.com, lct.org. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'Murder Ballad' A small but savvy musical that panders in style to those of us who lap up febrile accounts of fatal attractions. Julia Jordan and Juliana Nash's contemporary tale of a razor-edged love triangle knows exactly what it wants to do, and does it most efficiently, with a four-member cast, directed by Trip Cullman. Staged last fall at Manhattan Theater Club's Studio at Stage II, the show returns with most of its original cast (John Ellison Conlee, Will Swenson and Rebecca Naomi Jones) and an addition: Caissie Levy, who has replaced Karen Olivo. Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (800) 982-2787, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'My Name Is Asher Lev' Aaron Posner's adaptation of Chaim Potok's novel feels like a well-made play from the era in which the story takes place -- the 1950s. Set in a Hasidic community in Brooklyn, this tale of an artistic prodigy has been directed with an attention to emotional nuance by Gordon Edelstein and features strong performances from its three-person cast: Ari Brand, Mark Nelson and Jenny Bacon (1:30). Westside Theater/Upstairs, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rachel Saltz)
&#x2605; 'Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812' Dave Malloy's transporting pop opera dramatizes an emotionally potent slice of Tolstoy's ''War and Peace.'' Rachel Chavkin directs a superb young cast who bring the loves and losses of 19th-century Russian aristocrats to vibrant, intimate life in a stylish cabaret setting expressly built for the production (2:30). Kazino, West 13th Street, at Washington Street, West Village, (877) 704-2821, thegreatcometof1812.com. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'Peter and the Starcatcher' The most exhilarating and inventive example of story theater since the Royal Shakespeare Company's ''Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby.'' This production, about the boy who became Peter Pan, is an enchanted anatomy of the urge to defy gravity. Roger Rees and Alex Timbers direct (2:10). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'A Picture of Autumn' Removing an aged parent from a beloved home that's no longer safe or convenient is never easy. Just imagine this scaled up a bit, with the parent clinging to a crumbling, 16th-century 18-bedroom mansion. Robert tries this thankless task in the revival of this 1951 play by N. C. Hunter. The play feels much too long, drawing out dialogues as if the audience had as much time to kill as the listless manor residents. But the cast (led by George Morfogen) is nonetheless stellar (2:20). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, minttheater.org. (Catherine Rampell)
&#x2605; 'Potted Potter' With no new Harry Potter adventures to pore over, what's a Muggle in need of a fix to do? One answer: this gloriously goofy parody by Daniel Clarkson and Jefferson Turner, which compresses a retelling of the seven books into 70 minutes, complete with a game of Quidditch. Clearly the two comics attended Professor Flitwick's charms class, because they cast the perfect spell over the audience: reductio ad absurdum (1:10). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Daniel M. Gold)
&#x2605; 'Rantoul and Die' Debbie, assistant manager at the local Dairy Queen, has had enough of Rallis, a whimpering man-child. But Rallis cannot bear the thought of living without her, and discharges several disturbing cries for help. This darkly funny play is by Mark Roberts, creator of the sitcom ''Mike & Molly,'' and he writes here with the expletive-laden catharsis of someone who has been cramped by CBS's Standards & Practices department for far too long. His dialogue is exquisitely vivid and coarse, riddled with saw-toothed similes and sinister non sequiturs (1:40). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (866) 811-4111, amoralists.com. (Rampell)
'The Silver Cord' The Peccadillo Theater Company tries to enliven this creaky 1926 drama about an absurdly possessive mother by having that role played by a man in drag (Dale Carman), but the move doesn't add much. The play, by Sidney Howard, who later wrote the screenplay for ''Gone With the Wind,'' just hasn't aged very well (2:15). Theater at St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101, thepeccadillo.com. (Genzlinger)
&#x2605; 'The Two-Character Play' Playing strung-out sibling theater troupers in Tennessee Williams's rarely seen fever dream of an eternal folie  deux, Amanda Plummer and Brad Dourif don't just strike sparks. They're a raging conflagration that keeps changing form and direction. Gene David Kirk directs this revival of a demented, messy and oddly affecting self-portrait from an American master (2:10). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Unbroken Circle' Eve Plumb, a k a Jan of ''The Brady Bunch,'' demonstrates a flair for grown-up comedy as a born-again Christian with drinking and divorce habits in James Wesley's comic drama. Too bad the production is uncertainly paced and a little unpolished, because the story of a 1970s Texas family dealing with the death of an abusive patriarch has a lot going for it (1:50). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Gates)
'Unconstitutional' Colin Quinn's entertaining spin through the history of our country translates wonky history into very funny jokes (1:05). Reopens on Thursday at Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (212) 352-3101, cherrylanetheatre.org. (Jason Zinoman)
&#x2605; 'The Weir' This first-rate revival of Conor McPherson's play gathers a group of friends as they tell ghost stories to drive away a loneliness than can be even more frightening (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (Ken Jaworowski)
Off Off Broadway
'A Cautionary Tail' Two half-Chinese siblings squirm under the iron paw of their menacing tiger mom. In their struggles to conform to unyielding parental expectations while remaining trendy, sexually adventurous, self-actualizing Stuyvesant students, the siblings end up turning against each other. In the age of Facebook, teenage spats can escalate quickly. Christopher Oscar Pea's script is sprawling and disjointed, but salvaged by direction from Benjamin H. Kamine, whose imaginative stagings and design choices are the production's real star (2:00). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (866) 811-4111, theflea.org. (Rampell)
&#x2605; 'Patti Issues' In his funny, tender coming-of-age monologue, Ben Rimalower traces the obsessive Patti LuPone fandom that provided him with an empowering role model. That inspiration proved perhaps most useful to Mr. Rimalower in processing the fallout after his father kicked down the closet door and bailed on the family. While on one hand, this is the story of many young gay men's propensity for diva worship, the tartly observed show goes several steps further by exploring the wide-eyed experiences that result when the acolyte gets to interact with his idol (1:00). Duplex Cabaret Theater, 61 Christopher Street, at Seventh Avenue, Greenwich Village, pattiissues.brownpapertickets.com. (Rooney)
'Showgirls! The Musical!' If ever a movie were ripe for a sendup, it's Paul Verhoeven's 1995 turkey, ''Showgirls.'' The lurid story of a hitchhiker turned pole dancer turned Las Vegas star is catnip for any devotee of camp, and this frenetic production pushes it into the camp stratosphere, with X-rated songs, abundant toplessness and a much higher male quotient. Alas, the movie's misogyny lingers. The tireless and fearless April Kidwell, however, in the Elizabeth Berkley role, is a wonder: Her vibrant physicality and knowing humor inadvertently constitute a welcome riposte to the story's mockery of its protagonist (1:30). (Wednesdays and Saturdays only.) XL Nightclub, 512 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-2999, showgirlsthemusical.com. (Webster)
&#x2605; 'Then She Fell' Inspired by Lewis Carroll's ''Alice'' books, this transporting immersive theater work occupies a dreamscape where the judgments and classifications of the waking mind are suspended. A guided tour of Wonderland, created by Third Rail Projects, leads its participants through a series of rooms and an interactive evening of dance, poetry, food and drink (2:00). Return engagement starts on Saturday. The Kingsland Ward at St. John's, 195 Maujer Street, near Humboldt Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 374-5196, thenshefell.com. (Brantley)
'Totally Tubular Time Machine' This show is less a play or musical than a big, campy, drinking party, with a little bit of singing thrown in. Held at an '80s-theme dance club in Midtown, it features celebrity impersonators who wander through the crowd handing out party favors (lollipops from Katy Perry, trucker hats from Justin Bieber) and taking turns at karaoke. The impersonations come with varying degrees of similitude and singing talent (2:00). Saturdays only. Culture Club, 20 West 39th Street, (212) 921-1999, totallytubularnyc.com. (Rampell)

Last Chance
'Ann' (closes on Sunday) Holland Taylor wrote and stars in this solo show about Ann Richards, the straight-shooting onetime governor of Texas. Ms. Taylor's engaging performance goes beyond impersonation, though the script is neither a dramatically shapely piece of writing nor a deeply probing character study (1:55). Vivian Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, lct.org. (Isherwood)
'The Boat Factory' (closes on Sunday) This two-man show by the Northern Irish actor Dan Gordon (who stars, with Michael Condron) vividly evokes the heyday of Harland & Wolff shipyard, the 300-acre Belfast expanse that among other things was the birthplace of the Titanic. The play's celebration of blue-collar craftsmanship, pride and dedication underscores values that seem lost in our digital age (2:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org. (Webster)
'Bureau of Missing Persons' (closes on Saturday) Lila Rose Kaplan's new play about a teacher who suffers a mental breakdown after losing a student on a school trip is sprinkled with bits of absurdity and magical realism and other charms; it's often hard to tell what is real and what is imagined. But the whimsical frills do not make up for underwritten characters, who remain disconnected from one another and ultimately from the audience as well (1:20). Fourth Street Theater, 83 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Rampell)

Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (866) 811-4111, rattlestick.org. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'The Comedy of Errors' (closes on Sunday) The director Daniel Sullivan is once again in top form in this buoyant and brisk (90 minutes!) production of one of Shakespeare's lower and lesser comedies. Updated to upstate New York in the 1940s, this stylish production features the terrific team of Jesse Ferguson, as the Dromios, and Hamish Linklater, as the Antipholuses (1:30).

&#x2605; 'Cornelius' (closes on Sunday) This engrossing revival of J.B. Priestley's seldom-seen drama, which was first produced in 1935, is both a warm, entertainingly old-fashioned play and a cool, prescient portrait of an economic system spinning off its axis. Alan Cox is superb in the title role of a divided soul struggling to keep a small business afloat.

&#x2605; 'I'll Eat You Last: A Chat With Sue Mengers' (closes on Sunday) Bette Midler gives the most lusciously entertaining performance of the Broadway season in John Logan's souffl of a solo show in which she depicts the Hollywood agent Sue Mengers, dishing great piles of dirt as she awaits word from her great friend -- and ex-client -- Barbra Streisand (1:30).

'Lucky Guy' (closes on Wednesday) Nora Ephron's elegy and valentine to the rough-and-tumble of big-city newsrooms and scoop-hungry reporters, starring Tom Hanks as the columnist Michael McAlary, is written with a true fan's avidity. Directed with bells and whistles by George C. Wolfe, this is less a fully developed play than a boisterous swapping of fond anecdotes about the end of a life and the end of an era (2:00). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Reasons to Be Happy' (closes on Saturday) Neil LaBute wrote and directed this winning romantic comedy (yes, Neil LaBute), a sequel to his ''reasons to pretty.'' As embodied by Leslie Bibb, Josh Hamilton, Jenna Fischer and Fred Weller, Mr. LaBute's characters remain articulately inarticulate and enlighteningly in the dark, reminding us that though friends and lovers may stop speaking, those relationships never really end (2:15).

'Roadkill' (closes on Sunday) Cora Bissett's unsettling site-specific theater piece takes its audience on a bus ride into the brutal and shameful world of sexual trafficking. Starring a convincing Mercy Ojelade as a 14-year-old girl forced into prostitution, this consciousness-raising production cannily elicits in its audience the sense of helplessness that is part of being a passive spectator (1:30).

'The Seagull' (closes on Sunday) The New York Classical Theater's free outdoor production of Chekhov's classic does a fine job of telling the story of its late-19th-century lovers, losers and dreamers at a Russian country estate. The translation can be simplistic at times, but the great lines are there and the settings (the audience moves en masse several times) couldn't be more beautiful (1:40).

&#x2605; 'Sontag: Reborn' (closes on Sunday) Moe Angelos portrays the celebrated writer in search of herself in Ms. Angelos's own adaptation of Sontag's journals and notebooks. The stylish multimedia production, directed by Marianne Weems, provides a moving X-ray of the writer's psyche as she moves through the crucible of youth (1:15).

'Still More of Our Parts' (closes on Friday) Neil LaBute's ''Call Back'' is the highlight of this touching and irreverent if uneven program of six very short plays from Theater Breaking Through Barriers, a company of both actors with disabilities and able-bodied artists. Tonya Pinkins is the star attraction as a Hollywood manager with a dying, publicity-hungry client in ''Supernova in Reseda.'' And Samuel D. Hunter's ''Good Beer,'' about a disabled couple on their first date, is a winner (1:15). Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, tbtb.org. (Gates)

Urban Stages Theater, 259 West 30th Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444, teaforthree.com (Jaworowski)
'Venice' (closes on Sunday) Eric Rosen and Matt Sax's action-flooded musical, about a once-and-future civil war, borrows some of its plot from Shakespeare's ''Othello'' and much of its tone from apocalyptic movie blockbusters. Yet it still seems to translate into the two-dimensional panels of a comic book as you watch it. The elastic-featured Mr. Sax plays the show's rapping narrator (2:30).

HEADLINE: Roosevelt's Legacy, Burning Brightly

BYLINE: By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN.

 BODY:
HYDE PARK, N.Y. -- We should expect presidential libraries to be a bit grandiose. They are, after all, self-erected monuments, not just repositories of papers and artifacts from the Oval Office. They are used to stake presidential claims, chronicling major crises, great successes and perhaps even a few small successes. As museums, these libraries echo the European royal models: they are created, in part, to celebrate their creators.
So, of course, continuous homage is being paid by the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum to its founder as it unveils a new permanent exhibition here on Sunday. Its director, Lynn A. Bassanese, points out that the exhibition represents the first major rethinking of President Roosevelt's life and career in decades at the library, and its showcase is a $35 million renovation, the building's first major overhaul since President Roosevelt himself dedicated the library in 1941. Roosevelt also created the model that with some variation has been followed since: a privately financed library (here once part of the sweeping family estate) donated to the government and overseen by the National Archives. 
What is remarkable is not that the overall effect here is celebratory but that it is so overwhelming. You emerge from this 12,000-square-foot exhibition (designed by Gallagher & Associates) in a state of justified amazement, not necessarily because new facts have been revealed, or because of new interactive video tables and screens with digital ''flipbooks,'' but because the exhibition, whose curator is Herman R. Eberhardt, so steadily recounts the history.
Between March 1933, when Roosevelt took office during the Depression, and April 1945, when he suddenly died just before the Second World War came to an end, the world was thoroughly transformed. Was there any other president whose administration spanned one of the country's greatest domestic cataclysms and one of its greatest international cataclysms? And whose actions shaped the consequences of each?
At the beginning of his first term, the exhibition notes, a quarter of the country lived on farms, and the federal government played a limited role in the economy. By 1950, only about 16 percent of the population lived on farms, and the government role was on its way to what we see today. Between 1930 and 1945, the percentage of unionized workers jumped from 7 percent to nearly 34 percent; the Democratic Party had reformed its constituencies; liberalism had shifted from a focus on individuals to a focus on groups; and the United States had become a world power. We are living in the world that Roosevelt ushered in.
The exhibition calls Roosevelt ''an activist president who fundamentally changed American political and economic life.'' And that is the portrait that takes shape. The themes sounded in his presidency -- the role of the state in the economy, the nature of the public safety net, the virtues and weaknesses of a free market, the dimensions of liberalism, the justifications for long-term war, the dangers in alliances -- are still being sounded.
In recounting this narrative, the exhibition draws on two earlier temporary exhibitions: ''Action and Action Now: F. D. R.'s First 100 Days,'' which in 2008 chronicled the astonishing roster of legislation Roosevelt shepherded through Congress in response to the Depression, helping to create the Public Works Administration, the Civilian Conservation Corps, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the National Recovery Administration. The other exhibition is from 2006, ''Freedom From Fear: F. D. R., Commander in Chief,''; it dealt with the waging of World War II. Some of the artifacts recur, but the new exhibition's scale draws on the full range of the library's collection, which includes 17 million pages of documents, like Roosevelt's 1882 baptismal certificate and a sketch he made in 1943 of what a postwar ''United Nations'' might look like.
The papers also include official carbon copies, telegrams, internal memos, privately scrawled notes, drafts of speeches -- providing an almost frenetic sense of personal intervention and decision. While reading, you see the mark of a rusty staple here, the crumble from a hasty grip there, the yellowing of age. There is a sense of the contingency to this history as it unfolds: events depended on actions and communications, with Roosevelt usually at the center. It is startling to learn, then, that almost all of these documents are meticulous reproductions rather than originals, which couldn't be exposed to the continuous light of a permanent exhibition. Ordinarily I might have been dismayed; the aura of the original is still powerful in imagining historical actors. But the reproductions are so fine, the exhibition so vivid, and there is so much to read and think about that the documents serve as illustrations rather than ends in themselves.
The most intriguing displays are actually scanned documents on video screens that present the controversies and debates during the Roosevelt years: Did the New Deal really end the Depression, or did the coming of the war? Why didn't Roosevelt support federal anti-lynching legislation? (He did not want to lose Southern Democratic support.) What were his attitudes toward race? What was behind the executive order that interned Japanese-Americans along the West Coast? Did Roosevelt do what was possible to help Jews fleeing Hitler's executioners? (At one point Alaska was considered as a refuge.) And did he give away Eastern Europe to Stalin at Yalta?
This approach has been used at other presidential libraries with some success (Harry Truman's I recall as particularly effective, and something similar is a feature of the new George W. Bush library in Dallas.) But the old permanent exhibition here paid little attention to debate, and even this one could have gone further. In the discussion of the New Deal, in particular, the exhibition is so supportive of Roosevelt's vision that excerpts from critical histories aren't given enough space to develop their counterarguments. These debates, at any rate, never really chip away at the imposing monument being built.
Two other themes in this exhibition might also have been thought to weaken its heroic dimensions but end up having another effect. First, there is Roosevelt's paralysis. During his presidency, there was a tacit understanding by the media that he was never to be photographed with his crutches or in positions of weakness; this was deemed important, because in the waging of economic and military war, a psychological suggestion of strength was indispensable (and convictions of the time equated disability with weakness). Among the library's 130,000 photographs of Roosevelt, we learn, only four show him with crutches; they are on display here.
And when we see those actual crutches, or images of Roosevelt being supported, it is not to emphasize what was once hidden but to reveal the heroic aspect of his private life. We lift a lever here and feel 10 pounds of resistance -- the weight of the crutches. The only time Roosevelt's disability was publicly acknowledged, the exhibition states, was when he returned exhausted from his 14,000-mile trip to Yalta, where he met with Stalin and Churchill. Roosevelt addressed Congress in March 1945 but remained seated, saying, ''It makes it a lot easier for me not to have to carry about 10 pounds of steel around on the bottom of my legs.'' Just over a month later he was dead.
We learn too that his wife, Eleanor, believed that his disability taught him a sensitivity to suffering that she had not seen before. The library's previous exhibition reserved a special gallery for Eleanor, but here she is woven into the story throughout, a force in her own right. She appears to have been a gadfly to the administration from the political left: various groups appealed to her when trying to reach the president. There are also occasional references to Franklin D. Roosevelt's infidelities and the possibilities of other romantic involvements. But this dose of realism does not diminish the couple.
There is much else here, including examples of Roosevelt's ''fireside chats'' -- the radio addresses that used the medium to create a new sense of democratic intimacy. While that sense is marred by the new clear panels walling off both Roosevelt's study and his Ford Phaeton (which was outfitted with special driving controls), an unimpeded view of his daily life can still be found at the Roosevelt house nearby.
The library exhibition now ends with a walk through the archive's hallway, offering glimpses into storage rooms showing paintings, books, sculptures, furniture and even Roosevelt's enormous model ship collection. There is enough for an exhibition twice as large -- if, that is, it weren't filled first by continued discussion and examination of the 12 years of this presidency, with its mixtures of failures and successes, and an enduring influence that is still being wrestled over.
In a video showing the opening of the library on Sunday, 1941, Roosevelt says that at that moment of world crisis, ''the dedication of a library is in itself an act of faith.'' It was. And its rededication this weekend, in a different way, still is.

HEADLINE: The Myriad Benefits of a Carbon Tax

BYLINE: LAURA D'ANDREA TYSON


HIGHLIGHT: A carbon tax would not only help the environment, but would also provide a relatively simple path forward in simplifying the tax code, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Laura D'Andrea Tyson is a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, and served as chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Clinton. 
Few goals in Washington have more bipartisan support, at least in theory, than cleaning up the tax code. Republicans and Democrats say they want a system that is simpler, fairer and more efficient. Put simply, they want a system with fewer special tax breaks and lower rates.
Yet one of the best ideas for advancing all of those goals - and also heading off catastrophic climate change - isn't even on the table. I refer to a carbon tax, which would impose a price on emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
Most climate experts concur that dangerous climate change is occurring at a more rapid rate than expected. They also agree that the deterioration in the earth's climate is primarily a result of carbon emissions from fossil fuel consumption by humans. If you dispute the overwhelming scientific consensus about man-made climate change and the role of fossil fuel emissions, you should probably stop reading now. Evidence is unlikely to affect your opinions. 
But if you accept this consensus, you should know that economists across the political spectrum agree that a carbon tax is the most effective way to discourage carbon consumption and lower the risks of catastrophic climate changes.
I am convinced by the environmental case for a carbon tax. But I want to make a broader argument: a carbon tax could be an engine for tax simplification, deficit reduction, less government regulation and even increased competitiveness.
To be sure, the environmental urgency alone is compelling. In May, atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide reached nearly 400 parts per million. When concentrations were last that high - more than three million years ago - humans had not yet appeared, the world was warmer by 3 to 4 degrees Celsius, and sea levels were 80 feet above where they are today.
United Nations negotiators have set a limit of 450 parts per million to prevent costly and irreversible changes in the earth's climate. At current emission trends, the world will cross this limit in a matter of decades.
The anecdotal evidence of climate change is everywhere: melting Arctic ice, new migration patterns for plants and animals and extreme weather events including record droughts, heat waves, epic floods and super storms. The frequency, intensity and costs of such events are increasing at an alarming rate. Climate scientists have moved from the view that such events are consistent with climate change to the view that climate change significantly increases the odds of their occurrence.
Economists have long contended that a carbon tax is the most effective and simplest way to reduce carbon emissions. Conservative supporters include Gregory Mankiw, a former economic adviser to President George W. Bush, and George P. Shultz, who was secretary of state under President Reagan. Economic centrists include Alan Blinder of Princeton and Robert Frank of Cornell University. Further to the left are the Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz and Robert Reich, former secretary of labor. James Hansen, NASA's former top climate scientist, is also a vocal champion of carbon taxes. So is former Vice President Al Gore, who has advocated carbon taxes for the last 35 years as the policy most likely to be successful in combating carbon emissions.
The beauty of a carbon tax is its market-based simplicity. Economists since Adam Smith have insisted that prices are by far the most efficient way to guide the decisions of producers and consumers. Carbon emissions have an "unpriced" societal cost in terms of their deleterious effects on the earth's climate. A tax on carbon would reflect these costs and send a powerful price signal that would discourage carbon emissions.
Producers and consumers would adjust their behavior in response to this signal in ways that are most efficient for them. And these efficient micro decisions would support efficient societal outcomes.
There's much debate about what the proper "social cost of carbon" might be, but there is no debate that carbon emissions are seriously underpriced. Any tax on carbon would be an important step in the right direction, and it could be gradually increased to give consumers and producers time to modify their decisions.
Without a tax, the government has to rely on second-best regulations to limit carbon emissions. Facing Congressional inaction and staunch opposition to a carbon tax, this week President Obama proposed regulations on carbon pollution standards for new and existing power plants using his executive authority under the Clean Air Act.
A carbon tax is also a cheaper and often more efficient way to reduce carbon emissions than subsidies for alternative fuels. Generous subsidies for biofuels have cost billions of dollars; by reducing the price of gasoline they may have perversely increased rather than decreased carbon emissions.
Other subsidies, like the production tax credit, have been successful at ramping up research, development and deployment of alternative energy technologies in recent years. Such subsidies would be even more effective in combination with a carbon tax that would make fossil fuels less price-competitive and would stimulate research on renewable and energy-saving technologies.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that even a modest carbon tax could reduce both greenhouse emissions and the federal budget deficit. A tax of $20 per ton of carbon dioxide, which would translate to about 15 cents per gallon of gasoline, would reduce emissions by 8 percent and generate up to $1.2 trillion in tax revenues over 10 years.
None of this is controversial to economists. As Professor Mankiw remarked a few years ago, the basic argument for a carbon tax "is so straightforward as to be obvious."
Politically, of course, it's anything but obvious. Republicans and Democrats fear that a carbon tax would antagonize voters by raising the prices of products with fossil fuel content for everyone who uses them. Republicans worry that a carbon tax would be a source of government revenue to feed "big government spending." Democrats worry that a carbon tax would be regressive.
Both objections are easy to address. The revenues from a carbon tax do not have to be used for more government spending; the tax's burden on low-income families can be offset by targeted income support measures, like those used in other countries to offset the regressive effects of value-added taxes.
Adele Morris at the Brookings Institution estimates that diverting just 15 percent of the revenues from a $16-per-ton carbon tax would provide enough money to keep low-income households whole. The remaining money could be used to finance a substantial reduction in corporate tax rates and reduce deficits by $815 billion over 20 years. Government spending would not increase.
Put another way, a carbon tax can be a central pillar of tax reform and sound fiscal policy. If a carbon tax were used in part to replace other forms of taxation, it would be a major force for tax simplification. It may seem like a "liberal" initiative, because its core purpose is to slow climate change. But a carbon tax also bears a strong resemblance to the kind of flat, broad-based tax on consumption favored by many conservatives.
Opponents of a carbon tax, and of climate-change legislation in general, often assert that it would put the United States at a competitive disadvantage. They usually point to China, the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases (the United States is in second place and not far behind).
The competitiveness objection to a carbon tax is crumbling fast, however. This year, China announced plans for a carbon tax. Many European countries with which the United States competes, including Germany, an export powerhouse, already have carbon taxes in addition to very high gasoline taxes.
In May, the World Bank reported that countries that either have carbon taxes or are scheduled to impose them account for 21 percent of global greenhouse emissions. If you add China, Brazil and other countries that are actively considering carbon taxes, the share goes up to more than 50 percent.
In his speech, President Obama said the United States must lead international efforts to combat climate change, calling for a global free trade in environmental goods and services and renewed negotiations on a global agreement to reduce carbon. The United States could breathe new life into these negotiations by announcing its commitment to a carbon tax harmonized with those of other nations.
A well-designed carbon tax is probably the single best tool for fighting catastrophic climate change and safeguarding the earth for future generations. It can also be a key component of tax reform and deficit reduction, both of which would enhance the nation's competitiveness. Much of the world is already heading for a carbon tax: the United States should get out in front and lead the way. As Mr. Gore recently blogged, "A tax on carbon is an idea whose time has come."

HEADLINE: U.S. Prism, Meet China's Golden Shield

BYLINE: DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW


HIGHLIGHT: Amid much criticism from the Chinese government over U.S. surveillance programs, a Beijing lawyer has officially requested that his state tell the Chinese people about its own surveillance programs. 

 BODY:
BEIJING - On Tuesday, shortly before China escalated its criticism of the United States over its global surveillance programs, saying they showed not just the "hypocrisy" but also the "true face" of the U.S., a Beijing lawyer named Xie Yanyi filed a public information request with the police asking about China's own surveillance operations.
Mr. Xie wanted to know: How was the state protecting citizens' rights to online and communications privacy? By what laws was surveillance taking place? Who granted the permission to monitor citizens? Were such activities approved by the National People's Congress, China's parliament? (Here it is in English.) 
"China has only been accusing the United States," but is silent about its own surveillance, Mr. Xie said in a Skype interview. "I don't oppose the government legally managing the public's interest," said Mr. Xie. "But it should not overstep its powers. I hope this will make people face the problem here too. China's surveillance system is extremely wild, there are no rules governing it that are worth speaking of."
Mr. Xie, a lawyer at the Beijing Kaitai Law Firm, who said he filed the request as a private citizen, said there were three programs in particular he wanted to know more about: Golden Shield, Great Wall and Green Dam.
Golden Shield is over a decade old, an overarching monitoring network spun by the state that encompasses the colloquially-named Great Firewall of Internet censorship (today it's made up of many different projects with different names); Green Dam is a now-defunct program to install software on computers to filter information. It wasn't immediately clear if Great Wall was a separate program, or if Mr. Xie was referring to the Great Firewall.
Chinese surveillance is extensive and invasive, say security researchers, dissidents and rights activists. Cities are installing large-scale, anti-crime systems that encompass telephone, text message, Internet and car number plate monitoring, facial recognition software and a range of other technology, according to this report about one such "Safe City" program called "Project 3.20," in the central-eastern cities of Taizhou and Jianjiang.
Since Mr. Snowden's leaks earlier this month, Chinese state-run media have loudly criticized the cybermonitoring practices of the U.S., especially following allegations that the N.S.A. hacked into at least one backbone of China's Internet, at Tsinghua University, and targeted people and organizations in Hong Kong and the mainland of China.
It has all got ordinary Chinese talking, said Mr. Xie - many for the first time. Because it was happening elsewhere, and the state itself was talking about it, ordinary people could join in the discussion. "You could call this an 'enlightenment moment' for many people," he said.
"After Prism started we could openly talk about it, on bulletin boards, on Weibo," or China's popular microblogs. "Most people were critical about the U.S. and supported Snowden. They felt the U.S. had overstepped its boundaries," he said. "The Chinese government was very happy."
Then the discussion started shifting to take in China's own surveillance issues. "After a while people began to talk about domestic surveillance," Mr. Xie said. Some comments were "strongly controlled," or censored, he said.
While state media have focused its criticisms on U.S. "hypocrisy," and not criticized the intrinsic concept of surveillance, recent remarks by a Ministry of National Defense spokesman, Col. Yang Yujun, and a surge of commentary in state-run media "appear aimed at persuading Chinese citizens that their government holds the moral high ground in Internet issues," wrote my colleague Chris Buckley.
One cybersecurity expert disagreed that it does.
"There are some stark differences between the United States and China when it comes to surveillance, transparency, and the rule of law, particularly as it relates to access to information requests," said Greg Walton, an Internet specialist formerly at the University of Toronto, now a cybersecurity consultant based in India.
"Mr. Xie won't receive meaningful answers to his request for information because of absurd state secrets laws that trump regulations on open government," Mr. Walton predicted. "Human rights researchers in the West know remarkably little about the surveillance state in China. The Chinese people know very little."
Mr. Xie said a key aim of the information request is not only to learn more about his government's surveillance activities and their legality, but also to try to further what he says is a global cause: the need for a new security architecture aimed at protecting citizens' rights to privacy. That included protecting intellectual property rights, he said. A key U.S. complaint against China has been that China has for years engaged in economic espionage.
"We are all facing a new challenge," he said. "We need a United Nations treaty, an international framework for this."
Said Mr. Walton via Skype chat from India: "It is hypocritical for China to use Mr. Snowden's leaks to attack the U.S. internet freedom agenda, just as it is hypocritical for the U.S. to restrict the 'rules of the road' to the theft of intellectual property - claiming that it doesn't engage in economic espionage against its competitors - or even allies." He said, "According to the European Parliament, for example, the N.S.A. has spied on Airbus to the benefit of Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas."
"We are all in this together, and where we do need international norms first and foremost is in defense of the right to openly debate and discuss global issues such as surveillance," he said. "Civil society has got to be protected from state-sponsored espionage - and in this area China has a dreadful record - a decade of aggressive digital spying against anyone who they feel challenges them - from the Dalai Lama to foreign correspondents, scholars to human rights activists."

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today&#8217;s Times, plus a look at what&#8217;s happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times:

        
Harnessing support from both sides of the aisle, the Senate passed the most significant overhaul of the immigration system in a generation on Thursday, Ashley Parker and Jonathan Martin report. But the bill's next roadblock is the House, which Republican leaders say will not take up the Senate measure, looking instead at narrower legislation.
 

        
While the recently expired Supreme Court term had elements of modesty, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has been playing a long game, persuading the more liberal justices to join compromise opinions as he patiently sways the court to the right, Adam Liptak writes.

        
President Obama had been hoping his trip to Africa would offer an opportunity for his first face-to-face meeting as president with Nelson Mandela, of whom Mr. Obama has long been an admirer. But Mr. Mandela's illness has ended the chances of a meeting between the two men, both of whom made history as the first black presidents of countries with deep racial divides, Michael D. Shear reports.

        
Federal Reserve officials worked Thursday to quell fears of a quick, early end to its stimulus campaign, saying that while they were increasingly optimistic about economic growth, the Fed would continue its effort to reduce borrowing costs as long as necessary, Binyamin Appelbaum reports.
Washington Happenings:

        
Continuing his Africa tour in Senegal on Friday, Mr. Obama will attend an event focused on food security for West African farmers. Later, he and his family will travel to South Africa, where he will visit the United States Consulate in Johannesburg.

        
Representative Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California, and Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, Republican of Florida, will talk about what could stand in the way of Congress passing comprehensive immigration overhaul at Bloomberg Government on Friday.

        
The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform is scheduled to consider a resolution on Lois Lerner, the former head of the Internal Revenue Service's division on exempt organizations, and her potential waiver of her right not to incriminate herself at a hearing in May.

HEADLINE: Daily Report: Dispute Over Tech Companies' Motives in Immigration Debate

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Technology companies say there are not enough skilled workers in the United States, while the labor lobby contends that there are eligible workers, but the industry prefers cheaper labor from abroad, Somini Sengupta reports in The New York Times. 

 BODY:
Technology companies say there are not enough skilled workers in the United States, while the labor lobby contends that there are eligible workers, but the industry prefers cheaper labor from abroad, Somini Sengupta reports in The New York Times. 
Silicon Valley companies say that it is too costly to retrain older workers and that the country is not producing enough younger Americans with the precise skills the industry needs. Their arguments have persuaded a majority of senators to give them what they want: a provision in the immigration bill to let in many more foreign professionals.
But other Americans and the powerful labor lobby say that what the tech industry really wants is to depress wages and bring in more pliant, less costly temporary workers from overseas. If there is such a talent shortage, they ask, why aren't wages for most engineers rising faster? Labor groups have pushed for a requirement to offer jobs to equally qualified Americans before hiring foreigners, a provision that the industry fiercely resisted.
The pitched arguments of both sides, which are likely to resurface in the House when it takes up its version of an immigration overhaul, cloud a complicated reality. There is little empirical evidence to suggest that foreign engineers displace American engineers as a whole. If anything, one recent study suggests, the growth of immigrant workers in American companies helps younger American technical workers - more of them are hired and at higher-paying jobs - but has no noticeable consequences, good or bad, on older workers.
At the same time, though, the industry's claims of a labor shortage may be somewhat overblown. Most workers with H-1B guest-worker visas hold entry-level positions. Economists say that bringing in more of these workers would serve to keep wages down. It also saves employers the trouble of having to retrain workers.

HEADLINE: U.S. Takes Aim at Corzine

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Jon S. Corzine, a veteran of Wall Street and New Jersey politics, faces the biggest fight of his career. | Federal Reserve officials showed their frustration with the rise in interest rates. | Lewis S. Ranieri has returned to mortgage bonds. | Derivatives can allow those who own them to create deception, a columnist writes.

U.S. TAKES AIM AT CORZINE | Jon S. Corzine, a veteran of Wall Street and New Jersey politics, faces the biggest fight of his career: a showdown with the United States government, DealBook's Ben Protess writes. Federal regulators sued Mr. Corzine on Thursday in connection with the collapse of MF Global and the apparent misuse of customer money during the brokerage firm's final days. Mr. Corzine ran the firm until its bankruptcy in October 2011.
The lawsuit, filed in the United States District Court in Manhattan, cites dozens of e-mails and captures previously unreleased phone calls to create the first real-time synopsis of a Wall Street blowup using executives' own haunting words, Mr. Protess writes. In one call, the firm's global treasurer indicated that the firm's liquidity "situation" was "not sustainable" and that "we have to tell Jon that enough is enough. We need to take the keys away from him." Mr. Corzine, who inherited a firm in 2010 that lost money in each of the previous three years, nicknamed this person "the Gravedigger."
Andrew J. Levander, Mr. Corzine's lawyer, denounced what he called "an unprecedented lawsuit based on meritless allegations." 
FED OFFICIALS SEEK TO EASE CONCERN | In three separate but similar speeches on Thursday, Federal Reserve officials showed their frustration with the rise in interest rates that began in May and accelerated after remarks last week by the central bank's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke. The economy is the victim of misunderstanding, the officials said, telling investors that they are misguided in believing the Fed's stimulus campaign is about to wane, Binyamin Appelbaum writes in The New York Times.
"I don't want to be too cute about a serious matter," Dennis P. Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said in Marietta, Ga., "but to make an analogy, it seems to me the chairman said we'll use the patch - and use it flexibly - and some in the markets reacted as if he said 'cold turkey.'" The speeches appeared to make an impression; stocks rose modestly while interest rates ticked downward, Mr. Appelbaum writes.
OLD CHAMPION RETURNS FOR MORTGAGE BONDS | 
Lewis S. Ranieri helped pioneer mortgage-backed securities in the 1980s. On Thursday, his new firm priced its first mortgage bond deal. With the recent turmoil in the bond markets, however, the $251 million offering was not without drama. The structure of the offering was changed to offer buyers more protection against losses, according to a person briefed on the matter who was not authorized to speak about the private deal.
ON THE AGENDA | BlackBerry reported earnings. The final version of the Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment index for June is out at 9:55 a.m. Thomas J. Barrack, founder of Colony Capital, is on CNBC at 7 a.m.
DERIVATIVES AS A TOOL FOR DECEIT | "For some derivatives, a desire for deception is the only reason they exist," Floyd Norris, a columnist for The New York Times, writes. "That deception can allow those who own derivatives to evade taxes or accounting rules. It can allow activity that might otherwise be illegal, were it not called a derivative, or that would face regulation if it were labeled what it truly is. Sometimes, banks use derivatives they create to help their clients deceive the public. Other times, they enable the banks to deceive those clients."
"The latest revelation of deception by derivative came in Italian government documents leaked this week to two European newspapers, La Repubblica and The Financial Times," Mr. Norris continues. "What seems to have happened in Italy is similar to something that we already know Greece did. Rather than borrow money - which would increase the reported budget deficit - the country entered into a derivatives contract that called for the banks to make large upfront payments in return for larger payments later from the government."

HIGHLIGHT: Peugeot&#8217;s founding family hands over control, and Ford announces a new special edition F-150. 

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 As Peugeot continues to struggle in a tough Eurozone economy, the automaker's founding family has agreed to relinquish control of the company in hopes that General Motors will inject fresh capital into it. The Peugeot family has owned a controlling share of the company since it opened for business in 1810, manufacturing coffee mills. G.M. already owns a 7 percent stake, but faces political hurdles if it takes Peugeot's reins, which it has said it will only do if it can cut production capacity. General Motors also owns a stake in Opel and would likely merge the two beleaguered car brands. (Reuters)
 Nissan announced Thursday that it would add 900 manufacturing jobs to its plant in Smyrna, Tenn. The new workers will help produce the Nissan Rogue, which has been built in Japan since its 2007 debut. Nissan said it expected Rogue production to begin at the Tennessee plant this fall. The company also says that by 2015 it plans to build 85 percent of the cars it sells in the United States in North America. (The Tennesseean) 
 With Ford F-150 sales going strong, it makes sense that blue oval leadership is getting creative with special editions of the truck. In a move to appeal to the street performance crowd, Ford unveiled the 2014 F-150 Tremor Thursday. With a short wheelbase and short bed, it is Ford's first EcoBoost-powered sport truck. The 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6 produces 365-horsepower through a 4.10-ratio rear axle with an electronic locking differential. It also has a bad boy black leather interior and bold paint scheme to match.

 It was bound to happen sooner or later: someone is running "The Homer" in the 24 Hours of Le Mons race in Buttonwillow, Calif., on June 29. Inspired by the car Homer Simpson devises for his long-lost half brother's car company in Season 2, Episode 15 of "The Simpsons," the BMW E30-based car built for Homer is ready for the track. The car lovingly recreates the cartoon version, from the bowler statue-topped, Rolls-Royce-esque Lincoln grille to the bubble dome rear seat. It even has a La Cucaracha horn. But unlike the "real" Homermobile, which was so awful it scuttled his half-brother's car company in the episode, the Le Mons version looks like it's got chops. Watch the little drifting snippet in the video. (Time Tech)
 The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission announced on Thursday that taxi owners will be allowed to choose hybrid taxis over the Nissan NV200 Taxi of Tomorrow mandated by the city. Taxi owners had sued the city over the NV200 because it is not being offered as a hybrid yet, but a court ruled in May that taxi owners should have the option of continuing to run hybrids. But Green Car Reports says that the city's lenience will last only until Nissan adds a hybrid model to its extended-wheelbase NV200 lineup. The Taxi of Tomorrow should come out this autumn.

HEADLINE: London Theater Journal: The Empire Crumbles

BYLINE: BEN BRANTLEY


HIGHLIGHT: &#8220;Mission Drift,&#8221; an American import at the National Theater, has plenty of showbiz spark as it makes the case that the United States isn&#8217;t a nation of endless reach and endless opportunity. 

 BODY:
LONDON - The empire is so over. No, not the British one. That's been dead for ages. I mean the American one, which I have now had the chance to watch disintegrating on both sides of the Thames. My first show in London was Lucy Kirkwood's sold-out "Chimerica" (at the Almeida in Islington), which portrayed the waxing of the East (as in China) versus the waning of the West (as in you know where).
When I slipped over to the South Bank the other night, to the National Theater, I was treated to the spectacle of the American dream evaporating like a mirage in the desert, or Las Vegas, to be exact. That was in a musical called "Mission Drift," which for the month of June has occupied the Shed, a provisional structure set up by the National in its courtyard while its Cottesloe Theater (soon to be reincarnated as the Dorfman) is being revamped. 
The Shed turned out to be the perfect spot for this lively production from the theatrical collective called the TEAM. (You'll probably like its members better if you don't know what the acronym stands for.) For "Mission Drift" makes the case that the United States is a temporary setup, too, at least as a nation of endless reach and endless opportunity.
Unlike "Chimerica," a British production, "Mission Drift" is American-born. It was staged at the COIL Festival in New York last year, where it wasastutely reviewed by my colleague Charles Isherwood. I decided to see "Mission Drift" basically because I wanted to spend some time in the Shed (which sounds kind of sinister, doesn't it?). And yes, it was appealingly shedlike, though far more comfortable than anything Stella Gibbons might have envisioned for her "Cold Comfort Farm."
But I also wound up having a high old time at "Mission Drift," along with the mostly, refreshingly young audience that packed the place. Directed by Rachel Chavkin (who staged the New York hit "Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812"- and written by the TEAM, in collaboration with Heather Christian and Sarah Gancher - "Mission Drift" finds plenty of showbiz spark in a world of ashes.
The show tracks four centuries of American pioneering as it follows a Dutch husband and wife (both eternally 14, and immortal) from little old New Amsterdam in the 1600s across a series of new frontiers. They end up in Las Vegas, building an empire of hotels meant to include their chef d'oeuvre, the Ark. (Apocalypse anyone?)
But they're derailed in 2008 by the housing bust, which also takes its toll on the show's second couple, a 21st-century cocktail waitress and the cowboy who loves her. Libby King and Brian Hastert play the forever-young Dutch kids, who keep changing their names but not their entrepreneurial spirit. And Amber Gray and Ian Lassiter are the latter-day casualties of their predecessors' pioneering.
"Mission Drift" is as thick on economic and historical data as it is on allegory, which could be tedious. This is largely avoided, thanks to the presence of a jaded, sultry lounge singer named Miss Atomic. (Well, you knew that atomic bomb testing would figure in this, didn't you?) She is portrayed by Ms. Christian, who has written a tasty slew of torchy, bluesy, burning-down-the house numbers for her and the TEAM troupe to sing and dance to.
So maybe toward the end, when the show mostly exchanges singing for sermonizing, I started to feel the weight of the centuries and the previous couple of hours. But having seen six full-length shows in four days, I was grateful for the opportunity to watch talented and dedicated young things playing in the sand (which is kept onstage in bottles to be spilled when the occasion requires) and drinking beer. Yeah, beer. That's what we call it back in the States.
Whiskey was the tipple on offer in the other state-of-a-nation show I caught that day, in a matinee at Trafalgar Studios. That amber-colored fuel (or its simulacrum) was deployed most entertainingly by the great Simon Russell Beale, who stars in Jamie Lloyd's revival of "The Hothouse" by Harold Pinter. Mr. Beale's character gets drunk on the stuff, for sure, but he also flings it repeatedly - and with crack vaudeville timing - into the face of a snidely insinuating employee.
The nation under the microscope in this case is Britain in the late 1950s, which is, it seems, already a madhouse run by the insane. (Told you the empire was long gone.) This early work from Pinter is set in a sanitarium where the patients are known only as numbers and have a way of mysteriously disappearing or becoming pregnant.
It's hard for the man in charge, Roote (Mr. Beale), to keep them all straight, and he would appear to be having the sort of full-fledged nervous breakdown that befalls dimwitted, rule-obsessed bureaucrats in satires of that era. Eyes in full bulge and brow in full beetle, Mr. Beale sputters and fulminates expertly through a series of music-hall-style encounters with employees played by a sly-footed John Simm, a sly-curved Indira Varma and a sly-tongued John Heffernan.
These characters have monosyllabic names to match their personalities: Gibbs, Cutts and Lush. And the innocent new worker there, played by Harry Mellingof the "Harry Potter" films, is called Lamb. He is sacrificed, needless to say, and in ways that anticipate Pinter's late-career examinations of political torture.
Mr. Lloyd's production, designed with moody end-of-days shabbiness by Soutra Gilmour, is better at conveying the comedy than the terror. (Ian Rickson's revivalfor the National in 2007 was more successfully double-edged.) Written in 1958, and put aside by its author for more than two decades, "The Hothouse" shows a young writer under the influence of absurdist predecessors.
Might these have included "The Goon Show"? Featuring more outright slapstick and dizzy dialogue than any of Mr. Pinter's later plays, "The Hothouse" suggests that the master of the comedy of menace might have pursued an alternate career as a writer for Monty Python. The interest for Pinter purists lies in looking for clues of things to come, particularly in the portrayal of Woman.
She is lusciously embodied by Ms. Varma as an artificial erotic construct, who crosses and uncrosses her legs in beguiling and threatening ways that foreshadow the Sphinx wife of "The Homecoming." Mr. Simm's balletic footwork of obsequiousness and officiousness is a treat.
Mr. Beale, his generation's most complex Hamlet, reminds us that he can deliver lunacy in more keys than one. And this "Hothouse," like "Mission Drift," reminds us of the theatrical energy to be minded from enervated empires.

HEADLINE: Temp Workers, Permanent Problems

BYLINE: JILLIAN DUNHAM


HIGHLIGHT: An investigative report from ProPublica and Time on temporary workers that&#8217;s truly worth reading. 

 BODY:
I found my first job out of college through a temp agency, which sent me to a brand-name bank where I stood in a windowless closet in a polyester-blend suit and heinous square-toed shoes filing carbons of personal portfolio data for individual-wealth-management clients. I was grateful to be hired, but during those humid, lifeless hours, I did think fondly of the days when I shoveled horse manure for $5 an hour. 
The experiences of temp workers chronicled by Michael Grabell for ProPublica and Time are far, far worse: getting up at 4 in the morning to sit in an agency office and hope for your name to be called; having no other option but to take van rides with as many as 20 other people to get to your job; taking home less than minimum wage and falling quickly into a hand-to-mouth scramble, always worrying whether your name will be called tomorrow.
Grabell writes that there are more temporary workers now than ever before, some 2.7 million people, according to Labor Department statistics. A temp job is perhaps better than no job at all (and can sometimes lead to a permanent one), but at least 840,000 of those workers are making less than $25,000 a year, ProPublica found. The temp industry is expanding at a rate 10 times that of the private sector - it's easy to speculate that this growth comes at the expense of full-time jobs.
"The temp system insulates the host companies from workers' compensation claims, unemployment taxes, union drives and the duty to insure that their workers are citizens or legal immigrants," Grabell writes. "In turn, the temps suffer high injury rates, according to federal officials and academic studies, and many of them endure hours of unpaid waiting and face fees that depress their pay below minimum wage."
Recruiting a temporary work force has become so important to American companies that there are so-called temp towns, where anywhere from 5 to 8 percent of the workers are in temporary jobs. "In many temp towns," Grabell writes, "agencies have flocked to neighborhoods full of undocumented immigrants, finding labor that is kept cheap in part by these workers' legal vulnerability." Minorities make up a large portion of the temporary workers; Grabell notes that African-Americans make up 20 percent of the temp industry, compared to 11 percent of the overall work force.
Low wages and a lack of any kind of benefits like health insurance or day care bolster Grabell's argument that the temp industry is creating a kind of vacuum for growing economic inequality. When one temp worker tells Grabell that she dreams of owning "a really small, little house," he asks if she thinks she can, and she laughs.
"'Earning $8.25 an hour?' she says. "I don't think I'll ever be able to do that.'"

HEADLINE: To Explain the Fed, Choose a Vice

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: Efforts by Federal Reserve officials to put the prospective tapering of monthly bond purchases in perspective have prompted a flurry of metaphors. 

 BODY:
The search for the best metaphor to describe the tapering of the Federal Reserve's monthly bond purchases later this year rolled forward on Friday.
The latest contestant is the Richmond Fed president, Jeffrey Lacker. 
"The Federal Reserve is not only leaving the punch bowl in place, we're continuing to spike the punch, though at a decreasing rate over the next year," Mr. Lacker said.
This was reminiscent of Thursday's best effort, which also invoked an addictive vice.
"It seems to me," said Dennis P. Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, "the chairman said we'll use the patch - and use it flexibly - and some in the markets reacted as if he said 'cold turkey.' "
(Mr. Lacker was riffing on a famous description of central banking by a former Fed chairman, William McChesney Martin. The job, Mr. Martin said, is "to take away the punch bowl just as the party gets going.")
The point that Fed officials are trying to make is mathematically straightforward. Since December, the Fed has expanded its holdings of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities by $85 billion a month. Starting later this year, perhaps in September, the Fed is going to buy less each month.
But - this is the key - the Fed will still be expanding its portfolio. More alcohol! More nicotine! More stimulus for the American economy!
It is relevant at this point to note that neither Mr. Lacker nor Mr. Lockhart is among the strongest supporters of the Fed's efforts. The supporters tend to favor metaphors less freighted with negative connotations.
Consider the choice of the chairman, Ben S. Bernanke:
"To use the analogy of driving an automobile, any slowing in the pace of purchases will be akin to letting up a bit on the gas pedal as the car picks up speed, not to beginning to apply the brakes," he said last week.
Ah, that's much more dignified. The Fed as designated driver rather than enabler.
Except, of course, that markets didn't get Mr. Bernanke's point, which is the reason we are now enduring the other metaphors.

HEADLINE: Rising Rates, and the Rent vs. Buy Decision

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: Buyers should take into account their personal situation, not just mortgage rates, when deciding to buy instead of renting a home. 

 BODY:
Mortgage rates have been rising, making it a bit more expensive to borrow to buy a home.
Home priceshave been on the upswing, as well. (The Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller home price index showed a 12 percent gain in home prices in 20 cities from April 2012 to April 2013.)
But some perspective is warranted. Mortgage rates are still historically low - they're expected to hover around 4 percent for the second half of the year, according to Freddie Mac. (The average rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 3.93 percent last week; a year ago, the average was 3.71 percent). 
And while home prices are rising, they are still relatively affordable. According to a Freddie Mac statement on June 18, "At today's house prices and income levels, mortgage rates would have to be nearly 7 percent" before the typically priced home would be unaffordable for most families making a typical income.
Jed Kolko, chief economist at Trulia, a real-estate site, wrote in a recent blog postthat despite the recent upswing in mortgage rates, the cost of owning a home is still low when compared to the main alternative: renting. In most markets, he argued, buying is cheaper than renting, and it will remain so until mortgage rates move significantly higher.
To see how much rates would have to rise before it becomes cheaper to rent, Trulia updated its "rent vs. buy" analysis to reflect home prices and rents (based on properties listed for sale and for rent on Trulia) from March, April and May. The result? Rates would have to rise to an average of 10.5 percent before the scales tip in favor of renting nationally, Trulia found.
In some markets where home prices are much higher, like many cities in California, the calculated "tipping point" is much lower. In San Francisco and San Jose, rates have to climb just over 5 percent to make renting more attractive. In New York and New Jersey, the tipping point comes around 7 percent.
While such rent vs. buy comparisons can be informative, they are, by necessity, made using a series of assumptions, which may or may not reflect your personal financial situation, said Daniel McCue, research manager at the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University.
For instance, he noted, Trulia's calculator assumes a 20 percent down payment. For a $200,000 home, that is $40,000 - an amount the typical renter is unlikely to have handy.
The site's rental listings also may not capture many individual apartments owned by smaller landlords, which may be less expensive than large, investor-owned apartment complexes, he noted.
The analysis also assumes that the buyer will stay in the home for seven years and so will benefit from a modest appreciation in price. But if you are young and mobile, you aren't necessarily going to stay in a house that long - so you lose out on the chance to earn back closing costs and other home-buying expenses.
(A complete list of the calculation's assumptions is available on Trulia's Web site).
In short, rent vs. buy calculations can help track trends, but it's hard to say that there is a single, magic number where home buying must be cheaper than renting - for you.
Are rising mortgage rates affecting your decision to buy a home? Do you think continuing to rent makes sense?

HEADLINE: The Return on College, Around the World

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: There are major returns, both public and private, to going to college. This is true around the world, but it is especially true in the United States. 

 BODY:
As my colleague Eduardo Porter wrote this week, there are major returns from going to college. This is true around the world, but it is especially true in the United States.
According to a report released this week by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, across the developed world the average person who has graduated from college (either two-year or four-year) and has any earnings makes about 57 percent more than a counterpart with no more than a high school education. In the United States, the comparable earnings premium is 77 percent.
Only four O.E.C.D. member countries - Chile, Brazil, Hungary and Slovenia - have a higher earnings premium. (The premiums are higher, I should note, if you look only at the universe of people with four-year degrees; across the O.E.C.D., the premium is 68 percent, and in just the United States, it's 84 percent.) 
The chart above also shows the earnings penalty paid by people who don't have high school diplomas. And just as American workers are rewarded unusually well for getting tertiary education, they are penalized unusually harshly for not completing secondary education. The average worker with earnings in the O.E.C.D. who didn't complete high school makes 76 percent of what the average high school graduate with earnings makes. In the United States, that share is 64 percent.
Now you might think that since the incentives to become more educated are substantially higher in the United States, then college graduation rates would also be higher in the United States. But in fact, while the United States had one of the highest college attainment rates in 2000, it has since fallen behind in the rankings.
Our graduation rates have risen, but rates have risen much more in other rich countries. In 2000, 38 percent of 25- to 34-year-olds in the United States had tertiary education (fourth place among countries tracked by the O.E.C.D.); in 2011, the share was 42 percent (11th place among O.E.C.D. countries, 12th place if you count a Russia, a nonmember country that the O.E.C.D. tracks).
Of course, there are other factors that affect college graduation rates besides the higher wage you get once you have the degree, including how expensive it is to enroll. And the private cost of going to college is much greater in the United States than the most other developed countries, which more heavily subsidize higher education.
In fact, as a special O.E.C.D. report on education in the United States notes:
In the United States, the public-private balance of expenditure on tertiary education is nearly the reverse of the average across other OECD countries. In the United States, 36% of expenditure on higher education come from public sources, and 64% come from private sources. Across all OECD countries, 68% of expenditure on tertiary education come from public sources, while 32% come from private sources.
You could argue that with the private returns so high to attending college, maybe the United States government is right not to provide more subsidies for higher education. But here's the thing: the public returns to college-going are also huge in the United States, higher than they are in almost every other O.E.C.D. country.
Here's a chart showing both the public and private returns of tertiary education for the average man in each developed country.
As you can see, the average return to taxpayers is $230,722 in the United States, versus less than half that, $104,737, across the developed world.
In other words, there should be strong monetary incentives not only for individual Americans to go to college, but also for taxpayers to help students actually graduate.

HEADLINE: In Africa, Competing With Beijing

BYLINE: CAROL GIACOMO


HIGHLIGHT: Critics are faulting the president for not going to Africa sooner and for lagging behind China in capitalizing on the continent&#8217;s potential. 

 BODY:
As President Obama visits Senegal, South Africa and Tanzania this week, critics are faulting him for not going to Africa sooner and for lagging behind China's leaders in capitalizing on the continent's potential. While there is truth to the complaints - there are good reasons to intensify top-level American engagement in Africa - there is also more to the story. 
Once dismissed as an economic backwater, the region has grown rapidly in recent years. China, ravenous for raw materials and new markets, anticipated this shift long ago and has been investing serious time and money there. In March, on his first foreign trip after taking office, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited three African countries.
China's trade with the continent was nearly $200 billion last year while America's trade was only about $95 billion. The United States, which for more than a decade has been focused heavily on wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, clearly has catching up to do.

But it's not as if the administration has ignored the continent entirely. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made no fewer than three trips to Africa during her tenure, including one last August that took her to nine countries over two weeks. As Mr. Obama is doing, she brought along a delegation of chief executives from leading American companies, a sign that U.S. priorities, like that of many African countries, had shifted from a preoccupation with humanitarian and development aid to trade and investment.
Beijing's role in Africa, moreover, has its down sides. Even as it pumps money into the region, there's little attention to local job creation. On big projects it tends to import Chinese workers.
On his trip, Mr. Obama intends to highlight an American agenda that goes beyond China's mercantilism, including promoting democracy and the rule of law, inspiring a new generation of young Africans and helping their countries develop sustainable agricultural industries.
Despite budget problems, the United States still does a lot of good in Africa. Mr. Obama has backed President George W. Bush's hallmark anti-AIDS program called PEPFAR and his administration has played critical roles in stabilizing Somalia, combating piracy and helping many African countries counter terrorist groups. The danger is that investments in counter-terrorism - including establishment of a drone base in Niger - are obscuring America's other non-military contributions.
Whatever the substantive criticisms about Mr. Obama's trip, it is ironic that he is also being faulted for the cost, which the Washington Post reported was in the range of $60 million to $100 million. Price tags for presidential trips are rarely disclosed but The Post said this one was in the usual ballpark. All president travel and all their trips have similar security, communications and logistics requirements. It's one necessary cost of being engaged with the world.

HEADLINE: Video of Deadly Clashes in Alexandria, Egypt

BYLINE: LIAM STACK


HIGHLIGHT: Three people, including an American citizen, were killed in the clashes on Friday, and the local headquarters of the Muslim Brotherhood, of which President Mohamed Morsi is a leader, was set ablaze. 

 BODY:
As my colleagues Kareem Fahim and David Kirkpatrick report, violent street battles gripped Egypt on Friday as supporters and opponents of the country's Islamist president, Mohamed Morsi, held competing protests that devolved into fierce clashes in several cities. The violence was particularly fierce in the port city of Alexandria, where three people, including one American citizen, were killed and the local headquarters of the Muslim Brotherhood, of which Mr. Morsi is a leader, was set ablaze.
There was little confirmed information about the identity of those killed on Friday or of their attackers. Security officials said the American was stabbed to death while taking photographs of clashes near the Brotherhood headquarters in the Sidi Gaber neighborhood. In an update posted to Twitter, the United States Embassy in Cairo, the capital, said it was "seeking to confirm" the identity of the American victim. 
As Egyptians took to the streets and protests spread across the country, footage of chaotic scenes flooded social media, including a number of videos that showed parts of the deadly clashes in Alexandria.
A video posted to YouTube and Facebook by AlexTV, a media organization based in Alexandria, showed fighting between rival groups of young men in the Sidi Gaber train station, one of the city's two main railroad stations and an important transportation link between Alexandria and Cairo. (It is in the same neighborhood as the burnt Muslim Brotherhood headquarters, outside of which the American citizen was killed, according to officials.) The video shows young men setting off fireworks, shooting firearms and pelting one another with stones inside the enclosed station, while police in riot gear and armored vehicles appear to watch impassively.
El Badil, a left-leaning Egyptian newspaper, posted another video from the Sidi Gaber train station that claimed to show the police firing birdshot at protesters from the Muslim Brotherhood. In the video, men in police uniforms walk along train tracks, joined by a small group of men in civilian dress, and fire several types of firearms at protesters. It is not clear if the protesters shown in the video are supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood and, if so, why the police would be firing on supporters of the president.
AlexTV posted a second video from Alexandria on Friday that claims to show young men attacking the Muslim Brotherhood headquarters. At least one of the men is carrying a small firearm. Several gunshots can be heard, and it appears that a rival group not seen on camera - either the police or supporters of Mr. Morsi - is trying to defend the headquarters. Several men appear to discourage the man with the gun from approaching the front line of the clashes, but he does so anyway and fires one shot before retreating. It is not clear what kind of weapon he fired, nor is it clear that this video shows an attack on the Brotherhood headquarters and not a battle elsewhere in the city.
At least seven people have been killed in a string of clashes in the Nile Delta and Alexandria in the last three days. The country is bracing for a day of protests planned for Sunday by opponents of Mr. Morsi, who have called for him to resign. A leader of the once-banned Muslim Brotherhood, Mr. Morsi is Egypt's first democratically elected president, but opponents accuse him of governing autocratically and presiding over a period of economic deterioration, political deadlock and worsening sectarianism.

A video posted to YouTube and Facebook by AlexTV, a media organization based in Alexandria, showed fighting between rival groups of young men in the Sidi Gaber train station, one of the city's two main railroad stations and an important transportation link between Alexandria and Cairo. (It is in the same neighborhood as the burnt Muslim Brotherhood headquarters, outside of which the American citizen was killed, according to officials.) The video shows young men setting off fireworks, shooting firearms and pelting one another with stones inside the enclosed station, while police in riot gear and armored vehicles appear to watch impassively.
El Badil, a left-leaning Egyptian newspaper, posted another video from the Sidi Gaber train station that claimed to show the police firing birdshot at protesters from the Muslim Brotherhood. In the video, men in police uniforms walk along train tracks, joined by a small group of men in civilian dress, and fire several types of firearms at protesters. It is not clear if the protesters shown in the video are supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood and, if so, why the police would be firing on supporters of the president.
AlexTV posted a second video from Alexandria on Friday that claims to show young men attacking the Muslim Brotherhood headquarters. At least one of the men is carrying a small firearm. Several gunshots can be heard, and it appears that a rival group not seen on camera - either the police or supporters of Mr. Morsi - is trying to defend the headquarters. Several men appear to discourage the man with the gun from approaching the front line of the clashes, but he does so anyway and fires one shot before retreating. It is not clear what kind of weapon he fired, nor is it clear that this video shows an attack on the Brotherhood headquarters and not a battle elsewhere in the city.
At least seven people have been killed in a string of clashes in the Nile Delta and Alexandria in the last three days. The country is bracing for a day of protests planned for Sunday by opponents of Mr. Morsi, who have called for him to resign. A leader of the once-banned Muslim Brotherhood, Mr. Morsi is Egypt's first democratically elected president, but opponents accuse him of governing autocratically and presiding over a period of economic deterioration, political deadlock and worsening sectarianism.

HEADLINE: Visit by Obama Is Overshadowed by Mandela Vigil

BYLINE: By DECLAN WALSH and MICHAEL D. SHEAR; Rick Lyman contributed reporting from Johannesburg, Lydia Polgreen from New York and Alan Cowell from London.

 BODY:
JOHANNESBURG -- Nelson Mandela always wanted to go quietly. Despite his stature as a global icon, he sought a dignified withdrawal from public life in recent years; privately he told aides of his desire for a quiet funeral, stripped of pomp.
That is not how it is happening now. With Mr. Mandela in critical condition in a hospital from a serious lung infection, and as President Obama arrived Friday for a state visit, the country was in the grip of passions, ceremony and controversy as its people come to terms with finally bidding Mr. Mandela farewell.
Outside the hospital gates, South Africans of all races prayed, sang and dropped flowers for their revered father figure. Less harmoniously, a simmering family feud over his funeral arrangements burst into public view. A 65-year-old woman claiming to be his illegitimate daughter stepped forward, demanding to be let into the hospital to meet him.
In the evening, Mr. Obama entered the fray, faced with a delicate diplomatic balancing act involving statesmanship, policy and respect for a fading hero. Mr. Obama, who had planned weeks ago to visit Mr. Mandela during this trip, wishes to honor the man who inspired his career in politics, mindful that he is arriving as South Africans are sorrowful over their beloved former president's condition. 
''I don't need a photo-op,'' Mr. Obama said while on his way to South Africa, where he landed just a few miles from the Pretoria hospital where Mr. Mandela has been lying in intensive care. ''Right now, our main concern is with his well-being, his comfort, and with the family's well-being and comfort.''
At any other time, Mr. Obama's arrival would have been a symbolically potent moment with resonance for both countries: America's first black president visiting a nation that only two decades ago shook off the yoke of white minority rule.
But for South Africans, their hearts, if not their eyes, were focused on something else.
''This trip is overshadowed by Nelson Mandela's illness,'' said Justice Malala, a political commentator and columnist. ''Its impact will be blunted because people's attention is elsewhere.''
Some unfolding events seemed to be exactly what Mr. Mandela had hoped to avoid. A court hearing in a provincial town on Friday exposed a bitter family rift over arrangements for his funeral.
Mr. Mandela has long been painfully aware of the divides within his family, and on Friday lawyers and magistrates confirmed that 16 Mandela relatives, led by his eldest daughter, Makaziwe Mandela, had filed a lawsuit against a grandson, Mandla Mandela, a tribal chief.
A report from South Africa's national broadcaster pointed to a macabre squabble at work: the plaintiffs want to compel Mandla to rebury three relatives, who had been exhumed and moved some years ago from the family graveyard at Qunu, Nelson Mandela's home village, back in their original graves.
The court action appeared to stem from an argument over where Mr. Mandela should be buried. Mandla prefers a site at the headquarters of his tribal village of Mvezo, where Mr. Mandela was born; the rest of the family wants him to be buried at Qunu, where he grew up.
Among some South Africans, the government's careful management of news about Mr. Mandela even stoked speculation that it was somehow keeping him alive in order to facilitate Mr. Obama's trip. The government flatly rejected such rumors.
''Urban legend,'' said Mac Maharaj, the presidential spokesman. ''That has been put to us before, and it is wrong. People take the government's report as accurate.''
Mr. Obama, who is accompanied by his wife, Michelle, and their daughters, Sasha and Malia, arrived from Senegal and was due to travel to Tanzania on Sunday. His long-awaited African tour is intended to stress the importance of trade, not aid, for the continent.
''Everything we do is designed to make sure that Africa is not viewed as a dependent, as a charity case, but is instead viewed as a partner,'' he told reporters on Friday.
In South Africa, Mr. Obama plans to salute Mr. Mandela's life with a visit on Sunday to Robben Island, the prison where Mr. Mandela spent 18 years in a tiny cell, now a somber tourist attraction inhabited mainly by penguins.
Mr. Obama's host here will be President Jacob Zuma, a controversial figure who in some ways epitomizes the disappointments of the post-Mandela era.
A charismatic populist, Mr. Zuma has attracted fire for his views -- he is a practicing polygamist who believes all women should get married -- while his penchant for singing his signature song, ''Bring Me My Machine Gun,'' causes some supporters to cringe.
Mr. Zuma's reputation has been dented by a 2006 rape trial (even though he was acquitted), corruption accusations and his handling of the police shooting of 34 striking platinum miners last August.
On Saturday, he will meet with Mr. Obama to discuss economic development, security issues in Sudan and Central Africa, and efforts to promote democracy on the continent. A day later, on Sunday, Mr. Obama is scheduled to deliver the major speech of his trip at the University of Cape Town, where Robert F. Kennedy made a famous address in 1966.
It is unclear whether either side will nod to the more controversial aspects of America's historical engagement with South Africa: accusations that the C.I.A. helped the apartheid police arrest Mr. Mandela in 1962, or the fact that the State Department removed Mr. Mandela from its terrorist list only in 2008 -- 15 years after he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Along with enthusiastic well-wishers, Mr. Obama is expected to confront protests about his foreign policies from a coalition of trade unionists, students, lawyers and Muslim groups.
Looming over the visit is the possibility of Mr. Mandela's death. White House officials say that Mr. Obama will ''gauge the situation'' when deciding whether to visit Mr. Mandela, based on his condition. While aides would not discuss their contingency plans, they have indicated the president's schedule might change.
For South Africans, however, the American president's visit was not the biggest story of the day. The tide of public worry has focused on the Mediclinic Heart Hospital in Pretoria, where a wall of handwritten notes and balloons has become a shrine of sorts to Mr. Mandela.
His wife, Graa Machel, sleeps in a room nearby, remaining far from public view. In recent days, visiting relatives have emerged from the hospital with often worrisome news. ''I won't lie, it doesn't look good,'' Makaziwe Mandela said on Thursday.
But on Friday Mr. Mandela's former wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela offered a note of hope. He was showing ''great improvement'' compared with a few days earlier, she told reporters.
Tension over the intense news media coverage at the hospital, stoked by criticism from the Mandela family, continued on Friday. The police detained a South African filmmaker who flew a radio-controlled helicopter, with a camera mounted underneath, over the scene.
Despite his stated desire for a quiet goodbye, Mr. Mandela has long been used to the idea of leveraging his celebrity in the service of his struggle for freedom, said Mr. Malala, the political analyst.
''He was always someone who understood the value of spectacle,'' he said. ''The liberation struggle needed a face, a symbol. And he understood that was the price that had to be paid.''

HEADLINE: Slim Savings, Earning Little

BYLINE: By ANN CARRNS

 BODY:
Despite improvement in the economy, more than a fourth of Americans have no emergency savings. And those who do manage to sock away some money in basic savings accounts get abysmal interest on their funds and sometimes have to pay excessive fees.
Half of Americans have less than three months of expenses saved up, and just a quarter have six months saved, which is the typical recommendation for emergency financial reserves, according to a report from the financial Web site Bankrate.com. The survey by Princeton Survey Research Associates International queried 1,004 adults from June 6 to 9 using landlines and cellphones. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4 percentage points. 
Meanwhile, in a separate report, the Consumer Federation of America finds that statement or passbook savings accounts, the main place where lower- and moderate-income consumers put their savings to cover unexpected expenses like car repairs or dental bills, are very stingy with their interest rates and sometimes hit customers with extra fees. The accounts are used by about three-fifths of households nationally, the report found.
The federation's report is based on an analysis of information about traditional savings accounts from the Federal Reserve Board's 2010 Survey of Consumer Finances, and research on the Web sites of 150 banks, including the 50 largest as measured by the number of branches, as well as the 10 largest credit unions. The Federal Reserve data was analyzed for the federation by Catherine Montalto, a family economics professor at Ohio State University.
The federation's report found that 17 percent of banks reviewed paid just 0.01 percent interest or less, or no more than 10 cents annually, on a $1,000 balance. Just 4 percent of the banks pay more than 0.25 percent on basic savings accounts. Interest rates on such accounts, in short, are ''ridiculously low,'' said Stephen Brobeck, the federation's executive director, during a telephone briefing.
What's more, the accounts may hit customers with significant fees that wipe out even the negligible interest they earn. For instance, in a sample of about two dozen banks, some banks charge fees from $1 to $12 if the account is inactive for as little as six months. While most banks don't charge the fees unless the balance drops below a minimum balance (sometimes as low as $50), one online bank charges a $10 fee after six months of inactivity, regardless of the balance.
The inactivity fees are especially burdensome for savers who have built their account to a certain level as an emergency cushion and then just let it sit until needed, said Mr. Brobeck. ''A consumer who wants to park funds but doesn't make additional deposits and doesn't have any emergencies could get whacked with these fees,'' he said.
Some banks also penalize customers for excessive withdrawals. Federal regulations limit withdrawals from a savings account to six per month. But a significant number of banks -- half of the large banks in the study -- limit withdrawals to three a month and charge fees for each withdrawal over the limit. The fees vary widely, from 50 cents to $15 at large and medium banks and 50 cents to $10 at small banks.
The Bankrate report found that while the savings numbers are slightly better than before the recession, when just 39 percent had three months of expenses in the bank, they are still troubling, said Greg McBride, senior financial analyst at Bankrate.
The main culprit appears to be stagnating wages, he said; people have shed debt since the recession, but they still don't have much excess cash.
It's true that interest rates don't offer much incentive to save, but Mr. McBride said an emergency fund was not meant to earn big investment returns. Rather, it's just what it should be: a safe stash of cash for unexpected expenses.
The best way to build an emergency fund, he suggested, is to arrange for automatic transfers from a checking account into a savings account.
By arranging for automatic transfers, most savings accounts waive monthly service fees, Mr. Brobeck of the consumer federation said.
Do you have an emergency fund? Is it kept in a typical savings account?
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Predictions on Fed Strategy That Did Not Come to Pass

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
ON the day after Democrats lost control of the House of Representatives in the 2010 midterm election, the Federal Reserve announced it would purchase $600 billion in Treasury securities -- a program that quickly became known as Q.E.2, for quantitative easing.
While the first such program started at the height of the credit crisis in 2008, the new program came when the economy was growing, and it was subjected to immediate and withering criticism, particularly from conservatives fearful it would set off inflation and unimpressed by the Fed's belief that action was needed to spur job growth. 
A group of 43 economists, including former aides to Republican presidents and presidential candidates, published an open letter to the Fed's chairman, Ben Bernanke, saying the program should be ''reconsidered and discontinued.'' The planned bond purchases ''risk currency debasement and inflation, and we do not think they will achieve the Fed's objective of promoting employment,'' the economists wrote.
The Fed did not back down, and Republican efforts to pass legislation removing the Fed's mandate to seek full employment were not successful. The next year, the Fed moved on to what became known as Q.E.3, also known as Operation Twist, an effort to bring down long-term interest rates by purchasing longer-term Treasuries. That move was criticized by Republican leaders even before it was announced. ''We have serious concerns that further intervention by the Federal Reserve could exacerbate current problems or further harm the U.S. economy,'' the Congressional leadership said in a letter sent to Mr. Bernanke while the Fed was meeting.
Now, the Fed is again under attack, as officials discuss the possibility of slowing the pace of bond purchases later this year, and of possibly ending the program as early as 2014. That talk has caused interest rates to rise and led to warnings of large losses for bond investors, amid complaints that it is still too early to proclaim that the recovery has gathered strength.
Losses for bond holders are sure to happen at some point, assuming interest rates return to more normal levels, and this week's downward revision of first-quarter economic growth may provide a warning that the Fed's growth expectations, which are more robust than those of many economists, may be too rosy. Navigating an end to quantitative easing, whenever that becomes necessary, may yet prove to be tricky.
But as the accompanying charts indicate, the Fed's critics of 2010 and 2011 have not proved to be prescient. Far from bringing disaster, Q.E.2 appears to have helped the economy.
It is remarkable how close many markets are now to where they were when the Fed announced the program on Nov. 3, 2010. The recent rise in 10-year Treasury bond rates has left the yield just a little lower than when the program began. The price of gold spiked to record highs in 2011 but is now down about 8 percent from its pre-Q.E.2 level.
In 2010, there were complaints from developing countries that the Fed was trying to drive down the value of the dollar, something Fed officials denied while conceding that the program could temporarily have that effect. Now the dollar index -- based on the value of the American currency against six foreign currencies -- has recovered all the lost ground.
Inflation has been quiet, and perhaps more important from a central bank perspective, inflationary expectations remain subdued. Such expectations can be inferred by comparing yields of inflation-protected Treasury securities to ordinary Treasuries of the same maturity. The chart shows what the markets expect inflation will be in five years.
For a time last year, the markets were expecting deflation -- a far cry from the runaway inflation feared by Fed critics in 2010. Now, the expectation is for inflation of a little over 1 percent -- or less than the expectation when the Q.E.2 program was begun.
The decline in unemployment since the Fed began Q.E.2 has been steady but hardly inspiring, and there are still fewer people working than there were before the credit crisis began in 2008. But consumer confidence has been rising recently and the stock market, despite some recent Fed-induced jitters, remains more than 30 percent above its level when the program began.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: A Policy That Worked: Since Nov. 3, 2010, when the Federal Reserve announced what became known as QE2, or the second round of quantitative easing, stock prices have risen. Inflation expectations and interest rates are not far from where they were then, despite recent increases. Gold prices soared, but have now fallen back, and the dollar, after losing value in 2011, has recovered. (Source: Bloomberg)

HEADLINE: Consumer Sentiment Ended June Near a Six-Year High

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Consumer sentiment improved, ending this month close to a six-year high set in May, as optimism among higher-income families rose to its strongest level in six years, a survey released on Friday showed. 
The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's final reading on the overall index on Americans' consumer sentiment was 84.1 points, slightly below the 84.5 in May. The new figure was higher than the preliminary reading of 82.7.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the final June reading of 82.8.
''Consumers believe the recovery has achieved an upward momentum that will not be easily reversed,'' Richard Curtin, survey director, said in a statement.
He added that the recent drop in stock prices and the jump in mortgage rates had not caused a deterioration in consumers' view on the economy.
''To be sure, few high- or low-income consumers expect the economy to post robust gains or think the unemployment rate will drastically shrink during the year ahead,'' Mr. Curtin said.
Consumer sentiment is considered by some economists as a predictor on consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of the United States economy.
Also on Friday, the Institute for Supply Management-Chicago said its index on Midwest business activity posted a steeper-than-expected drop in June to 51.6. A reading below 50 points suggests business contraction.
''It's not firmly in expansion territory where businesses are ready to hire and invest,'' said Tim Quinlan, an economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, N.C.
In the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's data, there was a divergence in outlook between higher-income families and lower-income ones.
Higher-income households showed increased optimism about their incomes and wealth, while lower-income ones reported less optimism. Families in the top third of incomes were the most optimistic since the June 2007 survey.

HEADLINE: Redrawing the Family Debate

BYLINE: By ANAND GIRIDHARADAS

 BODY:
NEW YORK -- When the television series ''Mad Men'' debuted in 2007, virtually everyone it portrayed was steadily (if not thrillingly) married, children tended to grow up with their fathers, women kept to their place, and nobody was known to be gay.
And then, over eight plot years, the future happens. 
Women rise and seek equality. Marriages are fled more easily. Children start to grow up without fathers. Grandparents step in to help single mothers. Gay people peek out of the closet, and some straights seem unfazed. Marriage and childbearing are delayed for careers. Couples cooperate in child rearing without marrying. Double-income households let children slip through the cracks.
For a fictional series set half a century ago, ''Mad Men'' does a remarkable job of reflecting America's present-day struggles with changing family patterns. It takes care to show how progress and decay walk arm in arm, how good change can sour into bad.
Alas, this nuance and complexity are virtually absent from the nonfiction realm of the national political conversation. In a period of stunning change in the structures of family life, America isn't having an honest, broad-based discussion about how to cope.
In part, that's because same-sex marriage has consumed so much of the oxygen surrounding the issue. With the Supreme Court this past week giving a pair of victories to proponents of such marriage, it may be time to have the rest of the discussion.
Of course, the conversation has also been limited because of polarization. Whether on Capitol Hill in Washington or at dinner tables from coast to coast or in the blogosphere, Americans are bitterly divided over how to talk about the changing family.
Discussions on the right typically narrate a nostalgic story centered on the collapse of marriage. It used to be strong and stable, the story goes; now it's threatened by gays, premarital sex, careerism, divorce, absent fatherhood and a too-permissive culture. This worldview tends to see other social problems -- like crime and the drug war -- as inevitable byproducts of weak families.
''Communities, neighbors, states and nations bear large costs at the collective levels when families break down,'' W. Bradford Wilcox, director of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia, has said. ''Evidence suggests to us that intact, biological marriage is still the gold standard.''
Discussions on the left tend to be haunted by history. For too long, the story goes, state power has been used to sanction one type of family life, at the expense of all those who failed to conform to that standard: gays, minorities, the childless, divorcs. Far better, the logic goes, to leave people to make their own choices and provide government support so that families are luxuries, not economic necessities. Where the fraying family is discussed, it tends to be presented as a consequence of other social problems -- like unemployment and mass incarceration -- rather than a cause.
''Surely a country that claims compassion and democracy as core values should reject as inadequate and misleading the marriage and fatherhood formula as a response to poverty,'' said a report published in 2008 by the liberal groups Political Research Associates and the Women of Color Resource Center. ''True compassion and democracy would respect the right of low-income women to make their own decisions and provide proven pathways out of poverty as the first line of assistance.''
Starkly opposed positions may be good for think-tank fund-raising, but they do not a good society make. Is there a middle ground between doing too much and doing nothing? Between family conformity and family dissolution? Between nostalgia for a perfect family that's never coming back (and may never have existed) and a refusal of the idea that life is easier when you're not alone?
That middle ground may be found by thinking of the family as, in effect, a huddle: a way of sharing risk and joy, having others to lean on when life makes it hard to stand. It will be hard for the extremists to swallow, but it may be possible to argue, in the very same breath, that the huddles people form are inevitably growing ever more diverse; and that huddling makes life easier than not.
''Is 'the family' a barbaric, premodern holdover institution, perpetuating irrational relations and inherited forms of inequality?'' Philip N. Cohen, a University of Maryland sociologist who studies the institution, writes on his blog. ''Or is it a 'haven in a heartless world,''' he asks, ''one of the few places where people still have any loyalty to anyone but themselves? I think it's both.''
If that is so, it is worth continuing to argue, as we have been, about the appropriate forms, legally and otherwise, of huddle. But the more urgent discussion may be about the unhuddled.
Gay or straight, old or young, a staggering number of Americans live isolated today. They struggle to make reliable commitments and to have reliable commitments made to them. They create children they cannot raise. They grow up with too few hours of devoted parenting. They live alone, one doctor's bill from ruin.
Everyone has their preferred culprit: welfare, bad schools, tax policy, drug laws, hip-hop, the vaporization of manufacturing jobs.
Perhaps all these things are involved. But if the national dialogue continues to dwell on what forms of huddling should be legal, it risks missing the forest for the trees -- leaving behind the millions whose problem is having no one with whom to huddle.

HEADLINE: Varied Alliance to Press House on Immigration Bill

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Even as they were popping corks on Thursday night after a strong bipartisan vote in the Senate to pass an immigration bill, supporters of the overhaul were laying plans for the far more difficult task of moving something similar through the Republican-controlled House.
Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio insisted on Thursday that the House would not take up the Senate bill and would pass its own measure only if a majority of Republicans backed it, instead of relying more on Democratic votes.
As a sign of the conservative direction of the debate in the House, its Judiciary Committee recently approved a bill to enforce immigration laws away from the nation's borders that was much tougher than anything from the Senate. The House has yet to produce a bill that includes a core piece of the Senate legislation: a path to citizenship for 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the country.
While supporters are hardly confident, they say House Republicans will soon discover a crucial difference this year from failed immigration efforts of the past. They say their coalition is broader and far more energized and committed than in 2007, when an immigration overhaul by President George W. Bush did not even reach a vote in the Senate. 
Latinos, who showed their strength when they overwhelmingly supported President Obama last November, are a leading force, but are not the only one, supporters said. Business and technology industry groups, labor unions, agricultural growers, farmworkers, law enforcement associations, churches, educators, youth groups and other immigrant organizations are also in the mix.
The diversity gives supporters a variety of pressure points for approaching reluctant House Republicans, said Clarissa Martnez de Castro, an organizer for NCLR, the national Latino organization also known as the National Council of La Raza. A lawmaker who does not have many Latino voters in a district might have vegetable farmers, or labor unions, or a university, or an evangelical Christian megachurch, she said.
Asked why he thought the overhaul had a fighting chance in the House, Ali Noorani, a veteran of many immigration wars, pointed to a big green mobile billboard that had circled Capitol Hill every day this week.
Its flashing message was ''Praying for immigrants. Praying for Congress.'' Groups of evangelical Christians prayed on the Capitol lawn for the Senate to pass its bill. Mr. Noorani's group, the National Immigration Forum, has worked with Southern Baptists and other large evangelical denominations to coordinate prayer campaigns and run pro-overhaul spots on Christian radio stations in states where lawmakers might be persuaded to change their views.
''In 2007, we weren't even on the radar,'' said the Rev. Samuel Rodrguez, the president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, an evangelical group. Mr. Rodrguez said he had been on the road continuously, addressing primarily non-Hispanic Christian conferences to spread the message on the overhaul.
Business groups are also pledging to stay in the fray.
''What will shock a lot of people in the House is the level of interest and intensity of the business community compared to 2007,'' said Scott Corley, the executive director of Compete America, which represents tech companies that are pressing for an increase in visas for skilled immigrants.
In 2007, Silicon Valley companies stayed in the background, and after a bruising and finally fruitless fight with labor unions, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce lost enthusiasm. This year, the Senate bill includes a compromise that the chamber and the A.F.L-C.I.O. worked out to bring in low-wage migrant workers in the future, as well as provisions for high-skilled immigrants.
On Thursday, the House Judiciary Committee approved its own bill to offer more visas for foreign computer engineers and scientists, which was also to the liking of Mr. Corley and leaders of other tech groups. But Mr. Corley said tech companies remained convinced that such measures had to be part of a comprehensive package like the Senate bill, including the path to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants.
During the Senate debate, one business group, the Partnership for a New American Economy, which was started by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, tried a populist approach with what organizers called a virtual march on Washington. The group claims to have carried off one of the largest simultaneous ''thunderclaps'' of Twitter messages and Facebook posts, reaching more than 40 million people.
The organization ran newspaper ads in Utah signed by business leaders and political figures, and it organized a letter from 21 Tennessee university presidents to the state's senators, Bob Corker and Lamar Alexander, both Republicans. Both lawmakers voted for the immigration bill.
Frank Sharry, another veteran of past immigration debates, said he believed that a bipartisan majority probably already existed in the House for legislation like the Senate measure, but that it would include most Democrats and only a minority of Republicans. Mr. Sharry, the executive director of America's Voice, an advocacy group, argued that the burden would be on Republicans, and particularly on Mr. Boehner, to provide explanations to voters if the House advances no legislation this year to fix an immigration system that is widely regarded as dysfunctional.
Supporters have been newly galvanized by their victory in the Senate, and so have opponents. In the Senate, the most passionate opposition was waged by a single tireless Republican lawmaker, Jeff Sessions of Alabama. In the House, many conservative Republicans reject the Senate bill as dangerously weak on border and interior enforcement, and as giving too much too soon to illegal immigrants.
House opponents of the Senate approach are led by experienced lawmakers like Lamar Smith of Texas and Steve King of Iowa, both Republicans. The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, has been ecumenical in airing a range of views in immigration hearings he has held, but he has left no doubt that he will support only a plan far tougher than the Senate measure, perhaps with no path to citizenship.
The wider opposition in the House also gives more points of contact to the main organizations fighting against any legislation that they see as amnesty for lawbreakers, including NumbersUSA and the Federation for American Immigration Reform.
Mr. Obama, who was traveling in Senegal, called several of the senators from the bipartisan group that wrote the immigration legislation to congratulate them on its passage, and he called Mr. Boehner and Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House leader, urging them to follow suit.
Supporters say they are on the offensive now.
''The House has not felt our love yet,'' said Eliseo Medina, the international secretary-treasurer of the Service Employees International Union, a leading labor group in the campaign for the overhaul. On Friday, more than 100 top organizers from unions, immigration groups and other organizations converged on Washington for a two-day session to strategize for the House debate.
Mr. Rodrguez, of the evangelical coalition, said Republicans who voted to block the overhaul could face future costs.
''We were at the edge of the Jordan River, but after the Senate, we officially got our feet wet,'' he said. ''If 11 million immigrants are left in the middle of the water and do not reach the promised land, neither will the Republican Party reach the promised land of the White House.''

HEADLINE: A Calm Close to a Volatile Month

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Given the wild trading of late, it was a calm close to the month.
After flitting between tiny gains and losses most of Friday, the stock market closed mostly lower, a peaceful end to the most volatile month in nearly two years. 
''It's a dull Friday,'' said Gary Flam, a stock manager at Bel Air Investment Advisors. A bull market, he added, is ''rarely a straight march up.''
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended its bumpy ride in June down 1.5 percent, the first monthly loss since October. The index still had its best first half of a year since 1998.
Investors seemed unsure how to react to recent statements by Federal Reserve officials about when the central bank might end its support for the economy.
Mixed economic news on Friday added to investor uncertainty after big stock gains. An index of consumer confidence was up, but a gauge of business activity in the Chicago area plunged.
''Investors don't know what to make of the news,'' said John Toohey, vice president for stock investments at USAA Investment Management. ''I wouldn't be surprised to see more ups and downs.''
The S.& P. 500 closed down 6.92 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,606.28. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 114.89 points, or 0.8 percent, to 14,909.60. The Nasdaq composite index rose 1.38 points, or 0.04 percent, to 3,403.25.
Stocks have jumped around in June. By contrast, the first five months of the year were mostly calm, with small but steady gains as investors bought on news of higher home prices, record corporate earnings and an improving jobs market.
By May 21, the S.& P. 500 had climbed to a record 1,669, up 18 percent for the year. The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, spoke the next day and prices began seesawing.
Investors have long known that the central bank would eventually pull back from its bond purchases, which are intended to lower interest rates and get people to borrow and spend more. Last week, Mr. Bernanke got more specific about the timing, saying the Fed could start purchasing fewer bonds later this year and stop buying them completely by the middle of next year if the economy continued to strengthen.
Investors dumped stocks, but then had second thoughts this week as other Fed officials stressed that the central bank would not pull back on its support soon.
Bonds have also been on a bumpy ride in recent weeks, mostly down.
The prospect of fewer purchases by the Fed sent investors fleeing from all sorts of bonds -- municipals, United States Treasury securities, corporate bonds, foreign government debt and high-yield bonds. Investors withdrew a record $23 billion from bond mutual funds in the five trading days that ended Wednesday, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Bond yields, which move in the opposite direction of bond prices, have rocketed. On Friday, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 3/32 to 93 19/32, bringing the yield up to 2.49 percent, from 2.47 percent late Thursday. Last month, the yield was as low as 1.63 percent.

HEADLINE: F.B.I. Will Fight the Mafia With Fewer Investigators

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM

 BODY:
The New York office of the F.B.I. confronts an array of challenges -- from cyber and financial crime to global terrorism -- that would have been unimaginable half a century ago when it first squared off in earnest against the mob. And so, in recent years, more and more agents have been assigned to those modern threats and fewer to the L.C.N., the bureau's shorthand for La Cosa Nostra.
Now, for the third time in five years, the office is reducing the number of agents assigned to traditional organized crime cases, bringing the total remaining to roughly three dozen, people with knowledge of the changes said. Those agents are responsible for investigating some 700 so-called made members and 7,000 associates. The number of squads focused exclusively on the city's five crime families will be reduced to two from three. The cuts will leave about 60 percent fewer agents in New York City investigating the mob than in 2008, when there was -- as there had been for decades -- a separate squad of 10 to 20 agents devoted to each crime family. 
The changes come after two decades of success in the fight against the mob, and they have met with mixed reviews within the Federal Bureau of Investigation and at some of the other agencies that, over the years, worked to wrest the mob's grip from some industries and loosen it over others.
Some see the changes as a necessary evolution, a reaction to the changing nature of crime and threats to the nation in a time of tight budgets. Others fear the reductions could allow the city's five weakened crime families -- the Gambinos, the Bonannos, the Colombos, the Genoveses and the Lucheses -- to grow stronger, regroup and reassert themselves.
The head of the New York F.B.I. office, assistant director George Venizelos, declined to discuss specific staffing numbers but acknowledged the cuts, citing terrorism and other priorities, the F.B.I.'s budget and what he called the mob's changing footprint. He suggested, however, that the changes were not set in stone. ''That doesn't mean we're not going to increase it in six months'' if circumstances warrant, he said, adding, ''we're just trying to be more flexible.''
''That's where the challenge is -- you want to stay on top of the L.C.N., and you don't want it to be back where it used to be,'' he said. ''Would I like another 100 agents or so? Of course we would, but we have to deal with what we have.''
Other F.B.I. offices in cities where traditional organized crime families have long exerted influence have seen similar cutbacks. Ten years ago in the Chicago office, for example, two squads with 12 agents each were devoted exclusively to investigating La Cosa Nostra. Now only one squad with 12 agents focuses on the mob, a person briefed on those changes said.
Prof. James B. Jacobs, the director of the Center for Research in Crime and Justice at New York University School of Law who has written extensively about organized crime, construction and labor unions, said the reductions presented a potential problem, but that a re-examination of the bureau's priorities was long overdue.
''We just don't have enough resources,'' Mr. Jacobs said, adding that James B. Comey's nomination to succeed Robert S. Mueller III as F.B.I. director could present an opportunity for just such a review. He also said that state and local governments should play a greater role in investigating organized crime cases.
The hallmark of organized crime has long been the ability of its more imaginative members to find creative ways to penetrate, corrupt and control industries, and thus separate the government, businesses and citizens from their money. Coupled with the omnipresent threat of violence and more mundane schemes, it remains an enduring presence in certain sectors of the economy and certain neighborhoods around the city.
Over the years, the mob has found its way into more and more sophisticated schemes, feeding on everything from the stock market to the Internet and the health care and telecommunications industries, all while remaining entrenched in construction and staples like gambling, loan-sharking and extortion.
A resurgent mob, officials fear, could drive up the costs of a range of goods and services in the city, including private carting, construction, health insurance and restaurant linens.
''The problem hasn't gone away,'' said one senior F.B.I. investigator, who like others interviewed for this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to publicly criticize their superiors. ''Just because you put a guy away,'' he said, ''they replace him. They make new guys. Unless you stay on top of it, you won't know who those guys are.'' And if you don't know who they are, he said, you can't keep up with what they are doing.
The investigator, along with several other current and former officials, cautioned that the reduced number of agents assigned to handle organized crime cases would not only limit the nature and number of cases that the bureau can pursue, but also slow the flow of the informers -- the key to most investigations -- to a trickle.
Informers also serve an important role in helping investigators track developments in mob families: the makeup of the hierarchy, promotions, the induction of new members and their daily activities.
Under the old model, there was one F.B.I. squad responsible for investigating and gathering intelligence on each of the city's five mafia families. At any given time, a squad might be investigating several larger and smaller cases against crime figures.
With the cutbacks, one squad, known by the internal designation C5, which previously had handled the Genovese family, will also be responsible for the Bonannos and the Colombos. Another squad, C16, which had long investigated the Gambino family, is now also responsible for the Lucheses.

HEADLINE: Taking a Cue From Bernanke a Little Too Far

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
Financial advisers have been fielding calls from shaken investors in recent weeks, particularly retirees, who are nervous that a bond market crash is on the horizon.
You can hardly blame them. Investors have been fleeing bonds in droves; a record $76.5 billion poured out of bond funds and exchange-traded funds during the month of June through Wednesday. That exceeds the previous record, according to TrimTabs, when $41.8 billion streamed out of the funds in October 2008 and the financial crisis was in full force.
But the rush for the exits really means one thing: investors are betting that interest rates are about to begin their upward trajectory, something that's been expected for several years now.
Their cue came from the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, who recently suggested that the economic recovery might allow the central bank to ease its efforts to stimulate the economy. That includes scaling back its bond-buying program beginning later this year. 
So the big fear is that interest rates are poised to rise much further, driving down bond prices; the two move in opposite directions.
A Barclays index tracking a broad swath of investment-grade bonds lost 3.77 percent from the beginning of May through Thursday, according to Morningstar. United States government notes with maturities of 10 years or longer, however, lost an average of 10.8 percent over the same period.
Making a bet on interest rates is no different from trying to predict the next big drop in stocks, or jumping into the market when it appears to be poised to surge higher. These sort of emotional moves are exactly why research shows that investors' returns tend to trail the broader market.
And it's also why many financial advisers suggest ignoring the noise, as long as you have a smart assortment of bond funds that will provide stability when stocks inevitably tumble once again.
''It's a futile game to base portfolio moves on interest rate guesses,'' said Milo Benningfield, a financial adviser in San Francisco. ''We don't have to look any further than highly regarded Pimco manager Bill Gross, whose horrible interest rate bet against Treasuries in 2011 landed him in the bottom 15 percent of fund managers in his category that year. Investors should take a strategic approach designed around the reason they hold bonds -- and then sit tight whenever hedge funds and other institutions shake the ground around them.''
The main reason longer-term investors hold bonds, of course, is to provide a steadying force. And though today's lower yields provide less of a cushion -- the 10-year Treasury is yielding about 2.5 percent -- bonds still remain the best, if imperfect, foil to stocks.
''The role of bonds in a portfolio has always been to be a ballast or a diversifier to equity risk,'' said Francis Kinniry, a principal in the Vanguard Investment Strategy Group. ''And that is very true today. Yields are low, but this is what a bear market in bonds looks like.''
So, yes, losses are indeed more probable than they have been in recent years. From 1976 through Jan. 31, 2013, high-quality bonds yielded an average of 7.3 percent, according to a recent Vanguard , which provided a nice cushion. For instance, if you had a portfolio of 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds -- and stocks fell by 20 percent -- the overall portfolio would have lost 9.1 percent. If the market plummeted 40 percent, the entire pile of money would be worth 21 percent less.
The situation is a bit different now. Assuming a more conservative average return on bonds of 1.9 percent -- a reasonable estimate based on bond yields now, according to Vanguard -- the same 20 percent drop in the stock market would cause the overall portfolio to decline by about two percentage points more, or 11.2 percent. If the market plummeted by 40 percent, the portfolio would lose 23 percent.
''Investors have been conditioned by higher bond yields going into both bear markets in the last decade to believe that bonds will substantially offset stock declines,'' Mr. Benningfield added.
So perhaps the loss from the bonds somehow feels worse because it's not something investors are accustomed to. And the memories of the stock market collapse of 2008-9 are still fresh enough.
''People are using adjectives like 'blood bath' and 'devastation,' but we are talking about a negative 3 percent return,'' said Mr. Kinniry, referring to the Vanguard Total Bond Market Index fund, which is down by that amount year-to-date.
Even the big bond market sell-off in 1994, which many refer to as a ''massacre,'' doesn't seem quite as violent as that moniker suggests. As Mr. Kinniry points out, the same index fund lost 5.3 percent that year, after interest rates spiked by 2.83 percent. If the same sort of situation were to play out now, he said the returns would be significantly worse because bond yields are lower than they were back then. ''You might lose about 8 percent,'' he said, adding that losses could be deeper depending on how quickly rates rose, among other factors. But typically, ''we're talking about single-digit losses.''
Still, some advisers suggested taking a closer look at your overall allocation to stocks, particularly if you're not well diversified, since bonds will provide less protection.
For most investors, holding bonds through low-cost index funds remains the most prudent course. People who invest in individual bonds don't have to worry about fluctuations in their price because they can continue to hold the bond and collect their interest payments until maturity, at which point they'll collect its face value (unless, of course, the bond issuer defaults). But you need to have a good pile of cash -- some experts say $500,000, even more -- to assemble a diversified portfolio of municipal and corporate bonds (though you don't need quite as much for Treasuries, since they're backed by the government).
You can figure out how sensitive your fund is to interest rates by looking at its duration, which essentially measures how long it will take to receive all of your money back, on average, from interest and your original investment. Generally speaking, for every percentage point that interest rates rise (or fall), a bond's value will decline (or increase) by its duration, which is stated in years. Bond funds with shorter durations are less susceptible to interest rate risk -- the faster a bond matures, the thinking goes, the more quickly you can reinvest the money at a higher interest rate.
That means a fund like the Vanguard Total Bond Market Index fund, which has a duration of 5.5 years, would decline by about 5.5 percent. But since the fund also pays investors income -- it has a yield of about 1.7 percent -- it would actually only post a total loss of about 3.8 percent. (Future returns would be one percentage point higher, too, thanks to the rise in rates).
But if even that feels too risky, experts say you can put some of your bond money into a diversified index fund with an even shorter duration. The trade-off, of course, is that you will earn less income. That might not matter once you remind yourself why you own bonds at all.

HEADLINE: What It Takes to Make New College Graduates Employable

BYLINE: By ALINA TUGEND

 BODY:
MY older son graduated from high school last week and has started a pleasant job as a summer lifeguard. In four years we expect to attend his college graduation, and we hope the time there leaves him with great experiences, a love of learning and some idea how to get and keep a job.
It's that last part of the equation that I'm going to focus on. My heart sinks every time I read a news story or opinion piece quoting employers who charge that four-year colleges and universities are failing to provide graduates with the skills they need to become and remain employable.
Of course, in many ways, this isn't a new story. 
''A four-year liberal arts education doesn't prepare kids for work and it never has,'' said Alec R. Levenson a senior research scientist for the Center for Effective Organizations at the University of Southern California.
Mara Swan, the executive vice president of global strategy and talent at Manpower Group, agreed.
''There's always been a gap between what colleges produce and what employers want,'' she said. ''But now it's widening.'' That's because workplaces are more complex and globalized, profit margins are slimmer, companies are leaner and managers expect their workers to get up to speed much faster than in the past.
''Employers are under pressure to do more with less,'' Ms. Swan said.
Unemployment rates for those with bachelor's degrees or higher are still much better -- at 3.8 percent in May -- than those with only a high school diploma, which was 7.4 percent in May, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Nonetheless, a special report by The Chronicle of Higher Education and American Public Media's Marketplace published in March found that about half of 704 employers who participated in the study said they had trouble finding recent college graduates qualified to fill positions at their company.
But, surprisingly, it wasn't necessarily specific technical skills that were lacking.
''When it comes to the skills most needed by employers, job candidates are lacking most in written and oral communication skills, adaptability and managing multiple priorities, and making decisions and problem solving,'' the report said.
Jaime S. Fall, a vice president at the HR Policy Association, an organization of chief human resources managers from large employers, said these findings backed up what his organization was hearing over and over from employers.
Young employees ''are very good at finding information, but not as good at putting that information into context,'' Mr. Fall said. ''They're really good at technology, but not at how to take those skills and resolve specific business problems.''
This isn't a dilemma just in this country, but around the world, Ms. Swan said. A global study conducted last year of interviews with 25,000 employers found that nine out of 10 employees believed that colleges were not fully preparing students for the workplace.
''There were the same problems,'' she said. ''Problems with collaboration, interpersonal skills, the ability to deal with ambiguity, flexibility and professionalism.''
But it's easy for the issue to degenerate into finger-pointing.
''If you sat down with a committee of professors, and told them students are not coming out with the skills they need, they would say, 'you're smoking something,' '' Mr. Levenson said. ''The trouble is, those skills are applied in a college context, not a workplace context.''
But, he added, ''you can't create a school-based curriculum that can help someone transition to being highly productive on the job in 10 days.''
In other words, the onus shouldn't just be on universities; employers also need to step up to the plate.
The in-depth training programs and apprenticeships of the past are unlikely to come back, so companies must become more innovative in helping young employees come up to speed, according to a report released in May by Accenture, a management consulting and outsourcing company.
''Rather than simply bemoaning the inability to find employees with the skills required for available jobs, organizations must step up with new and more comprehensive enterprise learning strategies,'' Accenture stated in a summary of The Accenture 2013 College Graduate Employment Survey, which queried 1,010 students graduating from college in 2013 and 1,005 who graduated in 2011 and 2012.
The problem, it said, is that most recent college graduates expect employers to provide on-the-ground training, but most of them don't actually receive it.
''Based on these findings, as well as our own work with hundreds of companies around the world, it is hard to deny the conclusion that many employers have overblown expectations for the skills of new hires -- believing falsely that recent college graduates should be able to hit the ground running,'' the summary added.
Katherine LaVelle, who leads Accenture's Talent and Organization group for North America, said the employers they talked to seemed more concerned about the lack of specific technical skills than broad ones like communication. But the overall issue of preparedness remains the same.
''Universities are not in the job of vocational training but they are in the job of evolving,'' Ms. LaVelle said. ''The magic lies in finding a model that's appropriate for students to build skills, but palatable and effective for employers as well.''
It would seem that the job internships that college students, and increasingly post-college students, participate in would help prepare students for the working world, but experts say most are too short and not substantial enough. Longer, more in-depth ones at prominent companies are highly competitive.
''They're incredibly helpful, but they're not a cure-all,'' Mr. Fall said.
There is clearly no one answer, but the most important issue is communication between all sides, said Karin Fischer, a staff writer for The Chronicle of Higher Education, who helped write up the survey results.
''To what extent are employers and colleges having a conversation about what they really need?'' she asked. ''We see this more in the community college arena. Maybe we need more back and forth.''
It's not that colleges and companies haven't been trying to figure this out -- and with varying success. In 2008, the Boeing Company ranked colleges based on how well their graduates performed within the corporation. The results weren't made public, but Boeing did share them with colleges.
Richard Stephens, a former senior vice present of human resources and management at Boeing, told The Chronicle that some colleges took the findings seriously and worked with the company to refine their curriculums, while others dismissed them.
Boeing used that information to determine where the aerospace company focused its internship programs and hiring.
But a spokesman for Boeing said there were no plans for another such evaluation, saying it was ''difficult to measure individuals in such a big company and difficult to implement over the long term.''
One way the industry is reaching out directly to new entrants in the work force is through a Web site, Jobipedia.org, started by the HR Policy Association. An employee posts a question and recruiters for the companies that participate answer it. One question may elicit several answers from different perspectives.
About 20 major companies -- such as Gap, Merck and American Express -- participated. And some 50 colleges, including Cornell, Duke University and Georgia Institute of Technology, have made the Web site available to students at their college career centers.
The questions range from career planning to interview issues to on the job concerns. For example, ''Is it O.K. to have a drink at a business lunch?'' elicited four responses. The consensus: Best to avoid it.
As Mr. Fall said, ''colleges can't be either/or anymore -- a trade school or a liberal arts college. We need skilled people with well-rounded backgrounds and the ability to think constructively.''
You hear that, son?

HEADLINE: Uncertainty At the Fed As Markets Oscillate

BYLINE: By JAMES B. STEWART

 BODY:
It can't have been the send-off that the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, was hoping for.
''He's already stayed a lot longer than he wanted or he was supposed to,'' President Obama told Charlie Rose in an interview that was broadcast on June 17 on Bloomberg TV, all but confirming that he wouldn't reappoint Mr. Bernanke when his term expires at the end of this year.
The best the president could muster was that Mr. Bernanke was an ''outstanding partner along with the White House'' in warding off ''what could have been an economic crisis of epic proportions.''
A White House spokesman said Mr. Obama meant that as praise, but supporters of the chairman, and even many who have disagreed with him on policy issues, were quick to question both the timing and substance of the comment. 
Not only did the comment come across as faint praise for a long-serving public servant who guided the nation's monetary policy through a severe crisis, but its timing could also hardly have been worse. Mr. Bernanke was in the midst of important Federal Open Market Committee meetings and that very week began the delicate task of communicating the Fed's plans to ''taper'' its latest round of quantitative easing. Markets went into convulsions and interest rates shot up. While no one blames Mr. Obama for that, adding another element of uncertainty about Fed policy may have contributed to the volatility.
Others were critical of the president's choice of the word ''partner'' to describe the Fed chairman's role, since the Federal Reserve is an independent agency overseen by Congress. ''Any Fed chairman would bristle at the idea they were a partner with a president,'' Senator Bob Corker, the Tennessee Republican who serves on the Senate Banking subcommittee on financial institutions and consumer protection, told me this week. ''I can understand why people who want to protect the independence of the Fed would be concerned.''
Others pointed out that the Fed has taken the lead in efforts to stimulate the economy as Congress blocked the White House from further stimulus measures, and thus ''partner'' overstates the White House's role in the recovery.
By contrast, although history hasn't been kind to the legacy of Mr. Bernanke's predecessor, Alan Greenspan, he received a send-off commensurate with his record five terms of service. The Fed itself announced Mr. Greenspan's decision to retire, and in late October 2005, President George W. Bush announced his choice of Mr. Bernanke at a White House news conference where he lavished praise on the departing chairman as a ''legend'' who had ''dominated his age like no central banker in history'' while Mr. Greenspan looked on. On the same occasion, Mr. Bernanke said Mr. Greenspan ''set the standard for excellence in economic policy making.''
With many economists and investors fixated for months on the question of when and how quickly the Fed would curtail its extraordinary efforts to stimulate the economy, Mr. Bernanke's suggestion, just two days after the president's comments, that the Fed might taper its bond-buying earlier than expected sent markets reeling. Stocks fell across the globe and interest rates rose, with 10-year Treasuries hitting their highest yields since 2011. The volatility index, which was already rising the week before the president's remarks, leapt to a new high for the year.
Mr. Obama ''instantly made Ben a lame duck before the end of his term,'' said one economist, who may be a future candidate for Mr. Bernanke's position and, like many people I interviewed, asked not to be named. ''He undermined his credibility both inside the Fed and in financial markets.'' While Mr. Bernanke tried to reassure markets that the Fed would monitor the economy and respond as appropriate, this person said, ''Part of the negative reaction in asset prices was because market participants have confidence in Ben, but now he won't be around to oversee that.''
People close to Mr. Bernanke told me that the chairman took the president's comments in stride, but said he was concerned about the severe market reaction. ''He wouldn't want to feed stories about this when he's trying to articulate a complex message about monetary policy,'' one adviser said.
The people close to the chairman said he had already told the president he wanted to leave at the end of his term. He is expected to return to teaching and research at Princeton, where he delivered this year's baccalaureate address. He quipped in the speech that his remarks had ''nothing whatsoever to do with interest rates'' and observed that life was unpredictable.
Senator Corker, who as an advocate for price stability is seen as more hawkish on monetary policy than Mr. Bernanke, said he had breakfast with Mr. Bernanke a few weeks ago. ''I couldn't imagine him wanting to be reappointed,'' the senator said. ''He's never confided in me, but I've never gotten the sense that he wanted to serve beyond this term.'' Others close to Mr. Bernanke agreed with that assessment, but added that if asked by the president to do so, he would stay.
Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Bernanke declined to comment. When asked at his news conference last week about the president's remarks, Mr. Bernanke responded coolly: ''We just spent two days working on monetary policy issues, and I would like to keep the debate, discussion, the questions here on policy. I don't have anything for you on my personal plans.''
But underscoring the perception that Mr. Bernanke is now a lame duck, two senior officials -- William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and Jerome H. Powell, a Fed governor -- tried to reassure investors and calm markets this week. ''Market adjustments since May have been larger than would be justified by any reasonable reassessment of the path of policy,'' Mr. Powell said in a speech on Thursday.
Others told me the president's remarks needed to be put in the broader perspective of Fed policy. ''I certainly agree that you don't want to add uncertainty at a time like this,'' said Jim O'Sullivan, chief United States economist for High Frequency Economics, an independent research firm. ''It would have been better not to have those comments as a news item. But it's not the main factor causing the market turmoil. You can't really blame the surge in bond yields on that comment. Arguably, the markets overreacted, but markets do overreact.''
The president ''has to pull off a delicate balancing act,'' said Douglas J. Elliott, a fellow at the Brookings Institution. ''You don't want to undercut the Fed chairman by making it more obvious than it is that he's a lame duck. But he is. It's not out of the question that he would choose to stay on, but it seems extremely unlikely. Most market participants already knew that.''
Everyone I spoke to agreed that President Obama was likely to appoint someone more ''dovish'' on monetary policy than Mr. Bernanke -- that is, someone who favors an easy monetary policy to raise employment and worries less about inflation. That would seemingly include the Fed vice chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, widely viewed as the front-runner to succeed Mr. Bernanke. Paradoxically, the market reacted to the president's remarks as if both Mr. Bernanke and his likely successor had become more hawkish, and thus more inclined to raise rates.
''If people were really worried that the new Fed chairman is likely to be more dovish -- and the current favorite has that reputation -- you'd think they'd be snapping up inflation hedges,'' Mr. O'Sullivan said. ''But they're not. Real yields are going up. The markets don't seem to be too worried about a dovish Fed.''
Market reactions aside, the end of the Bernanke era at the Fed seems to be approaching. He has his critics on both the right and left, but everyone I spoke to praised Mr. Bernanke's record. ''I thought he handled himself very well during the crisis, and for that I have a lot of respect for him,'' Senator Corker said. ''I understand what he was trying to do with quantitative easing, and although we've had some policy differences, I think he's handled that in a very artful and effective way.''
Still, as the end of the year nears, ''He'll become less and less relevant, and the trade is only halfway done,'' the senator added. ''The new Fed chairman has to unload the huge portfolio that they have,'' and Mr. Bernanke's ''successor has to be someone who has the ability to handle these complexities in a very delicate and thoughtful way.''

HEADLINE: Is America a Leader in Broadband, or a Straggler?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I largely agree with Lowell C. McAdam, chairman of Verizon, that a light regulatory regime is ''How the U.S. Got Broadband Right'' (Op-Ed, June 21). But there is a glaring failure amid the success: lack of broadband availability in rural areas, where Verizon and its cable counterparts have chosen not to invest in the infrastructure necessary to deliver the 100 megabits per second speed Mr. McAdam cites as available to over 80 percent of American households. 
That is why cooperatives and municipalities are stepping in to serve the unserved. They require two things to succeed: government financial support and forbearance by telecommunications and cable companies not to seek to block what they are not going to build.
STEVE NELSON Washington, Mass., June 21, 2013
The writer is a founding member of the executive committee of WiredWest, a broadband cooperative of 42 towns in western Massachusetts.
To the Editor:
''How the U.S. Got Broadband Right'' is yet another specious argument in favor of the existing loosely regulated monopoly system of Internet service.
In fact, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the International Telecommunication Union, America trails most developed nations in providing broadband, despite Lowell C. McAdam's assertion that Europe's regulatory regime ''limits investment and innovation.''
When will we wake up and recognize that a new economy dependent on broadband infrastructure is key to our success, indeed survival, in the world? Broadband is a public service that every individual and organization should have, and the United States needs to regulate this service as a public utility, not leave it to the so-called free marketplace.
JOHN M. EGER San Diego, June 21, 2013
The writer, a professor of communications and public policy at San Diego State University, is a former legal assistant to the Federal Communications Commission chairman (1970-73) and director of the White House Office of Telecommunications Policy (1974-76).

HEADLINE: The New Prostitutes

BYLINE: ROBERT KOLKER


HIGHLIGHT: Many women who would never have considered working for a pimp on the street are now working for themselves as prostitutes and escorts using the Internet, but are they any less vulnerable? 

 BODY:
Take the Long Hill Road exit off I-95 in eastern Connecticut and curl south toward the waterfront city of Groton and you'll find each of the places that briefly employed Maureen Brainard-Barnes. There is the TJ Maxx and the AutoZone and the Stop and Shop. And the Chester's chicken counter, where she made the potato wedges. And the shopping center with the Groton Cinema 6, where she picked up discarded snacks from the carpet in exchange for free admission and a bag of popcorn.
In 2005, Ms. Brainard-Barnes was a 22-year-old single mother who had difficulty holding down a steady job. She never could afford her own place, staying with her sister for long stretches and occasionally with a boyfriend. Modeling, she thought, could lead to a music career. As soon as she enrolled on a site called ModelMayhem.com, she received dozens of e-mails from places that purported to be modeling agencies but that, after a few clicks, turned out to mean nude modeling and sometimes working as an escort. She wasn't thrown by seeing this. What did surprise her was the money. 
Within a few months, Ms. Brainard-Barnes was making up to $2,000 a day on trips to New York City. She posted ads on Craigslist and worked out of a hotel room in Midtown for short stretches and then returned home to care for her daughter. After so many years of depending on others, she could leave her responsibilities behind and become another person for a while - and she could earn enough money to fulfill those same responsibilities. Online, she could be her own boss and not share what she made with anyone - not a pimp, not an escort service, not a boyfriend.
In 2010, Maureen Brainard-Barnes's body was one of four uncovered close by one another in the sand dunes of Gilgo Beach, Long Island, wrapped in burlap. Three years later, the Long Island serial killer case remains unsolved, even as six more sets of remains have been discovered nearby along Ocean Parkway and farther east. The first four bodies were identified as women in their 20s - just like another woman, Shannan Gilbert, who had disappeared three miles from where the four bodies in burlap were found. These five women clearly had much in common. Maureen Brainard-Barnes, Melissa Barthelemy, Shannan Gilbert, Megan Waterman and Amber Lynn Costello all grew up in struggling towns a long distance from Long Island. And they all were escorts who discovered an easy entree into prostitution online.
It had seemed enough, at first, for some to say that the victims were all prostitutes, practically interchangeable - lost souls who were gone, in a sense, long before they actually disappeared. That is a story our culture tells about people like them, a conventional way of thinking about how young girls fall into a life of prostitution: unstable family lives, addiction, neglect.
But in the two years I've spent learning about the lives of all five women, I have found that they all defied expectations. They were not human-trafficking victims in the classic sense. They stayed close to their families. They all came to New York to take advantage of a growing black market - an underground economy that offered them life-changing money, and with a remarkably low barrier to entry. The real temptation wasn't drugs or alcohol, but the promise of social mobility.
The Web has been the great disrupter of any number of industries, transforming the way people shop for everything, and commercial sex has been no exception. Posting ads online, escorts find clients without ever having to leave home or walk the streets. The method is easier, seductively so, almost like an A.T.M. - post an ad, and your phone rings seconds later. That ease clearly doesn't mitigate the risk of meeting strangers, though it might seem like it to some escorts.
The great transforming feature of the Internet is its anonymity. We all have learned that a person can do practically anything online without even their closest loved ones knowing, from commenting on Yelp or Gawker to selling stolen goods or viewing porn videos. This is as true for the escorts as it was for the clients, who have turned sites like TheEroticReview.com into a sort of Yelp for steady customers of commercial sex. No one has to go to a bad part of town to look for what he wants.
While no one has yet measured exactly how significantly the Internet has increased the number of working escorts, it's already clear that many Internet sex workers would never seriously consider working on the street. Scott Cunningham, an economist at Baylor University, conducted a survey of 700 sex workers in the United States and Canada. "The Internet is augmenting the sex market by bringing in women who would not have entered the sex market without the Internet," he says. In one month chosen at random by Mr. Cunningham - May 2009 - an average of 1,690 sex-worker ads were posted online every day in the New York City area alone.
All it took to persuade many of these women to enter the field, Mr. Cunningham theorizes, was a little financial pressure, or "economic shocks." The explanations for entering escort work, he says, "are often surrounding loss of income or increase of expenses they need to cover. A woman told me she was getting a divorce, she had a child, her husband was not going to provide child support. She already had a 40-hour-a-week job. And so her options were, she could get another job and work about 60 hours a week. Or she could do this and see her child more and have more money."
The women of Gilgo Beach all came from parts of the country hit hard by the recession like Buffalo, N.Y., and Portland, Me. - places where even if you did well in school, there seemed to be not much of a chance of finding a higher-than-minimum-wage job, much less one with health benefits. Some worked for escort services or walked the streets before turning to the Internet; others got their start online. Using Web sites like Craigslist and Backpage, they all made money that transformed their lives.
Shannan Gilbert worked for a high-end escort service in Jersey City, where the minimum rate was $400 or $500 an hour. But she took home only a third of that. When she switched to Craigslist, she made $1,000 many nights, enough to pay a month's rent on her apartment. Melissa Barthelemy abandoned her pimp to be her own boss online, charging $100 for 15 minutes, $150 for a half-hour, $250 for an hour and $1,000 for an overnight stay. She made enough money to come home to Buffalo at Christmastime and take her sister and mother to a spa for massages. "You deserve to be pampered," she told them.
Megan Waterman took three- or four-day working trips to Long Island from her home in Portland and made $1,500 on a busy night. And Amber Lynn Costello, a North Carolina native who lived briefly in West Babylon, Long Island, once raised $3,800 in just three days to bail out her boyfriend from jail - all, her friends said, from Craigslist.
"In the beginning, you make the money, and you're making it without the drugs," said her sister Kim Overstreet, who has also worked as an escort. "And then you get addicted to the money."
The women weren't the only ones to have profited. In 2010, Craigslist earned a reported $44.4 million from Adult Services ads, or about a third of the company's total revenue (the site had started charging $5 to $10 per posting two years earlier). For a time, some believed that Craigslist and its competitors were doing well by doing good. In 2006, a research team from Princeton and Columbia said that this new wave of prostitutes had a "professional and careerist orientation."
Three years later, Mr. Cunningham noted in one study that the Web was drawing different sorts of people into prostitution - they were better educated and they were thinner. In 2011, Jennifer Hafer, a researcher at the University of Arkansas, said people embraced online prostitution "for many of the same reasons that people enter the conventional job market - money, stability, autonomy and even job satisfaction." The Internet, said to be the solution to so many problems, was expected to legitimize the entire field of prostitution, elevate the underclass and make pimps a thing of the past.
OBVIOUSLY, that wasn't how things turned out for the women of Gilgo Beach. Maureen Brainard-Barnes disappeared in July 2007, last heard from near Penn Station. Melissa Barthelemy was said to be heading by herself to Long Island for an overnight appointment in July 2009. Shannan Gilbert vanished in the middle of a call in Oak Beach on May 1, 2010, in circumstances that still have not been fully explained. A month later, Megan Waterman disappeared after leaving a hotel room in Hauppauge. And in September 2010, Amber Lynn Costello, who didn't like to leave her house for work, had agreed to an overnight date for $1,500. Many other online escorts have reported incidents of violence. Nearly half of the New York City online escorts surveyed by the Urban Justice Center's Sex Workers Project in 2005 said they had been forced by a client to do something they did not want to do, and almost as many said they had been threatened or beaten. (In his research, Mr. Cunningham has found that the escorts who needed the money the most were the ones who lacked the resources and time to properly vet their clients.)
Politicians and law enforcement officials took notice of the problem in 2009, the same year Philip Haynes Markoff was arrested and charged with the murder of a masseuse he met on Craigslist. That same year, the sheriff of Cook County, Illinois, sued Craigslist, calling the site "the single largest source of prostitution in the nation."
Of course, if capitalism teaches us anything, it's that a demand-heavy market will find a way to thrive no matter what the obstacles. The pressure forced Craigslist to shut down its Adult Services category on Sept. 3, 2010 - as it happens, the day after Amber Lynn Costello went missing. Right away, the main competitor to Craigslist, Backpage, experienced an explosion in new escort postings. If community pressure or the threat of litigation sinks Backpage, a dozen more sites like it stand ready to pick up the traffic (and some escorts have never left Craigslist, posting surreptitiously in other categories).
The market doesn't care if prostitution is right or wrong, empowering or exploitative. The demand sustains human trafficking and under-age escorts engaging in survival sex. Just last month, the social-service organization Covenant House in Midtown Manhattan released the findings of a survey it conducted with Fordham University, which found that nearly half of the under-age prostitutes seeking help said they did it because they did not have a place to live.
Escorts face danger not because of the Internet but because they're still forced to work underground. In a different world, technology could be harnessed to reduce the dangers of prostitution. The University of Colorado law professor Scott Peppet has floated the possibility of a "technology-enabled sex market" where escorts and clients are all pre-vetted and predators are screened out. "The law, however, is hostile to such innovation," Professor Peppet writes. "It currently criminalizes not just prostitution itself, but activities - including technologies - that advance or facilitate sex markets." As it stands, escorts online remain invisible, where they are vulnerable to predators.
At the top of the pay scale, technology is delivering on its promise. Workers can increase their hours and their output from home and even work second jobs with more ease than ever. But toward the bottom, anxiety lingers, and the Web enables some people to take risks they never would have imagined. In this way, the women of Gilgo Beach still have something to teach us. The Internet might have made pimps less necessary, but today's escorts are as marginalized as ever, and every bit as vulnerable. The police rarely help them when they are at risk, and they rarely take their disappearances seriously. As far as the authorities are concerned, their profession still seals their fate.

HEADLINE: The Gospel According to 'Me'

BYLINE: SIMON CRITCHLEY and JAMIESON WEBSTER


HIGHLIGHT: In the New Age worship of the &#8220;authentic&#8221; self, personal well-being has become the primary goal of human life. 

 BODY:
The booming self-help industry, not to mention the cash cow of New Age spirituality, has one message: be authentic! Charming as American optimism may be, its 21st-century incarnation as the search for authenticity deserves pause. The power of this new version of the American dream can be felt through the stridency of its imperatives: Live fully! Realize yourself! Be connected! Achieve well-being! 
Despite the frequent claim that we are living in a secular age defined by the death of God, many citizens in rich Western democracies have merely switched one notion of God for another - abandoning their singular, omnipotent (Christian or Judaic or whatever) deity reigning over all humankind and replacing it with a weak but all-pervasive idea of spirituality tied to a personal ethic of authenticity and a liturgy of inwardness. The latter does not make the exorbitant moral demands of traditional religions, which impose bad conscience, guilt, sin, sexual inhibition and the rest.

Unlike the conversions that transfigure the born-again's experience of the world in a lightning strike, this one occurred in stages: a postwar existentialist philosophy of personal liberation and "becoming who you are" fed into a 1960s counterculture that mutated into the most selfish conformism, disguising acquisitiveness under a patina of personal growth, mindfulness and compassion. Traditional forms of morality that required extensive social cooperation in relation to a hard reality defined by scarcity have largely collapsed and been replaced with this New Age therapeutic culture of well-being that does not require obedience or even faith - and certainly not feelings of guilt. Guilt must be shed; alienation, both of body and mind, must be eliminated, most notably through yoga practice after a long day of mind-numbing work.
In the gospel of authenticity, well-being has become the primary goal of human life. Rather than being the by-product of some collective project, some upbuilding of the New Jerusalem, well-being is an end in itself. The stroke of genius in the ideology of authenticity is that it doesn't really require a belief in anything, and certainly not a belief in anything that might transcend the serene and contented living of one's authentic life and baseline well-being. In this, one can claim to be beyond dogma.
Whereas the American dream used to be tied to external reality - say, America as the place where one can openly practice any religion, America as a safe haven from political oppression or America as the land of opportunity where one need not struggle as hard as one's parents - now, the dream is one of pure psychological transformation.
This is the phenomenon that one might call, with an appreciative nod to Nietzsche, passive nihilism. Authenticity is its dominant contemporary expression. In a seemingly meaningless, inauthentic world awash in nonstop media reports of war, violence and inequality, we close our eyes and turn ourselves into islands. We may even say a little prayer to an obscure but benign Eastern goddess and feel some weak spiritual energy connecting everything as we listen to some tastefully selected ambient music. Authenticity, needing no reference to anything outside itself, is an evacuation of history. The power of now.
This ideology functions prominently in the contemporary workplace, where the classical distinction between work and nonwork has broken down. Work was traditionally seen as a curse or an obligation for which we received payment. Nonwork was viewed as an experience of freedom for which we pay but that gives us pleasure.
But the past 30 years or so has ushered in an informalization of the workplace where the distinction between work and nonwork is harder and harder to draw. With the rise of corporations like Google, the workplace has increasingly been colonized by nonwork experiences to the extent that we are not even allowed to feel alienation or discontent at the office because we can play Ping-Pong, ride a Segway, and eat organic lunches from a menu designed by celebrity chefs. If we do feel discontent, it must mean that something is wrong with us rather than with the corporation.
With the workplace dominated by the maxim of personal authenticity - Be different! Wear your favorite T-shirt to work and listen to Radiohead on your iPhone while at your desk! Isn't it nifty? - there is no room for worker malaise. And contrary to popular belief, none of this has assuaged the workplace dynamics of guilt, bad conscience and anxiety, which are more rampant than ever. In fact, the blurring of the boundary between work and nonwork in the name of flexibility has led to an enormous increase in anxiety - a trend well-documented in the work of Peter Fleming, a professor of work, organization and society at the University of London. Women in particular feel totally inadequate for not being able to have it all - climb the ladder at work, make the same wages as men, have a family, have a voluminous sex life, still look attractive and act as if they are having a great time through all of it.
Work is no longer a series of obligations to be fulfilled for the sake of sustenance: it is the expression of one's authentic self. With the extraordinary rise of internships - not just filled by college students anymore, but more and more by working-age adults - people from sufficiently privileged backgrounds are even prepared to work without pay because it allows them to "grow" as persons. Every aspect of one's existence is meant to water some fantasy of growth.
But here's the rub: if one believes that there is an intimate connection between one's authentic self and glittering success at work, then the experience of failure and forced unemployment is accepted as one's own fault. I feel shame for losing my job. I am morally culpable for the corporation's decision that I am excess to requirements.
To take this one step further: the failure of others is explained by their merely partial enlightenment for which they, and they alone, are to be held responsible. At the heart of the ethic of authenticity is a profound selfishness and callous disregard of others. As New Age interpreters of Buddha say, "You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection."
A nave belief in authenticity eventually gives way to a deep cynicism. A conviction in personal success that must always hold failure at bay becomes a corrupt stubbornness that insists on success at any cost. Cynicism, in this mode, is not the expression of a critical stance toward authenticity but is rather the runoff of this failure of belief. The self-help industry itself runs the gamut in both directions - from "The Power of Now," which teaches you the power of meditative self-sufficiency, to "The Rules," which teaches a woman how to land a man by pretending to be self-sufficient. Profit rules the day, inside and out.
Nothing seems more American than this forced choice between cynicism and nave belief. Or rather, as Herman Melville put it in his 1857 novel "The Confidence Man," it seems the choice is between being a fool (having to believe what one says) or being a knave (saying things one does not believe). For Melville, who was writing on the cusp of modern capitalism, the search for authenticity is a white whale.
This search is an obsession that is futile at best and destructive at worst. The lingering question for Melville, on the brink of poverty as he wrote "The Confidence Man," is: what happens to charity? When the values of Judeo-Christian morality have been given a monetary and psychological incarnation - as in credit, debt, trust, faith and fidelity - can they exist as values? Is the prosperous self the only God in which we believe in a radically inauthentic world?
As usual, the Bard of Avon got there first. In "Hamlet," Shakespeare puts the mantra of authenticity into the mouth of the ever-idiotic windbag Polonius in his advice to his son, Laertes: "To thine own self be true." This is just before Polonius sends a spy to follow Laertes to Paris and tell any number of lies in order to catch him out. 
And who, finally, is more inauthentic than Hamlet? Ask yourself: is Hamlet true to himself, doubting everything, unable to avenge his father's murder, incapable of uttering the secret that he has learned from the ghost's lips, and unwilling to declare his love for Ophelia whose father he kills? Hamlet dies wearing the colors of his enemy, Claudius. We dare say that we love "Hamlet" not for its representation of our purportedly sublime authenticity, but as a depiction of the drama of our radical inauthenticity that, in the best of words and worlds, shatters our moral complacency.
 Simon Critchley, a professor of philosophy at The New School for Social Research, and Jamieson Webster, a psychoanalyst, are the authors of "Stay, Illusion!: The Hamlet Doctrine." 
An earlier version of this essay referred imprecisely to a saying of Buddha. In a famous meditation, Buddha (whose teachings were committed to writing centuries after his death) said that before extending loving-kindness to others, one should first extend it to oneself. The expression, "You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection" does not appear in Buddhist scripture, though it is often attributed to him in self-help literature.

HEADLINE: Angst at the A.S.P.C.A.

BYLINE: By JACOB BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
One of the first times Cindy Adams went to a board meeting of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, tempers flared.
The problem wasn't the long-debated horse carriage issue. Nor was it how to prevent animals from being euthanized; the planning of the annual Bergh Ball, the organization's biggest fund-raiser; or how to spend the war chest.
The issue was Ms. Adams's hat. Specifically, that it was fur. ''It was dumb,'' Ms. Adams said last week of her sartorial miscalculation. ''I shouldn't have done it.''
But over the next couple of years, as Ms. Adams continued to serve on the board, dressed in a more politically correct manner, she was certainly an energetic patron. She plugged the A.S.P.C.A. relentlessly in her column in The New York Post; started an annual blessing of the animals at Christ Church on Park Avenue; and arranged a meeting between Christine Quinn, the City Council speaker, and A.S.P.C.A. executives, who'd had a tough time getting traction with elected officials. 
That relationship with Ms. Adams came to a sudden end this spring, however, when she resigned from the board after receiving, she said, a letter from someone on the board criticizing her for various offenses during her five-year tenure, though she did not want to discuss the details. The news made its way to The Post, where Ms. Adams is an enduring star. The article, quoting unnamed sources, said the A.S.P.C.A. was riven by ''internal disagreements'' and noted another recent defector from the board, Randy Levine, the president of the New York Yankees.
The defections allowed a glimpse into an organization that, for all its good works and undeniable fund-raising prowess, seems to be a place of warring factions and competing agendas. Indeed, over the last seven years, the A.S.P.C.A. has occupied one of the most fractious places in New York City philanthropy, with more than 15 members of the roughly 20-person board resigning and being replaced.
Last summer, the A.S.P.C.A.'s president, Ed Sayres, announced he was stepping down after almost a decade, as it was becoming clear his contract would likely not be renewed. Several board members had voiced misgivings about his $566,064 salary, more than double that of Wayne Pacelle, his counterpart at the Humane Society of the United States.
And Mr. Sayres's generous payment of a consultant, Mal Schwartz, back in 2006, sowed deep resentments in the board and staff, some of whom began a sub rosa e-mail campaign suggesting financial improprieties (none have been found).
A new president, Matthew E. Bershadker, was named in May.
''The A.S.P.C.A. board, for whatever reason, is not a happy place to be,'' said Penelope Ayers, who left the board in 2008.
Ms. Adams's take: ''It's Iraq and Iran with all the varying sects.''
How did it get to this? And why now, when the endowment has been on a seemingly nonstop upward trajectory for about a decade, aided by smart ad campaigns and a hit reality show?
Mr. Sayres arrived at the A.S.P.C.A. in 2003 from the San Francisco Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, a no-kill shelter that had success reducing the euthanization rate of abandoned animals.
Despite its name, the A.S.P.C.A. was at the time a fairly parochial organization that took in contributions of $32 million a year and focused largely on placing animals in homes and increasing spay and neuter rates in the New York area. The organization is also known for its Humane Law Enforcement Division, which is licensed by the state to investigate cruelty complaints and to make arrests.
In 2001, Animal Planet introduced a reality show about the division's officers called ''Animal Precinct,'' which did well. A robust ground effort to help animals in Louisiana in the wake of Hurricane Katrina continued to boost the A.S.P.C.A.'s national profile. By 2006, annual contributions were approaching $50 million.
An ad involving the folk singer Sarah McLachlan also helped draw donations, which totaled nearly $112 million for 2008.
With increasing sums, the A.S.P.C.A. has been able to do a major renovation of its 92nd Street headquarters and to establish a new rehabilitation facility. Due in large part to its spay/neuter work, the rescue rate of animals in New York increased and now hovers around 75 percent, among the best in the country.
But the board became divided over which legislative battles to pursue. Some board business was being conducted at Doubles, a private club in the Sherry-Netherland, which several members thought sent the wrong message.
In 2005, Mr. Sayres brought in Mr. Schwartz, the consultant, to help him with strategic planning, corporate partnerships and fund-raisers, including the resurrection of the annual dog walk. (Both men declined repeated requests for comment.)
In the annual budget for 2006, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, payment to Mr. Schwartz and his firm MBS Associates was approved at $125,000.
But when the organization filed its Form 990 with the I.R.S., it showed Mr. Schwartz and his firm had been paid $771,541, roughly $400,000 of which went to Mr. Schwartz for his work on the dog walk, according to a senior-level employee and two board members then working with the A.S.P.C.A.
It was flabbergasting, because the dog walk had netted just $14,000 (it happened on a rainy day). ''It was a washout,'' said Marsha Perelman, a former board chairman.
The board's treasurer at the time, James W. Gerard, was livid. ''It was a failure of management disclosure to the board,'' he said. ''As stewards of private donors' monies, I felt it was an inappropriate expenditure.'' (Mr. Gerard stepped down in 2008.)
Elizabeth J. Estroff, an A.S.P.C.A. representative, said: ''Board approval was obtained for all projects when it was required and all expenses were properly disclosed, as evidenced on our 990.''
Cindy Adams did not know about the divisions when she joined the board around the end of 2007. A widow, she says she found great solace in two Yorkshire terriers named Juicy and Jazzy Junior. ''All I have are my dogs,'' she said, ''so animals mean a huge amount to me.''
But in short order she came to the conclusion that Mr. Sayres was not adequately connected to either Ms. Quinn or Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. ''I realized if he's the C.E.O. ongoing and he can't get to the council speaker and he can't get to Bloomberg's people, something's wrong,'' she said. ''That's when I started this disaffection.''
As two former board members recall, though, Ms. Adams had a spotty presence at board meetings -- perhaps because they generally took place while she filing her daily columns for The Post.
Ms. Perelman, who took over as board chairwoman in 2009, also found it difficult to bring reform to the organization.
Ms. Perelman recalls that, with a fraction of the organization's donations coming locally, she believed A.S.P.C.A. had a responsibility to be more involved in lobbying and animal welfare issues around the country. ''No one else other than H.S.U.S. or the A.S.P.C.A. can afford the legislative work that needs to be done,'' she said.
Yet when Mr. Sayres and the A.S.P.C.A. did enter the fray, results were mixed. Throughout much of his tenure, Mr. Sayres was ensnared in a lawsuit against Feld Entertainment, the owners of Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus, whom the A.S.P.C.A. sued in federal court.
For nearly a decade, the organization had alleged that Feld's elephants were mistreated, but there were problems with A.S.P.C.A.'s key witness, who it turned out was receiving money from other groups that had joined the suit. The case was dismissed, and the A.S.P.C.A. paid a settlement of $9.3 million to Feld.
Another thorny issue arose because of Mr. Sayres's involvement as the co-president of Nyclass, which opposes horse-drawn carriages in New York.
Between 2008 and 2012, the A.S.P.C.A. gave the organization several hundred thousand dollars from its grant program. This became a mare's-nest when Nyclass opposed the mayoral candidacy of Ms. Quinn at the exact moment people within the A.S.P.C.A. like Ms. Adams were trying to curry favor with her. (Ms. Estroff said Mr. Sayres cut his official ties with Nyclass, and that the A.S.P.C.A. continues to finance the group, earmarking the money for nonpolitical purposes).
And there were harsh economic realities at work, too.
''The problem was, legislation doesn't raise money,'' said Bob Baker, who worked with the A.S.P.C.A.'s animal cruelty unit, investigating puppy mills. ''But you could show one picture of a mistreated dog and the funds would pour in.''
In 2010, Mr. Baker resigned from the A.S.P.C.A. ''I don't want to come off as a bitter employee,'' he said. ''But it got to the point where animal welfare was not the priority, fund-raising was. It felt as though the animals were being used for fund-raising, rather than using funds raised to help the animals.''
In recent months, the A.S.P.C.A. has made some strides, thanks to an increased legislative budget. A well-regarded lawyer was brought in from the Humane Society to oversee government work and a puppy-mill bill passed in the New York State Assembly and Senate. ''We're moving into the legislative area aggressively, but it takes time,'' Ms. Estroff said.
But back in 2010, Ms. Perelman shared nearly all of Mr. Baker's misgivings. She began to campaign against renewing Mr. Sayres's contract and got into what three board sources said was a pitched battle with Linda Lambert, the head of the A.S.P.C.A.'s nominating committee and a loyalist of Mr. Sayres.
That fall, two of these sources say, Ms. Lambert (who declined to comment) gave Ms. Perelman a stern dressing-down at a board meeting, prompting more resignations from members who thought the tone had become hostile and unpleasant. (Ms. Estroff said no ''dress down'' occurred.)
By the spring of 2011, Ms. Perelman was gone as well.
The next year was somewhat calmer. Mary Jo White, a former federal prosecutor, took over as interim chairwoman and the infighting became less intense. (Ms. White gave up her A.S.P.C.A. duties before she was nominated by President Barack Obama to head the Securities and Exchange Commission.)
This April, board members attended the annual Bergh Ball, where the designer Isaac Mizrahi took to the podium and the starlet Lake Bell posed for pictures with a pit bull. Mr. Sayres was smiling brightly, seeming to enjoy a victory tour after several years of posting fantastic fund-raising numbers. Numerous well-connected pet-lovers were in attendance, including the organization's vice chairman, James L. Nederlander, the Broadway producer; and Arriana Boardman, the young, horse-riding wife of D. Dixon Boardman, the hedge-fund magnate.
But even with a new chairman, Tim Wray, presiding over board meetings, tensions were again building: this time over who would succeed Mr. Sayres.
For months, Korn/Ferry, a blue-chip recruiting firm, had been assisting with the search. Scores of outside candidates were interviewed.
Ms. Lambert and Mr. Wray pushed for an insider, Mr. Bershadker, a 12-year veteran of the organization who had spent time overseeing the Humane Law Enforcement Division. The division had been successful at getting press for the A.S.P.C.A. (thanks in part to ''Animal Precinct''), and Mr. Bershadker had given what another board member had described as a ''terrific'' interview. But the actual number of cruelty arrests by the division was extremely low, around 103 a year against 50,000 tips, according to a 2007 New York Times investigation.
As a board member, Mr. Levine -- who had long felt the enforcement division had been mismanaged and that Ms. Lambert had too much sway with the board -- was becoming agitated.
''I spent a lot of time in the search process looking for a new C.E.O.,'' Mr. Levine said. ''I think Matt is very talented and I felt he would eventually be a great C.E.O. But I thought both he and the A.S.P.C.A. needed a more experienced hand at this point in time.''
So when it became clear that Mr. Levine was in the minority on the succession, and that Mr. Bershadker's appointment as the next president was a fait accompli, Mr. Levine announced his resignation at a board meeting and left the room.
With all that has transpired, some board members think the A.S.P.C.A. is just suffering growing pains.
''A lot of board members had served very long tenures for nonprofits,'' said Mr. Wray, the current chairman. ''We have dialogues and healthy debates like all boards, then we come to a consensus and move forward. Like no other organization in animal welfare, we're on the front lines. Whatever your philosophical differences are, you appreciate that.''
He added: ''I would match our senior management team against any successful nonprofit corporate organization in terms of the quality of work they do and their attention to it.''

HEADLINE: All-New 2014 Mazda 3 Is Unveiled in New York

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN PRESTON

 BODY:
If you haven't already seen photos that were leaked all over the Internet before Mazda's official unveiling of the 2014 Mazda 3 in Manhattan on Wednesday morning, the all-new compact is a looker. With proportions reminiscent of long-nose, short-rear-deck pony car glory, the new Mazda 3 is the latest example of the company's Kodo design language. 
''I've been telling people we're going to get rid of the Smile. We got rid of the Smile,'' said Derek Jenkins, director of design for Mazda's North American operations. He is, of course, referring to the cartoonish grille grins the company's past generation of models wore. Kodo cars have a five-pointed grille opening that, set between two sinister headlamp eyes, looks more like a puckish attack scowl.
Mazda's handsome Kodo design language -- we're told that kodo means ''soul of motion'' -- has already made its way from those sleek concept cars brought to international auto shows over the last few years to production models like the CX-5 compact crossover and the Mazda 6 midsize sedan. Finally, with even the ever strong-selling, but often lackluster Toyota Corolla getting a facelift for next year, Mazda got to its popular compact, applying Kodo magic to the Mazda 3 as well.
The new Mazda 3, which is a few inches longer than the outgoing model, but a couple hundred pounds lighter, will also have many features not common in the compact car segment, which Mazda says is its bread and butter. Among them are a head-up display system for speed, r.p.m. and by-direction navigation information, new navigation and infotainment systems, a rear-view camera, adaptive front lighting, a lane departure warning system and adaptive cruise control.
Although a diesel power plant option is not likely, Mazda said, the company's high-compression 2-liter and 2.5-liter Skyactiv 4-cylinder gasoline engines will be options for the new Mazda 3. Jeremy Barnes, a spokesman for Mazda, said that specific horsepower and fuel economy numbers would be available in a few weeks, as would transmission options, pricing and an unveiling of the new sedan model.
''It will be priced competitively in the heart of the segment,'' he said.
Mazda said the first new Mazda 3 models will be built in Japan. Later, after the company opens a new plant it plans to open in Mexico in the spring of 2014, Mazda 3 production will be shifted there. The 2014 Mazda 3 should be available in dealerships in September of this year.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The New Prostitutes

BYLINE: By ROBERT KOLKER

 BODY:
Take the Long Hill Road exit off I-95 in eastern Connecticut and curl south toward the waterfront city of Groton and you'll find each of the places that briefly employed Maureen Brainard-Barnes. There is the TJ Maxx and the AutoZone and the Stop and Shop. And the Chester's chicken counter, where she made the potato wedges. And the shopping center with the Groton Cinema 6, where she picked up discarded snacks from the carpet in exchange for free admission and a bag of popcorn.
In 2005, Ms. Brainard-Barnes was a 22-year-old single mother who had difficulty holding down a steady job. She never could afford her own place, staying with her sister for long stretches and occasionally with a boyfriend. Modeling, she thought, could lead to a music career. As soon as she enrolled on a site called ModelMayhem.com, she received dozens of e-mails from places that purported to be modeling agencies but that, after a few clicks, turned out to mean nude modeling and sometimes working as an escort. She wasn't thrown by seeing this. What did surprise her was the money. 
Within a few months, Ms. Brainard-Barnes was making up to $2,000 a day on trips to New York City. She posted ads on Craigslist and worked out of a hotel room in Midtown for short stretches and then returned home to care for her daughter. After so many years of depending on others, she could leave her responsibilities behind and become another person for a while -- and she could earn enough money to fulfill those same responsibilities. Online, she could be her own boss and not share what she made with anyone -- not a pimp, not an escort service, not a boyfriend.
In 2010, Maureen Brainard-Barnes's body was one of four uncovered close by one another in the sand dunes of Gilgo Beach, Long Island, wrapped in burlap. Three years later, the Long Island serial killer case remains unsolved, even as six more sets of remains have been discovered nearby along Ocean Parkway and farther east. The first four bodies were identified as women in their 20s -- just like another woman, Shannan Gilbert, who had disappeared three miles from where the four bodies in burlap were found. These five women clearly had much in common. Maureen Brainard-Barnes, Melissa Barthelemy, Shannan Gilbert, Megan Waterman and Amber Lynn Costello all grew up in struggling towns a long distance from Long Island. And they all were escorts who discovered an easy entree into prostitution online.
It had seemed enough, at first, for some to say that the victims were all prostitutes, practically interchangeable -- lost souls who were gone, in a sense, long before they actually disappeared. That is a story our culture tells about people like them, a conventional way of thinking about how young girls fall into a life of prostitution: unstable family lives, addiction, neglect.
But in the two years I've spent learning about the lives of all five women, I have found that they all defied expectations. They were not human-trafficking victims in the classic sense. They stayed close to their families. They all came to New York to take advantage of a growing black market -- an underground economy that offered them life-changing money, and with a remarkably low barrier to entry. The real temptation wasn't drugs or alcohol, but the promise of social mobility.
The Web has been the great disrupter of any number of industries, transforming the way people shop for everything, and commercial sex has been no exception. Posting ads online, escorts find clients without ever having to leave home or walk the streets. The method is easier, seductively so, almost like an A.T.M. -- post an ad, and your phone rings seconds later. That ease clearly doesn't mitigate the risk of meeting strangers, though it might seem like it to some escorts.
The great transforming feature of the Internet is its anonymity. We all have learned that a person can do practically anything online without even their closest loved ones knowing, from commenting on Yelp or Gawker to selling stolen goods or viewing porn videos. This is as true for the escorts as it was for the clients, who have turned sites like TheEroticReview.com into a sort of Yelp for steady customers of commercial sex. No one has to go to a bad part of town to look for what he wants.
While no one has yet measured exactly how significantly the Internet has increased the number of working escorts, it's already clear that many Internet sex workers would never seriously consider working on the street. Scott Cunningham, an economist at Baylor University, conducted a survey of 700 sex workers in the United States and Canada. ''The Internet is augmenting the sex market by bringing in women who would not have entered the sex market without the Internet,'' he says. In one month chosen at random by Mr. Cunningham -- May 2009 -- an average of 1,690 sex-worker ads were posted online every day in the New York City area alone.
All it took to persuade many of these women to enter the field, Mr. Cunningham theorizes, was a little financial pressure, or ''economic shocks.'' The explanations for entering escort work, he says, ''are often surrounding loss of income or increase of expenses they need to cover. A woman told me she was getting a divorce, she had a child, her husband was not going to provide child support. She already had a 40-hour-a-week job. And so her options were, she could get another job and work about 60 hours a week. Or she could do this and see her child more and have more money.''
The women of Gilgo Beach all came from parts of the country hit hard by the recession like Buffalo, N.Y., and Portland, Me. -- places where even if you did well in school, there seemed to be not much of a chance of finding a higher-than-minimum-wage job, much less one with health benefits. Some worked for escort services or walked the streets before turning to the Internet; others got their start online. Using Web sites like Craigslist and Backpage, they all made money that transformed their lives.
Shannan Gilbert worked for a high-end escort service in Jersey City, where the minimum rate was $400 or $500 an hour. But she took home only a third of that. When she switched to Craigslist, she made $1,000 many nights, enough to pay a month's rent on her apartment. Melissa Barthelemy abandoned her pimp to be her own boss online, charging $100 for 15 minutes, $150 for a half-hour, $250 for an hour and $1,000 for an overnight stay. She made enough money to come home to Buffalo at Christmastime and take her sister and mother to a spa for massages. ''You deserve to be pampered,'' she told them.
Megan Waterman took three- or four-day working trips to Long Island from her home in Portland and made $1,500 on a busy night. And Amber Lynn Costello, a North Carolina native who lived briefly in West Babylon, Long Island, once raised $3,800 in just three days to bail out her boyfriend from jail -- all, her friends said, from Craigslist.
''In the beginning, you make the money, and you're making it without the drugs,'' said her sister Kim Overstreet, who has also worked as an escort. ''And then you get addicted to the money.''
The women weren't the only ones to have profited. In 2010, Craigslist earned a reported $44.4 million from Adult Services ads, or about a third of the company's total revenue (the site had started charging $5 to $10 per posting two years earlier). For a time, some believed that Craigslist and its competitors were doing well by doing good. In 2006, a research team from Princeton and Columbia said that this new wave of prostitutes had a ''professional and careerist orientation.''
Three years later, Mr. Cunningham noted in one study that the Web was drawing different sorts of people into prostitution -- they were better educated and they were thinner. In 2011, Jennifer Hafer, a researcher at the University of Arkansas, said people embraced online prostitution ''for many of the same reasons that people enter the conventional job market -- money, stability, autonomy and even job satisfaction.'' The Internet, said to be the solution to so many problems, was expected to legitimize the entire field of prostitution, elevate the underclass and make pimps a thing of the past.
OBVIOUSLY, that wasn't how things turned out for the women of Gilgo Beach. Maureen Brainard-Barnes disappeared in July 2007, last heard from near Penn Station. Melissa Barthelemy was said to be heading by herself to Long Island for an overnight appointment in July 2009. Shannan Gilbert vanished in the middle of a call in Oak Beach on May 1, 2010, in circumstances that still have not been fully explained. A month later, Megan Waterman disappeared after leaving a hotel room in Hauppauge. And in September 2010, Amber Lynn Costello, who didn't like to leave her house for work, had agreed to an overnight date for $1,500. Many other online escorts have reported incidents of violence. Nearly half of the New York City online escorts surveyed by the Urban Justice Center's Sex Workers Project in 2005 said they had been forced by a client to do something they did not want to do, and almost as many said they had been threatened or beaten. (In his research, Mr. Cunningham has found that the escorts who needed the money the most were the ones who lacked the resources and time to properly vet their clients.)
Politicians and law enforcement officials took notice of the problem in 2009, the same year Philip Haynes Markoff was arrested and charged with the murder of a masseuse he met on Craigslist. That same year, the sheriff of Cook County, Illinois, sued Craigslist, calling the site ''the single largest source of prostitution in the nation.''
Of course, if capitalism teaches us anything, it's that a demand-heavy market will find a way to thrive no matter what the obstacles. The pressure forced Craigslist to shut down its Adult Services category on Sept. 3, 2010 -- as it happens, the day after Amber Lynn Costello went missing. Right away, the main competitor to Craigslist, Backpage, experienced an explosion in new escort postings. If community pressure or the threat of litigation sinks Backpage, a dozen more sites like it stand ready to pick up the traffic (and some escorts have never left Craigslist, posting surreptitiously in other categories).
The market doesn't care if prostitution is right or wrong, empowering or exploitative. The demand sustains human trafficking and under-age escorts engaging in survival sex. Just last month, the social-service organization Covenant House in Midtown Manhattan released the findings of a survey it conducted with Fordham University, which found that nearly half of the under-age prostitutes seeking help said they did it because they did not have a place to live.
Escorts face danger not because of the Internet but because they're still forced to work underground. In a different world, technology could be harnessed to reduce the dangers of prostitution. The University of Colorado law professor Scott Peppet has floated the possibility of a ''technology-enabled sex market'' where escorts and clients are all pre-vetted and predators are screened out. ''The law, however, is hostile to such innovation,'' Professor Peppet writes. ''It currently criminalizes not just prostitution itself, but activities -- including technologies -- that advance or facilitate sex markets.'' As it stands, escorts online remain invisible, where they are vulnerable to predators.
At the top of the pay scale, technology is delivering on its promise. Workers can increase their hours and their output from home and even work second jobs with more ease than ever. But toward the bottom, anxiety lingers, and the Web enables some people to take risks they never would have imagined. In this way, the women of Gilgo Beach still have something to teach us. The Internet might have made pimps less necessary, but today's escorts are as marginalized as ever, and every bit as vulnerable. The police rarely help them when they are at risk, and they rarely take their disappearances seriously. As far as the authorities are concerned, their profession still seals their fate.

HEADLINE: When Fuel Economy Improves, but Filling the Tank Costs More

BYLINE: By TUDOR VAN HAMPTON

 BODY:
The math seems so straightforward: as engines get smaller and fuel economy improves, the cost of driving will fall, right?
Not necessarily. In a growing number of new vehicles, the methods used to squeeze equivalent horsepower from engines with smaller -- or fewer -- cylinders have automakers pointing customers toward the pump that dispenses premium-grade gasoline. That's a setback for drivers who hoped their new car's better mileage rating would mean savings with each fill-up.
It's also a reminder that the label of premium, meant to signal the gasoline's octane rating -- its ability to forestall the destructive effects of erratic combustion -- also applies to the price. According to the Energy Department, premium averages 30 cents a gallon more than regular-grade gas, or $4.50 for each 15-gallon fill-up.
It's an extra expense that Micah Highland, a 35-year-old photographer in La Grange, Ill., knows well. Last year, he bought a 2008 Acura MDX, a sport utility roomy enough for his wife, daughters and Rosco, their Great Dane. 
Mr. Highland was aware of the MDX's fuel requirements before he made the purchase. Still, when the dealer handed him the keys and reminded him to fill up with premium gas, he thought to himself, ''Oh, man. Are you serious?''
Mr. Highland, whose previous S.U.V. also required premium, said he considered vehicles that did not require the more costly fuel, but after seeing the MDX, ''fuel wasn't a factor.'' Filling the tank costs about $80; today's MDX still requires premium, according to Edmunds.com, a Web site that offers car-buying guidance.
In the last 10 years, the number of models that require a fill-up with premium unleaded gasoline has actually fallen slightly, says Edmunds.com. Ten years ago, 21 percent of all models required premium, which in the United States typically carries an octane rating of 91 or higher; today, the number is 17 percent.
But the number of vehicles for which automakers recommend premium -- guidance typically found in the owner's manual or on the fuel-filler door -- is growing. Premium was recommended for only 2.5 percent of all models in 2003, says Edmunds.com; for 2013 models, it's 12 percent.
''What we are seeing now is a higher penetration of smaller engines that are developing more power and torque,'' Bill Visnic, a senior editor at Edmunds.com, said. ''As you get to the higher-output engines, manufacturers are probably going to at least recommend premium fuel, if not require it.''
Filling the tank with regular-grade gas when premium fuel is recommended has drawbacks. Horsepower, torque and fuel economy may suffer, though modern engine-management electronics prevent internal damage. Sensors in current models detect knock, or detonation in the cylinders, that was heard in older cars as ''pinging,'' a distinctive rattle that let drivers know when the gas didn't meet the engine's needs.
The premium label does not always carry over to vehicles whose diet calls for the more expensive gas. While there's little surprise in a BMW or Mercedes having a preference for high-octane blends, 2013 models whose makers recommend premium include economy-focused vehicles like the Fiat 500, Mini Cooper and Nissan Juke, as well as some versions of the Dodge Dart, Subaru Impreza and Volkswagen Beetle -- even the Chevrolet Volt.
The higher pump price of premium can have a wet-blanket effect on sales of vehicles in the lower price classes. Mazda learned this lesson with its CX-7 compact crossover, introduced in 2007. Originally equipped with a 2.3-liter turbocharged engine that required premium fuel, sales lagged despite the boom in crossovers.
''What we found was that there was either a rejection of the car when people were shopping, or it proved to be a customer satisfaction problem if they discovered that the running costs were higher,'' said Ruben Archilla, a manager for advanced engineering at Mazda North America.
The automaker modified the engine to make premium gas recommended rather than required, which sacrificed power and fuel economy, but it was too late. By the time Mazda rolled out a 2.5-liter nonturbo engine that ran on regular gasoline, consumers were already shopping elsewhere.
The CX-7 was discontinued last year to make way for the more fuel-efficient 2013 CX-5, which takes regular fuel and wrings performance out of its SkyActiv engine using a high 13:1 compression ratio.
''The whole premium-fuel question is not a problem if you are BMW, but it's a big issue if you are trying to sell cars that are in the compact car range,'' he said.
Not wanting to risk the loss of customers to other makes, engine designers at high-volume brands are stepping up efforts to squeeze more power from downsized gasoline engines that will run on regular grade.
''There has always been a desire by the chief engineers to keep the consumer fuel cost as low as possible and to design the vehicles around regular unleaded,'' Bill Studzinski, a powertrain fuels specialist at General Motors, said.
That has become increasingly challenging, because as engine sizes are shrinking, cylinder pressures are rising, either as a result of using higher compression ratios -- squeezing the air and fuel tighter during the combustion process -- or through the addition of turbochargers or superchargers. Each method can have the effect of increasing the likelihood of engine knock.
At the same time, consumers want small engines to perform like big ones.
''As we continue to reduce the displacement of the engine, the customers' expectations of the performance of the vehicle aren't changing,'' Doug Skorupski, technical strategy manager at Volkswagen of America, said. ''So you have to run higher and higher boost pressures from your turbochargers, and as you do that, higher octane plays into it.''
Engineers have several tools to prevent engine knock, but there's no cure-all. Knock sensors, which can signal the engine-control computer to delay the ignition spark when detonation is detected, inevitably cut back performance. Owners of cars that carry a premium-fuel recommendation can safely operate their vehicles with regular unleaded fuel; however, the engine will lose roughly five horsepower and one to two m.p.g., Mr. Skorupski said.
''You are reducing your fuel economy and your performance, but there is no detrimental damage to the engine,'' he said.
Another increasingly common technology, direct fuel injection, sprays gasoline into the cylinder at high pressure; the cooling effect of the atomized gasoline helps to keep knock in check. In effect, direct injection tricks the engine into thinking it is running a higher-octane gas -- up to four to six octane numbers, Rick Davis, a combustion specialist at G.M., said.
Putting regular-grade fuel in a car for which premium is required, rather than just recommended, is far riskier, experts say. ''Under extreme driving conditions, the engines aren't necessarily protected from degradation or damage if somebody used regular fuel,'' Mr. Davis said.
Fluctuations in the price gap between regular and premium gasoline will continue to confound consumers.
Late last year and through the first quarter of this year, the average price difference between premium and regular unleaded gasoline in the United States rose to more than 30 cents per gallon, according to the Energy Information Administration. In some locales, the gap is closer to 40 cents.
Fuel experts attribute this growing spread partly to the increased use of ethanol, which acts as an octane booster, while others say that ethanol blending has actually kept premium prices lower than they otherwise might be. Ethanol, which has an octane rating of 115, is blended at a 10 percent concentration into nearly all of the gasoline available in the United States.
''On a percentage basis, the price spread between premium-grade and regular-grade gasoline has actually remained relatively stable,'' said a May 6 report from the Energy Information Administration.
Sensitivity to the extra cost of premium gas is less of a concern, predictably, for drivers of luxury-class vehicles. Patrick DeLisle, a 36-year-old business analyst in Indianapolis, says he spends an extra $3 each time he fills his 2009 BMW X3.
''It's a cup of coffee,'' Mr. DeLisle reasons. ''If I drove more, then I would just not drink coffee outside my house. You save $3 a day just brewing it yourself.''

 TRADE-OFF: Despite its requirement of premium gas, a 2008 Acura MDX made sense for Micah Highland because it could carry the entire family, including Rosco. (PHOTOGRAPH BY MICAH HIGHLAND FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) (AU6) CHART: Your Cost May Vary: Premium-grade gasoline, with an octane rating of 91 or higher, is either required or recommended for about 30 percent of 2013 model vehicles. In fuel-efficient cars like the Fiat 500, the higher price of premium -- about 30 cents a gallon more than regular, which has an octane rating of 87 or lower -- can eat away at the savings realized by the car's excellent mileage. Here are examples of the added expense for the owners of a Fiat 500 and a Nissan GT-R, both recommended to use premium. The cost difference is based on 15,000 miles of driving, with regular grade at $3.58 and premium at $3.88, using each car's E.P.A. combined mileage. (AU6)

HEADLINE: Visit by Obama Is Overshadowed by Mandela Vigil

BYLINE: By DECLAN WALSH and MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
JOHANNESBURG -- Nelson Mandela always wanted to go quietly. Despite his stature as a global icon, he sought a dignified withdrawal from public life in recent years. Privately he told aides of his desire for a quiet funeral, stripped of pomp.
That is not how it is happening now. With Mr. Mandela in critical condition in a hospital from a serious lung infection, and as President Obama arrived Friday for a state visit, the country was in the grip of passions, ceremony and controversy as its people come to terms with finally bidding Mr. Mandela farewell.
Outside the hospital gates, South Africans of all races prayed, sang and dropped flowers for their revered father figure. Less harmoniously, a simmering family feud over his funeral arrangements burst into public view. A 65-year-old woman claiming to be his illegitimate daughter stepped forward, demanding to be let into the hospital to meet him. 
In the evening, Mr. Obama entered the fray, faced with a delicate diplomatic balancing act involving statesmanship, policy and respect for a fading hero. Mr. Obama, who had planned weeks ago to visit Mr. Mandela during this trip, wishes to honor the man who inspired his career in politics, mindful that he is arriving as South Africans are sorrowful over their beloved former president's condition. On Saturday the White House announced that Mr. Obama would meet later in the day with relatives of Mr. Mandela, but not visit the former leader at the hospital.
''I don't need a photo-op,'' Mr. Obama said while on his way to South Africa, where he landed just a few miles from the Pretoria hospital where Mr. Mandela has been lying in intensive care. ''Right now, our main concern is with his well-being, his comfort, and with the family's well-being and comfort.''
At any other time, Mr. Obama's arrival would have been a symbolically potent moment with resonance for both countries: America's first black president visiting a nation that only two decades ago shook off the yoke of white minority rule.
But for South Africans, their hearts, if not their eyes, were focused on something else.
''This trip is overshadowed by Nelson Mandela's illness,'' said Justice Malala, a political commentator and columnist. ''Its impact will be blunted because people's attention is elsewhere.''
Some unfolding events seemed to be exactly what Mr. Mandela had hoped to avoid. A court hearing in a provincial town on Friday exposed a bitter family rift over arrangements for his funeral.
Mr. Mandela has long been painfully aware of the divides within his family, and on Friday lawyers and magistrates confirmed that 16 Mandela relatives, led by his eldest daughter, Makaziwe Mandela, had filed a lawsuit against a grandson, Mandla Mandela, a tribal chief.
A report from South Africa's national broadcaster pointed to a macabre squabble at work: the plaintiffs want to compel Mandla to rebury three relatives, who had been exhumed and moved some years ago from the family graveyard at Qunu, Nelson Mandela's home village, back in their original graves.
The court action appeared to stem from an argument over where Mr. Mandela should be buried. Mandla prefers a site at the headquarters of his tribal village of Mvezo, where Mr. Mandela was born; the rest of the family wants him to be buried at Qunu, where he grew up.
Among some South Africans, the government's careful management of news about Mr. Mandela even stoked speculation that it was somehow keeping him alive in order to facilitate Mr. Obama's trip. The government flatly rejected such rumors.
''Urban legend,'' said Mac Maharaj, the presidential spokesman. ''That has been put to us before, and it is wrong. People take the government's report as accurate.''
Mr. Obama, who is accompanied by his wife, Michelle, and their daughters, Sasha and Malia, arrived from Senegal and was due to travel to Tanzania on Sunday. His long-awaited African tour is intended to stress the importance of trade, not aid, for the continent.
''Everything we do is designed to make sure that Africa is not viewed as a dependent, as a charity case, but is instead viewed as a partner,'' he told reporters on Friday.
In South Africa, Mr. Obama plans to salute Mr. Mandela's life with a visit on Sunday to Robben Island, the prison where Mr. Mandela spent 18 years in a tiny cell, now a somber tourist attraction inhabited mainly by penguins.
Mr. Obama's host here will be President Jacob Zuma, a controversial figure who in some ways epitomizes the disappointments of the post-Mandela era.
A charismatic populist, Mr. Zuma has attracted fire for his views -- he is a practicing polygamist who believes all women should get married -- while his penchant for singing his signature song, ''Bring Me My Machine Gun,'' causes some supporters to cringe.
Mr. Zuma's reputation has been dented by a 2006 rape trial (even though he was acquitted), corruption accusations and his handling of the police shooting of 34 striking platinum miners last August.
On Saturday, he will meet with Mr. Obama to discuss economic development, security issues in Sudan and Central Africa, and efforts to promote democracy on the continent. A day later, on Sunday, Mr. Obama is scheduled to deliver the major speech of his trip at the University of Cape Town, where Robert F. Kennedy made a famous address in 1966.
It is unclear whether either side will nod to the more controversial aspects of America's historical engagement with South Africa: accusations that the C.I.A. helped the apartheid police arrest Mr. Mandela in 1962, or the fact that the State Department removed Mr. Mandela from its terrorist list only in 2008 -- 15 years after he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Along with enthusiastic well-wishers, Mr. Obama is expected to confront protests about his foreign policies from a coalition of trade unionists, students, lawyers and Muslim groups.
For South Africans the American president's visit was not the biggest story of the day. The tide of public worry has focused on the Mediclinic Heart Hospital in Pretoria, where a wall of handwritten notes and balloons has become a shrine of sorts to Mr. Mandela.
His wife, Graa Machel, sleeps in a room nearby, remaining far from public view. In recent days, visiting relatives have emerged from the hospital with often worrisome news. ''I won't lie, it doesn't look good,'' Makaziwe Mandela said on Thursday.
But on Friday Mr. Mandela's former wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela offered a note of hope. He was showing ''great improvement'' compared with a few days earlier, she told reporters.
Tension over the intense news media coverage at the hospital, stoked by criticism from the Mandela family, continued on Friday. The police detained a South African filmmaker who flew a radio-controlled helicopter, with a camera mounted underneath, over the scene.
Despite his stated desire for a quiet goodbye, Mr. Mandela has long been used to the idea of leveraging his celebrity in the service of his struggle for freedom, said Mr. Malala, the political analyst.
''He was always someone who understood the value of spectacle,'' he said. ''The liberation struggle needed a face, a symbol. And he understood that was the price that had to be paid.''

HEADLINE: A Not-So-Powerful Federal Reserve

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''The Fed's Framers Would Be Shocked'' (Hindsight, June 23): 
Yes, they would be shocked, but not for the reasons stated. Rather than becoming the all-powerful central authority that Americans fear, the Federal Reserve has turned into the whipping boy of the markets and the ''money trust'' it was created to tame.
Listen again to the words of Ben Bernanke, the Fed's chairman, about its possible course in the face of economic uncertainty: ''If things are worse, we will do more. If things are better, we will do less.'' That's hardly the tone of a bully demanding that markets dance to its tune.
Immediately after his speech, stocks, bonds and other asset classes that are supposed to move in different directions sank in unison. The temper tantrum at the prospect of a gradual end to easy money makes it harder for the Fed to reverse course. Who wants to be responsible for another meltdown of stock prices?
If we fear the Fed's outsized influence on the economy, we need to recognize the source of the problem: our nation's central bank is no longer in charge. During the financial crisis, the Fed had to step in and pay for the sins of corporations that claimed to know better. Ultralow interest rates and quantitative easing have reflated asset prices, but the real economy of everyday workers and savers has benefited much less. Now that the Fed wants to leave the stage, the money trust refuses to let it go.

HEADLINE: The End of Car Culture

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL. 
A reporter who covers environment and health for The New York Times.

 BODY:
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.
That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving? 
The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world's prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized ''Mustang Sally'' and the Beach Boys, ''Little Deuce Coupe.''
But America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.
''What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,'' said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute. ''I think that means something more fundamental is going on.''
If the pattern persists -- and many sociologists believe it will -- it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves ''mobility'' companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.
''Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,'' said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.
With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit.
On top of that, city, state and federal policies that for more than half a century encouraged suburbanization and car use -- from mortgage lending to road building -- are gradually being diluted or reversed. ''They created what I call a culture of 'automobility,' and arguably in the last 5 to 10 years that is dying out,'' Ms. Sheller said.
New York's new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.
Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak's research has found.
He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver's license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it's not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.
Mr. Sivak's son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. ''When I was in my 20s and 30s,'' Mr. Sivak said, ''I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don't really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn't work.''
A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. The millennials don't value cars and car ownership, they value technology -- they care about what kinds of devices you own, Ms. Sheller said. The percentage of young drivers is inversely related to the availability of the Internet, Mr. Sivak's research has found. Why spend an hour driving to work when you could take the bus or train and be online?
From 2007 to 2011, the age group most likely to buy a car shifted from the 35 to 44 group to the 55 to 64 group, he found.
Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.
At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which ''pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.''
While President Obama's efforts to reduce emissions will benefit from Americans' reduced interest in driving, China's leaders will have no such luck: there, personal car ownership is growing by more than 10 percent annually.

HEADLINE: Democrats Get a Gift From the Roberts Court

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
BACK in the days when Republicans were reading polls through rose-colored glasses and imagining a Mitt Romney landslide, one of their most plausible arguments was that many pollsters were simply misreading the likely composition of the electorate. There was no way, this theory ran, that core Democratic constituencies would turn out at the same rates as in 2008, when Obamamania was at its peak. Instead, 2012 was set up to be what the conservative writer Ben Domenech called an ''undertow election,'' in which reduced turnout among young voters and minorities would drag the incumbent down to defeat.
This expectation turned out to be wrong on two counts. First, Republicans faced an unexpected (though in hindsight, predictable) undertow of their own, as many conservative-leaning, working-class white voters looked at what Mitt Romney had to offer and simply stayed home. 
Second, instead of declining as expected after the history-making election of 2008, African-American turnout may have actually risen again in 2012. When the Census Bureau released its turnout analysis last month, it showed blacks voting at higher rates than whites for the first time in the history of the survey.
If you believe Chief Justice John Roberts Jr.'s more overheated liberal critics, last week's Supreme Court decision invalidating a portion of the Voting Rights Act is designed to make sure African-American turnout never hits these highs again. The ruling will allow a number of (mostly Southern) states to change voting laws without the Justice Department's pre-approval, which has liberals predicting a wave of Republican-led efforts to ''suppress'' minority votes -- through voter ID laws, restrictions on early voting and other measures.
These predictions probably overstate the ruling's direct impact on state election rules, which can still be challenged under other provisions of the Voting Rights Act and other state and federal laws. But it is possible that the decision will boost the existing Republican enthusiasm for voter ID laws, and hasten the ongoing, multistate push for their adoption.
If so, though, the Roberts Court may have actually handed the Democratic Party a political gift.
How so? Well, to begin with, voter identification laws do not belong to the same moral or legal universe as Jim Crow. Their public purpose, as a curb to fraud, is potentially legitimate rather than nakedly discriminatory, and their effects are relatively limited. As Roberts's majority opinion noted, the voter registration gap between whites and blacks in George Wallace's segregationist Alabama was 50 percentage points. When my colleague Nate Silver looked at studies assessing the impact of voter ID laws, he estimated that they tend to reduce turnout by around 2 percent -- and that reduction crosses racial lines, rather than affecting African-Americans exclusively.
A 2 percent dip is still enough to influence a close election. But voter ID laws don't take effect in a vacuum: as they're debated, passed and contested in court, they shape voter preferences and influence voter enthusiasm in ways that might well outstrip their direct influence on turnout. They inspire registration drives and education efforts; they help activists fund-raise and organize; they raise the specter of past injustices; they reinforce a narrative that their architects are indifferent or hostile to minorities.
This, I suspect, is part of the story of why African-American turnout didn't fall off as expected between 2008 and 2012. By trying to restrict the franchise on the margins, Republican state legislators handed Democrats a powerful tool for mobilization and persuasion, and motivated voters who might otherwise have lost some of their enthusiasm after the euphoria of ''Yes We Can'' gave way to the reality of a stagnant, high-unemployment economy.
So a lengthy battle over voting rules and voting rights seems almost precision-designed to help the Obama-era Democratic majority endure once President Obama has left the Oval Office. As Sean Trende of RealClearPolitics has pointed out, for all the talk about how important Hispanics are to the conservative future, the Republican Party could substantially close the gap with Democrats in presidential elections if its post-Obama share of the African-American vote merely climbed back above 10 percent -- a feat achieved by Bob Dole and both Bushes. If that share climbed higher still, the Democratic majority would be in danger of collapse.
Such a turn of events wouldn't just be good news for Republicans. It would be good news for black Americans, as it would mean that both parties were competing for their votes.
But for now, our politics is headed in the opposite direction. Liberal demagogy notwithstanding, voter ID laws aren't a way for Republicans to turn the clock back and make sure that it's always 1965. But they are a good way for Republicans to ensure that African-Americans keep voting like it's always 2008.

HEADLINE: Why Healthy Eaters Fall for Fries

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD. 
A business reporter for The New York Times.

 BODY:
LAST Tuesday, Connor Moran, a limit-the-red-meat, increase-the-greens, eat-salad-for-lunch kind of guy, stopped into a Bronx Dunkin' Donuts for his usual black coffee, no sugar, no cream.
He walked out with a sandwich of egg and bacon between two halves of a glazed doughnut.
Such is the puzzle of the food industry: American consumers, even otherwise healthy ones, keep choosing caloric indulgences rather than healthy foods at fast-food restaurants.
Public health officials have been pushing fast-food restaurants to offer more nutritious foods to help combat excess weight in the United States, where more than one-third of American adults are obese. And restaurants have obliged by adding healthy menu items. But it's the sugary, fatty items that are flying -- or waddling -- out the door. 
The new menu items added by fast-food chains this year indicate as much: a brownie-batter-filled doughnut (Dunkin' Donuts), a bacon habanero ranch Quarter Pounder (McDonald's), bacon-filled tater tots (Burger King), a six-slices-of-bacon-and-cheese burger (Carl's Jr. and Hardee's), a choco-covered pretzel and choco chunk vanilla Blizzard (Dairy Queen), and a chocolate molten lava cake (Arby's).
Then there's the Glazed Donut Breakfast Sandwich from Dunkin' Donuts that Mr. Moran tried. It was rolled out nationally this month after a Massachusetts test that was a ''viral hit,'' the company's executive chef told The Boston Globe earlier this month. ''Within days of the test, people were sending pictures, tweeting 'look what I got!' or 'this is so wrong!' and it was just incredible.''
If unhealthy food is wrong, restaurant visitors apparently don't want to be right.
McDonald's chief executive officer, Donald Thompson, said recently that although the chain had devoted one-sixth of its advertising time to salads, they make up 2 to 3 percent of sales, and don't drive growth. Perhaps it would make more sense to give consumers vegetables by stuffing them inside McWraps, Mr. Thompson said.
And while restaurants try lower-calorie options -- an egg-white sandwich here, a turkey burger there -- the unhealthy stuff is ''what consumers order -- it's, quite frankly, on them,'' said Darren Tristano, executive vice president at Technomic, a food-industry consulting firm.
Gavan J. Fitzsimons, a professor who studies consumer psychology at Duke's Fuqua School of Business, has researched the disconnect.
In studies, he has presented participants with a range of menu choices -- sometimes just unhealthy items, sometimes neutral items (like a fish sandwich) and sometimes healthy choices like salad. It turned out that including a healthy option did change people's behavior -- by making them eat more unhealthily.
''When you put a healthy option up there on an otherwise unhealthy menu, not only do we not pick it, but its presence on the menu leads us to swing over and pick something that's worse for us than we normally would,'' Mr. Fitzsimons said.
Why? Mr. Fitzsimons called the phenomenon ''vicarious goal fulfillment.'' By seeing a healthy menu option at a restaurant, ''it basically satisfies that goal to be healthy,'' he said, and gives consumers leeway to order what they want.
And health-conscious eaters are the most susceptible to picking unhealthy items when the menu also has healthy ones. ''It's often the ones raising their hands, saying they would pick the salad, those are the ones that are the most at risk when they walk in,'' he said.
The road to hell may be paved with good intentions, but so, apparently, is the road to high cholesterol.
It's a conflict the Nobel-winning economist Thomas C. Schelling described in his book ''Choice and Consequence'': ''People behave sometimes as if they had two selves, one who wants clean lungs and long life and another who adores tobacco, or one who wants a lean body and another who wants dessert,'' he wrote. ''The two are in continual contest for control.''
Even when consumers are explicitly told the calories a food contains, it doesn't change their behavior much.
Brian Elbel, an assistant professor of population health and health policy at New York University's School of Medicine, studied consumer behavior before and after the city required chain restaurants to post calorie counts in 2008.
He found that 54 percent of respondents in New York City said they noticed the calorie labeling. Of those, less than a quarter said they ate fewer calories as a result.
BUT their behavior did not, in fact, change. When Dr. Elbel analyzed consumers' receipts, he found that there was no difference in calories consumed, whether people said they responded to the calorie counts or not. Consumers may be engaging in what behavioral economists call hyperbolic discounting, he said. ''It's just easier to imagine what this is going to feel like now, and harder to think through what it feels like later,'' he said.
When New York City financed another study after the calorie labeling went into effect, over all, the study found no difference in calories consumed before and after the labeling requirement. But there were specific changes.
While just 15 percent of customers said they used the calorie information, those who did ate 106 fewer calories than those who didn't. Some chains like McDonald's and KFC saw significant reductions. But at Subway, which nutrition experts say has one of the healthier menus around, and where a higher-than-average percentage of customers said they read calorie information, the number of calories consumed actually increased, from 749 to 882. The researchers hypothesized this was because Subway was promoting $5 footlong subs at the time, and economic incentives trumped healthy intentions.
''What we're learning from what's happening in the industry is, consumers don't see fast food as a place to eat healthy,'' said Mr. Tristano, the food consultant. ''It's indulgence that's important.''
Researchers are thinking of new ways to signal nutritional value: how much exercise it would take to burn off a menu item, symbols like traffic lights, or educational campaigns on understanding calories.
But they are not leaving it up to the restaurants.
''They're not social service agencies -- they're places that are trying to make money by selling food. That's their business,'' said Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University. ''Sugar, salt and fat sells.''
As Mr. Thompson of McDonald's put it, ''We're in this time period where people are defining -- quote-unquote -- healthy and non-healthy, and the question really is, in the restaurant business, what does the customer want?'' he said.
For Hannah Terry-Whyte, an Australian food blogger visiting the United States last week, it wasn't so much the indulgence she was after as the cultural experience when she ordered the doughnut breakfast sandwich.
''As an Australian, that, to me, is such the epitome of crazy American food behavior that I kind of had to try it,'' she said.
Still, even she wasn't immune to its meat-and-sugar seductiveness. Asked if she would try it again, she said, ''You know what? Maybe. Yeah. Probably.''

HEADLINE: Johannesburg Center Is Helping to Preserve Memories of a Legend

BYLINE: By RICK LYMAN

 BODY:
JOHANNESBURG -- Sello Hatang pulled open a long, yellow drawer and grabbed a cream-color parchment. It declared Nelson Mandela an honorary citizen of the State of Washington.
Underneath was a similar one from Wisconsin and, below that, a key to the City of Chicago. In the dozens of other drawers lining the room were similar documents from around the world, and above them shelves full of gifts from foreign dignitaries, crystal award statues and shiny bronze figurines.
This is ground zero in the effort to maintain and shape the legacy of Nelson Mandela -- widely referred to here as Madiba, his clan name -- and to make sure that the narrative of the struggle does not deviate too much from what Mr. Mandela wanted it to be. It was also the site chosen on Saturday for the meeting between President Obama and members of Mr. Mandela's family. 
''Everyone has an agenda, so we have an agenda, too,'' Mr. Hatang, the chief executive of the nonprofit Nelson Mandela Center of Memory, said Friday afternoon. ''But we want to be seen as trusted brokers. We want to keep the record accurate and to maintain Madiba's papers and possessions in a place that both the public and scholars can access them and keep the historical record pure.''
Mr. Hatang slid the drawer shut and walked across to a thick steel door. ''This is the holy of holies,'' he said, spinning the wheel that unlocked the vault-within-a-vault.
He picked up a square, navy blue box about the size of a cigarette pack, opened it and handed over a palm-sized bronze disc. It was Mr. Mandela's Nobel Peace Prize.
A few feet away, atop a line of filing cabinets, was the first passport Mr. Mandela was allowed to have by the apartheid government and, beside it, a half-torn black-and-white photograph in a clear plastic sheath. It showed about 50 young black men in dark dress jackets posed in front of their rundown secondary school in the rural Eastern Cape. The tall young man in the back row, on the right, a serious but amiable expression on his face, is the teenage Nelson Mandela. It is the earliest known photograph of him.
Beside this is Mr. Mandela's own desk calendar, on which he wrote such daily minutiae as how much money he had in his pocket, or his weight and blood pressure. There is the thick composition book in which he wrote his letters -- every line is used on every page and the penmanship is painstakingly neat.
Mr. Hatang retrieved the Nobel medal and placed it back in its box, embossed with the initials ''NM.'' He opened another folder beside it and pulled out the actual Nobel Prize proclamation. The penmanship on it was only marginally neater than Mr. Mandela's own.
Soon, much of this material will be on display upstairs in the grand rooms that will be opened to the public in September or October. Already, there are displays there of books sent to Mr. Mandela and autographed by the authors, including Bill Clinton and Muhammad Ali.
The center sits behind tall walls on a busy street beside a roaring expressway, a short drive from the home where Mr. Mandela moved in this upscale neighborhood after his release from 27 years of imprisonment. It was here, as well, that Mr. Mandela kept his office after he stepped down from the South African presidency in 1999.
While this is the most prominent institution dedicated to Mr. Mandela's legacy, it is not the only one. There is a Nelson Mandela Museum down in Mthatha, in the Eastern Cape, and a Mandela House museum in Soweto built around the house where he lived before his imprisonment.
With the 94-year-old Mr. Mandela in a Pretoria hospital, in what the South African government acknowledges are the final days of his life, Mr. Hatang said that those close to him are well aware that many will step forward to claim a piece of his legacy, or to try to shape his life story in ways that benefit their own interests.
''We cannot allow the past to be used as an instrument to advance someone's interests,'' he said.
Already, everything in Mr. Mandela's papers has been digitized, and about 15 percent of it is online and searchable. The remainder will show up online slowly in coming months.
The center was constructed in 2002, officially dedicated by Mr. Mandela in 2004, then rededicated last year. It will be dedicated yet again when it opens to the public. ''We have had a lot of dedications,'' Mr. Hatang said.
The center also keeps track of every tribute that Mr. Mandela has received around the world, all of it searchable on the center's Web site.
A small town near Rome, population 900, has been named Mandela. And there is a Mandela Bridge in the Netherlands; a Mandela Close in Norwich, England; a Mandela Square in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo; and a Mandela Park in Montreal. There is a Caf Mandela in Copenhagen and a Madiba restaurant in Brooklyn.
A newly discovered species of spider, first found in the Drakensberg Mountains in South Africa, is called Singafrotypa mandela. A new type of orchid was named for him in Singapore, paravanda Nelson Mandela. And marine biologists decided to name a type of sea slug the Mandelia Micocornata.
The greatest task of the center, Mr. Hatang said, is to keep his story alive for the younger generation of South Africans born after Mr. Mandela's rise to power, known here as ''Born Frees.''
''There is a sense of alienation that is felt by the Born Frees,'' he said. ''We want to create a dialogue with the Born Frees to ensure that there is some kind of understanding.''
Many of these young people are mired in poverty and unemployment, and are not as enamored with the heroic saga of the anti-apartheid struggle as they might be. ''This inequality breeds suspicions of the system,'' Mr. Hatang said.
''And then there will be the generation that comes after, those who are to be born in the years when Mr. Mandela is only a historical figure,'' he said.
So far, there is no name for them.

HEADLINE: Unable To Visit Mandela, Obama Honors Legacy

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR and RICK LYMAN; Declan Walsh contributed reporting from Johannesburg, and Marcus Mabry from Pretoria, South Africa.

 BODY:
JOHANNESBURG -- The possibility of a meeting between the two historic figures -- the first black president of the United States and the first black president of South Africa -- was so tantalizingly close. But with Nelson Mandela fighting for his life in a Pretoria hospital, President Obama abandoned his hope for a visit and instead on Saturday used every stop here to talk in emotional and sweeping terms about what Mr. Mandela meant to the world, and to him.
''I expressed my hope that Madiba draws peace and comfort from the time that he is spending with loved ones,'' Mr. Obama said after a meeting with some of Mr. Mandela's children and grandchildren, using the clan name by which Mr. Mandela is widely known. ''I also reaffirmed the profound impact that his legacy has had in building a free South Africa, and in inspiring people around the world -- including me. That's a legacy that we must all honor in our own lives.''
In an earlier news conference with South Africa's current president, Jacob Zuma, he also spoke about one of Mr. Mandela's greatest gifts: his ability to see beyond his own considerable legend. 
''Despite how revered he was,'' Mr. Obama said, Mr. Mandela understood that government must be ''bigger than just one person, even one of the greatest people in history. What an incredible lesson that is.''
Mr. Obama had built his Africa trip months ago on the hope of meeting with Mr. Mandela, whom he has called a personal hero. And like many South Africans, he was eager to ensure that Mr. Mandela's legacy will live on through younger generations. He brought his two daughters on the trip, even as many locals spent Saturday taking their own children to makeshift memorials outside the Pretoria hospital where Mr. Mandela, 94, lay in critical condition and outside the Johannesburg home where he lived much of the time after his release from 27 years in apartheid prisons.
Herschelle Sigudla was one of those South Africans. He went to the hospital on a brilliantly sunny winter morning with his wife and two teenagers to pay their respects.
''We were in university during the struggle,'' said Mr. Sigudla, 43, a physiotherapist, referring to himself and his wife, Pinky, 39, a radiologist. ''He inspired us to look forward to the new South Africa.''
Mr. Sigudla and his family exuded the confidence and prosperity of the new South Africa's affluent, well-educated black middle class. With his arms around his children, he said: ''We wanted to be here for our kids as well. This is history. One day they will learn it in school, and we want them to be able to say, 'We were there.' ''
Mr. Obama not only praised Mr. Mandela at the news conference, but in his first visit here as president also hailed South Africa's historic integration from white racist rule as a shining beacon for the world.
''The struggle here against apartheid for freedom, Madiba's moral courage, this country's historic transition to a free and democratic nation has been a personal inspiration to me; it has been an inspiration to the world,'' he said.
The meeting with 10 of Mr. Mandela's family members replaced the meeting with Mr. Mandela himself, and was arranged according to the family's wishes, the White House said.
On Saturday afternoon, the presidential limousine slipped past a gate at the Nelson Mandela Centre of Memory, leaving reporters behind for the 25-minute meeting before Mr. Obama headed to a town-hall-style meeting with students in Soweto. In a statement after the family meeting, Mr. Obama said he had also spoken by phone with Graa Machel, Mr. Mandela's wife, who has been spending most of her time at her husband's bedside.
The Centre of Memory is expected to be the institution that keeps Mr. Mandela's legacy alive. The sleek glass-and-steel building lies just beside a roaring freeway in the upscale Houghton section of Johannesburg, not far from Mr. Mandela's home here.
A steady stream of mostly white well-wishers gathered outside that home Saturday, leaving flowers or inscriptions on small colored rocks clustered under trees outside the closed gates. One note, left under a tree, said: ''Madiba, we drove across town without having to get permission. We live where we can, not where we are told to. All because of you and other heroes. Thank you, Lucien, Joelene, Ava and Luke.''
At one point, Ms. Machel emerged from a vehicle leaving the grounds to greet the crowd in what was a rare public appearance since Mr. Mandela's latest bout of illness.
''I just wanted to say thank you,'' she said, accompanied by security guards, before getting back into her car and driving off. ''All these messages you are compiling, it means so much to us. Every day he is getting well. So you should know that the message is getting across.''
Mr. Mandela was admitted to the hospital three weeks ago for a chronic lung infection. His condition turned critical, according to South African officials, just as Mr. Obama headed to Africa for a weeklong trip that started in Senegal.
The American president still plans to salute Mr. Mandela's life with a visit on Sunday to Robben Island, the prison where Mr. Mandela spent most of his incarceration. White House officials said Friday night that there was no change in the schedule, though Mr. Obama promised to ''gauge the situation'' based on Mr. Mandela's condition and his family's wishes.
Mr. Obama noted that he had visited Robben Island as a senator. He said he looked forward to taking his two daughters to Mr. Mandela's tiny prison cell to ''teach them the history of that place and this country, and to help them understand not only how those lessons apply to their own lives,'' but also more broadly.
After traveling to Cape Town on Sunday, Mr. Obama will deliver a speech to university students that aides said would be built around themes that related to Mr. Mandela's legacy. Mr. Obama will end his trip in Tanzania on Monday and Tuesday.
Mr. Obama began his first full day in South Africa in a private meeting with Mr. Zuma, who noted that the talks had taken place ''against the background of the ill health of our beloved former president.'' Mr. Zuma pointed to the symbolism of the moment, saying Mr. Obama and Mr. Mandela are ''bound by history as the first black presidents'' of their countries.
Afterward, Mr. Obama told reporters from both countries that his top priority for Africa was to help its governments to establish more stable and transparent democracies and to promote greater trade and investment that will help the economies of both the United States and the continent.
''I'm here in Africa because I think the United States needs to engage in a continent full of promise and possibility,'' Mr. Obama said, dismissing a question about whether America has fallen behind China and other countries in outreach to Africa. ''I think it's good for the United States, whatever others do.''
In Soweto, the site of the town hall meeting, a relatively small group of protesters demonstrated against the Obama administration's foreign policy.
The meeting with students and others included video hookups to small groups in Kenya, Nigeria and Uganda -- three countries he is skipping on this trip. Students queried him on America's economic policies and terrorism in Africa, among other topics.
Many of the questioners, some of them young entrepreneurs, focused on how American investment and trade can help Africa's economies and businesses. Mr. Obama pledged to work toward better trade relations with African nations, saying if Africa is doing well, ''we've got a market of people who will want to buy more iPads and Boeing airplanes and all the good stuff that we sell."
Outside Mr. Mandela's house, people were more focused on their more immediate future. ''According to a lot of black people I spoke to through my staff, they all fear an eruption of violence,'' said Laurence Hodes. ''But I don't think so. This is history.''
Diana Anderson arrived with her two young children, one of whom peppered her with questions.
''Yes, he's still at the doctor's. He's not feeling well,'' Ms. Anderson told her 2-year-old, Rupert. Ms. Anderson wiped away tears as she carried her children back to her vehicle. ''It feels like he's dead already,'' she said. ''Which is terrible.''

HEADLINE: The Redskins and the Value of a Name

BYLINE: By SCOTT CACCIOLA

 BODY:
Few teams in the N.F.L. have faced more pressing off-season concerns than the Washington Redskins, whose star quarterback, Robert Griffin III, hopes to be ready for training camp as he continues to rehabilitate his surgically repaired right knee.
But the hand-wringing over his injury has helped to mask a more polarizing issue for the team: its name.
With a group of American Indians engaged in a lengthy legal battle over the team's trademark protection, the chorus calling for change broadened last month when 10 members of Congress condemned the franchise for using a ''racial, derogatory slur'' as its mascot.
Roger Goodell, the N.F.L. commissioner, and Daniel Snyder, the Redskins' owner, have been adamant about holding firm to tradition -- the team has had the name since 1933, when it was based in Boston. But the team, one of the league's wealthiest franchises, could eventually find itself grappling with the risky business of a name change. How much would a makeover cost? It is impossible to know for certain, sports analysts and league executives said, though it would be measured in the millions of dollars. 
''Any time you try to reinvent yourself or improve yourself or cater to the needs of some, you run the risk of ending up as new Coke,'' said David Carter, the executive director of the Sports Business Institute at the University of Southern California. ''You're talking about a wholesale change of a global brand, and that's pretty substantial. It really depends on how the new name is embraced. If they took something that people could rally around, then there might be tremendous upside.''
The process would start with the enlistment of lawyers and focus groups to vet a new name. When the N.B.A.'s Grizzlies relocated to Memphis from Vancouver, British Columbia, in 2001, the franchise spent about $125,000 on research alone, said Andy Dolich, the team's former president for business operations. That figure included the work of a graphics team, which went through several mascot iterations. Memphis ultimately decided to keep the old nickname while updating its bear logo.
It would be dangerous, though, to draw too many parallels to the Redskins' situation, Dolich said. Unlike the Grizzlies, who were new to Memphis and benefited from almost unconditional support, the Redskins have been part of Washington's civic fabric for decades. Any changes would need to be carefully calibrated.
''You're not just going to Larry's T-shirt Store and saying, 'Hey, Larry, we need to change this,' '' Dolich said. ''In terms of merchandise and the team's presence on the Internet and all their corporate sponsorships, the Redskins have millions of exposure points. So there's a dollar figure attached to any sort of overhaul.''
A big chunk of the budget would be directed to the fairly rudimentary process of replacing all the old logos with the new one, including on the scoreboard at FedEx Field and on the stationery that the team uses. Carl Bassewitz, a sports marketing and branding expert who has worked with several professional teams, uses a 300-item checklist whenever he helps guide a franchise through the logistics of an identity change. ''It's a massive undertaking,'' he said.
Redskins officials, who declined to comment for this article, could minimize some of those costs by keeping the same color scheme, which would spare them having to replace thousands of burgundy-and-gold seats at the stadium. Still, any rebranding effort would require an investment from the team and the league.
For example, the Charlotte Bobcats of the N.B.A. recently estimated that it would cost them $4 million to become the Hornets (again) in time for the start of the 2014-15 season. When the Washington Bullets decided to call themselves the Wizards in 1997, it was a similarly painstaking process.
''We anticipated needing two years to wipe the slate clean, and it never really is clean,'' said Matt Williams, a former Wizards executive who now heads communications for the Washington Animal Rescue League. ''You had to change everything, from court design to uniforms to luggage. It was almost like starting up an expansion team.''
One huge caveat is that the Redskins, with their zealous fan base and lucrative revenue streams, are neither the bottom-feeding Bobcats nor the Bullets. The Redskins make a lot of money. Last year, Forbes magazine assessed the Redskins' annual revenue at $373 million. They ranked third in home attendance last season, behind the Dallas Cowboys and the Giants. Just as important, the Redskins share in the swollen coffers of the N.F.L., which generated $9 billion in revenue in 2012. The league receives more than $4 billion in annual television rights fees, which is split among its 32 teams.
So even if the franchise were to spend $10 million or $20 million to drop its nickname and rebrand itself, how much is that really?
''A drop in the bucket,'' said Gabe Feldman, the director of the sports law program at Tulane University. Consider that the N.F.L.'s salary cap for the coming season is $123 million.
The larger issue is how the team's fans would react, and that is much more difficult to forecast. Would fans protest the change by shedding their RGIII jerseys? Would they stop going to games? Would the new, unfamiliar name -- everyone knows the Redskins -- lessen the franchise's appeal to corporate America and cost the team sponsorships?
''I think you run the risk of heavily damaging your brand if you change your name,'' Dolich, the former Grizzlies executive, said.
Although there is no precedent for a change of this magnitude in pro sports, two marketing professors at Emory University recently studied the economic effect on college athletic departments that moved away from Indian mascots. The professors, Manish Tripathi and Mike Lewis, found that these colleges tended to have a year or two of marginal financial losses before quickly recovering. In fact, the move typically yielded positive returns in the long run.
Just as important, ditching an Indian mascot had no effect on an athletic department's all-important ''brand equity,'' Tripathi said -- that is, the willingness of a consumer to pay a premium price to support the team, whether that meant ordering season tickets or buying a sweatshirt.
''You could make the argument that the Redskins have brand loyalty that's not linked to the logo at all,'' Tripathi said in a telephone interview. ''It could have more to do with growing up with the team and feeling a connection to the franchise. If that's the case, people will just go out and buy the new jersey.''
Ultimately, the financial stakes would have more to do with the psychology of the sports fan than with the costs of printing new business cards. John Maroon, a former spokesman for the Redskins who runs a public-relations firm based in Maryland, said any sort of move would be bad for business.
Maroon cited a recent poll conducted by The Associated Press in which 79 percent of those surveyed said they favored the team's keeping its name, with 11 percent opposed. Rebranding the franchise, Maroon said, would be ''hugely unpopular'' and wind up costing the team ''tens of millions of dollars.''
At the same time, Maroon said, it would be difficult for fans to stay away, even if they were initially annoyed. Football, he said, has a strong emotional hold over fans. Are Redskins fans really so attached to a nickname that they would refuse to watch them play as the Congressionals or the Red Pandas?
Maroon said he rooted for the Jets.
''If they changed their name or banned Joe Namath from the stadium, I'd be upset,'' he said. ''But I'd still wind up wearing my Jets stuff, and then Sunday would come and I'd go to the game and watch them lose in another color.''

HEADLINE: Curtis W. Tarr, 88, Innovative Leader of the Draft

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Curtis W. Tarr, who as director of the Selective Service System in the later years of the Vietnam War sought to make the lottery system for the military draft fairer by reducing the number of student and medical deferments granted to young men, died on June 21 at his home in Walnut Creek, Calif. He was 88.
The cause was complications of pneumonia, his family said. 
Mr. Tarr, who had been president of Lawrence University in Wisconsin, brought to the Selective Service what he called a ''tremendous affection'' for young people. From 1970 to 1972, he helped make the lottery more genuinely random in choosing potential draftees into the military, and he tried to enlarge the pool by granting fewer deferments to students, fathers, men in certain occupations and those claiming medical problems. A larger pool was fairer, he said.
In 1971, Congress eliminated college and other deferments, but the action had little effect because fewer troops were being sent to Vietnam by then.
Mr. Tarr succeeded Gen. Lewis B. Hershey, who had been Selective Service director from 1941 until February 1970. (An acting director, Dee Ingold, served until Mr. Tarr's arrival in April.)
General Hershey had been a Washington institution, much like J. Edgar Hoover, the F.B.I. director. In 1967, General Hershey labeled draft resisters ''shirkers'' and ''slackers'' and sent a letter to local draft boards suggesting that a fit punishment for young antiwar demonstrators might be immediate induction into the military. The Supreme Court ruled that draft classifications could not be manipulated for punitive purposes.
Mr. Tarr took a much more conciliatory approach. When antiwar protesters massed outside the draft system's headquarters Washington in 1971, he invited four of them inside to chat.
''While I personally do not agree with all of their conclusions,'' he said, ''I believe that we share a common concern for the need to solve the serious problems that plague our country.''
Historically, draft boards selected potential draftees on the basis of seniority by age. But in 1969, a national lottery was introduced to determine, using birth dates, the order in which they would be chosen. (The lower the draft number someone received, the more likely it was that he would be drafted.) The first lottery was criticized for yielding clumps of dates; November and December dates in particular drew disproportionately lower numbers. Mr. Tarr enlisted scientists at the National Bureau of Standards to devise a more sophisticated approach for 1970.
When the Supreme Court ruled that it was acceptable to grant conscientious objector status to draftees for other than religious reasons -- the traditional standard -- Mr. Tarr developed more stringent requirements for that classification. He stressed that an applicant would have to prove that he was sincere in his pacifist beliefs and that he had held them before applying for conscientious objector status.
The draft ended in January 1973.
Curtis William Tarr was born on Sept. 18, 1924, in Stockton, Calif. He was a Boy Scout and an enthusiastic traveler, visiting all 48 of the continental United States by the time he was 25. He was drafted into the Army in World War II and earned three battle stars in Europe. He received a bachelor's degree in economics from Stanford and a master of business administration degree from Harvard.
Mr. Tarr worked for his family's farm equipment company in Chico, Calif., for most of the 1950s. While doing this, he worked for a federal commission studying government organization and ran unsuccessfully for Congress.
He returned to Stanford as an instructor in business history and administrator. While there, he completed a doctorate, writing his thesis on the difficulties of unifying the armed services.
In 1963, he became president of Lawrence College in Appleton, Wis., and negotiated its merger with Milwaukee-Downer College for women to form Lawrence University.
Defense Secretary Melvin R. Laird, who was from Wisconsin, brought Mr. Tarr to Washington in 1969 to be an assistant secretary of the Air Force. After several men, including two college football coaches, turned down the directorship of the Selective Service, Mr. Tarr accepted it, but only after turning it down once himself.
He went on to hold posts in the State Department before becoming a vice president of Deere & Company, the farm equipment manufacturer.
He served as dean of the Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University from 1985 to 1989.
Mr. Tarr's marriage to the former Elizabeth Meyers ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, the former Mary Katherine Laughlin; his daughters, Pamela Tarr and Cynthia Tarr; his sisters, Muriel Kurtz and Marian Schreiter; and a grandson.

HEADLINE: Politics Aside, A Common Bond

BYLINE: By N. GREGORY MANKIW. 
N. Gregory Mankiw is a professor of economics at Harvard.

 BODY:
ONE of the cool things about hanging around a place like Harvard, where I have been a professor for almost 30 years, is that you get to meet some supertalented people long before the world recognizes their talents. I had a vivid reminder of this just a few days ago, when President Obama appointed Jason Furman as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, a position that I held under George W. Bush.
Jason was once a student of mine at Harvard. As the president noted in announcing the appointment, I was chairman of Jason's Ph.D. dissertation committee. He and I have remained friends ever since. 
In Washington these days, comity between Republicans and Democrats is rare. Yet my relationship with Jason has never been hampered by our differing political affiliations.
During the campaign of 2004, I was part of the Bush administration and he was working for two Democratic candidates, first for Wesley K. Clark in the primary season and then for John Kerry during the general election. Yet the fact that our bosses were steeped in a political battle at the highest level did not stop us from enjoying regular dinners together. For me, and I suspect for Jason as well, friendship trumps politics.
Our friendship is based in part on the common bond of all economists. The field of economics offers a lens through which to view the world. For those who buy into it and pursue it as a career, it provides a foundation of a personal and political philosophy. It forever sets you apart -- for better or worse -- from mere muggles.
For economists working for politicians, as both Jason and I have, there is an inevitable tension between where the logic of the discipline leads you and what your political allies would like to hear.
In my case, one example is the gasoline tax. I have long advocated higher taxes on gasoline as a way to correct for the adverse side effects of driving, such as congestion, accidents and carbon emissions.
Yet this is not a message that most elected Republicans are ready to embrace. It dilutes the Republican message of being the party against higher taxes. Moreover, among the general public, the idea of raising the gasoline tax fares especially badly in polls, despite arguments from me and many other economists.
In Jason's case, an issue on which he parts ways with many of his political allies concerns the retailing giant Wal-Mart. Unions are traditional supporters of the Democratic Party, and over the years they have often been critical of Wal-Mart's business practices.
Yet in a 2005 study, titled ''Wal-Mart: A Progressive Success Story,'' Jason concluded that the criticism was mostly off the mark. ''By acting in the interests of its shareholders,'' he wrote, ''Wal-Mart has innovated and expanded competition, resulting in huge benefits for the American middle class and even proportionately larger benefits for moderate-income Americans.''
He did not reference Adam Smith's metaphor of the invisible hand, but the logic follows directly from it. The Walton family may have started its business to become rich, and it succeeded in doing so, but the normal forces of free markets have spread the benefits of its efforts more widely.
A NATURAL question is how, if Jason and I come from the same intellectual tradition, we ended up working for different political parties. I have never discussed this explicitly with him, but I doubt that there is a simple answer. So let me suggest three.
Arthur M. Okun, who served under President Lyndon B. Johnson as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, wrote that the big trade-off faced by society is between equality and efficiency. We can redistribute income to give everyone a more equal slice of the economic pie, but as we do so we blunt work incentives and the economic pie shrinks, he said. From this perspective, the Democrats are the party of more equality, and the Republicans are the party of more efficiency.
Another view is that the important tradeoff is between community and liberty. As members of society, we have goals we want to achieve with others. But as we reach those shared goals, we are asked to sacrifice some personal freedoms. From this perspective, the Democrats are the party that emphasizes communal values, and the Republicans are the party that emphasizes individual liberty.
Finally, there is the issue of how much one trusts centralized governmental power. Democrats tend to want to expand the scope of the federal government to improve the lives of the citizenry, while Republicans are more fearful that centralized power leads to abuse and lack of accountability.
These three answers go a long way to explaining, for example, why Jason and I disagreed on President Obama's health care reform. Jason saw it as a proper expansion of government's role to promote the community value that everyone should have access to affordable health insurance. I saw it as a risky expansion of government's power that reduces individual freedom, dulls incentives and will likely lead to a host of unintended consequences.
On health care, and many other public policy discussions, there is room for reasonable people to disagree. I don't expect to agree with all the advice my friend will give the president in the years to come. But I am confident that the nation will be better off for Jason's having the president's ear.

 BODY:
PRIVATE EMPIRE: ExxonMobil and American Power, by Steve Coll. (Penguin, $18.) Bookended by two man-made disasters -- the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska in 1989, and the BP Deepwater Horizon blowout in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 -- Coll's mammoth portrait of Exxon Mobil reveals the corporation's inner workings and vast influence, and abounds in empire-size figures. (If revenue were counted as gross domestic product, Exxon Mobil would rank among the top 30 countries.) 
THE DREAM OF THE CELT, by Mario Vargas Llosa. Translated by Edith Grossman. (Picador, $16.) Working as a British emissary, the Irish nationalist Roger Casement (1864-1916) documented brutality in Congo and Amazonia. Campaigning for Ireland's independence, he was hanged as a traitor in London. Vargas Llosa, the Peruvian Nobel laureate, reimagines Casement's life, unearthing the achievements of this complicated man of conscience.
SUPERMAN: The High-Flying History of America's Most Enduring Hero, by Larry Tye. (Random House, $17.) Seventy-five years after he sprang to life, Superman is still going strong. In this exhaustive history Tye, whose previous books include a biography of Satchel Paige, recounts the Man of Steel's creation; the fantastical evolution of his powers; the television series and blockbuster movies; and the gritty reboots of the comic book over the years.
SILVER: Return to Treasure Island, by Andrew Motion. (Broadway, $16.) This rollicking sequel, set almost 40 years after Jim Hawkins's fateful journey aboard the Hispaniola, introduces his son, Jim Jr. Neglected but sheltered, young Jim is persuaded by the mysterious Natty (the daughter of his father's foe, Long John Silver) to sail to Treasure Island in search of the trove their fathers left behind.
YES, CHEF: A Memoir, by Marcus Samuelsson with Veronica Chambers. (Random House, $16.) In 1995, while cooking for the Scandinavian restaurant Aquavit, Samuelsson became the youngest chef to receive a three-star rating from The New York Times. This evocative memoir traces his journey from Ethiopia, where he and his sister were born into poverty; to his adoptive family in the Swedish city of Goteborg; to some of the most demanding restaurants in Switzerland, France and New York.
THREE STRONG WOMEN, by Marie NDiaye. Translated by John Fletcher. (Vintage, $15.) In loosely linked narratives, three women from Senegal struggle with fathers and husbands in France. NDiaye's subtle, hypnotic novel won the Prix Goncourt in 2009; our reviewer, Fernanda Eberstadt, called it ''the poised creation of a novelist unafraid to explore the extremes of human suffering.''
JOURNALISM, by Joe Sacco. (Metropolitan/Holt, $22.) As with his extraordinary ''Footnotes in Gaza,'' Sacco's method in this collection of comics reportage is to venture into trouble spots (Hebron, the Caucasus, Kushinagar), talk to everyone he can, and assemble those stories into panoramic examinations of conflict.
SCHMIDT STEPS BACK, by Louis Begley. (Ballantine, $15.) The third novel to feature Begley's prickly, introspective protagonist finds Albert Schmidt in January of 2009, at the age of 78, still coping with family strife and ready for the next thing -- that old perennial, love.

HEADLINE: I'm Not Ok

BYLINE: By KIM TINGLEY

 BODY:
For reasons that have eluded people forever, many of us seem bent on our own destruction. Recently more human beings have been dying by suicide annually than by murder and warfare combined. Despite the progress made by science, medicine and mental-health care in the 20th century -- the sequencing of our genome, the advent of antidepressants, the reconsidering of asylums and lobotomies -- nothing has been able to drive down the suicide rate in the general population. In the United States, it has held relatively steady since 1942. Worldwide, roughly one million people kill themselves every year. Last year, more active-duty U.S. soldiers killed themselves than died in combat; their suicide rate has been rising since 2004. Last month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that the suicide rate among middle-aged Americans has climbed nearly 30 percent since 1999. In response to that widely reported increase, Thomas Frieden, the director of the C.D.C., appeared on PBS NewsHour and advised viewers to cultivate a social life, get treatment for mental-health problems, exercise and consume alcohol in moderation. 
In essence, he was saying, keep out of those demographic groups with high suicide rates, which include people with a mental illness like a mood disorder, social isolates and substance abusers, as well as elderly white males, young American Indians, residents of the Southwest, adults who suffered abuse as children and people who have guns handy.
But most individuals in every one of those groups never have suicidal thoughts -- even fewer act on them -- and no data exist to explain the difference between those who will and those who won't. We also have no way of guessing when -- in the next hour? in the next decade? -- known risk factors might lead to an attempt. Our understanding of how suicidal thinking progresses, or how to spot and halt it, is little better now than it was two and a half centuries ago, when we first began to consider suicide a medical rather than philosophical problem and physicians prescribed, to ward it off, buckets of cold water thrown at the head.
''We've never gone out and observed, as an ecologist would or a biologist would go out and observe the thing you're interested in for hours and hours and hours and then understand its basic properties and then work from that,'' Matthew K. Nock, the director of Harvard University's Laboratory for Clinical and Developmental Research, told me. ''We've never done it.''
It was a bright December morning, and we were in his office on the 12th floor of the building that houses the school's psychology department, a white concrete slab jutting above its neighbors like a watchtower. Below, Cambridge looked like a toy city -- gabled roofs and steeples, a ribbon of road, windshields winking in the sun. Nock had just held a meeting with four members of his research team -- he in his swivel chair, they on his sofa -- about several of the studies they were running. His blue eyes matched his diamond-plaid sweater, and he was neatly shorn and upbeat. He seemed more like a youth soccer coach, which he is on Saturday mornings for his son's first-grade team, than an expert in self-destruction.
At the meeting, I listened to Nock and his researchers discuss a study they were collaborating on with the Army. They were calling soldiers who had recently attempted suicide and asking them to explain what they had done and why. Nock hoped that sifting through the interview transcripts for repeated phrasings or themes might suggest predictive patterns that he could design tests to catch. A clinical psychologist, he had trained each of his researchers how to ask specific questions over the telephone. Adam Jaroszewski, an earnest 29-year-old in tortoiseshell glasses, told me that he had been nervous about calling subjects in the hospital, where they were still recovering, and probing them about why they tried to end their lives: Why that moment? Why that method? Could anything have happened to make them change their minds? Though the soldiers had volunteered to talk, Jaroszewski worried about the inflections of his voice: how could he put them at ease and sound caring and grateful for their participation without ceding his neutral scientific tone? Nock, he said, told him that what helped him find a balance between empathy and objectivity was picturing Columbo, the frumpy, polite, persistently quizzical TV detective played by Peter Falk. ''Just try to be really, really curious,'' Nock said.
That curiosity has made Nock, 39, one of the most original and influential suicide researchers in the world. In 2011, he received a MacArthur genius award for inventing new ways to investigate the hidden workings of a behavior that seems as impossible to untangle, empirically, as love or dreams.
Trying to study what people are thinking before they try to kill themselves is like trying to examine a shadow with a flashlight: the minute you spotlight it, it disappears. Researchers can't ethically induce suicidal thinking in the lab and watch it develop. Uniquely human, it can't be observed in other species. And it is impossible to interview anyone who has died by suicide. To understand it, psychologists have most often employed two frustratingly imprecise methods: they have investigated the lives of people who have killed themselves, and any notes that may have been left behind, looking for clues to what their thinking might have been, or they have asked people who have attempted suicide to describe their thought processes -- though their mental states may differ from those of people whose attempts were lethal and their recollections may be incomplete or inaccurate. Such investigative methods can generate useful statistics and hypotheses about how a suicidal impulse might start and how it travels from thought to action, but that's not the same as objective evidence about how it unfolds in real time.
The inscrutability of suicide has not kept most psychologists who study it from theorizing about why people kill themselves. Nock, however, tends to approach theories from a different angle. ''I think it's easy to generate explanations,'' he said recently. ''It's much harder to test out these different explanations and see whether the data support them or not.'' At first, the stress of combat seemed to be the obvious reason for the jump in military suicides -- until researchers realized that the rate has also risen among soldiers who were never deployed. Public-health experts have speculated that the uptick in suicides among the middle-aged is linked to modern tensions like the troubled economy, the stress of caring for elderly parents and insolvent children, and unprecedented access to prescription drugs. Nock, conversely, tends to point to a graph showing how the suicide rate for 45-to-64-year-olds has dipped and risen over a longer period of time -- the rate today is similar to what it was 20 years ago. The graph tells a more complicated story. ''My thought is that we've had theories of suicide for a long time and no data,'' he said. ''So we want to work from the other end.''
Indeed, Nock has started from scratch by searching for a way to precisely measure suicide risk. Three years ago, he and his team published a paper suggesting that they had found, for the first time, an objective test that could predict a psychiatric patient's likelihood of a suicide attempt better than the patient or his clinician could. Nock is now running it and other tests on hundreds of people -- those who have tried to kill themselves, those who have had suicidal thoughts and those who have not -- to see how the initial scores differ from one group to another and whether those scores will end up having forecasted, beyond what current methods can, who will try to kill themselves in the future.
Each data point Nock collects moves him one step closer to his ultimate goal: to be able to give people a series of tests that could tell them -- and their psychiatrists or primary care physicians or school nurses -- how high their risk of suicide is at any given moment, much the way cardiologists can use blood-pressure and cholesterol readings combined with weight and height to calculate a person's risk of heart disease.
Each data point is also a person whose impossibly complex conscious and unconscious thoughts -- about who they are, what they want, what's possible and tolerable -- highlight both why such tests are needed and why it is so surprising that they might actually work.
When Melissa was growing up in Southern California, her playmates included six imaginary princesses. One of them was always getting captured, and Melissa, a princess herself, would save her, she told me. We were in a teashop on a February afternoon in Harvard Square, where the clattering dishes, the hiss of steaming milk and the wash of voices cocooned our conversation the way she preferred. Melissa, who asked to be identified only by her middle name, wore a thin, white-checkered coat. She was 18, petite and pale, with faint freckles and auburn hair collected in a silver clip. Last November, she tried to kill herself in her college dorm room with an overdose of pills. Now, three months later, she had completed a residential treatment program at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass., and was living in a transitional house in Cambridge for psychiatric patients. She was taking classes at a local extension school; to return to her former college, a liberal-arts academy in another state, she would need to reapply. I first met Melissa in Nock's lab and was impressed by her cinematic memory. But even for her, trying to recreate the progress of her suicidal thoughts was like trying to trace a breaking wave back out to the ocean. Her parents, her doctors and even Melissa herself had not known the wave was coming until it hit. Now all of them were hoping to turn back future danger without knowing exactly what to look for.
In seventh grade, Melissa said, she sometimes wrote ''goodbye notes'' in her head in the shower. That year, she started feeling excluded by her friends, and because she was later than other girls to hit her growth spurt, she said, she looked like an outsider too. The notions she had about ending her life were mostly fantasy. ''It was never something that I talked about, but it was always kind of there,'' she said. She hadn't considered herself ''brave enough'' to really do it, though she now thought ''brave'' was a weird word to use.
Melissa talked about her high-school years with animation, doing goofy voices to narrate the nave thoughts of her younger self. She recalled mean messages her classmates had posted about her on a popular online forum, even as she sympathized with what she saw as their desire to fit in. Early on, she started drinking regularly and smoking pot. She starved herself. She fought with her parents. Her grades dropped. The summer after her sophomore year, Melissa told her parents that she felt suicidal and needed to go to a hospital; doctors there held her for five days and prescribed medication that her father, a neurobiologist, and her mother, a biochemist, refused because they felt it was far too strong for her, her mother told me. Eventually afraid to leave her alone for even a few minutes, they enrolled her in an inpatient program for substance abuse and mental illness. Melissa felt the counselors there punished her for her behavior instead of helping her learn how to change it, and they held her beyond the month she expected. ''They said I was resisting treatment,'' she said. ''Really the only thing that it taught me was that I have to get myself out of here. To leave, I had to explain why I was manipulative, passive-aggressive, how I relate to boys by expressing my sexuality.'' These assumptions offended her, and she didn't believe they were true. Ultimately, however, she told her doctors what she thought they wanted to hear, and they let her go.
Melissa saw a psychiatrist, who prescribed medication for depression and anxiety, and she went through several outpatient programs with better results. She transferred to a new school for her junior year, which eased her social stress; she was a competitive athlete, acted in plays and raised money for impoverished children in India that she delivered in person. She was accepted by her first-choice college. The summer before she left home, at a ceremony at a treatment center, she told me, the mother of another girl said to her, ''I don't understand why you would be here in the first place, because it seems like you have everything figured out.'' Outwardly she accepted the remark as a compliment, though it startled her to realize that she seemed to have everyone fooled. ''At that exact point in time,'' she said, ''I was thinking about anything except being alive.''
Her parents, worried, stipulated that they would pay her college tuition only if she attended weekly therapy sessions at the school's health-services center, which would report missed attendance to them. But Melissa wanted to start over. She skipped sessions and stopped taking her medication -- despite the potentially dangerous side effects of quitting abruptly -- saving the pills in a baggie instead. Her mother told me she flew out to check on her, but Melissa didn't want to see her. She was 18 by then and in charge of her own health care. At the teashop, Melissa described how she decorated her new dorm room, putting up a Harry Potter poster she brought from home and making the bed with blue sheets her mother bought for her when she was 13 and scared to go to sleep. She found friends, began drinking and doing drugs again and fell behind in her classes. About a month into the semester, she said, a painful episode between her and a boy she was seeing became campus gossip, making her feel heartbroken and exposed. She couldn't say exactly how or when she formed a plan to use the pills she had saved as ''an emergency-exit measure.''
She tugged at a pink hair tie on her wrist. ''I'm having a hard time explaining this,'' she told me. ''It wasn't one specific moment. It was just everything.''
I asked her if the therapists she saw ever questioned whether she had suicidal thoughts. ''They always asked,'' she said. ''And the answer I always gave was yes, I had thoughts, and that it was nothing I would act on. It was sort of a robot answer, and it wasn't really true, but I wasn't in a position that I could say, 'No, I love my life,' and I wasn't in a position where I could say, 'Yes, I spend my subway rides planning out my goodbye note.' ''
On the evening after Halloween, Melissa was hung over and wearing most of her angel costume from the night before, when she and her roommate, dressed as a devil, went to a campus party. A week earlier, she revived the relationship with the boy who hurt her. Now she received a text from him telling her to stop being so needy. She recalled feeling as if everyone would be better off if she disappeared; she wasn't making the world a better place and didn't deserve to be in it. Sitting on her bed, she wrote a goodbye letter in her favorite notebook while her roommate and a few of their friends listened to music and did homework. When Melissa's friends asked if she wanted to go to the dining hall for ice cream, she declined. After they left, she swallowed the pills. She woke from a coma in intensive care, intubated. Paramedics had scissored off her clothes, revealing ''Do not resuscitate'' scrawled on her forearms in red Sharpie. She didn't remember writing it.
Melissa found it hard to say why she tried to kill herself when she did -- how that night differed from others when she had felt wounded or sad. ''Everything just kind of hit me all at once,'' she said. ''I was behind in my classes. I felt like my friends were embarrassed by me. And, I don't know, I just felt like I had screwed up my life so badly that this was the only way out.''
Nock didn't plan to devote his career to researching self-harm. The son of an auto mechanic, he grew up pumping gas and learning to fix cars at the service station his parents own in Basking Ridge, N.J., while also taking other jobs: tuxedo-rental clerk, ice-rink guard, windshield repairer. He was the first member of his family to graduate from college and expected to use his degree in psychology to become a clinician and work with patients. But the more time he spent with people who hurt themselves, the more he worried about treating their behavior. His first internship, while an undergrad at Boston University, was in a psychiatric unit for violent patients prone to severe self-injury: one man pulled out his eyeball, another arrived with deep gashes in his arms. Nock, who rarely mentioned his own feelings even when I asked him personal questions, said he grew close to the youngest patient on the unit, a man about his age. ''When he was in treatment, moodwise he was pretty stable, pretty happy guy, pretty upbeat guy,'' Nock said. ''We'd talk a lot about hip-hop and soccer.'' When he was released, around the time Nock's internship was ending, he killed himself. He was the first person Nock knew who died by suicide, and Nock had not foreseen it. He went on to get a doctorate in psychology from Yale, and instead of joining a clinical practice, he turned to academia and research.
Nothing in medical literature suggests a reliable method for accurately identifying suicidal patients. The earliest known reference to suicide is a poem, written on papyrus in Egypt 4,000 years ago. From then until the 1700s, artists, philosophers and religious figures, rather than doctors or scientists, were the only ones to wrestle with the subject, according to George Howe Colt's comprehensive history, ''The Enigma of Suicide.'' It was a sociologist, mile Durkheim, who offered the first unified theory of suicide, ''Le Suicide,'' which has underpinned suicide science ever since it was published in 1897. Durkheim argued that suicidal feelings occur in response to a person's relationship with society: not being part of a community and sudden disruptions in the fabric of daily life are potential triggers. Freud put suicide in the same category as masochism, which he attributed to an aggressively critical superego turning on the self. Recent psychological theories posit that suicide is driven by intense mental pain: hopelessness, a yearning for escape, a sense of not belonging, feelings of burdensomeness.
But suicidal behavior also appears to run in families, suggesting it has biological roots. ''We think that there are many genes -- there might be hundreds, there might be thousands, each of which might contribute a tiny amount individually'' to heightened risk, says Jordan Smoller, a psychiatric geneticist at Massachusetts General Hospital who has collaborated with Nock. Gustavo Turecki, the director of the McGill Group for Suicide Studies, has also shown that one major risk factor linked to suicide, having suffered abuse in childhood, can cause changes in the receptors of brain cells that regulate the stress hormone cortisol, leaving the brain in a chemical state of increased alertness that causes a person to overreact to stress. ''Our emotions are all somewhere coded in our brains,'' Turecki told me, and identifying what mechanisms drive suicide could one day enable scientists to tailor drug therapies to reduce risk. Right now, though, Nock's tests appear to offer our best hope for a diagnostic tool that could work on anyone, no matter what complex social and biological factors are prompting suicidal thoughts. They also offer a way of seeing how such thinking operates, which could help us understand why it happens.
In 2003, during his first year teaching at Harvard, Nock approached his colleague Mahzarin Banaji with a proposal. Banaji had helped develop the Implicit Association Test, which was introduced to social psychology five years earlier and has become famous for its ability to measure biases that subjects either don't care to acknowledge or don't realize they have on topics like race, sexuality, gender and age. Nock wondered if the I.A.T. could be configured to measure people's bias for and against being alive and being dead, and Banaji thought it was worth a try. They experimented with several versions in Nock's lab and at the psychiatric-emergency department at Mass General. Then they put their best one on a laptop and offered it to Mass General patients, many of whom had recently threatened or attempted suicide; 157 agreed to take it. Hunched in plastic waiting-room chairs or propped up in cots as they waited for a clinician to admit or discharge them, they were often grateful for a distraction.
Balancing the computer on their thighs, the patients held their pointer fingers over left and right keyboard keys. The heading ''Life'' appeared in the upper left corner of the screen, ''Death'' in the upper right. In the center, words associated with one of the headings popped up one at a time. Patients jabbed the left key to link ''alive,'' ''survive,'' ''breathing,'' ''thrive'' and ''live'' with ''Life''; the right key matched ''funeral,'' ''lifeless,'' ''die,'' ''deceased'' and ''suicide'' with ''Death.'' The researchers asked the volunteers to do this as quickly as they could. Each word had a correct response. If patients put ''thrive'' with ''Death,'' for instance, a red X appeared, and the test paused until they hit the proper key. The sorting continued as the words reappeared randomly. After about a minute, the headers switched sides, and the process repeated. Then new rubrics popped up -- ''Me,'' ''Not Me'' -- along with new words to sort: ''self,'' ''I,'' ''myself,'' ''my,'' ''mine,'' ''other,'' ''theirs,'' ''they,'' ''them,'' ''their.'' Again the headers flipped places, and the sorting continued.
Once the patients had established a rhythm, the test began to measure bias. The headers doubled up: ''Life'' above ''Me'' and ''Death'' above ''Not Me,'' forcing test-takers to hit the same button to group ''thrive'' and ''breathing'' with ''self,'' ''my'' and ''myself.'' ''Die'' and ''funeral'' went with ''theirs,'' ''they,'' ''them.'' Theoretically, the faster the patients were and the fewer mistakes they made on this part of the test, the more they associated themselves with living.
Then ''Life'' and ''Death'' switched places, swapping the associations; the same key grouped ''myself'' and ''my'' with ''funeral,'' ''suicide,'' ''die,'' ''deceased.'' Agility on this part of the test would suggest an association with dying.
Doctors of all kinds, including psychologists, do no better than pure chance at predicting who will attempt suicide and who won't. Their patients often lie about their feelings to avoid hospitalization. Many also appear to mislead by accident, not realizing they are a risk to themselves or realizing but not knowing how to say so. Some 90 percent of young people who kill themselves have visited their primary-care doctors within a year; nearly 40 percent of adults have within a month. The opportunity to help them seems enormous, if only there were a way to see past appearances and identify an inclination they might be hiding -- perhaps even from themselves.
The Mass General patients and their clinicians rated on separate scales how likely they thought they were to try to kill themselves in the future. When researchers checked on each patient six months later, they discovered that, as expected, clinicians had fared no better than 50-50 in their predictions. Patients themselves, it turned out, were only slightly more accurate. The I.A.T., to everyone's surprise, bested them both. People who sorted words more quickly when ''Death'' was paired with ''Me'' than with ''Not Me'' proved three times as likely to try to kill themselves as people who sorted words more quickly when ''Life'' was paired with ''Me.'' The I.A.T., it seemed, was picking up a heightened signal of suicidal tendencies that the most commonly used method for assessing risk -- a clinical interview -- had been powerless to detect.
On an unseasonably warm morning in January, a McLean Hospital van dropped Melissa off at Nock's lab, where one of his postdoctoral researchers, Cassie Glenn, was running the I.A.T. and two other tests on volunteers from 12 to 19 years old. She had advertised for subjects on Craigslist and Twitter and through fliers in hospitals. About eight test-takers came in the past month, often on Sunday afternoons, in pink zip-up hoodies or jeans with holes in the knees, wearing Red Sox caps or glitter eye shadow. I met one girl who was giggly and two boys who were shy. Two volunteers were not yet 18 and brought their mothers. Glenn, a cheerful Roller Derby player with a colorful tattoo beneath each wrist, gave them a permission form they could sign to let me watch them take the tests or interview them. Protective of her subjects, she always asked that I wait out of sight so that they wouldn't feel any pressure. Melissa was the fourth to sign on to meet me. When Glenn introduced us, Melissa held out her hand, listing slightly toward a purse with cartoon animals stitched on its side, slung over her opposite shoulder. ''Would it be possible to take a break?'' she asked Glenn. ''Could I go downstairs and smoke a cigarette?'' Glenn said yes, as long as she went with her. ''You can come, too,'' Melissa told me, ''if you want to ask me questions.''
Outside, she perched on a bike rack, packing Marlboro Red 100s against her palm. I asked her why she volunteered for the tests, and she told me that in college, she took a psychology class in which she read about famous case studies. At McLean, curious about what it would be like to be a research subject, she asked her doctors how to become one. ''I've always been interested, from an observer's point of view, in what they would say about me,'' she said. She paused, took a drag and gazed off down the street as she exhaled, playing the part of a tragic ingnue while making it clear that she knew she was onstage -- that a real part of her was vulnerable to my opinion. Nock had told me that talking with people about their past suicide attempts does not increase the odds that they will try again. But I still worried about asking Melissa to revisit her experience. I wanted to know that she wouldn't hurt herself again, but I couldn't. I was afraid that if she did, I would feel responsible. It was, I realized, the same anxiety I heard from clinicians and researchers and family and friends who are involved with people thought to be at heightened risk for suicide. There was nothing I, or anyone else, could do to be absolutely certain she stayed safe.
We took the elevator back upstairs. In a tiny yellow room, Glenn settled Melissa in a wooden chair facing an ancient-looking P.C. Glenn and I watched through a tinted square window behind her. The first test was the Stroop, which psychologists use to identify words that are especially meaningful to the test taker. In Nock's version, words appear on-screen in blue or red type, and as fast as possible the test-taker pushes one key if the word is red and another key if it's blue. People who are contemplating suicide, knowingly or not, appear to take a fraction of a second longer to push the button when the word on the screen is related to suicide than when it is a neutral word like ''engine'' or ''museum.'' As Melissa hit the keys, the words barely registered as more than bursts of color: ''happy,'' ''funeral,'' ''suicide,'' ''alone,'' ''museum,'' ''dead,'' ''pleasure,'' ''paper,'' ''pleasure,'' ''paper,'' ''rejected.''
Next came the I.A.T. On-screen, the words appeared and vanished like a time-lapse koan: ''deceased,'' ''die,'' ''myself,'' ''breathing,'' ''self,'' ''thrive,'' ''my,'' ''funeral,'' ''suicide,'' ''other,'' ''deceased,'' ''breathing,'' ''thrive,'' ''theirs,'' ''die,'' ''myself.''
''I missed some,'' Melissa said apologetically when the test ended and Glenn opened the door. ''Don't worry,'' Glenn said, ''I miss some, too.''
Nock and his team are currently running the I.A.T. and Stroop at local and military hospitals as well as in the lab. They are also experimenting with other measures. Glenn later gave Melissa headphones and attached electrodes underneath her eye to measure how much a muscle there contracted when she heard a burst of noise meant to startle her. The noise was coupled with a series of pictures, some of which were related to suicide without being too graphic, like a man standing in front of a train. Glenn's hypothesis is that teenagers have to overcome a fear of death to attempt suicide and that the less startled they are when looking at suicide-related imagery, the more likely they may be to try to kill themselves in the future. Nock's plan is ultimately to combine four or five tests that measure slightly different cognitive processes into a single diagnostic tool that could deliver a risk score. But the scores Melissa and others get now will take on fuller meaning only over months and years of work -- as researchers analyze them together in light of what the test-takers go on to do: become more or less depressed, start or stop having suicidal thoughts, hurt themselves in other ways or attempt suicide. Glenn would call Melissa in six months and again in a year to ask how she was doing and add those responses to her file.
If these data lead to reliable diagnostic tests, researchers could use them as a measuring tool to design studies of suicide that mirror the Framingham Heart Study, which has guided how we treat and prevent cardiovascular disease: 65 years ago, researchers began tracking the habits of and compiling regular medical workups on 5,209 residents of Framingham, Mass. It wasn't initially clear what the data they were collecting meant. But over decades, as some people developed heart disease and others didn't, their earlier test results and behavior began to reveal how high blood pressure and cholesterol, smoking, obesity and lack of exercise had helped cause it, how those factors could be entered into a calculator to determine risk and what would drive that risk down; once these insights led to treatments, the rate of deaths from heart disease nationwide, which had been steadily increasing since the turn of the century, began a steep decline.
Cognitive tests, of course, are not as fail-safe as a blood test. Nock says it is possible for patients taking the I.A.T. or the Stroop to adjust the speed of their keystrokes if they wish to hide their thoughts. ''But it's much more difficult to change the way you report on the test than to change the way you report verbally to someone.'' Nock said. ''It's really easy to say: 'I don't want to kill myself. I'm totally fine.' '' Anyone can choose not to reveal what he's really thinking about. It's much harder, Nock said, to trick the tests.
But even if the tests could offer a suicide-risk score right now, clinicians and researchers still have questions about how they would use the number to treat patients. ''One of the things I wonder is what do you do if somebody tests positive on one of these things and they deny that they're suicidal,'' says David A. Brent, who holds an endowed chair in suicide studies at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. ''Admittedly I'd rather have the information than not. But it's an interesting thing, you know, to say, 'Look, according to this you are thinking about suicide.' And would you be able to keep somebody in the hospital because of that? Would you change your treatment? I'm just not really sure.''
Nock's refusal to accept any wisdom that can't be tested, including the seemingly logical notion that simply getting more suicidal people into treatment would solve the problem, has put him at odds with clinicians who believe their methods work and that questioning those could cost lives. In January, in partnership with Ronald Kessler, an epidemiologist at Harvard, he published a study showing that about one in eight American teenagers reported experiencing serious suicidal thoughts. Strikingly, more than half of them were getting therapy before or during the period when they became suicidal. Some clinicians e-mailed Nock to express anger that he would make such statistics public. Their position, he said, was that if you tell people treatment's not effective, they'll stop coming. ''But I think there's a balance here,'' Nock said. ''Yes, we want people to get treatment. But at the same time, we want to make sure the treatment they are getting is effective.'' Marsha Linehan, a psychology professor at the University of Washington, has shown that intensive therapy designed to change patterns of thinking and behavior can reduce the risk of attempted suicide among highly impulsive patients with severe emotional problems. This was the treatment Melissa received at McLean. Preliminary evidence suggests that other existing interventions might work too, but -- largely because of how difficult it is to tell who is suicidal and when -- a majority of people at high risk aren't getting them.
A major investment of money and manpower from the Army is set to revolutionize the scope of collecting data on suicidal behavior. Nock and his team are participating in the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers, which got under way in 2009 and is the most comprehensive investigation of suicide ever undertaken. The Army's access to thousands of volunteers who lead comparable lifestyles and excel at following instructions offers a unique laboratory for Framingham-scale longitudinal studies. Nock envisions, for instance, one day beaming the I.A.T., Stroop and other tests to servicemembers' phones daily -- a technological feat unthinkable a decade ago. Those scores might reveal suicidal thoughts in real time. They might also offer a way to monitor patients known to be at high risk and call them if they seem to be entering a dangerous frame of mind.
''Right now, we ask people if they're suicidal,'' Nock said. ''And if they say yes, we give them medication to try and make them less depressed or less anxious or less psychotic or to have a more stable mood. And then we talk to them. We do talk therapy. And essentially talk them into not being suicidal anymore. And this over all as a strategy for many people does not seem to be curative.'' But if doctors could see which patients are suicidal at a given moment, they might be able to retrain their self-destructive thinking based on their test scores. If, as the I.A.T. seems to suggest, associating yourself more with dying than with living increases your risk for suicide, breaking that association might decrease it. To find out, Nock is developing computer tasks that he hopes could help get people, through rote practice, to identify more with being alive than dead. His researchers are also starting to test whether training people to think more positively about the past and the future makes them less likely to attempt suicide. Nock often talks about ''turning levers,'' as if he were a railroad-switch operator manning an existential junction. ''Can we think of suicide as resulting from problems with memory or cognition or attention?'' he said. ''And if so, can we then turn levers on those things to make people less likely to think about suicide? So, it's not giving a pill; it's giving a training.''
Before I met Nock, I wondered what someone whose research requires constantly delving into the grief of others must be like. I imagined he would be solemn and weary. But he is a mechanic by background and temperament. His search for solutions is Socratic, not quixotic. He is an optimist. ''It's a complex problem,'' he told me once, in his reasonable fashion, ''but there are answers to it.'' At this point in his career, he has asked hundreds of people why they tried to kill themselves. More often than not, their responses have fueled rather than dulled his curiosity.
One evening in his office in January, I asked him if he'd ever gotten an answer that did make sense to him. It was a school holiday, and most of the building was empty. Nock, working late, was wearing a tracksuit top and trying to kick a five-cups-a-day coffee habit by sipping a mug of apple cider. Outside, far below in the dark, snowflakes were slicking the roads.
Nock began to talk about pain. He imagined the building was on fire and that leaping from the window was the only way out. He evoked piercing ear infections that no drug could touch. He said he knows what it is like to be in intense pain and have an urgent need for it to stop, though he has never been suicidal. But he knows from his research that in most cases, feeling suicidal -- for whatever reason -- is a state that comes and goes. This is what drives him to turn levers, to keep asking people who attempt suicide, ''Why?'' As individual as their responses are, they tend to share at least one detail. ''Virtually all of them,'' he said, ''say, 'I'm glad I didn't die.' ''
Everyone wishes life could be different; no one's first choice is to be dead. Melissa wants to be an actress or a writer. It upsets her, she told me, to think about the anguish her suicide attempt caused her family and friends, and she is working on building a life she can feel is worth living. But she has said there are also times when she faces an impulse to hurt herself again. She was always matter-of-fact when she talked about trying to kill herself -- it felt, she said, like telling a story about somebody else. On the afternoon we met in the square, she seemed weary of rehashing the past and eager to get to class. She traced a wet mark along the table and spoke softly about what she euphemistically called her goodbye note. ''The word 'suicide' kind of freaks me out,'' she said, ''so I try not to say it.''

HEADLINE: The Gospel According to 'Me'

BYLINE: By SIMON CRITCHLEY and JAMIESON WEBSTER

 BODY:
The booming self-help industry, not to mention the cash cow of New Age spirituality, has one message: be authentic! Charming as American optimism may be, its 21st-century incarnation as the search for authenticity deserves pause. The power of this new version of the American dream can be felt through the stridency of its imperatives: Live fully! Realize yourself! Be connected! Achieve well-being! 
Despite the frequent claim that we are living in a secular age defined by the death of God, many citizens in rich Western democracies have merely switched one notion of God for another -- abandoning their singular, omnipotent (Christian or Judaic or whatever) deity reigning over all humankind and replacing it with a weak but all-pervasive idea of spirituality tied to a personal ethic of authenticity and a liturgy of inwardness. The latter does not make the exorbitant moral demands of traditional religions, which impose bad conscience, guilt, sin, sexual inhibition and the rest.Unlike the conversions that transfigure the born-again's experience of the world in a lightning strike, this one occurred in stages: a postwar existentialist philosophy of personal liberation and ''becoming who you are'' fed into a 1960s counterculture that mutated into the most selfish conformism, disguising acquisitiveness under a patina of personal growth, mindfulness and compassion. Traditional forms of morality that required extensive social cooperation in relation to a hard reality defined by scarcity have largely collapsed and been replaced with this New Age therapeutic culture of well-being that does not require obedience or even faith -- and certainly not feelings of guilt. Guilt must be shed; alienation, both of body and mind, must be eliminated, most notably through yoga practice after a long day of mind-numbing work.
In the gospel of authenticity, well-being has become the primary goal of human life. Rather than being the by-product of some collective project, some upbuilding of the New Jerusalem, well-being is an end in itself. The stroke of genius in the ideology of authenticity is that it doesn't really require a belief in anything, and certainly not a belief in anything that might transcend the serene and contented living of one's authentic life and baseline well-being. In this, one can claim to be beyond dogma.
Whereas the American dream used to be tied to external reality -- say, America as the place where one can openly practice any religion, America as a safe haven from political oppression or America as the land of opportunity where one need not struggle as hard as one's parents -- now, the dream is one of pure psychological transformation.
This is the phenomenon that one might call, with an appreciative nod to Nietzsche, passive nihilism. Authenticity is its dominant contemporary expression. In a seemingly meaningless, inauthentic world awash in nonstop media reports of war, violence and inequality, we close our eyes and turn ourselves into islands. We may even say a little prayer to an obscure but benign Eastern goddess and feel some weak spiritual energy connecting everything as we listen to some tastefully selected ambient music. Authenticity, needing no reference to anything outside itself, is an evacuation of history. The power of now.
This ideology functions prominently in the contemporary workplace, where the classical distinction between work and nonwork has broken down. Work was traditionally seen as a curse or an obligation for which we received payment. Nonwork was viewed as an experience of freedom for which we pay but that gives us pleasure.
But the past 30 years or so has ushered in an informalization of the workplace where the distinction between work and nonwork is harder and harder to draw. With the rise of corporations like Google, the workplace has increasingly been colonized by nonwork experiences to the extent that we are not even allowed to feel alienation or discontent at the office because we can play Ping-Pong, ride a Segway, and eat organic lunches from a menu designed by celebrity chefs. If we do feel discontent, it must mean that something is wrong with us rather than with the corporation.
With the workplace dominated by the maxim of personal authenticity -- Be different! Wear your favorite T-shirt to work and listen to Radiohead on your iPhone while at your desk! Isn't it nifty? -- there is no room for worker malaise. And contrary to popular belief, none of this has assuaged the workplace dynamics of guilt, bad conscience and anxiety, which are more rampant than ever. In fact, the blurring of the boundary between work and nonwork in the name of flexibility has led to an enormous increase in anxiety -- a trend well-documented in the work of Peter Fleming, a professor of work, organization and society at the University of London. Women in particular feel totally inadequate for not being able to have it all -- climb the ladder at work, make the same wages as men, have a family, have a voluminous sex life, still look attractive and act as if they are having a great time through all of it.
Work is no longer a series of obligations to be fulfilled for the sake of sustenance: it is the expression of one's authentic self. With the extraordinary rise of internships -- not just filled by college students anymore, but more and more by working-age adults -- people from sufficiently privileged backgrounds are even prepared to work without pay because it allows them to ''grow'' as persons. Every aspect of one's existence is meant to water some fantasy of growth.
But here's the rub: if one believes that there is an intimate connection between one's authentic self and glittering success at work, then the experience of failure and forced unemployment is accepted as one's own fault. I feel shame for losing my job. I am morally culpable for the corporation's decision that I am excess to requirements.
To take this one step further: the failure of others is explained by their merely partial enlightenment for which they, and they alone, are to be held responsible. At the heart of the ethic of authenticity is a profound selfishness and callous disregard of others. As New Age interpreters of Buddha say, ''You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection.''
A nave belief in authenticity eventually gives way to a deep cynicism. A conviction in personal success that must always hold failure at bay becomes a corrupt stubbornness that insists on success at any cost. Cynicism, in this mode, is not the expression of a critical stance toward authenticity but is rather the runoff of this failure of belief. The self-help industry itself runs the gamut in both directions -- from ''The Power of Now,'' which teaches you the power of meditative self-sufficiency, to ''The Rules,'' which teaches a woman how to land a man by pretending to be self-sufficient. Profit rules the day, inside and out.
Nothing seems more American than this forced choice between cynicism and nave belief. Or rather, as Herman Melville put it in his 1857 novel ''The Confidence Man,'' it seems the choice is between being a fool (having to believe what one says) or being a knave (saying things one does not believe). For Melville, who was writing on the cusp of modern capitalism, the search for authenticity is a white whale.
This search is an obsession that is futile at best and destructive at worst. The lingering question for Melville, on the brink of poverty as he wrote ''The Confidence Man,'' is: what happens to charity? When the values of Judeo-Christian morality have been given a monetary and psychological incarnation -- as in credit, debt, trust, faith and fidelity -- can they exist as values? Is the prosperous self the only God in which we believe in a radically inauthentic world?
As usual, the Bard of Avon got there first. In ''Hamlet,'' Shakespeare puts the mantra of authenticity into the mouth of the ever-idiotic windbag Polonius in his advice to his son, Laertes: ''To thine own self be true.'' This is just before Polonius sends a spy to follow Laertes to Paris and tell any number of lies in order to catch him out.
And who, finally, is more inauthentic than Hamlet? Ask yourself: is Hamlet true to himself, doubting everything, unable to avenge his father's murder, incapable of uttering the secret that he has learned from the ghost's lips, and unwilling to declare his love for Ophelia whose father he kills? Hamlet dies wearing the colors of his enemy, Claudius. We dare say that we love ''Hamlet'' not for its representation of our purportedly sublime authenticity, but as a depiction of the drama of our radical inauthenticity that, in the best of words and worlds, shatters our moral complacency.
Simon Critchley, a professor of philosophy at The New School for Social Research, and Jamieson Webster, a psychoanalyst, are the authors of ''Stay, Illusion!: The Hamlet Doctrine.''

 CORRECTION:
An essay last Sunday about the boom in self-help referred imprecisely to a saying of Buddha. In a famous meditation, Buddha (whose teachings were committed to writing centuries after his death) said that before extending lovingkindness to others, one should first extend it to oneself. ''You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection'' does not appear in Buddhist scripture, though it is often cited in self-help literature.

HEADLINE: A Gated State of Mind

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

 BODY:
East End Avenue is not the kind of thoroughfare that casual visitors to New York are likely to stumble across while searching for restaurants, theaters or clubs. They'd have to be looking for it. The neighorhood that it anchors, hugging the edge of the Upper East Side like fuzz on a peach, runs only 13 blocks or so. Most of its transsecting east-west streets end in cul-de-sacs, giving the area an almost gated feel: cars are not likely to pass through on their way to somewhere else.
But there is a way in which that obscurity heightens East End's appeal. If you can endure the five-long-block slog from the Lexington Avenue subway on East 86th, you'll be rewarded: the street leads into lush Carl Schurz Park, merging into its shaded bluestone-lined path. From there, a climb of a few steps delivers a front-seat view of the boat, barge and tug parade that is the East River.
In recent years, families have surged into the area, which is home to several schools, and which Monica Weinberg, a resident who has three children, describes as ''the suburbia of the Upper East Side.'' Dr. Weinberg, an internist, and her husband, Andrew, moved to East End in 2009 from a three-bedroom nearby in Yorkville. 
She declined to say what they paid for the four-bedroom they bought at 170 East End, a then-new 20-story condominium overlooking the park and the river. But units of that size were selling for up to $9 million, according to data from Streeteasy.com and other reports, which also show them trading for less today.
What concerns the Weinbergs and many of their neighbors is the potential for erosion of quality of life -- and property values -- if the city goes through with a $240 million plan to build a 10-story garbage transfer station on a pier at East 91st Street. The target opening date for the station, which has federal permits, is in 2015.
Fearing a plan that envisions garbage trucks cutting through the Asphalt Green athletic complex, just a few feet from a busy soccer field, to reach the pier, Dr. Weinberg said, ''I feel it is almost criminal to destroy what is such a beautiful area.''
But the city, pointing out that Manhattan does not have a waste management station, argues that every borough needs to be responsible for its own refuse, and that the station is a key element of a 2006 plan to reduce the number of trucks carrying garbage through city streets to poorer areas, where current stations tend to be.
Opponents citing diesel exhaust pollution as one of their concerns have sued repeatedly to stop the station, so far without success. The issue has even injected itself into the mayoral race; most candidates are against it, which gives foes hope that the new mayor will pull the plug on the plan.
A factor in the decision may be the plant's possible vulnerability in the face of another major storm. Hurricane Sandy last year flooded parts of 200 East End, some of whose residents camped out in the lobby of Heleen Brody's co-op, No. 180.
In 1996, her four-bedroom cost ''well under $1 million,'' said Ms. Brody, who works in finance. Similar units in the postwar building list at about $2 million today.
''We like the remoteness of the place,'' she said. ''We've always slept with the windows open so we can hear the birds.'' The effect of garbage trucks on such nightly rituals remains an open question.
What You'll Find
Squeezed between York and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, from 79th to 92nd Street, the East End area is laden with co-ops, many dating to the postwar period.
Among them are 75 East End, a 20-story full-block monolith from 1963 with red brick and green panels, and the 1970s-era 60 East End, with 43 stories, set back on a curving driveway. Basement garages abound, and residents frequently drive to work via the southbound F.D.R. entrance at 79th.
Several prewar co-ops also stand out -- for instance, 120 East End, a limestone structure that, along with 520 and 530 East 86th Street, was developed by Vincent Astor, whose great-great grandfather, John Jacob Astor, once had a country estate nearby. Condos are fewer. In addition to No. 170, there is No. 90, a traditional red-brick building dating to 2000.
A tiny historic district, on the dead-end at Henderson Place is an enclave within an enclave, with a fairy-tale-like assortment of Queen Anne-style apartments, with slate roofs, brownstone stoops and delicate metalwork.
What You'll Pay
In mid-June there were 105 condominiums and co-ops for sale, at an average of $1.86 million, according to Streeteasy.com.
At the high end was a five-bedroom duplex penthouse at 10 Gracie Square, an Art Deco co-op, at $23 million. At the low end, a studio with hardwood floors at an East 88th Street co-op, was listed at $235,000.
The market has struggled to rebound since the recession. In 2012, 31 condos sold, at an average of $1.72 million, according to Streeteasy. In 2008 there were 76 sales, at an average of $3 million -- though 55 of them were in a single new luxury building, 170 East End, which may have skewed the total. Similarly, 151 co-ops sold in 2012, at an average of $816,000, while 128 sold in 2008, at an average of $1.13 million.
Whether the softness stems from fears about the garbage station project is unclear.
Margo Mohr, a broker with the Fox Residential Group, who has lived at East End and 82nd Street for 32 years, pointed out that a smaller station had stood at the same site until 1999, with nobody seeming to mind.
''I've heard that people are selling because of it,'' she said, ''but I haven't had any problems.'' So far this year, ''the market's been going fast and furious.''
What to Do
One of two modest retail strips runs from 81st to 82nd, offering a Gristedes market and a new deli -- an offshoot of Yura, a Madison Avenue mainstay -- that opened this spring. Stores used to occupy the block from 82nd to 83rd, as well, but except for a wine store, all the storefronts appear vacant. Residents rue the closing of Sirabella's, a popular restaurant, but East End Kitchen, which serves straightforward dishes like chicken breast with mashed potatoes ($22), on East 81st, has filled the gap to some extent.
The large indoor pool at Asphalt Green offers swim lessons for infants as well as training sessions for adult triathletes.
The Carl Schurz Park is also home to Gracie Mansion, which hosts official city events but can also be rented for parties; a few years ago, Ms. Brody hosted an afternoon tea for her mother-in-law there.
The Commute
The 4, 5 and 6 trains stop at East 86th Street, which is about a 20-minute walk.
Otherwise, many rely on Mario's Transportation, a private service that runs vans every 15 minutes during rush hour from York Avenue and 85th Street to various points in the financial district. One-way fares are $6.
Buses include the M31 and M86, which come as far east as York, and the M79, which loops down East End.
The Schools
Just outside the neighborhood, on York Avenue at 78th Street, is Public School 158, the Bayard Taylor School, which runs through fifth grade. Last year it got a B on its city progress report. Also nearby, the East Side Middle School on 91st Street has 470 students. It got an A from the city.
And last year at Eleanor Roosevelt High School on East 76th Street, SAT averages were 572 in reading, 594 in math and 592 in writing, versus 434, 461 and 430 citywide.
Top private schools in the immediate neighborhood include two for girls: Brearley, on 83rd, and Chapin, on East End at 84th.
The History
Into the early 20th century, East End was called Avenue B and York was called Avenue A, according to news reports of the time. They aligned with their downtown counterparts.
Schurz park, which encompasses 15 acres on the site of the former Gracie farm, is named for a German immigrant who in the 1800s gained renown as a journalist and a senator from Missouri; though a Midwesterner, Schurz undoubtedly had fans in the large German enclave along East End.

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, the Living In article on June 30, about East End Avenue, misstated the avenue's length. It is 11 blocks long, not ''13 blocks or so,'' which was a reference to the size of the general neighborhood.

HEADLINE: Jimmy Wales Is Not an Internet Billionare

BYLINE: By AMY CHOZICK

 BODY:
According to Wikipedia, the Tampa International Airport is a public airport six miles west of downtown Tampa, in Hillsborough County, Florida. It's also where Jimmy Wales flies in and out of a couple times a month, in coach, to visit his 12-year-old daughter, Kira, who is named after the protagonist in Ayn Rand's anti-communist novel, ''We the Living.'' Kira lives with Wales's ex-wife in a ranch-style home not far from the offices where Wales, along with a handful of colleagues he generally no longer speaks to, ran Wikipedia a decade ago. The original Florida mailing address for one of the Internet's most life-changing innovations is a UPS store with a faded red awning. Next door is a Kahwa Caf. 
That was Wales's old life. In his new one, he lives in London with Kate Garvey, his third wife, whom he often describes as ''the most connected woman in London.'' Garvey doesn't have a Wikipedia page, but if she did, it would probably note that she was Tony Blair's diary secretary at 10 Downing Street and then a director at Freud Communications, the public relations firm run by Matthew Freud, a great-grandson of Sigmund Freud, who is also Rupert Murdoch's son-in-law. And that Blair, in his 2010 memoir, wrote that Garvey ran his schedule ''with a grip of iron and was quite prepared to squeeze the balls very hard indeed of anyone who interfered.''
Garvey and Wales were married last October before about 200 guests, including the Blairs, the political operative Alistair Campbell, David Cameron's former aide Steve Hilton and Mick Hucknall, the lead singer of Simply Red. Garvey's maid of honor gave a toast teasing her friend for marrying the one world-famous Internet entrepreneur who didn't become a billionaire. But the wedding was still covered in The Daily Mail and The Sunday Times, much to Wales's excitement. ''Front page, above the fold,'' he told me of the latter. Wales pulled up The Mail's Web site on his MacBook to show me some photographs from the reception. ''That was surreal,'' he said.
Wales has a complicated time balancing his new life with his old one. That was evident one morning this winter as he bounded into the lobby of the West End building where he rented office space and hurriedly signed himself in at the front desk. Wales, his brown Tumi bag slung over his shoulder, was 45 minutes late, disheveled and a little frantic. He had left the keys to his and Garvey's Marylebone apartment at his place outside Tampa; the nanny, here in London, was stranded with the couple's 2-year-old daughter. ''I forgot to drop off the key,'' he said. Just when Wales thought he might have to run home, his assistant, who is based in Florida, texted that a building manager had let the nanny in. Global child-care crisis averted.
Wales wore a too-tight black turtleneck under a black overcoat with a well-shorn beard, a look that could either read Steve Jobs superhero or Tekserve flasher. Almost any time you see Wales, 46, he looks like a well-groomed version of a person who has been slumped over a computer drinking Yoo-hoo for hours. After he composed himself, he explained that his office was too embarrassingly unkempt for public consumption. (''It's a room with a couch, it's a huge mess.'') So he joined me on a cracked sofa in a common lounge area downstairs. With its ratty Oriental carpets and mismatched folding chairs, the space exuded a bohemian chic look that Wales, a savvy purveyor of his own image, seemed to delight in showing off. The building, a condemned former BBC space, had been slated for demolition. Wales would soon be moving. ''I'm not the Google guys,'' he said.
London is often described as Britain's New York, L.A. and Washington all in one -- the center for finance, entertainment and politics. But there are conspicuously few traces of Silicon Valley. Wales gladly fills the void. Before he showed me his wedding photos, he talked about his new friend, the British model Lily Cole, who rented office space across the hall. Then he took a call from the Boston Consulting Group, the business-advisory firm, to discuss a speech he would be giving at the World Economic Forum. Wales uses a cheap smartphone made by the Chinese company Huawei that a friend bought him for $85 in Nairobi. The phone, which he often shows to reporters, is the perfect prop to segue to his current obsession of expanding Wikipedia onto mobile devices in the developing world. It is not, however, the perfect phone for participating in an international conference call with the Boston Consulting Group. Several calls were dropped. Wales suggested conducting the meeting over instant messenger, an idea that was rejected.
Once the call finally got under way, though, Wales seemed distracted. On his MacBook, he was following his Wikipedia ''talk'' page, where the site's volunteers log their discussions and disagreements over entries. The page had lit up with a raging debate about the banning of some editors on the Turkish version of Wikipedia. Wales watched as the online version of a cafeteria food fight ensued.
Wikipedia is built as a wiki -- a Web site that allows users to collectively create, add and edit content -- and more than a million people have edited at least one entry. But the veracity and updating of its more than 24 million encyclopedia entries relies largely on an army of more than 80,000 dedicated volunteers known as ''the community.'' This global collection of grass-roots volunteers makes for a collectively brilliant creation, but it can also lead to online hysteria and ''edit wars'' over minutia like how to categorize hummus. ''They love it in Israel, so shouldn't it be in Category: Israeli cuisine? '' one editor wrote on a Wikipedia page called ''Lamest Edit Wars.'' ''Or is it a purely Arab food that Zionists have illegally occupied?''
Though Wales no longer runs the day-to-day operations of Wikipedia -- traveling the world giving talks on free speech and Internet freedom -- he still spends an inordinate amount of time interacting with, and thinking about, the community. Wales, or ''Jimbo'' as he is called, is the person the community turns to when disputes are not settled in their online arbitration committees. Wales may not speak Turkish or know much about Turkey, but he is the B.D.F.L., or the Benevolent Dictator for Life.
As B.D.F.L., Wales's responsibilities are seemingly limitless. Before the Turkish debate, Wales had weighed in on arguments over whether the Wikipedia entry for the military historian Lynette Nusbacher should mention her gender change (he said it should, but the entry was later removed) and whether the entry on homeopathy should describe the practice as ''quackery'' (Wales agreed that it could, as long as the word ''quackery'' was attributed to the American Medical Association). ''Argumentum ad Jimbonem'' means dutifully following what Wales says, but there are even arguments about that. One Wikipedia editor said, for instance, that Wales was no longer comfortable with the B.D.F.L. description. (There is, among some, a debate over what to call him.) Some users have also disputed the Latinized version of ''Jimbo.'' (Should it be ''Jimboni'' or ''Jimbini''?) Either way, the Google guys probably wouldn't put up with this.
Wales doesn't have much choice. He realized early on that the community would revolt if he were to monetize Wikipedia by selling ads. He may now travel the world giving speeches and even include Bono as a friend, but Wales's celebrity relies largely on being the guy who made the sum of the world's information free without making a penny himself. As such, his reputation remains inextricably linked to the noisy, online volunteers who got him there. It's a tricky balancing act, and it all seemed to work fine until Wales moved to London and began to, or at least tried to, enjoy some of the trappings of his success.
Wikipedia, which is now available in 285 languages, gets more than 20 billion page views and roughly 516 million unique visitors a month. It is the fifth-most-visited Web site in the world behind Google, Yahoo, Microsoft and Facebook; and ahead of Amazon, Apple and eBay. Were Wikipedia to accept banner and video ads, it could, by most estimates, be worth as much as $5 billion. But that kind of commercial sellout would probably cause the members of the community, who are not paid for their contributions, to revolt. ''The paradox,'' says Michael J. Wolf, managing director at Activate, a technology-consulting firm in New York and a member of the Yahoo! board, ''is that what makes Wikipedia so valuable for users is what gets in its way of becoming a valuable, for-profit enterprise.''
Wales suffers from the same paradox. Being the most famous traveling spokesman for Internet freedom brings in a decent living, but it's not Silicon Valley money. It's barely London money. Wales's total net worth, by most estimates, is just above $1 million, including stock from his for-profit company Wikia, a wiki-hosting service. His income is a topic of constant fascination. Type ''Jimmy Wales'' into Google and ''net worth'' is the first pre-emptive search to pop up. ''Everyone makes fun of Jimmy for leaving the money on the table,'' says Sue Gardner, the executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit that runs Wikipedia.
Wales is well rehearsed in brushing off questions about his income. In 2005, Florida Trend magazine reported that he made enough money in his brief stint as an options-and-futures trader in Chicago, before starting Wikipedia, that he would never have to work again. But that was before he had to pay child support and rent for homes in Florida and London. When I brought up the topic recently, Wales seemed irritated. ''It rarely crosses my mind,'' he said. ''Reporters ask me all the time and expect me to say: 'I'm heartbroken. Where's my billion dollars?' '' On two occasions, he compared himself to an Ohio car salesman. ''There are car dealers in Ohio who have far more money than I'll ever have, and their jobs are much, much less interesting than mine,'' he said during one conversation. When his net worth came up again, he brought up Ayn Rand. ''Can you imagine Howard Roark saying, 'I just want to make as much money as possible?' '' Wales asked rhetorically.
Wales likes to invoke the higher purpose of Wikipedia. He applies his libertarian worldview to the Internet and has taken on institutions like the United States government and Apple for threatening to curb the free exchange of information on the Web. He also packs his schedule with sponsored events that have supported his new life. These days, corporations, universities and foundations typically pay Wales more than $70,000 to deliver a standard but eloquent speech about Internet rights. Last fall, I watched Wales speak on a panel titled ''Champions of Action'' at the Clinton Global Initiative, the annual gathering that matches wealthy donors with worthy causes, run by the former president. Onstage in a darkened ballroom of a Sheraton Hotel in New York, he sat alongside Madeleine K. Albright, the former secretary of state; Paul Farmer, the Harvard professor and co-founder of Partners in Health; and Tawakkol Karman, a Yemeni human rights activist and a 2011 Nobel Peace Prize recipient. Wales was there, in part, to promote the site. (Wikipedia uses its donations to keep its servers running and for about 160 paid employees.) But in between discussing health access in Haiti and the uprisings in the Middle East, the misspelling of Karman's first name on Wikipedia came up. ''They write it, all the world, in the wrong way,'' she told the crowd. ''Maybe I have to show a passport or something.'' Wales assured her that he had fixed the entry.
Powerful people like to be around Wales. A common criticism is that Wales likes to be around them, too -- and perhaps a little too much. During a visit to Los Angeles in February, Wales tweeted: ''Lunch with Felicia. Dinner with Charlize. L.A. is . . . wow,'' referring to the actresses Felicia Day and Charlize Theron. He also recently tweeted: ''Just got measured for my clothes for Sean Parker's wedding. This oughta be innerstin'. :-)'' But, as I learned at the Clinton Global Initiative, some famous people treat Wales a little bit like their own personal editor. After the Karman incident, the hip-hop artist Will.i.am stopped Wales to complain about an error on his Wikipedia page. ''Everyone thinks he's William James Adams Jr., but it's not James and it's not junior,'' Wales told me as he opened his MacBook and corrected the entry.
That kind of proximity to famous people doesn't sit well with some members of the Wikipedia community who assert that Wales's new life is, in some ways, contradictory to the egalitarian online world he created. Several contributors protested that Wales had used a firsthand, unsourced experience to change Will.i.am's entry. A user called Fram said Wales had violated Wikipedia protocol, which requires factual information be attributed to published materials. ''People are not necessarily trustworthy when it comes to personal information,'' Fram wrote after changing Will.i.am's full name back, referencing two published sources. The same rule applied when Wales tried to get his own birthday changed, from Aug. 8, 1966 (as his passport and driver's license used to read) to his actual birthday, Aug. 7. ''This is unverifiable information, I'm sorry to say,'' he wrote on his entry's talk page. ''Maybe I'll have to upload a signed note from my mom as documentary evidence.''
One of the amazing things about Wikipedia is how it has emboldened anonymous volunteers with the same power as established experts. In many ways, Wales has been similarly emboldened. He grew up in Huntsville, Ala., the son of a teacher and a retail manager, before he left to study finance at Auburn University. (''It's pretty weird,'' Wales said in 2005. ''I used to be just a guy. Now I'm Jimmy Wales.'') At 20, he married Pamela Green, whom he met when he worked at an Alabama grocery store. Later, he worked briefly as a trader in Chicago where he met his second wife, Christine Rohan, a steel trader.
In 1996, when Wales still wore a shaggy beard, listened to Insane Clown Posse and quoted ''This is Spinal Tap'' in meetings, he co-founded Bomis, a search engine that came with a ''Bomis Babe Report,'' a blog with photos of scantily clad celebrities and porn stars. He and Rohan moved to San Diego to get in on the Internet boom. (In 2005, Wales objected on his Wikipedia page to an entry that said Bomis peddled porn. ''The mature audience [NOT pornography] portion of the business is significantly less than 10 percent of total revenues,'' he told the community.) Porn or not, Bomis's profits financed Wales's side project, Nupedia, an online encyclopedia with peer-reviewed entries written by experts and academics that served as the predecessor to Wikipedia.
Wales was obsessed with the idea of an online encyclopedia that anyone could edit. He had grown up reading his parents' collection of World Book encyclopedias with stickers that marked updated entries, and in graduate school he developed an interest in the burgeoning open-source software movement that allowed programmers to collaborate. As Nupedia floundered and his business partners tried to expand Bomis, Wales saw a potentially larger cultural experiment in a free open-sourced encyclopedia and devoted almost all of his attention to it. In January 2001, he registered the domain names www.wikipedia.org and www.wikipedia.com. The project went live on Jan. 15, 2001, henceforth known as Wikipedia Day.
Like many Internet entrepreneurs of the early aughts, Wales aimed to create something cool first and worry about a business model later. And at first, Wikipedia was a hand-to-mouth operation. Wales, who relocated with Rohan to St. Petersburg, Fla., for cheap real estate, would hand deliver a check from Bomis to keep Wikipedia's Tampa servers running. In those early days, Wales still thought he could turn his free encyclopedia into a billion-dollar idea. ''I think Jimmy thought he could get very rich off this,'' his friend and partner at Bomis, Terry Foote, told me. Foote, who went to high school with Wales, was the best man in his second wedding. He didn't attend the third. ''Fame tends to change people,'' Foote said of their falling out. Wales mostly declined to discuss the status of his friendships from Wikipedia's early days. ''Moving to London has had a big impact on my social circle,'' he said. ''My wife, you know, knows everyone.''
The Internet bubble had burst before Wales could implement a revenue-generating business model for Wikipedia. After the crash, he was stuck with an oddity -- a popular but penniless online encyclopedia run by strong-willed volunteers likely to reject the idea of advertising. But as Wikipedia grew, Wales undertook a shrewd branding transformation. In June 2003, he set up a nonprofit foundation to run the operation. In a 2004 interview with the Web site Slashdot, he publicized the mission statement that would definitively distance his Wikipedia future from his seedier Bomis Babe Report roots. ''Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That's what we're doing,'' he said. Andrew Keen, a technology writer who has clashed with Wales, told me that Wales ''was a soft-porn guy who stumbled on to this thing.'' But Wales's lofty goal got him a TED Talk in 2005. Then Bono personally invited him to the World Economic Forum in Davos.
During that trip, people who were close to Wales say he morphed from a schlubby computer guy to an activist with dramatically improved access to information and power. His mantra of an Internet unconstrained by corporate or government interests resonated; Time magazine named him one of its 100 Most Influential People of 2006. The following year at Davos, Wales and Garvey were both named ''Young Global Leaders.'' (Wales, who separated from Rohan in 2008, says he first recalls meeting Garvey in Monaco in 2009. Their romantic relationship began in 2010.) ''Jimmy has had an ongoing valedictory lap for having catalyzed one of the greatest creations in the history of human knowledge,'' Jonathan L. Zittrain, a Harvard law professor and co-founder of the school's Berkman Center for Internet and Society, said. ''It's hard to begrudge him for that. I think he's been feeling his way around. It's not like there's a lot of precedent for this.''
But some have wondered if Wales, who couldn't figure out a way to become rich off his innovation, was cynically making a play to cash in on being a great humanitarian. ''Did Jimmy have the vision or did he settle into his spontaneous role?'' asked Scott Glosserman, a filmmaker who helped make ''Truth in Numbers?'' a 2010 documentary about Wikipedia. Wales had granted Glosserman and the other filmmakers unfettered access for the documentary, which turned out to be critical of Wikipedia, pointing out inaccuracies inherent in trusting a teenager as much as a tenured professor. Wales disliked the film and refused to help promote it. ''It was like throwing the magic beans away and the next day seeing a beanstalk,'' Glosserman said of Wikipedia's evolution.
High-minded or not, empowering the masses has made Wales beholden to them. That was an easy enough dynamic when he lived in St. Petersburg, Fla., and drove a 4-year-old dented Hyundai, but being benevolent dictator becomes a bit more complicated when you're going to parties with the Blairs. Despite the community's occasional discomfort with his friends in high places, it's clear that Wales has tried to use those connections to promote issues the community tends to care most about. Last January, the volunteers voted to make Wikipedia go dark to protest two pieces of antipiracy legislation in Washington, a move that contributed to the bills being blocked. Not long after the Stop Online Piracy Act (S.O.P.A.) blackout, Wales worked with The Guardian newspaper to prevent the extradition to the United States of Richard O'Dwyer, the 25-year-old whose search engine, TVShack.net, was suspected of promoting piracy. He also opposed the British government's proposed Communications Data Bill (also known as the ''snoopers' charter''). Wales called the legislation that would have required the tracking of British citizens' Internet, text and e-mails ''technologically incompetent'' and threatened to encrypt Wikipedia pages so they could not easily be monitored. Lawmakers have since shelved the bill.
Wales, however, ensures he is not taken for a radical. He treads carefully when weighing in on more extreme members of the free-culture movement, like Julian Assange -- who he has criticized for using the ''wiki'' name -- and online hacking collectives like Anonymous. Wales and I met for lunch the day after the 26-year-old computer programmer and Internet activist Aaron Swartz killed himself. The community had erupted with calls for Wales to weigh in, but he was hesitant. ''People have been pushing me to comment, but I didn't know him,'' Wales told me. He has also stayed mostly mum on Edward Snowden, the contractor for the National Security Agency who leaked confidential information about widespread snooping by the United States government.
''Wikipedia expresses the very essence of the Internet,'' Craig Newmark, the founder of Craigslist, told me. ''Used to be the victors wrote history. Now everyone gets a chance.'' Not even Wales is spared. After the site caught on, Wales tried to edit his own entry to call himself the sole founder. The trouble was that in 2000 he hired Larry Sanger, an academic and proselyte of an open-source Internet, to help him start his online encyclopedia. The idea of letting anyone (and not just experts) oversee the encyclopedia entries was Wales's idea, but Sanger has said he talked a skeptical Wales into using wiki technology and came up with the name Wikipedia. Wales's attempt to change his entry was a violation of Wikipedia protocol that sent the community into a tizzy. His page currently calls him the co-founder. An entire ''controversy'' section explains the Sanger dispute and references a 2001 New York Times article and a 2002 Wikipedia news release that both name Wales and Sanger as co-founders. ''That's funny, isn't it?'' Wales says in a way that makes clear he doesn't find it funny at all. ''It's the dumbest controversy in the history of the world.'' Sanger declined to comment for this article, but on the talk page of Wales's entry, he wrote that ''it was only when Wikipedia emerged into the broader public eye and Jimmy started jetting around the world'' that he tried to rewrite history.
After separating from Christine, Wales briefly lived in New York and would travel to London frequently to visit Garvey at her Covent Garden apartment. In 2011, Wales, who didn't travel outside the United States until he was 37, moved to London, and he and Garvey, who declined to comment for this article, found a rental in Marylebone. Wales seems to have adapted to this new life with ease. He uses Britishisms that make him sound a little like the famous faux-Brits Gwyneth Paltrow or Madonna. He told me he had ''a good ol' time'' at the Olympics, where he attended beach volleyball and an equestrian event as Boris Johnson's guest. Living in Marylebone is nice, he says, because ''we have loads of friends and people pop by.'' Unlike in the United States, where politicians are remote Wikipedia subjects, in Britain he ''literally'' (pronounced LIT-ruh-lee) knows them. ''My wife,'' he said again, ''is the most connected woman in London.''
The community, however, would not be left behind. Since expanding his circle in London, Wales has recused himself from weighing in on certain Wikipedia entries, including Tony Blair's page and several members of the House of Lords whom he now knows personally. Even so, the community questioned whether Wales had any part in an allegedly whitewashed entry on the Kazakh government, which Blair has advised. (Wales called the accusation ''totally stupid.'') Even before he married Garvey, some members argued that he had grown increasingly out of touch. ''Jimbo does not own Wikipedia,'' wrote one volunteer. ''He may have co-founded it, but so what? It has always belonged to the community.'' Wales concedes that this is more or less true. ''In theory, I have the authority to do anything and to make policy by fiat,'' he said. ''In practice, if I tried to do that, people would go crazy and revolt.''
That collective ownership model won't make anyone rich, but Wales argues that in the long run it makes Wikipedia far more enduring and valuable to society than Facebook or Twitter. It openly bothers Wales that Wikipedia doesn't get more credit for events like the uprisings that led to the Arab Spring. ''People like to talk about the Facebook and Twitter revolutions, but I think that's the most superficial endpoint of the whole process,'' he told me. ''It's incredibly important that people are able to self-organize and go demonstrate, but what led them to believe that was even possible?'' He pointed to activists reading about the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, revolts in Europe and the early days of democracy in the United States. ''It's one thing to go out on the street and demand change,'' he said. ''It's another to say, 'O.K., we won, the bad guy's gone, now what?' ''
Wikipedia, he says, can inform those decisions. And that's why Wales's current project is to expand Wikipedia to the developing world. Last year, as part of a ''Wikipedia Zero'' campaign, the foundation established partnerships with telecommunications companies to provide mobile phones preloaded with Wikipedia in developing countries like Thailand, Malaysia, Serbia and, potentially, South Africa. In speeches, Wales largely focuses on this mission to spread the online encyclopedia to every person in the developing world at no data charge.
One night in New York, Wales took a break from his evangelism to have dinner with friends. He had just finished taping an appearance on ''The Colbert Report'' and wore a white dress shirt with an asymmetrical collar and purple trim piping by the British designer Ozwald Boateng. Six years ago, a less media-savvy Wales felt like he struggled on ''Colbert.'' This time he shut himself in the greenroom with a publicist. ''Since you were last on, Wikipedia has been ubiquitous,'' Colbert said. ''You must be rolling in the cash, right?'' Wales laughed it off, and reminded the audience that Wikipedia still needed their donations. At dinner afterward, he seemed adrenaline-fueled, coyly soaking up compliments on his successful performance. The next day he would be off to London, then Florida, then Germany, then California to deliver a keynote speech at a cybersecurity firm. The community, of course, would be with him all the way.
A few months later, as I was reading something he had written on the question-and-answer Web site Quora, I thought about Wales sipping wine out of milk glasses and eating oysters after ''Colbert.'' In response to a question about how to get his help with a start-up idea, Wales advised against using the type of buzzwords that impressed Bono before that first trip to Davos. '''A world-changing next-generation platform for Gen Z blah blah blah' -- yuck,'' he wrote. He advised aspiring Internet entrepreneurs to ''treat me like a business person,'' including, he noted, offering compensation with stock options -- ''yay.'' Internet ubiquity is great and all, but it would be nice to get paid for it, too.

HEADLINE: Mom, Admit It, We're Homeless

BYLINE: JULIE KNIGHT


HIGHLIGHT: As my children and I huddled together outside their father&#8217;s house, the word &#8220;goodbye&#8221; suddenly filled my throat with a powerful soreness. I couldn&#8217;t bear to say it out loud. 

 BODY:
Last year at this time, my children and I were homeless.
When my ex-husband and I separated nine years ago, our children were 3 and 5. I had primary custody.
I had built a successful corporate communication freelance writing business during my marriage and always felt so grateful that I could work from home and take care of our children. When the economy started to slide, I worked harder. Got more clients. We lived simply. Gave up cable. But it wasn't enough.
By the time I realized I couldn't make my ballooning mortgage payments any longer, the privilege of selling the house would have cost me $30,000. Result: a failed short sale. Foreclosure. A scarlet F on my credit report. After years of being a homeowner, I became a renter. It felt like moving into the dot of a big question mark. 
Though I was making ends meet, each year our lease was up, I worried about a rent increase. Would we have to move? Where? Would moving traumatize my children? I got a full-time job as a corporate communication writer. At last, I had a steady paycheck and benefits. Things were looking up. Best of all, the job allowed me to work from home four days a week. I could still be with my children. A happy ending - almost.
Everything changed last year, when our two-bedroom apartment in San Ramon, Calif. - in the San Francisco East Bay area - decided to raise our rent a heart-thumping $400 a month, jacking it up to $2,100.
I felt desperate to keep my children in the same city they had grown up in, close to their father and other family members. After a mad search, I found a less expensive, income-restricted apartment. But it was preconstruction and wouldn't be ready for months.
I thought, no problem. We'll find short-term housing. Unfortunately, at the time, no one wanted to rent a house or apartment short-term to me and my two children, then 11 and 13, and our lovable dog, Murphy, a Chihuahua mix. At the final hour, I had to ask my ex to take them. He's a wonderful father, and the kids love him and his fiance dearly. I was happy they would have quality time together, but I didn't anticipate how hard it would be for me to let them go.
As we huddled together outside their father's house, the word "goodbye" suddenly filled my throat with a powerful soreness. I couldn't bear to say it out loud.
I moved most of our stuff into storage and rented a room, where I stayed for a month, until the landlord asked me to find other housing. He had found another, longer-term renter who wanted the room right away.
In the moment I became homeless, I didn't even realize I was homeless. After all, I could still afford an inexpensive hotel.
While my daughter wanted to spend more time with her father, my son was surprisingly thrilled when I asked if he wanted to move into the hotel with me.
We were not what you might think of as "typical" homeless people. I had a job. My children never missed a day of school. No one could feel sorry for us as we sat in a hot tub in the back of our hotel.
Jets whirring, stars twinkling above, my son asked, "Why'd we lose the house again?"
The question seemed to make the water temperature rise 10 degrees and the foamy bubbles brew with added fierceness. I submerged, thinking of what to answer. When I surfaced, I realized I couldn't sugarcoat the truth.
"We lost our house to foreclosure. That means we had to give our house back to the bank. Kinda like the end of the Monopoly game, when you're flipping all your properties over but still don't have enough money to get past Go."
He looked worried. "That sucks. You're saying we're poor?"
I paused. "Not really. The Buddhists believe all you ever own is your soul."
"Gag me. Can't you admit it? We are freaking homeless."
I wanted to assure him everything would be O.K. That we would soon be moving to the more affordable apartment. But at the time we hadn't been approved yet, and given my credit history, I honestly didn't know if we would be.
So I did the only thing a good mother could do. I splashed him. "Shaddup. You love this hotel. Maids makin' your bed every night. Free breakfast and pastries in the lobby every morning. For God's sakes, we've got cable!"
"I know, right?" he smiled, making a beard out of hot tub foam, his braces glimmering in the moonlight. "It's awesome. All my friends are jealous. Dude, can we live here forever?"
We high fived.
"Missed you," my son said unexpectedly. "Love you, Mom."
No richer words were ever spoken.

HEADLINE: Legal Merger Shows Rise in Criminal Defense Status

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Stillman &#038; Friedman, a New York firm that has represented some big clients, is combining with Ballard Spahr, an old-line Philadelphia firm. 

 BODY:
There once was a time when most of New York's top law firms shunned criminal defense work, turning up their noses at assignments they viewed as unprofitable and dclass.
Out of this void emerged an elite corps of small firms that specialized in defending corporate executives and Wall Street financiers under government scrutiny. The lawyers at these firms relished representing the accused, and did not mind scuffing up their white shoes while butting heads with prosecutors.
On Monday, one of those lawyers, Charles A. Stillman, will announce that his firm, Stillman & Friedman, has combined with Ballard Spahr, an old-line Philadelphia firm looking to enter the New York market and expand its criminal defense practice. Reflecting the strength of the Stillman & Friedman brand, Ballard's New York office will be called Ballard Spahr Stillman & Friedman.
 "They're a perfect fit," Mark S. Stewart, chairman of Ballard Spahr, said of the 14-lawyer firm. "It's easy to go out and get bodies, but rare to get the judgment our clients will be getting with Stillman & Friedman." 
The combination speaks to a shift that has taken place over decades, of corporate firms making a core business line out of white-collar work, including conducting internal investigations, handling foreign-bribery cases and representing executives in a number of scandals. As firms struggle to increase revenue, they realize that representing business people behaving badly is good for the bottom line.
It also represents a generational shift. Mr. Stillman rose to prominence in the 1970s and 1980s alongside a number of other criminal defense lawyers, including Stanley S. Arkin and Robert G. Morvillo, who died in 2011 at 73. These lawyers - most of them former prosecutors at the United States attorney's office in Manhattan - dominated the market for white-collar cases. Today, flotillas of large-firm lawyers do criminal defense work.
"For guys like Charlie and me, the game has changed," said Mr. Arkin, 75. "What was once a niche practice is now a big business for virtually every national firm."
As evidence of the transformation, Gerald L. Shargel, a renowned criminal defense lawyer who has represented Mafia figures and corrupt politicians, shut down his four-lawyer practice in June and joined Winston & Strawn, a 900-lawyer firm.
Large firms have benefited from taking on a variety of white-collar defense assignments, and the work is worldwide. With Fortune 500 companies growing inexorably across the globe, they need help navigating a thicket of international laws and regulatory regimes.
There is also a steady stream of financial scandals like the insider trading investigations or the controversy surrounding Libor, the global benchmark interest rate. These representations can generate big revenue.
Take, for instance, the defense of Rajat K. Gupta, the former Goldman Sachs board member convicted of leaking the bank's boardroom secrets to a hedge fund manager. Mr. Gupta's defense, led by Gary P. Naftalis of Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel, has cost more than $35 million, according to court filings.
Today, even the leadership at several top firms comes from the white-collar criminal defense bar. Dechert L.L.P. is led by Andrew J. Levander, who represents, among others, Jon S. Corzine, the former chief executive of the collapsed brokerage firm MF Global, which regulators sued last week.
The new chairman of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, Scott A. Edelman, has a specialty in defense work. And the global head of litigation at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom is David M. Zornow, who was the firm's first white-collar criminal defense lawyer when he joined in 1989. All are former federal prosecutors.
While there remain successful white-collar criminal defense boutiques across New York, they now routinely find themselves in competition with the city's biggest firms. The smaller firms consistently land work representing individuals, but acknowledge that it is difficult to win business on laborious, document-intensive assignments that require many lawyers, like internal investigations and Foreign Corrupt Practices Act cases.
Still, "there will be plenty of business available to firms, both big and small, that have a reputation in the field," said Elkan Abramowitz, a partner at Morvillo Abramowitz Grand Iason & Anello, a 37-lawyer firm.
Mr. Stillman, 75, has built a sterling reputation over four decades. A Brooklyn native and former federal prosecutor, he has had numerous prominent clients, including Clark M. Clifford, a former defense secretary later charged in the Bank of Credit and Commerce International scandal; Sol Wachtler, the former chief judge of New York's highest court, who was accused of trying to extort money from his onetime mistress; and Mark H. Swartz, the former chief financial officer of Tyco, who served prison time after being convicted of looting his company.
In an interview, Mr. Stillman said that Ballard - a 500-lawyer firm with 13 offices across the country - first approached him about the idea of combining. But he also said that he and his partner, Julian W. Friedman, had for years considered merging with a big firm because of the changes they were seeing in the profession.
"We had heard enough times, 'We want you to handle this litigation but you're not big enough,' that we had to consider a bigger platform to serve our clients," Mr. Stillman said.
He recently lost a big client to a large firm. He had represented Mathew Martoma, a former portfolio manager at SAC Capital Management charged in a vast insider-trading scheme. But in April, Mr. Martoma, whose trial is scheduled for November, switched lawyers, replacing Mr. Stillman with Richard M. Strassberg of Goodwin Procter, a firm with roughly 800 lawyers.
"I would have liked to try that case," Mr. Stillman said. "Do I think he made a mistake? I'm not going to address that."
Stillman & Friedman also suffered a loss in 2011 when a well-known partner, Paul Shechtman, left the firm to join Zuckerman Spaeder, a firm with about 100 lawyers and with headquarters in Washington.
For Mr. Stillman, a prime reason to combine with Ballard was to ensure that his firm will be well positioned for the future when he retires. All eight of his partners will become Ballard partners. The five other lawyers are also moving, as is the support staff, including Mr. Swartz, the former Tyco chief financial officer, who is employed by the firm as a clerk while on work-release.
"I'd like to know that I helped my colleagues get to a place where they could live happily ever after," Mr. Stillman said. "I owe it to them."
An earlier version of this post gave an incorrect year for the death of the prominent criminal defense lawyer Robert G. Morvillo. It was 2011, not last year.

HIGHLIGHT: Combine ill-thought-out government incentives with a misguided corporate tax system and what do you get? A blockbuster drug. 

 BODY:
ONE sure sign that federal regulations and policies are out of whack is when companies start making a business model out of gaming them. That's particularly true in two areas of government rule making - drug regulation and corporate taxes.
Consider the success of Jazz Pharmaceuticals. 
Just four years ago, this little-known company was struggling: its share price was measured in pennies, and Jazz had missed a string of interest payments on its debt. Today, its stock has levitated to $68 per share.
Jazz accomplished that $4 billion enrichment of its shareholders thanks to well-intentioned federal regulations that deterred competition for its principal product, compliant health insurers, and a Swiss-cheese corporate tax regime.
Don't get me wrong: Jazz's mainstay, Xyrem, which is currently used by about 10,500 Americans, is a good drug. While it doesn't cure any deadly disease or even directly prolong life, it does help those with narcolepsy, a debilitating ailment that causes people to fall asleep unexpectedly during the day, and a related condition, cataplexy.
Xyrem came to Jazz as the centerpiece of its acquisition of Orphan Medical, so named because of its focus on orphan drugs - those intended to treat uncommon disorders (affecting fewer than 200,000 patients in the United States) that are ignored by many big pharmaceutical companies.

To get drug developers to focus on these relatively small pools of patients, the federal government offers inducements like a 50 percent research-and-development tax credit as well as a longer period of market exclusivity (seven years after Food and Drug Administration approval, rather than the typical five). These long monopolies often give orphan drug makers a free hand to raise prices.
That's precisely what Jazz has done, often multiple times each year, at an average annual rate of nearly 40 percent. Today, Xyrem costs more than $65,000 per year for the typical user.
The drug will account for approximately $550 million in revenue this year, making up a majority of Jazz's total sales. Last year, Jazz turned 49 cents of every revenue dollar into net profit, an extraordinary margin even for a pharmaceutical company.
The Orphan Drug Act of 1983 was intended to encourage drug makers to invest in treatments for underserved diseases, for which research-and-development costs can often be high and the markets for the medicines too small to make the expenditure worthwhile. But Xyrem, which is a modification of a long-available compound, was inexpensive to develop, as new drugs go. Indeed, Jazz paid only $146 million for Orphan Medical, just a fraction of what it now earns each year from Xyrem alone. (The company contends that it has spent considerably on its development.)
Central to Jazz's pricing strategy, moreover, has been the willingness of insurance companies to reimburse the cost of Xyrem, even when physicians prescribe the drug for other ailments (like insomnia), as they are permitted to do. Nearly every patient gets the drug pretty cheaply - Jazz subsidizes co-payments above $35 per month - so few users care what Jazz charges.
The corporate tax system, meanwhile, has further sweetened the pot. As profits began to gush, Jazz was able to avoid a heavy United States tax bill by merging with an Irish company that was one-quarter its size and moving to Ireland, where the tax climes are more convivial.
The tax laws didn't require Jazz's senior management to decamp; the company's top four executives are still based in sunny Palo Alto, Calif. And unlike multinationals incorporated in the United States, Jazz can bring unlimited amounts of cash across the Atlantic without paying American tax rates that can reach 40 percent. All told, analysts estimate that Jazz will pay about 18 percent of its earnings in taxes this year.
To be fair, while Jazz's success in mastering the government's web of policies and regulations is notable, the company is hardly alone. For example, Questcor has raised the price of a vial of its flagship drug, Acthar, used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis and other ailments, from around $50 in 2001 to $28,000 today. And using tax havens to shield profits is a hallmark of the pharma industry.
As for Jazz, Wall Street remains bullish. Although Xyrem's orphan status expired at the end of last year, Jazz has erected a small fortress of patents around the product and is actively litigating to defend them. What's more, the company is now pursuing orphan status for two other drugs.
And hey, why not? When Uncle Sam is willing to play Daddy Warbucks, being an orphan is a smart move.
