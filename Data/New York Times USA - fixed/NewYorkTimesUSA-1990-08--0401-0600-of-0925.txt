HEADLINE: Japan Stocks Fall Sharply

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: TOKYO, Monday, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Tokyo stock prices tumbled more than 5 percent today on the widespread selling of long cash-index positions by futures arbitragers before regaining nearly a percentage point. The Nikkei index of 225 issues fell 1,153.12 points, or 4.22 percent, to close at 26,176.43. 
Selling fueled by concerns over the Persian Gulf sent the Japanese index plunging as much as 1,411.74 points, or 5.17 percent, to 25,917.81, in afternoon trading. The Nikkei finished the morning session down 763.12 points, or 2.79 percent, to 26,566.43 - the first time it had fallen below the 27,000 level in more than two years. On Friday, the gauge fell 286.18 points.
''The Nikkei has been dropping almost every day,'' said a trader at a foreign brokerage. ''There is a growing number of people who think it will fall to levels that were inconceivable only a year ago. They say it could fall as low as 23,000 or 22,000.''
In earlier trading, the dollar firmed on the Nikkei's drop and on the news that an Iraqi soldier killed a British business executive attempting to flee from Kuwait to Saudi Arabia.
The dealers expect the dollar's long-term trend to remain negative because of concerns over an economic slowdown in the United States. Some of the traders fear the cost to the United States deploying forces in the Middle East will make it harder to cut its budget deficit.
In trading in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index was down further, at 3,067.73, compared with 3,078.97 on Friday. The index has fallen 11.23 percent since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
''The current tension in the Middle East makes it too risky for bargain-hunting on a grand scale,'' said Richardson Wong, a broker at Sun Hung Kai Securities here.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL REPORT;
Iraqi Invasion Adds To Markets' Problems

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The world's stock markets have quickly declined since Iraq invaded Kuwait 12 days ago. But the invasion's dramatic impact merely exaggerated the problems already troubling the world markets.
Before the invasion early on Aug. 2, the markets were already being weighed down by worries about inflation, high interest rates worldwide, poor corporate earnings and slowing growth in several leading countries.
By driving up oil prices and raising the specter of higher inflation and slower economic growth, all the problems are now worse. Long-term interest rates around the world have already risen, depressing bond markets and drawing more investors away from the stock markets. 
 
Markets Likely to Head Lower
''The Middle East is keeping people very nervous and keeping people in cash,'' said David A. Robbins, head of the international securities department at UBS Securities in New York. Even without an escalation in the Persian Gulf, he said, world markets are likely to drift lower.
A rally will be difficult, he said, because investors will be unwilling to commit themselves even to bargains until some resolution to the crisis appears. ''And whenever you get a bad piece of news out of the gulf,'' he added, ''the markets will sell off again.''
Earlier this year, the Tokyo stock market had been troubled by high interest rates and a weak currency, and the Nikkei index of 225 stocks fell to 28,002.07 on April 2. The Nikkei then bounced back to above 33,000, but new concerns that the Bank of Japan would push interest rates higher to slow the economy and curb inflationary expectations started a new decline July 20. Before the invasion, the Nikkei had already fallen 7 percent from the 33,000 level. On Friday, the index closed at 27,329.55.
In Britain and the United States, high interest rates, economies near the brink of recession and disappointing earnings had already turned the markets sour after spring and early- summer rallies.
 
Consequences of Unification
In West Germany, despite the future potential of the development of Eastern and Central Euorpe, the near-term cost and inflationary consequences of the unification of the two Germanys were helping to keep the stock market from rising to a new high.
France, the darling to which investors fled in the spring when West Germany faltered after rising to record levels, was softening under high interest rates. Switzerland, like France, had taken a turn and rose to new highs in late May and early June but was falling back. And the attractive smaller markets, like Spain and Italy, were having trouble keeping up their momentum.
Only Mexico, Hong Kong and Austria, of the 24 markets in the Financial Times world indexes, were rallying before the invasion. And only Mexico, with its oil cushion, was resilient after Aug. 2.
 
Big Drop in the Markets
Since the invasion, world stock markets as a whole have fallen 6.7 percent and are down 16.22 percent in terms of local currencies for the year, according to The Financial Times world indexes.
The markets that have taken the worst beating are Singapore, down 12.59 percent in local currency; Hong Kong, off 12.10 percent; Malaysia, down 11.18 percent; Austria, off 10.87 percent, and Japan, down 8.51 percent.
The shock from oil prices, which jumped $8 a barrel after the invasion, sent Tokyo's weak market even further down. Japan imports almost all its oil, with about 70 percent coming from the Middle East.
Until the invasion, Hong Kong had been on a rally that took it up 18 percent since May and pushed the local Hang Seng Index far past the high before the market collapsed after the Tiananmen Square massacre June 4, 1989. Austria, which has been favord for its connections with Eastern Europe, especially Hungary, was inching back close to its high for the year. Both had probably overstreched themselves, which made the decline that followed a little steeper.
 
South Africa Is Flat
The country whose stocks fared the best, South Africa, is virtually unchanged when the index is measured in the local currency, the rand. Other countries that did relatively well included Mexico, down nine-tenths of 1 percent; Australia, off 1.63 percent; Canada, down 1.95 percent, and Norway, off 2.98 percent. Those countries benefited from having strong oil and gas interests.
The decline in Britain, which was 4.71 percent, was mitigated by the country's North Sea oil production. But oil plays a far less important role in the British economy now than it did 10 years ago.
The United States was just above the middle of the pack, falling 5.52 percent. Italy, down 9.26 percent, and Spain, off 9.65 percent, fell fairly sharply, partially because their earlier rallies had been so dependent on foreign investors, who moved out quickly after the Iraqi invasion.
The decline in markets since the beginning of August left the rankings for the year generally intact. Mexico, Austria and Norway are the top three performers and Japan is still at the bottom. The biggest moves were made by the countries whose markets were helped by oil or gold. South Africa jumped from 21st to 15th for the year and Britain moved from 12th to 7th. Malaysia fell from 11th to 17th, and France from 15th to 20th.
 
Gold Prices Rebound
Except for precious metals and minerals, to which many investors rushed as a safe haven, no sector of the world's economy was unscathed. And despite a 1.24 percent rise in gold and other precious metal stocks, the sector is still down 10.12 percent for the year because the price of gold had fallen sharply to around $360, from more than $420 in February. But the Iraqi invasion has given gold a boost. On Friday, gold was up more than $11 for the day, to $396.90 in New York, very close to the psychologically crucial $400 level.
Even the oil-company stocks, the best defense in an oil-shocked market, are down on average by four-tenths of 1 percent since the invasion. There were gains by some companies, like British Petroleum, up 7.12; Sasol, the South African refiner, up 15.37 percent, and Saga Petroleum of Norway, up 14 percent. But others, which have to buy much of the oil they process, will be hurt as the price increases.
The fear of a slowing economy as a result of higher oil prices and the possiblity of loss of contracts hurt the engineering and shipbuilding industry, whose stocks declined 12.48 percent. Slower growth, which would mean a weaker housing sector, also hurt construction, down 11.56 percent, and appliances, down 10.83 percent. And the higher price of oil knocked the automobile sector down 10.65 percent.

HEADLINE: Previous Exports to Iraq May Prove Costly for U.S.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
President Bush's freeze on Iraqi assets and financial dealings may prove costly to the United States Government, which has guaranteed the payment of $1.7 billion that Iraq owes for the purchase of American farm products.
According to the Commodity Credit Corporation, an arm of the Agriculture Department that guarantees payment for agricultural exports, foreign and American banks have begun to file notices of Iraq's failure to make payments. Including interest, Iraq owes nearly $2 billion, of which about $1.8 billion would be covered by the commodity credit guarantees. 
Iraq imports about three-fourths of its food and was the 10th-largest foreign customer for American agricultural products in 1989, buying about $1 billion worth of products ranging from barley malt to yeast.
''Bank notices that they have not been paid according to schedule are starting to come in now,'' said Richard Godsey, chief of the credit sales registration branch of the Commodity Credit Corporation. Banks have 30 days after filing notices to assemble documents and make their claims. Such documents have not yet been submitted, ''but it seems to be a foregone conclusion they will be,'' Mr. Godsey added. Under the export-guarantee program, Iraq was not required to pay immediately. Instead, American banks and American branches of foreign banks would pay grain companies and other exporters, and then wait for repayment from an Iraqi bank that had issued a letter of credit. The Iraqi bank would usually be the Government-owned Rafidain Bank of Baghdad, the nation's largest, which does not have a good reputation in financial markets. But until recently it had met all payments on letters of credit for agricultural imports.
If Iraq does not pay the banks, the credit corporation is to pay for 98 percent of the exports' value, plus 4.5 percentage points, or roughly half of the interest being charged by the banks on the three-year credit agreements. A higher interest rate equal to that on one-year Treasury bills is covered for exports with a 10-year repayment period.
The export guarantee program was started in the early 1980's to stimulate purchases of American agricultural products. Iraq had been active in the program.

HEADLINE: Freeze on Iraqi Assets Expected to Cost U.S. Banks Little

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The freeze on Iraqi and Kuwaiti investments and bank deposits announced by President Bush and officials of other Western countries last week is not likely to be costly to American banks, according to Government data and bankers' estimates.
The intent of the freezes is to punish Iraq and reinforce the United Nations embargo on trade, while protecting Kuwaiti Government assets from seizure by Iraq. Bankers say their biggest problem has been deciding which Kuwaiti accounts are Government controlled and subject to the freeze.
''The background information about the accounts was available, but it was not all immediately at hand in a single place,'' one New York banker said. Several bankers said the close relationship between businesses owned by members of Kuwait's ruling family and state-owned activities had made it hard to distinguish between private and Government assets. 
 
Administrative Headaches
As bankers wait for the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control to provide more details by Aug. 18 about which Kuwaiti accounts are deemed to be Government controlled, they are applying for special licenses to handle transactions like payments of interest and dividends that do transfer Kuwaiti assets to Iraq.
Bankers have complained about the administrative headaches and have worried that some Kuwaiti clients would be angered by the freeze. They said the freeze had been far less disruptive than the 1979 freeze of Iranian assets, which affected more than $9 billion on deposit at American banks.
Because other countries joined the United States in freezing assets of Iraq and Kuwait, overseas branches of American banks have avoided the delicate and unclear issue of whether they are bound by policies of the United States or the country where they are situated.
 
Easing of Restrictions Begun
In recent days, governments have begun to ease restrictions on Kuwaiti accounts and allow ordinary business dealings. Swiss officials, for example, announced Friday that banks could allow transfers out of Kuwaiti Government accounts, so long as assets do not go to private hands, or to Iraqi controlled accounts.
Even before the attack on Kuwait, American banks had been wary about lending to Iraq because the country's finances are in precarious condition. The country's largest bank, Rafidain Bank in Baghdad, ''was not regarded as a reliable guarantor,'' one American banker said.
A Federal Reserve survey of American banks found loans to Iraq at the end of March totaled $575 million, of which $463 million was backed by guarantees from non-Iraqi sources, often agencies of European governments. Losses on the remaining $112 million of non-guaranteed loans could be reduced by banks' holdings of Iraqi deposits.
 
Effect on New York Banks
Big banks in New York declined to say exactly how much they could lose in their dealings with Iraq, but said their exposure was small. A spokesman for Citibank, the most active American bank in the Persian Gulf area, said the risk of loss to Iraq was ''zero.'' Officials at Chase Manhattan, Manufacturers Hanover, J. P. Morgan and the Bank of New York said their exposure was minimal.
Sharif Ghalib, director of the Africa/Middle East department at the Institute for International Finance in Washington, estimated last week that institutions in other parts of the world were more vulnerable than United States banks to Iraqi loan losses.
Mr. Ghalib estimated that Iraq was in arrears on about $4 billion of debt, much of it loans from government agencies of France, Britain and Italy used to finance imports.
 
Estimate of $35 Billion Owed
By Mr. Ghalib's estimates, Iraq owes about $25 billion to banks, businesses and governments in Western nations and Arab countries besides Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Another $10 billion is owed to Eastern European counties, including $6 billion to the Soviet Union.
Little is known about Iraq's debts to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, except that they are large and were mostly accumulated during Iraq's war with Iran. Mr. Ghalib estimated that Saudi Arabia and Kuwait had supplied a total of $47 billion to $64 billion since late 1980.
''Interest has never been paid on that money,'' he said, ''and I do not think it was regarded as a loan that would ever be repaid.''
 
Banks' Risk of Losses
Determining the risk of loss from loans to Iraq is difficult because there is no single source of complete information and there are many conflicts and inconsistencies. Data from the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, for example, show Iraq's claims, or deposits, in 11 developed Western countries totaled $2.9 billion, while claims on Iraq, or loans from those countries, were nearly $8.3 billion.
Jonathan Crusoe, an editor at Middle East Economic Digest in London, estimated that loans by agencies of the Governments of Japan and France totaled $4.5 billion and $4 billion, respectively. Lenders in Italy have well over $2 billion in loans to Iraq, primarily through the Government-owned Banca Nazionale del Lavaro.
 
Bank Dealings With Kuwait
Bankers generally do not think they are exposed to losses on their dealings with Kuwait, which has long invested widely and wisely around the world. Mr. Ghalib of the Institute for International Finance estimated that Kuwaiti Government assets, excluding money lent to Iraq and other illiquid investments in Arab countries, probably total about $80 billion. Another $25 billion to $30 billion is held by individuals and corporations, he said.
Within the banking system, data of the Bank for International Settlements, covering banks in 11 developed countries, show the Kuwaiti Government and businesses holding about $16.3 billion of deposits at banks, with loans of only about $7.5 billion. The biggest risk from the invasion of Kuwait may be borne by Arab banks, many of them based in Bahrain, that have made big loans to Kuwaiti businesses, bankers said.
As a large investor whose intentions, if known, could cause big price changes, Kuwait has kept most of its financial dealings secret. But Kuwaitis are known to have invested heavily in the oil business. For example, the Kuwaiti Government acquired the Santa Fe International Corporation, based in Alhambra, Calif., for $2.5 billion in 1981.
Estimates of Kuwaiti investments range from about $4.2 billion, according to a Commerce Department count, to more than $40 billion. Mr. Ghalib said Kuwait's investment in the United States is $15 billion to $20 billion, including real estate and securities. Investments in Britain are about $28 billion to $37 billion, he said, with another $13.3 billion in Japan, $2.8 billion in Switzerland and $2.5 billion in Spain.

HEADLINE: SHIPS TURN AWAY FROM PORTS AS IRAQ EMBARGO TIGHTENS; U.S. MILITARY FORCE POURS IN;
U.S. Alliances Recast

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 13

 BODY:
The Persian Gulf crisis is recasting the United States' relations with two of its oldest Middle East allies, Israel and Jordan.
 
Upset by the support
King Hussein of Jordan has been giving Iraq in the crisis, Administration officials said today that if the Jordanians allow Iraq to use the Red Sea port of Aqaba to break the United Nations trade embargo, then the United States Navy will blockade Iraqi shipping seeking to use the port.
Such news will make it clear to King Hussein, who often used to boast that he counted every American President since Dwight D. Eisenhower, especially George Bush, as a personal friend, how far Jordan and the United States are drifting apart. For his part, the King said the United States forces in the region had created an ''explosive situation.''
 
Israel Urged to Lie Low
While the Administration is seeking to induce King Hussein to drop his support for President Saddam Hussein of Iraq and join in the anti-Baghdad boycott, the Bush team has been asking Israel to keep quiet and not to undertake any military actions in the gulf. It is no accident that virtually the only two Middle Eastern leaders whom President Bush has not telephoned since the gulf crisis began are the Iraqi President and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel. 
The Israelis did get a call, but of a different nature. According to Administration officials, the first phone call made by the United States to any Middle East nation on the night Iraq invaded Kuwait went from Robert M. Kimmitt, the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, to Israel's Ambassador in Washington, Moshe Arad.
Mr. Kimmitt, officials said, told the Israeli Ambassador that Washington wanted Israel to keep its head down and its guns holstered. The more public the Israelis were, and the more active they were on the military front, the more difficult it would be for the United States to assemble and maintain an Arab coalition against Iraq. Since then Mr. Arad has met regularly with senior Administration officials, but always in private and without fanfare.
Israeli leaders have indicated that, for now at least, they understand and are prepared to cooperate by quietly sharing their intelligence on Iraq with Washington and to support American military moves in the gulf through a variety of means. What these might be the Pentagon and Israeli officials decline to disclose, but they are understood to be extensive. Officials said that Mr. Shamir sent Mr. Bush a private letter on Thursday assuring him that Israel was prepared to cooperate to deter ''Iraqi aggression'' in any way that Washington suggested.
 
A Meeting Is Postponed
For now, that way is for Israel to remain as unobtrusive as possible. Administration officials were relieved when it was decided that Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d would go to Turkey at the end of last week, precisely when he was scheduled to meet in Washington with Israel's new Foreign Minister, David Levy, to talk about Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations.
American officials wanted the Baker-Levy meeting postponed so that no picture would be sent around the Middle East showing Mr. Baker and Mr. Levy standing together in the State Department lobby. The officials were also concerned by reports quoting leaders of Israel's governing right-wing Likud Party as saying that the Iraqi invasion proved that the real problem in the Middle East was not the Palestinian issue but rather the belligerent nature of certain Arab nations.
American officials said Ambassador Arad told his superiors in Jerusalem that for the sake of United States-Israel relations it would be best that they forgo making strident propaganda points at this time and to lie low. Mr. Arad is also understood to have told his superiors that while the crisis was underscoring Israeli arguments about the violent nature of Middle East politics and highlighting Israel's value as a loyal ally, it could in the long run rebound to Israel's disfavor.
In particular, Israeli officials are concerned that a ''bonding'' between the United States and the Arab world is now taking place at all levels, from the President down to the foot soldier stationed in Saudi Arabia. If the Iraq crisis is resolved, some Israeli analysts predict, the moderate Arab countries will say to Washington: ''We helped you turn back the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait and we paid a high political price for that in our countries, now you have to help us roll back the Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza. How can you be opposed to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and not the Israeli occupation of the West Bank?''
 
What Washington Wants
Answering such a question could become all the more urgent for Washington if President Hussein succeeds in painting the leaders of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria and the gulf Arab nations as ''lackeys'' of the United States and Israel. Israel occupied the West Bank after King Hussein refused to heed an Israeli warning to stay out of the 1967 war in the Middle East and the Jordanian Army opened fire on Israeli troops.
For now, though, it is Jordan's cooperation that the Administration wants most to complete the encirclement of President Hussein. It will not be easy to enlist.
King Hussein has no illusions about the Iraqis. It was President Hussein's predecessors in the Iraqi Baath Party who, in 1958, burst into the Rihad Palace in Baghdad and pumped bullet after bullet into his Hashemite cousin, King Faisal, then the ruler of Iraq. In addition, Jordan, already $9 billion in debt, gets 95 percent of its oil from Iraq, as well as a large percentage of its foreign currency from Iraqi shipping through Aqaba. It receives just $50 million in aid from the United States, compared with $2 billion a year that goes to Egypt.
Finally, the King is a lonely man in a dangerous neighborhood. He has watched in recent years as his tacit allies in Israel's Labor Party, who moved troops to save him from Syria in 1970, have been replaced by a Likud Party that boasts it is prepared to allow Jordan to be turned into a Palestinian nation. For its part, Washington, having tired of the King's equivocations on peace with Israel, decided to bet its big money on President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. The King gradually found himself an orphan.
 
Between Two Worlds
King Hussein now stands torn between two worlds. On one side, he hears the economic grievances of his predominantly Palestinian refugee population, which has not shared in the wealth of the oil boom and which identifies with President Hussein's attack on the rich oil sheikdom of Kuwait. On the other side, he has always had more in common in terms of family and heritage with the ruling Sabah tribe in Kuwait and the Saud tribe in Arabia than with a gunman-turned-politician like President Hussein. Whatever their shortcomings as leaders, the Sauds and Sabahs were always men of limits, unlike President Hussein, who keeps taking the King across lines he has never before crossed.
''The King is now trapped between his Arab obligations, his international obligations and his desire to survive,'' said Marvin C. Feuerwerger, an expert on Jordan at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ''He saw what happened to his cousin. He saw what happened to his fellow Arab kings, and he made a strategic choice to side with Iraq in hopes that this will put him at the bottom of Saddam Hussein's enemies' list. This is not a good time to be a traditional monarch on the border of Iraq.''

HEADLINE: Environmentalism vs. Jobs Troubles Taos

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: QUESTA, N.M.

 BODY:
In isolated pockets of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, it is possible to gaze for miles and lose track of the century.
It might seem that this remote region still belongs to the Pueblo Indians, whose adobe buildings have stood for 800 years, or to the Spaniards who followed the conquistadors, or to the descendants of later settlers who rode the trail blazed by Kit Carson.
In fact, the land is home to all these cultures. Now another wave of newcomers is settling here in Taos County, as the pristine setting and slower pace of life draw affluent people from faraway urban centers. And once again, old practices are being challenged by new values and interests. 
The newcomers are among the most vocal elements in an environmental movement that is fighting a proposed disposal site for waste from a molybdenum mine, which has provided relatively high-paying jobs for several generations of Hispanic workers.
In Taos County, where the unemployment level exceeds 15 percent, and where the average household has an income of less than $10,000 a year, the dispute has uncovered bitter feelings about class, race and roots.
''The people I work with don't have trust funds, and they can't sell a painting for a few thousand bucks,'' said LeRoy Phillippi, a social worker whose Spanish ancestors settled here in the 1600's. ''We all want blue skies and clean ground water, but people shouldn't have to starve to death, either. You can't hear the birds and the streams when your stomach is grumbling with hunger.''
Environmentalists say the construction of disposal pits, which would be visible from some roads, would scar the mountainside and disrupt wildlife. The miners say they fear losing their jobs if the Bureau of Land Management, which is reviewing the mine's application, does not approve a new disposal site.
David Bates, president of the Taos Environmental Association, said a disposal pit would harm the region's worth as a recreational attraction.
''It's not in the region's best interest,'' said Mr. Bates, who designs adobe-style homes, chiefly for newcomers from California and the East.
Around the country, such disputes have become increasingly common since facsimile machines and computer modems have allowed many professionals to live amid the quiet beauty of rural regions while maintaining easy contact with urban centers.
Environmentalists say these people often serve as protectors of the natural splendor. But many longtime residents of these remote areas complain that their economies, which are already struggling, are being further hampered by newcomers with more empathy for wildlife than for wage earners.
The owner of the mine, Molycorp, says it is running out of room for disposal of tailings, the crushed rock that is the residue of molybdenum mining. Moly, as the miners call it, is a metallic element used to make alloys like stainless steel.
 
Plan for Disposal Site
''People come here and talk about retaining the culture,'' said LeRoy Apodaca, manager of administration at Molycorp. ''Well, mining has been part of the culture in these parts since the middle of the 1800's. We're willing to do all we can to show our commitment to the environment. But you can only go so far until you start looking somewhere else. And shutting down the mine here would severely disrupt the lives of a lot of people.''
Molycorp, a subsidiary of the Unocal Corporation of Los Angeles, asked permission to build the disposal pit in the saddle of Guadalupe Mountain, a few miles west of the mine. The dump would cover 568 acres that now are juniper and pinyon forest. The company said it had room for disposal for 8 to 10 more years but must make a decision much sooner about whether the mine would remain usable beyond that time.
Lee Keesling, a spokesman for the Bureau of Land Management, said alternatives were also being studied by the agency. Before making a ruling, it will assess effect a new pit would have on the environment and gauge the sentiments of people who live in the region, he said.
In the tiny town of Questa, virtually every family has a member who has worked for the mine. In 1985 nearly 900 workers were employed there. But the falling price of molybdenum - in part, a result of a slump in oil-exploration, which uses a lot of the element - has cut its employment here to fewer than 300 workers. Because there is so little other work, those who have been laid off must move or wait to be called back to jobs that pay $10 an hour and more.
Many of the unemployed workers fear that opposition to a disposal pit among ''Anglos with rich parents,'' as one idled miner put it, will doom their chances to return to work.
 
'I've Got to Feed My Family'
''I appreciate that these people like our scenery, but I've got to feed my family,'' said Steven Garcia, 41 years old, who has been out of work since 1986.
Writers and artists have been coming to Taos County since before the turn of the century, drawn by the natural beauty and the unusual culture here. Pueblo Indians have endured for 1,000 years here. And the Spaniards who followed Coronado have retained a distinctive culture, largely because of the mountain region's isolation. The language of the Spanish descendants, for example, derives from 17th-century Castilian.
In recent years, Taos has increasingly been a magnet for prosperous newcomers with a love for the environment. Some still work for companies in distant cities. Some are retired. Others have sold homes elsewhere, shed their business suits and started careers as crafts dealers or proprietors of bed-and-breakfast inns.
A few years ago, there were no such inns here; now there are about 30. Some of these people are known here as ''yoarpies,'' or, young almost-retired professionals.
 
Reasons for Migration
''A lot of us came because we have certain environmental concerns,'' said Randy Pelton, who quit his job as an advertising director in Santa Monica, Calif., and moved here with his wife, Carol, to open a bed-and-breakfast inn, the Hacienda del Sol.
Mr. Pelton said they chose Taos because they appreciated the ''cross-cultural experience'' here and because they liked to ski.
''We're trying to get away from what's already been ruined,'' he said. ''Many of the people here take things for granted. But then, given that we didn't do so well with the environments we came from, I suppose we should be more open-minded.''
Mr. Bates, who settled here 17 years ago after studying philosophy at Yale Graduate School, said the movement to places like Taos County is not entirely new.
''But it's different than the migration of the 60's, where you had a lot of young people coming out here to live in teepees and communes,'' he said. ''Now it's more middle-aged people who have become sensitized to what's going on in modern America. They're no longer seduced by the chase. They want clean air, natural beauty and a slower pace.''
Environmentalists concede that the mining issue has largely divided people by economic class, but they note that some natives share their opposition to the mine.
Joe Vigil has organized rallies and petition drives to fight the mine's plan. Mr. Vigil told the hearing sponsored by the Bureau of Land Management that the region's spiritual connection to the mountains was endangered. ''That mountain is like a mother to us,'' he said.
But Phil Rael, who began working at the mine 26 years ago, said the primary concern here ought to be ways to support families.
''What's a working man in Taos County supposed to do?'' he asked. ''I've got a house. I've raised my children. This is what I know how to do. What's wrong with that?'' Mr. Bates and others contend that mining does not provide a healthy source of support.
''My understanding of mining is that it creates a boom and bust cycle,'' he said. ''People get paid high wages one year, so they go out and buy expensive vehicles. Then they get laid off the next year, so they can't make the payments.''
The miners and their supporters consider such a view to be condescending. Moreover, they detect some hypocrisy among the more affluent environmentalists.
''They want to get back to nature, so they come out here and build the old wood-burning stoves,'' said Mr. Phillippi, the social worker. ''On some mornings, when they've all got their stoves going, you can't see the mountains because of the haze.''

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Jordan Denounces U.S. For 'Explosive' Tactics

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Aug. 13

 BODY:
King Hussein of Jordan, whose position in the gulf crisis has been equivocal, accused the United States in a speech published today of creating an ''explosive situation'' that threatens the entire Middle East.
The King appeared to be aligning his country with Iraq, although he did not formally take Baghdad's side in the angry speech to his country's Parliament. ''Foreign ambitions in this region serve the purposes of the enemies of the Arab nation and are designed to help achieve the enemy's objectives by depriving the Arabs of their wealth now and in the future,'' he said.
''The foreign powers aim to regain control of this Arab land and those who live on it,'' the King said. Although he did not mention the United States by name, or its decision to send troops to Saudi Arabia, Washington was clearly a target of his indignation. 
Taking note of the high tensions in the region, King Hussein ordered that first aid centers be opened and training stepped up for civil defense and military units. He cautioned the Jordanians, who have quickly emptied grocery store shelves, against hoarding, and he urged them to limit their use of water and electricity.
 
Fails to Block Goods
Although the United Nations Security Council has imposed trade sanctions on Iraq in response to its occupation of Kuwait, Jordan has not moved to block shipments through its territory to Iraq. Iraq, Jordan's main trading partner, is regarded here as a protector against Israeli attack.
Jordanian officials at the barren desert border with Iraq said this morning that 500 heavy trucks were entering Iraq daily with cargoes including fruit, vegetables, shoes, stone construction blocks and chemicals.
The King's brother, Crown Prince Hassan, who counsels the monarch on political strategy, told a televison interviewer today that Jordan considered the United Nations resolution imposing the trade sanctions to be mandatory. But he suggested that Jordan might appeal to the United Nations for compensation because of the country's dependence on trade with Iraq.
A senior Government official said advisers were reviewing the sanctions and that it was not clear when Jordan would begin to observe them.
 
Solarz Meets King
Representative Stephen J. Solarz, a New York Democrat, said before meeting with the King today that he intended to tell him that ''his whole relationship with the United States hinges on making these sanctions effective.''
''Given the interests we have in the Gulf,'' Mr. Solarz said, ''it's inconceivable that we'd be prepared to maintain relations as we have in the past if he subverts the sanctions meant to bring this aggression to an end.''
The King, in his address to the joint session of his Parliament, complained that ''an Arab border problem'' had been ''transformed into a major and dangerous confrontation with international consequences'' as a result of ''the massing of foreign military forces on Arab soil.''
American combat troops began landing in Saudi Arabia last week, and hundreds more are arriving daily. President Bush said he ordered the troops to the Middle East in the hope of discouraging an advance by President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, who has been massing troops along the Saudi border since he occupied Kuwait 11 days ago. The two Husseins are not related. No Longer a Balance King Hussein's remarks were a sharp departure from the balance he seemed previously to have sought between his relationship with the United States, which gives Jordan millions of dollars in economic and military aid, and his ties with his powerful neighbor Iraq.
President Bush said last week he was disappointed that King Hussein, an old friend, had not joined other Arab League leaders in condemning Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and its massing of combat troops at the Saudi border.
A few days later, the King called a news conference and objected to the forceful seizure of territory. He also said he continued to recognize Kuwait's royal family as the legitimate rulers.
But at a hastily called meeting of Arab leaders on Friday in Cairo, King Hussein hedged his approval of a resolution to condemn the Iraqi leader and to send Arab troops to defend Saudi Arabia, voting ''with reservations.''
Palace aides say the King has spoken several times by telephone with President Bush since the Iraqi invasion 11 days ago.
Taking questions from foreign reporters last week, King Hussein appeared to be trying to mollify the United States without offending President Hussein of Iraq. Aides say the two Husseins have become close friends. Another Turnabout? The Jordanian King's harsh address to Parliament suggested a turnabout, and possible annoyance at pressure from Washington.
A spokesman for the United States Embassy here declined to comment on the speech. A senior Jordanian Government official, apparently seeking to soften the impact of the speech in Washington, said the King's remarks were not ''particularly directed at the United States.''
The official also denied that King Hussein's speech was an attempt to increase his standing in his own country, which has been one of the region's most enthusiastic supporters of the Iraqi leader's actions.
But the spirit of the King's address apparently was not lost on Suleiman Arar, the speaker of the lower house, who praised the Jordanian leader for ''confronting the imperialist-Zionist plans and conspiracies.'' He applauded the King for challenging ''American arrogance and choosing to side by the struggle of the people.''
The Speaker of the Senate, Ahmad Lawzi, also referring specifically to the Americans, said, ''These troops and forces wove the conspiracy of Palestine and want now to keep the power of the Arab oil in their hands.''
King Hussein has said he will continue to seek an ''Arab solution'' to the crisis.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Policies Uncertain, Tokyo Leader Abruptly Puts Off a Mideast Visit

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 14

 BODY:
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu on Monday abruptly put off his plans to travel to the Middle East amid indications that his advisers were divided and uncertain about how to promote Japan's interests there.
The decision, announced two days before Mr. Kaifu's scheduled departure, was widely viewed here as a blow to Tokyo's efforts to play a more assertive diplomatic role on the world stage. He would have been the first leader of a leading Western ally to travel to the area since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
Japanese officials said Tokyo needed more time to come up with ''concrete measures'' to assist the international efforts to isolate Iraq militarily and economically.
 
Foreign Minister to Go Instead
But there was also some confusion as to what Japan had agreed or not agreed to do, aside from continuing to enforce its economic sanctions against Iraq, which were announced a few days after the invasion.
The Foreign Minister, Taro Nakayama, will travel to the Middle East instead of Mr. Kaifu. Mr. Nakayama said Japan would not supply any financial aid to military efforts by the United States and other countries to assist Saudi Arabia and enforce a blockade against Iraq.
His comment appeared to be a rebuff to informal suggestions in the United States that Japan, because of its overwhelming dependence on oil from the Middle East, should be prepared to help financially to make sure that its supplies are not interrupted.
But a Foreign Ministry spokesman emphasized Monday evening that Mr. Nakayama had ruled out financial assistance to the military efforts only for the time being.
President Bush telephoned Prime Minister Kaifu with a request that Japan increase its financial assistance to Middle East nations hit hard by the trade sanctions against Iraq, Japanese officials said this morning. It was unclear whether the United States was seeking aid to the military efforts in the gulf region.
 
Constitutional Restriction
The Foreign Ministry spokesman and others emphasized on Monday that Japan would have difficulties in assisting the military efforts because the Japanese Constitution, written by the United States after World War II, forbids the use of force by Japan.
The Constitution does not specifically forbid assisting armed forces fielded by others, and Tokyo in fact pays 40 percent of the $7 billion cost of stationing American troops in Japan. But the Constitution is often cited by those who oppose increasing military spending.
Mr. Kaifu was to have left Wednesday for Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Jordan and Egypt on a long-planned ''good will'' mission.
Officials said the cancellation was forced by mounting fears in both the Foreign Ministry and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party that the trip would turn into a debacle.
They were said to be worried that Japan would anger both Iraq and its enemies by seeming to appeal to other oil-producing countries to increase production. The concern that the trip would merely be seen as an ''oil-buying expedition'' caused Japanese diplomats to reassess it, officials said.
 
A Cautious Image
Nevertheless, for many the cancellation seemed to reinforce Japan's image as a country that hesitates to assert its political interests in a way commensurate with its status as an economic superpower.
''This shows that Japan simply isn't ready to forge an independent diplomacy,'' said Kent E. Calder, associate professor of politics and international relations at Princeton University, who was visiting Tokyo. ''Japan really doesn't want to move in uncharted waters where there's any kind of risk.''

HEADLINE: Bush Returning to Washington for Budget Session

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KENNEBUNKPORT, Me., Aug. 13

 BODY:
President Bush is returning to Washington on Tuesday, a day earlier than scheduled, and plans to hold a budget meeting and a news conference where aides said he would prod the Democrats to come to a ''reasonable'' agreement on the budget.
The President will argue that the need for such an agreement is more urgent than before, they said, with the Persian Gulf confrontation following so closely on the costly savings and loan bailout.
No specific proposals are expected to come out of the meeting of Administration officials involved in budget negotiations with Congressional leaders. But White House officials said the negotiators would try to come up with a preliminary estimate of the impact of oil price increases and the American military presence in the gulf. 
 
Economy Called Sound
''We want to see what changes we might want to make in our proposals to reflect the impact'' of sending ships and troops to the Middle East, said one senior Administration official.
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has left both Democratic and Republican lawmakers worried about the effect of rising oil prices on a faltering economy and skeptical that the budget talks between Congress and the White House can move forward.
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady predicted last week that higher oil prices would cut the economy's growth rate in half but asserted that it was resilient enough to avert a recession. He said those who argued for delaying talks on reducing the deficit because of fears about the invasion of Kuwait and rising oil prices were ''dead wrong.''
The White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, took a similar position at a briefing here today, saying, ''There's no official change in our assumptions at this point'' that rising oil prices will not devastate the economy.
Last month negotiators for the White House and Congress tentatively agreed to cut the deficit by $50 billion. Asked whether that would be more difficult in light of the crisis in the gulf, Mr. Fitzwater replied: ''It's been so difficult to this point, it's hard to imagine it getting more difficult. It will be difficult, but on the other hand, we are hopeful that the Democrats are operating in good faith and that we'll be able to reach an agreement.''
At the budget meeting, Mr. Fitzwater said, Administration negotiators would also review their plans for cutting expenditures, overall budget figures and tax policy, in preparation for resuming budget talks with Congressional negotiators in September.
Mr. Bush has exempted some military personnel from the automatic spending cuts that will take effect on Oct. 15 under the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law if there is no budget plan by then.
Mr. Fitzwater said today that the money for the Persian Gulf operation would come from ''existing budgetary resources.''
''The money is there,'' he said. ''Funding will not drive this operation.''
Mr. Fitzwater was asked if the cost of the Gulf crisis had changed the President's view that taxes would need to be raised as part of any budget agreement. ''We don't discuss the internal aspects of the budget,'' Mr. Fitzwater replied. But he said the President's view on taxes had not changed.

HEADLINE: Road Still Rough for Black Candidates

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Just a year after L. Douglas Wilder made history in Virginia by becoming the first black elected Governor of a state, national attention has been focused on the chances of new breakthroughs by black candidates for governor in Georgia and South Carolina and for the Senate in North Carolina.
 
But when Andrew
Young suffered a crushing defeat last Tuesday in the Democratic runoff in Georgia, it underscored that Mr. Wilder's success will be difficult to duplicate.
The candidacies of blacks in those three states are important signs of the remarkable political gains that blacks have made in the South only three decades after the end of segregation. According to a recent report by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a research group in Washington, 4,955 of the nation's 7,370 black elected officials are in 16 Southern and border states and the District of Columbia.
But some of the gains, as exemplified by Theo Mitchell's candidacy for governor of South Carolina, say as much about a Democratic Party weakened by the defection of white voters as they do about racial progress. 
And a Department of Justice challenge to Georgia's primary system two days after the runoff, accented the degree to which gains by blacks are bringing the Democrats risks as well as opportunities as they try to hold on to white voters.
 
Victory Was 'Extraordinary'
''Young's race points up again just how extraordinary the Wilder victory in Virginia was,'' said Larry J. Sabato, a professor of government at the University of Virginia. ''While it is possible for a black to win now in the South, it is never likely a black will win.''
Even before Mr. Young's dismal showing, losing to Lieut. Gov. Zell Miller by 38 percent to 62 percent, many political analysts said that unique aspects of Virginia politics hid some of the problems black candidates still face and that it was a mistake to read too much into the three candidacies this year.
Mr. Mitchell won the nomination of perhaps the most demoralized state Democratic Party in the South and is given little chance of beating the Republican incumbent, Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. Mr. Young, despite his international reputation and moderate record as Mayor of Atlanta, attracted only minimal white support.
But in North Carolina, Harvey Gantt faces better prospect in his underdog race against Senator Jesse Helms, the conservative Republican.
Despite the obvious echoes of last year's Virginia campaign, the differences between the three races and Mr. Wilder's outweigh the similarities, experts say.
Mr. Wilder was nominated by a party convention rather than having to face a primary battle, so he faced the voters only once, in the general election. He found an issue, support for abortion rights, that attracted a white constituency. His opponent ran what was considered a weak campaign, and his state, Virginia, includes the Washington suburbs with a white constituency more sympathetic than those in Georgia, North Carolina or South Carolina.
 
Lessons From Young
''Wilder only had to win one race,'' Mr. Sabato said. ''He had the silver bullet of abortion, which was the hot issue. He had a divided Republican Party. And he still won by only 6,800 votes.'' The defeat of Mr. Young, who had an impressive record of public service and a mainstream message, illustrates pitfalls black candidates still face.
Mr. Young tried to run a low-key race much like Mr. Wilder's, assiduously courting white voters and counting on solid black support. Instead, he made few inroads among whites and failed to generate great enthusiasm among blacks.
Many black candidates seem to face a choice of alienating whites with a campaign that excites blacks or failing to energize their black base with a low-key campaign aimed at courting whites.
Mr. Young faced other problems as well. Like many other black candidates with their bases in big cities, he had to overcome the historic antipathy of rural Georgia voters to candidates from Atlanta.
Polls showed that the most important factor in the election was not race, but Mr. Miller's support for a lottery to finance education. But polling also found that about a third of the white voters were highly unlikely to vote for a black, leaving Mr. Young with a difficult task with only two-thirds willing to hear his message.
 
Tough Battle in South Carolina
Mr. Mitchell, a veteran State Senator with close ties to the Rev. Jesse Jackson, sees a similar symbolism in all three races.
''I think it's a source of pride that Virginia, capital of the Confederacy, would see fit to end the hostility between the races,'' he said in a recent interview. ''And I also say that the state where the first shot was fired in the Civil War is going to fire the final shot. We're going to really end the Civil War with the election of yours truly as governor.'' Few think that is likely, however. Mr. Mitchell has one paid staff member and has raised $200,000 as against the $1.7 million that Mr. Campbell has raised toward a goal of $2.5 million.
Mr. Mitchell's nomination comes at a time when whites are continuing to desert or ignore the Democratic Party in South Carolina. In 1978, 455,000 people voted in the Democratic primary, with blacks making up 29 percent of the vote. In this year's primary, only 204,000 votes were cast, with blacks making up about 50 percent of the vote.
To many analysts, the real message of Mr. Mitchell's primary victory is that the Democratic Party in South Carolina is continuing to lose white support and is in danger of losing its ability to compete for major races.
 
Challenge to Runoffs
''For a lot of whites, particularly younger whites, the Democratic primary is not on their political radar screen anymore,'' said Earl Black, a professor of political science at the University of South Carolina.
The issue could be complicated by a United States Justice Department challenge to the election rules in Georgia, because other Southern states also mandate a runoff if no candidate wins 50 percent of the vote in the primary.
Some blacks say that the runoff rules dilute black voting strength and that the abolition of runoffs would make it easier for blacks to win statewide primaries. But many experts say that if runoffs are ended, the big winners would be Republicans, who would be more likely to face a candidate without broad-based support among Democrats. ''They will elect more Republicans if they succeed in abolishing the runoff,'' Mr. Sabato said.
Like Mr. Mitchell, Mr. Gantt won his nomination after the top Democratic contenders, like former Gov. James Hunt, declined to run in what would be a bruising race.
Unlike Mr. Mitchell, polls show Mr. Gantt is running strongly and is slightly ahead of Mr. Helms, though many voters remain undecided. But Mr. Helms trailed Mr. Hunt by large margins in early polls in 1984 only to mount a big-money, brass-knuckles campaign that won. And the polls were taken at a time when Mr. Gantt was campaigning heavily and Mr. Helms was not.
Mr. Gantt, a former Mayor of Charlotte who was defeated when he ran for re-election in 1987, gained 37 percent of the white vote in the Democratic runoff against District Attorney Mike Easley of Brunswick County. Mr. Gantt says the contrast with a dogged conservative like Mr. Helms helps his campaign. Analysts say that unlike Mr. Young's race against the moderate Mr. Miller, the presence of Mr. Helms on the ticket will insure a large black turnout no matter what kind of race Mr. Gantt runs. And running in a year with no Presidential race gives him an advantage over Mr. Hunt in 1984, who ran when Ronald Reagan's presence brought out Republican voters.
''I have always said in order for us to win, we felt we had to run against a guy like Jesse Helms who is so clearly defined and whose vision can be so sharply contrasted with mine,'' Mr. Gantt said in a telephone interview.
There is enough anti-Helms feeling in North Carolina that any serious challenger is believed to begin the race with at least 40 percent of the vote. Getting to 50 percent is the hard part. And some Democrats worry that Mr. Gantt has hurt himself by leaving open the possibility of tax increases and opposing the death penalty and will not have the financial resources to compete with a barrage of Helms television spending late in the race.
Still, if the races this year represent steps on a long journey rather than the full arrival of blacks in Southern politics, a win by Mr. Gantt over Mr. Helms would be at least as significant as Mr. Wilder's victory last year.
And some analysts say that if the trends are helping the Republicans as they continue to make gains in the South, in the long run they could help both the Democrats and the region as whites become more accustomed to blacks in politics.
''In the short run it could be a problem for the Democrats,'' said Hastings Wyman, publisher of the Southern Political Report, an independent newsletter.. ''In the long run, you have to say there are some trends going on that may be helpful to them - that is a lessening of hostility on the part of white voters to blacks in politics. That has been a burden to the Democrats and an asset to Republicans. To the extent that over time becomes less of a factor, it helps the Democrats.''

HEADLINE: Rinfret Proposes Towns Bid For Waste-Site Exemptions

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Pierre A Rinfret, the Republican gubernatorial nominee, said today that he would solve the perennial problem of finding sites for landfills and garbage incinerators by forcing local governments to bid for the right not to build them.
Environmentalists and local government leaders were quick to criticize the plan as discriminatory against the poorest areas of the state, which could become dumping grounds for the rest of New York.
''It sounds like the worst case of toxic imperialism I've ever heard of,'' said Lee Wasserman, executive director of the Environmental Protection Lobby, a statewide advocacy group. 
''I think many of our officials would find that proposal objectionable, and it would get little support here,'' said Edwin L. Crawford, executive director of the New York State Association of Counties.
 
Payments to Accepting Town
Under Mr. Rinfret's plan, auctions would be held in which counties or municipal governments would bid against other governments in their areas for the right to keep solid-waste disposal center out of their towns.
Eventually, Mr. Rinfret said, one government would stop the bidding and accept the landfill or incinerator, either because it could not afford to bid higher or because it wanted the center in its area. The other governments would then pay the accepting government an annual fee equivalent to the amount of the winning bid, possibly hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Mr. Rinfret announced his proposal at three news conferences, including one here, in which he discussed an environmental program that he said was based on ''free-market ideas.'' He also appeared on Staten Island at the Fresh Kills Landfill and in Syracuse at the site of a solid-waste transfer station.
Mr. Rinfret, a New York City economist, has based his campaign on a series of unconventional proposals. Among other suggestions, Mr. Rinfret has proposed selling the New York City subways and eliminating plea bargaining.
Mr Rinfret said the auction idea could also be used to find sites for low-level radiation storage and prisons. He denied that the practice would put poorer counties or municipalities at a competitive disadvantage.
 
'An American System'
''They have a choice,'' he said. ''They just bid more to get out of it. That's called an American system. Why don't you drive a Rolls-Royce? Because you don't have the money, right?''
In other environmental proposals, Mr. Rinfret said he would favor mandatory recycling across the state. He said he opposed a recommendation by a gubernatorial commission to limit development in the Adirondacks, saying it would be unfair to residents there.

HEADLINE: FOOTBALL;
Player Sues N.C.A.A. Over Eligibility Rules

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN

 BODY:
College football, already beset by whirlwind changes, is faced this week with a new legal challenge to its authority.
Braxston Banks, a fullback at Notre Dame who sat out the 1989-90 season, has filed suit against the National Collegiate Athletic Association and Notre Dame in an effort to regain the final year of eligibility that he lost as a result of becoming a candidate for the National Football League draft last April.
Banks was one of 38 players with remaining eligibility to declare and one of 20 not selected.
A hearing is scheduled in South Bend, Ind., on Thursday at which Banks will attempt to get an injunction enjoining the N.C.A.A. and Notre Dame from enforcing two key eligibility rules: one automatically prevents athletes who place their names in a professional sports draft from playing college sports again, even if they are not chosen; the other makes players ineligible if they agree to retain an agent, even if the agent is a friend or family member. 
 
One Person, One Institution
''The preliminary injunction principally affects one person in one institution and the teams they play against,'' said Allan Morrison, Banks's chief attorney in the case. ''The case as a whole, however, deals with how the N.C.A.A. and its member institutions are going to relate to college athletes who are being used by these institutions, in many cases to make enormous amounts of money for those institutions, and whether they're going to continue to treat them in a way that many people, including some high officials in the N.C.A.A., consider to be unfair.''
Richard Schultz, the N.C.A.A.'s executive director, has publicly advocated a rule change that would allow undergraduates to declare for the N.F.L. draft, testing the pro market, without losing their eligibility.
Banks sat out the 1989-90 season after undergoing knee surgery in February 1989. Because he was graduating in the spring with a degree in English, he had originally planned to use the year of eligibility and enroll in Notre Dame's business school, an expense the school would have carried had Banks remained on his football scholarship. But Banks changed his mind and declared for the draft.
 
Family Member Consulted
Once he declared, Banks became ineligible under the two N.C.A.A. regulations that are being challenged in the suit. Banks admits that while he was making up his mind on the draft, he consulted with a family member who happened to be a sports attorney, but he maintains that he did not sign a contract or accept money.
''Although the focus of the preliminary injunction is not on the agent rule, we think that the agent rule is perhaps even more important in the long run,'' Morrison explained. ''These kids need good advice from reputable people before they make up their minds, before they even test the waters. Part of the problem is that its hard to get good advice now.''
Attorneys for the N.C.A.A. say that they are operating under provisions of the current regulations, and that under those rules, Banks is ineligible to play this fall at Notre Dame.
''He made a wrong decision,'' said William C. Duncan, one of the attorneys representing the N.C.A.A. ''Not every wrong decision can be remedied by a court decision.
''Whether the rule is not fair, whether it is too broad is not the issue here. There is no antitrust issue here. Banks can try out for any team he pleases; what he cannot do is return to Notre Dame and play football for Notre Dame. There is no economic injury to anyone but him, because he guessed wrong. He made a conscious decision and he guessed wrong and now he wants another chance. If there was a law that said he could come back, then he would be able to return. Right now, there is no such law.'' Neutral at Notre Dame Notre Dame describes itself as a neutral party in the case.
''We're members of the N.C.A.A.,'' said Gerald Lutkus, one of Notre Dame's lawyers. ''We support the rule; we will follow those values, unless the court tells us otherwise.''
''If the court says yes, it is my understanding that he has been informed that he will be given a fourth year of eligibility,'' Lutkus added, alluding to the school's athletic department.

HEADLINE: Antarctica Sheds Ice and Scientists Wonder Why

BYLINE: By WALTER SULLIVAN

 BODY:
SATELLITE monitoring shows that Antarctica has shed more than 11,000 of its 5 million square miles of ice since the 1970's, and scientists say further study is needed to determine whether the findings indicate that global warming is melting polar ice.
The new findings and other reported indicators of warming have led researchers to devise elaborate plans to map Antarctica's ice. Only half its coastline has been repeatedly recorded in satellite pictures so far.
A meeting of experts organized early this year by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in College Park, Md., recommended that a multidisciplinary research initiative be established to involve universities and Federal agencies in the study of changes in marine ice sheets, ice resting on land that is now below sea level.
If global warming occurs, its effects will be most obvious at the poles, Dr. Richard S. Williams Jr. of the United States Geological Survey said in an interview. In the past, the comings and goings of polar ice have caused sea levels to fall and rise by hundreds of feet. A sea level rise of only a few feet could be catastrophic for coastal areas worldwide. 
Dr. Williams said the shedding of Antarctic ice might have begun ''hundreds of years ago.'' He said he doubted that it was part of a short-term cycle, but said he could not rule out global warming as the cause.
Jane G. Ferrigno, who works with Dr. Williams, said at an international conference on the subject at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks in June, that in 1986 alone, more than 8,800 square miles of ice had floated into the Weddell Sea from the Larsen and Filchner ice shelves, layers of continental ice about 1,000 feet thick, that flowed off onto ocean water.
''Recent apparent large-scale retreat or recession in several areas make it important to continue to monitor and evaluate the changes to determine if they are random, cyclic, or whether they are a signal of global climate change,'' she said.
This loss of ice from the shelves did not substantially raise sea levels, she said, but could clear the way for rapid and massive shedding of ice resting on land, which would cause water levels to rise.
Ms. Ferrigno said four other extensions of the continental ice had gone to sea in the last few years, as well. In 1987 more than 1,900 square miles from the Ross Ice Shelf ''calved,'' floating off to sea as a giant iceberg and disintegrated.
Researchers studying corals have concluded that two periods of polar ice melting after the last ice age brought about extremely rapid sea level rises - up to 14 feet in a century. Last month, French scientists reported that evidence from African lakes suggested that rapid climate change coincided with the polar melting and filled the previously arid lakes, perhaps within decades.
The Antarctic accounts for 91 percent of the earth's ice. Almost all the rest is over Greenland. Enough of this ice melted between the last two ice ages, 125,000 years ago, to raise global sea levels at least 20 feet above their present level. A study of sea-level rise published this month by the National Academy of Sciences, while noting that global sea levels have risen 300 feet in the last 18,000 years as ice sheets melted and taking into account the possibility of further polar ice melting, forecast a rise of roughly 1.5 to 3.5 feet in the next century.
Participants at the NASA meeting said much of West Antarctica's marine ice sheet is vulnerable to collapse and dispersal into the oceans when sea water penetrates it, causing it to break into icebergs. The proposed multidisciplinary project, called Searise, would monitor the grounding line, the place where ice flowing off the continent becomes waterborne and the spot where the penetration of ocean under the marine ice sheets would occur. Because the land slopes downward at the new grounding line, the ice ''would find itself in deeper water, where the ice needs to be thicker to maintain contact with the bed,'' the Searise report said. In such a situation, it explained, ''the grounding line retreats faster and faster as the entire ice mass is dispersed toward its margin and into the ocean.''
 
Possible Signs of Collapse
Like water flowing off a continent, five ''streams'' of ice renewed by snowfall, up to 50 miles wide and 300 miles long, flow across the slow-moving West Antarctic ice sheet into the floating Ross Ice Shelf. These streams, which move half a mile a year, ''may be manifestations of collapse already under way,'' the NASA panel said.
Specialists believe that if the Ross Shelf went to sea, no longer buttressing the inland ice, the ice might become ''unplugged'' and disperse. This might occur as well on the opposite side of West Antarctica if the Ronne and Filchner ice shelves went to sea, but only a small percentage of them has broken up in recent years.
A contrary view, that the Antarctic ice may be growing, has been advanced by Dr. Charles R. Bentley of the University of Wisconsin at Madison. From measurements of snow accumulation and ice that broke off into the water, he has sought to estimate how much ice is being added to the ice sheet by snowfall and compare it with the loss by flow into the sea around the entire continent. From this he estimates that input exceeds output by 5 to 15 percent. He said global warming would produce even greater accumulation, since that would increase the humidity of air blowing from the sea, causing still more snow to fall.
The accumulation that he estimates is already occurring would lower worldwide sea levels by one-tenth to four-tenths of an inch per year. But sea levels seem to be rising. This means the melting ice must be coming from elsewhere, possibly Greenland or mountain glaciers, he said in a telephone interview.
 
Melting Greenland Ice
Dr. Roy M. Koerner of the Geological Survey of Canada has argued that the rise in sea level at the end of the next-to-last ice age to 20 feet above the present level was almost all caused by shedding of ice from Greenland. Samples from the bottoms of two holes drilled through the Greenland ice cap, he argues, show that the ice formed on bare land at the start of the most recent ice age, after all ice from the previous ice age had already vanished.
He noted that so far, samples from the sea floor off Antarctica have not shown evidence that West Antarctica totally shed its ice after the next-to-last ice age.
Evidence that polar ice disintegrated after the last ice age far more rapidly than had been supposed has been derived from corals on the island of Barbados by Dr. Richard G. Fairbanks of the Columbia University Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory. He has reconstructed a record of sea levels over the past 18,000 years. This, he said in an interview, shows that 14,200 years ago, sea levels were rising at a rate of 14 feet per century.
In a subsequent surge, 11,300 years ago, seas rose 12 feet per century. Whether the melting came from Antarctica or elsewhere is uncertain, he said. The rapid filling of widely separated lake beds in the African desert was reported in a recent issue of the journal Nature by French researchers who studied lake sediment.
Participants in the NASA meeting acknowledged that ice is also flowing swiftly off Greenland. For example, Jakobshavn Glacier, the world's fastest, is flowing into the sea at the rate of 75 feet a day. They decided, however, that their first focus should be on the West Antarctic sheet because of its vulnerability. More offshore sampling could help determine its history, as well as drilling through it to see whether any ice from the previous ice age remains.
Participants also noted that shedding of the Antarctic ice would have many little-recognized effects, changing ocean and air circulation probably as far north as the tropics. Such circulation is now strongly influenced by the violent winds that pour off the South Polar ice.
 
Monitoring by Satellites
NASA officials believe that satellites carrying laser altimeters will be able to spot lowering of the surface, if a collapse is occurring. The program assumes that satellites, as well as surface expeditions, will monitor changing ice volume, including flow down the glaciers and ice streams. Scientists from several countries are building radio-observing stations in Antarctica to provide highly precise reference points for such observations.
By comparing radio signals from distant celestial objects like quasars, scientists at stations on land and on the ice can determine their locations to within a fraction of an inch. The Japanese have recently built such a station at Showa, their base in Enderby Land. The West Germans have started one near the Antarctic Peninsula. A Soviet station is projected, but the site is still uncertain.
Dr. James Garwin of NASA, who is working on plans for satellite mapping of Mars as well as the height of the Antarctic ice, said a challenge would be to determine the satellite's orbit precisely enough to identify where its radar or laser beam is looking.
Other efforts are already under way. Dr. Baerbel K. Lucchitta of the Geological Survey office in Flagstaff, Ariz., told the Fairbanks meeting of efforts to learn the extent to which Antarctica, through its many coastal glaciers, is dumping ice directly into the sea. The 25-nation Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research has begun a program to take duplicate photographs from space of glaciers recorded by satellite in the early 1970's.
So far, she said, such repeated images of 15 glaciers have been recorded, showing rates of annual motion ranging from 328 feet to 1.4 miles. Because the flowing glaciers carry with them crevasse patterns, splits in the ice that are easily recognized in the images, their motions can be followed from year to year. The fastest are the Pine Island and Land Glaciers, both draining Marie Byrd Land.
Robert A. Wharton Jr., of the Desert Research Institute in Reno, told of 10 years of observing ice thickness on Lake Hoare, a permanently ice-covered lake in southern Victoria Land, near McMurdo Sound. From 1979 to 1986, he said, it thinned from 18 feet to 11 feet, then stabilized.
 
Above-Freezing Temperatures
''An increase in mean annual temperature is the most plausible explanation,'' he said. He and his colleagues believe that peak summer temperatures have been above freezing ''for a progressively longer period of time each year since 1973.''
Another temperature measurement was reported by Gary D. Clow and colleagues at the Geological Survey branch in Menlo Park, Calif. They studied the manner in which heat has propagated downward in permanently frozen ground, concluding that during the past century much of northern Alaska has warmed about 4 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit.
Dr. Clow said a drill hole in the Taylor Dry Valley of Antarctica showed a rise of about two degrees in the past 15 years, but its link to warming was uncertain.
The June 28 issue of Nature discussed evidence for Arctic ice thinning obtained by upward-looking sonar on two British submarines cruising under the ice. Earlier expeditions have found average thicknesses to be highly variable, ranging from 10 to 15 feet. The thinning from 1976 to 1987 was found to be substantial, but subject to so many factors that it could not be taken as evidence for climate change.
There seems to be widespread, though not universal, agreement that the world has become warmer in recent decades. Philip D. Jones and Tom M. L. Wigley at the University of East Anglia in Britain have completed a 10-year analysis of available data. In the August issue of Scientific American they say: ''Our work shows conclusively that the world's climate, though highly variable over periods of a decade or less, has become generally warmer during the past century.''
The effect, they say, has been less than that predicted from carbon dioxide and other gases added to the atmosphere by human activity. There is no proof that such an effect is occurring, they say, but they argue that this should not be used as an excuse for inaction.
''The longer the world waits to act, the greater will be the climate change that future generations will have to endure,'' they warned.

The Burning Season
The Murder of Chico Mendes and the Fight for the Amazon Rain Forest
By Andrew Revkin
317 pages. Houghton Mifflin. $19.95.
In Chico Mendes, a Brazilian rubber tapper who was murdered in December 1988, the developed world found a symbol of resistance to the destruction of the planet. Mr. Mendes, who had campaigned for the preservation of the Amazon rain forest that provided his livelihood, became a martyr to the environment and a posthumously fashionable figure. 
After a torrid summer in the United States in 1988, with its drought and fires in Yellowstone Park, the killing of Mr. Mendes by ranchers intent on setting the Brazilian forest ablaze caught the imagination and indignation of Americans. He became the symbol of the little man standing up to the big interests that were fueling global warming.
Now, two books - Andrew Revkin's ''Burning Season: The Murder of Chico Mendes and the Fight for the Amazon Rain Forest'' and Alex Shoumatoff's ''World is Burning'' - look back at the life and death of Mr. Mendes. Each, inevitably, covers much of the same ground, chronicling the gradual transformation of Mr. Mendes from a humble rubber tapper in Acre, an eastern Brazilian state, to a man whose courageous defense of the trees and workers he loved eventually made him a figure of such influence that the ranchers he opposed decided to kill him.
But the similarities between the books end there. While Mr. Revkin's book is a clear, informative account of the clash in the dark heart of the rain forest, Mr. Shoumatoff seems unable to decide whether he is writing a personal travelogue of his own meanderings in the Amazon and elsewhere or the story of Mr. Mendes. His hip language, which seems to owe much to Hunter S. Thompson without ever having Mr. Thompson's bite or humor, is too often a thin mask for an irritating sloppiness. Explaining the difficulty of getting statistics on the Amazon, for example, he writes that ''numbers are a temperate-zone precision trip.''
Born from a magazine piece on Mr. Mendes that appeared last year in Vanity Fair, Mr. Shoumatoff's book is flawed by its self-obsession and lack of structure. Chapters follow the writer in a circuitous route from his country cabin in New York State, to Rio de Janeiro, on through the Amazon and around again. It reads like a long unedited diary, awaiting distillation. In one of countless references to himself, he describes how he wrote a 714-page ''vomit draft'' of the book in the last three months of last year. Even at half that length in its final form, the book is a trifle emetic.
That is a pity because Mr. Shoumatoff, an old Brazil hand, has a sharper journalistic eye for the country than Mr. Revkin. He captures well the mounting sense of moral depravity that marked the country during the administration of President Jose Sarney and reached a culmination with the murder of Mr. Mendes.
Moreover, he understands the sometimes maddening meekness of the myriad Brazilian poor, some of whom Mr. Mendes unexpectedly organized into a resistance force, and their unusual generosity of spirit. He describes well the Brazilian conviction that American concern over the Amazon masks a quest to hold back the economic development of a country with lingering superpower pretensions. And he has a keen sense of the country's institutions, writing, for example, ''In the Brazilian system, the church is the moral check, and the military is the check against chaos.'' But if there are interesting insights scattered through Mr. Shoumatoff's pages, they are awash in a sea of trivia. Overall, Mr. Revkin does a better job of telling the rubber tapper's story.
Mr. Mendes emerges as a genuinely tragic figure, swept up in larger forces that ultimately destroy him. Born into the depressed fringes of western Brazil, he takes up his father's work, tapping the rubber trees of the rain forest to extract the syrupy latex that will become rubber. Through a series of chance encounters, he is thrust from this role into the defense of his livelihood against ranchers and others pouring into Acre, intent on burning the forest for pasture.
Finally, as the global environmental movement gathers force, he assumes a much wider role as a spokesman for the rain forest at international meetings in Miami and Washington, before his still primitive corner of Brazil reclaims him, with bullets.
In a telling passage on the roots of Mr. Mendes's dogged campaign, Mr. Revkin quotes the rubber tapper, shortly before his death, as he leaps up in anger while watching a documentary on the greenhouse effect and the carbon dioxide spewing from the burning forests of the Amazon.
''I'm not protecting the forest because I'm worried that in 20 years the world will be affected,'' he said. ''I'm worried about it because there are thousands of people living here who depend on the forest, and their lives are in danger every day.''
While waving the Mendes banner is now de rigueur for those who are attracted by rain-forest chic, this is a useful reminder that the rubber tapper was no starry-eyed environmentalist.
On the contrary, his struggle to create ''extractive reserves'' in the forest was directly born of the violent reality of Brazil. It is a reality well captured by Mr. Revkin when he evokes the strangeness of Amazonia: ''The look, feel and smell of the hunks of smoked latex seemed antiquated, anachronistic. It was a material from another time, but in the Amazon all times overlap. Here, rubber tappers still live as they did in the 19th century while ranchers hop to their properties in sleek twin-engine planes and watch television via satellite.''
Amid the media's discovery of the rain forest and Hollywood's fascination with it, the complexity of Brazilian society and the forces driving settlers into the Amazon has often been forgotten. Mr. Revkin does a good job of presenting all the issues. And although those charged with killing Mr. Mendes have not yet been brought to trial, he sounds a cautiously optimistic note.
Large extractive reserves for rubber and nuts have been created since Mr. Mendes's death. Killings in Amazonia have fallen off in an apparent sign that the ranchers' sense of impunity has diminished. And the new Brazilian President, Fernando Collor de Mello, has committed himself to environmental defense amid a growing realization that the development of the Amazon has been hopelessly mismanaged.
This is testimony to Mr. Mendes's achievement. The Amazon, 15 percent of the total mass of plant life, is still little known, and he stood up, almost alone, to preserve its treasures. As Mr. Revkin writes, in an image that is bound to encourage those continuing the struggle Mr. Mendes began, ''Where one tree has fallen to crumble and rot, dozens of green seedlings and saplngs suddenly spring up to vie for the blast of sunlight entering the hole in the canopy.''

HEADLINE: 2 Giants Battle in Wiring Money

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The American Express Company, the nation's largest financial-services concern, is aggressively challenging the Western Union Corporation at a business it pioneered and has long dominated: wiring money.
The objective of the American Express campaign, which started in earnest this summer, is to capture an unlikely market - primarily poor and working-class black and Hispanic consumers, many of them immigrants - who are the most loyal customers of the money-wiring business. It is an unusual campaign for a company that honed its marketing skills on appealing to the affluent and those who want to be.
Wired money is transferred electronically from one city to another through a network of agents. While higher-income Americans usually prefer to send money by check or money order, many poor people either are unaccustomed to banks and checking accounts or cannot afford the fees that banks attach to low-balance accounts. 
John J. Oliviera, a wire agent for American Express who co-owns E.& J. Milk Farms, a combination grocery store/bus depot/used-car lot in Queens, said his customers were often unemployed or working class people. ''They don't exactly have a cellular phone in their car,'' said Mr. Oliviera, who recently switched from Western Union.
Poor black and Hispanic customers are among the biggest users of wired money, sending funds to family members in places like the South, Mexico and Puerto Rico. But they pay high fees for doing so. The American Express charge to wire up to $100 is $12, at least 12 times the cost of traveler's checks.
At least $3.3 billion was wired last year by Western Union and American Express alone. (An unknown number of small ethnic companies, mainly serving the Hispanic market, also wire money, but the amount is not known.) What is known is that the vast majority of the money transfers - about $3 billion - was handled by Western Union. It is a market that is now one of the few reliable sources of profit for the heavily indebted telecommunications company, which narrowly avoided bankruptcy earlier this year and has labor problems. And Western Union's brand name is so powerful that Citicorp, the nation's largest banking company, withdrew from the money-transfer business in frustration in 1988.
As if Western Union does not have enough problems, American Express appears to be gaining ground. After months of building a large agent network but doing little advertising, American Express has already gained about $300 million in money transfers.
 
An Upbeat Attitude
American Express executives are upbeat about the prospects of their money-wiring service, called MoneyGram, against Western Union's Money Transfer service.
''We're going to provide faster, better, less expensive service and get a good piece of the money-transfer business,'' said Robbin L. Ayers, head of the American Express wire-transfer unit in Englewood, Colo. ''But it's going to be a challenge because Western Union is the dominant player.''
Another, and perhaps larger, challenge for American Express may be that it is out of its element in trying to appeal to lower-income groups. The working class and poor - ''habitual users'' in American Express parlance - account for half or more of all wire transfers. Because both American Express and Western Union get their revenue from the per-transaction service fee, they are the most desirable customers. Upper- or middle-class consumers tend to be only ''emergency users,'' wiring money, for example, to cash-short children on vacation or at school.
 
A Large Lead
At least 13 million money transfers occurred last year, most originating in the United States. Twelve million of them were Western Union's, and about one million were American Express's. The busiest months are July, August and just before Christmas.
Western Union, which had total sales of $629 million last year, has seen its revenue from money transfers grow more than 80 percent since 1984, to about $236 million last year. American Express does not disclose financial figures for its wire business, but analysts doubt that it is profitable at this stage.
''American Express is using their size and their skill to come into this market in a big way,'' said Edward J. Fuhrman, head of Western Union's money-transfer division in Upper Saddle River, N.J. ''They're no David and we're not Goliath.''
In a departure from American Express's usual marketing approach of placing a major emphasis on newspaper and magazine ads, the company is devoting most of its money-transfer advertising to radio and television commercials to try to reach people less prone to read. Some of the ads are broadcast on Spanish-language radio and television and on radio stations with large black audiences. $10 Million Budget American Express will not say how much it is spending on advertising, but acknowledges the amount is more than $10 million, compared with Western Union's $20 million budget.
In one general-market radio spot, a wife tells her husband that their son the musician is calling long distance to tell them he ''finally got a gig.'' Trouble is, she says, his group needs money for new outfits within the hour. The husband grumbles, ''I don't believe it.'' The mother sighs and says, ''Well, I guess they can come back here and rehearse in the garage.'' Says the father, ''I believe it . . . Let's send them money right now.''
In one Spanish-language television ad for American Express, a construction worker says, ''Because I work hard for what I earn, I need to know that my money gets there.'' Another man is shown entering a wire agent's office, saying, ''I send money to my family because I want to, and with American Express MoneyGram every time I send money . . . it gets there.''
 
Opportunity in Mexico
Money sent to Mexico is an especially attractive opportunity for both American Express and Western Union. The estimated 22 million Americans of Hispanic descent send abroad, by various means, about $7 billion annually, American Express said. About $5 billion is sent to Mexico alone, but only a small fraction of this money is sent by wire transfer.
American Express has introduced in Mexico a new product called Lightning Service, or El Servicio Relampago. The company claims a processing time of less than 10 minutes for money sent in the form of dollar-denominated traveler's checks that can be exchanged for pesos. Western Union, which claims greater geographical reach than American Express, acknowledges that its service can take as long as two days, but notes that the money is provided directly in pesos.
For New York-based American Express, which had a profit last year of $1.2 billion on revenue of $25 billion, the wire-transfer business is a relatively small but attractive opportunity, analysts say. ''This is very close to their core business; they're good at this,'' said Michael L. Goldstein of Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. ''If anyone can do it, they can do it.''
American Express gets about 3.5 cents every time someone uses any of its charge cards, Mr. Goldstein estimates. Western Union, long establshed in the business, averages $19.60 in revenue for each wire transfer.
 
Few Sources of Profit
For Western Union, the wire-transfer business is one of the few sources of profit. The company's telex and other businesses have been hurt by the rise of new technology, such as facsimile machines. Last year the company lost $32 million.
Over the weekend, Western Union replaced most of its 2,500 unionized workers who are negotiating a new labor accord. The company said the lockout would not affect money transfers or other services, but said the action was prompted by the ''ever present threat'' of a strike.
So far, Western Union is planning no major marketing countermoves against American Express in the money-wiring business. And, given Western Union's financial troubles, it may not be able to afford any expensive new marketing campaigns soon. ''We're just sticking to our game plan,'' Mr. Fuhrman said.
 
Network of Agents
If American Express is to make headway against Western Union, it will have to put together a global network of agents. In the money-transfer business, customers pay a fee to an agent, such as a supermarket, convenience store or bus station, to have the money wired to another city or town. The party receiving the money picks it up at a particular receiving agent, or in the case of ''will call'' service, anywhere in the network.
Unlike money orders - where a company makes most of its money from the ''float,'' investing the money in the interval between the order's issuance and actual cashing - a wire-transfer company and its agents make money from the fee itself.
American Express said it had learned lessons from Citicorp's unhappy experience. It has already built up a large agent base - more than 9,000 agents in 35 countries, mainly the United States. Unlike Citicorp, which announced it was going national with its service and then attempted to build an agent network, American Express has been quietly putting together a network since January 1988, but did not start its national advertising campaign until May.
Citicorp, when it withdrew from the business, had only 2,100 agents. Western Union has more than 15,000 agents.

HEADLINE: Unequal Pay Widespread in U.S.

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
People who work in the same field and are of similar age and education are finding that their wages, once very close, now extend across a much wider range, new studies of Labor Department data show.
Such findings contribute a new explanation for the growing gap between the incomes of the wealthiest and poorest Americans, which is now the widest since World War II, even after adjusting for inflation. The gap can no longer be explained simply by noting that the college-educated earn much more than those with only a high school degree, that blacks do not fare so well as whites or that men earn more than women.
Among the theories explaining the change is that the wage spread reflects a decline in the power of unions, which act to keep wages more uniform. Another is the stiff competition wrought by deregulation in some industries, which forced some struggling employers to impose lower wage scales than their more successful rivals. 
Some economists also think the wage gap has grown as employers increasingly short of skilled labor bid up wages for the best workers, using criteria that go beyond education and job experience. Finally, some economists say that social mores that once kept wages within limits even on Wall Street eroded in the 1980's.
Although wage spreads are increasing among all workers, what is most striking about the trend is its appearance among men who hold full-time jobs, economists say. They constitute more than 50 percent of the labor force, and their wage scales had historically been the most uniform. Results from the recent studies suggest to many economists that the increasing wage gap in this group is perhaps the chief reason for the growing number of wealthy and poor Americans.
''The college/high school thing is important and so are the other differences, but most of the action is among people of the same age and education,'' said Lawrence Katz, a Harvard labor economist, who is studying the wage-spread phenomenon. ''Inequality is going up in nearly every occupation.''
Ten years ago, for example, young lawyers of similar age and education who were seeking to specialize in pension law could expect to land jobs in New York that paid similar salaries. Today, wage surveys show, the top salary is $110,000 and the bottom $42,000, a spread of $68,000. Electrical engineers in their early 30's, holding jobs in Silicon Valley, in California, earned within $12,000 of each other in 1980. The spread has grown to $25,000, greatly outstripping the increase in inflation, with the high end now $65,000. And until 13 years ago, mechanics at any of the nation's big airlines with the same seniority earned virtually the same wage. Today, a top-scale mechanic's hourly wage ranges from $16 at Pan American World Airways to $21 at American Airlines.
Economists who say that the wider wage gap has been caused mainly by employers bidding up wages for the most skilled workers add that this situation makes United States companies more competitive.
But paying sharply different wages to people with essentially the same job credentials is divisive for American society, some economists and sociologists argue. ''I'm not overly concerned about one lawyer who makes $35,000 and another who makes $100,000,'' said Richard Freeman, a Harvard economist. ''But for many others, the wage spread means they no longer make it into the middle class. And they are working just as hard as people did 30 years ago.''
 
Uniformity Exists Abroad
The wage spread means, in effect, the disappearance of a sort of insurance policy that assured people they would receive roughly the same pay if they switched jobs, even if one shoe salesman, mechanic, secretary or engineer was not so skilled as another, Mr. Freeman said. Such uniformity exists today in other industrial nations, among them West Germany and Sweden, where government agencies or unions set pay guidelines.
Christopher Jencks, a sociologist at Northwestern University, sees another dark side in the wage spread. More workers, finding themselves earning less than their peers, seem to be growing discouraged and leaving the labor force, Census Bureau data indicate. ''People get a set of wage expectations that become harder to fulfill,'' he said.
Many theories are being offered to help understand a process that the studies show is 20 years in the making and that is only now getting the attention of many economists. Mr. Freeman and others think that union contracts had tended to keep wage scales uniform within many industries and that the decline in union membership and influence at the bargaining table has undermined this check on wage inequality.
 
Skewing Follows Deregulation
That change took place, for example, in the airline industry, where mechanics' wages were ''in lockstep with each other'' in the 1970's, kept that way by the International Association of Machinists union until deregulation, said Jerry Glass, head of J. Glass & Associates, a labor-relations consultant to the industry. Stiff competition, wage givebacks and bankruptcies forced some workers to give ground, disrupting the scales. Now, senior mechanics at Northwest Airlines or American Airlines are paid 30 percent more than those at Pan Am, a less healthy carrier.
Other economists argue that employers are hungrier than in the past for highly skilled workers and are bidding up wages for the best people in every occupation. Because job skills are not necessarily related to schooling, many of the college-educated are falling behind their former classmates, said Marvin Kosters of the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington research organization.
Mr. Kosters's analysis might help to explain the wage spread for pension-rights lawyers that blossomed in the mid-1980's, when the financial health of corporate pension plans became an issue. ''Pension lawyers became hot in the mid-1980's, and companies and consulting firms began to bid for them,'' said Carole R. Schwartz, chairman of the executive search firm McCabe & Schwartz. ''That disrupted the established salary structure.''
 
Other Explanations
Some economists speculate that the spreads might also be the result of changes in the American economy that cannot be easily reversed. Small companies, for example, proliferated in the 1980's. While established companies in Silicon Valley tend to pay electrical engineers with 10 years' experience about $65,000, the small new companies offer only $40,000 but lure skilled people with stock options that promise big payoffs if the venture succeeds, surveys show.
Some economists go beyond economics to explain the wage gap. One hunch of Frank Levy of the University of Maryland is that workplace mores have eroded. From a purely free-market point of view, Michael R. Milken, who created and dominated the market in high-yield ''junk bonds,'' might have been worth to Drexel Burnham Lambert 20 years ago the inflation-adjusted equivalent of his 1987 income of $550 million, Mr. Levy explained. But in those days, Mr. Milken would not have dared to ask for so much money. And paying such an amount was beyond Wall Street's imagination.
''Then, as custom eroded in the 1980's, the free market came into full play and inhibitions on paying such big sums disappeared,'' Mr. Levy said.
 
The Latest Studies
Kevin M. Murphy of the University of Chicago and Finis Welch of the University of California at Los Angeles produced several of the new studies, which cull from Labor Department data the education, age and experience levels for the nation's full-time male workers, going back nearly 30 years. Until the early 1970's, wage spreads did not change much; after that they widened rapidly. Through 1987, the latest year covered in the recently published studies, the spreads within the various age and education groups were, on average, 30 percent broader than they had been in the early 1970's.
The studies involved men working full time. Separate studies of black and white men produced comparable results. Although the wage gap phenomenon also exists among women working full time, economists say, they were not included in the studies because their tendency to leave the labor force for long periods to rear children can skew the results.
The studies show that people at the top of their salary scales frequently improved their standards of living in the 1980's, or held their own. This improvement took place most often among occupations that employed the college-educated. But in occupations served mostly by high school graduates the top earners also brought home enough in wage increases to maintain their living standard. The wages of nearly all the others, whatever their education, did not rise so fast as the inflation rate.
 
Gains for the Best Paid Only
One of Mr. Murphy's studies shows how men out of school for 11 to 20 years have been affected. Near the high end of the scale, those with college degrees earned $1,076 a week in inflation-adjusted dollars in 1970. The wage near the low end was $377, and the median for this group was $663. Seventeen years later, only the people at the high end had improved their standard of living, which rose 5.2 percent, to $1,132 a week. At the low end wages fell 14.3 percent, to $323, while median wages fell 9.8 percent, to $598 a week.
Similarly, only the best-paid high school graduates were keeping their heads above water 11 to 20 years after completing school. The high-end wage was $650 a week for this group in 1970, adjusted for inflation, and it fell only six-tenths of 1 percent, to $646 in 1987. The median and the low-end wages lost much more ground in those years, with the median falling 10 percent, from $431 to $388, and the low plunging 29.2 percent, from $274 to $194.
The wage gap expanded in those 17 years by 21 percent for the high school graduates and 16 percent for those with college degrees.

HEADLINE: Chip Indicator Continues Slide

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Chip orders declined in July as the American semiconductor industry's leading indicator continued the downward slide it began in June, a trade group said today.
 
The Semiconductor Industry
Association, based in San Jose, Calif., reported a book-to-bill ratio of 1 for the three-month period that ended in July, down from 1.06 in June and down significantly from a revised figure of 1.15 in May. 
The ratio compares orders with shipments and is considered a leading indicator of the industry. A ratio of 1 indicates that for every $100 worth of product shipped, $100 was ordered, indicating demand is no longer growing but has not yet declined.
At $1.19 billion, three-month orders for July were down 6.4 percent from $1.27 billion for the period that ended in June.

HEADLINE: Costs Rising for Chemical Industry

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Higher crude oil prices are starting to affect prices in the chemical industry, a leading consumer of petroleum products, executives of chemical companies say. And because products derived from crude oil are used to make many of the basic materials that go into a host of other products, notably plastics, consumers will soon feel the pinch.
Some chemical companies say they have already seen slightly higher prices on the spot market. For example, the price of naphtha, a product that comes out of refineries and is used in making propylene, ethylene and benzene, has soared from $160 a metric ton three weeks ago, to $240 a metric ton. And last week the spot price for benzene, a key ingredient of plastic packaging, increased 17 percent, while xylene, a chemical used as an octane enhancer and an important ingredient in making plastic bottles, was up 12 percent. 'Higher Consumer Prices' 
''Downstream products have not yet responded,'' said Carolyn Koss Kasten, director of chemical services with Data Resources Inc. in Boston. ''But if there is a protracted period of higher oil prices, the effect on downstream products - plastics, synthetic rubber and synthetic fibers - could easily be higher consumer prices.'' Products as diverse as clothing and airplane parts would be affected. Despite increases in the cost of raw materials, many chemical manufacturers said they were reluctant to pass them along to consumers and that the impact would be negligible on most manufactured goods. As a result, many analysts expect that profits in the industry will be lower than previously thought.
''While it is difficult and premature to assess the scope of the likely negative impact higher crude oil prices may have on chemical company earnings, it is clear to us that for most hydrocarbon-dependent chemical makers, feedstock and energy costs will be rising,'' said Leonard Bogner, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities. ''And they probably won't be able to offset them via high selling prices.'' Mr. Bogner said that pricing for petrochemicals would be based more on supply and demand trends, rather than raw material costs.
But if crude oil prices continue to increase, the result will be higher prices for consumer products, chemical industry executives maintain. ''There aren't many manufactured products that don't have a chemical ingredient in them,'' said Allen Lenz, chief economist with the Chemical Manufacturers Association in Washington. ''And consumers will see those increases if chemical companies see significantly higher crude oil prices.'' Higher oil prices affect all of American industry by raising the cost of energy for manufacturers. The chemical industry is particularly vulnerable not only because of its high consumption of energy, but also because products derived from crude oil are important components in making chemical products.
Robert W. Gallant, vice president of hydrocarbons and energy for the Dow Chemical Company, said higher crude oil prices had begun to affect the price of raw materials. But Mr. Gallant said the higher prices had not changed the company's long-term strategy because supplies were ample.
''We are not in a shortage situation,'' he said. ''In fact, we're carrying a higher inventory than usual.''
 
'Perceived Shortages'
A. Nicholas Filippello, chief economist with the Monsanto Corporation, said even though prices for some raw materials had risen slightly, it was unlikely that prices would remain elevated. ''There is a fundamental excess capacity in the world petrochemical market,'' Mr. Filippello said. ''It's more a function of supply and demand, and perceived shortages can make prices volatile. But when things settle down, I think we will find that not all of that will flow through.''
Many American companies said they expected to be less affected by higher prices than their European rivals because they were larger users of natural gas. A spokesman for the Union Carbide Corporation said natural gas spot prices had increased by 25 to 45 percent, while the spot prices of naphtha had risen 60 percent.
Still, many in the chemical industry are expecting prices of raw materials to increase. ''Although it hasn't affected our raw material costs yet, we definitely expect that it will,'' said William G. Mays, president of the Mays Chemical Company, a commodity chemical distributor based in Indianapolis.

HEADLINE: A New Interest in Taxing Trades

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
Events in the Middle East have revived concern on Wall Street about the prospect of a securities transfer tax - something the financial community is dead set against.
The Iraqi conflict has caused Congressional leaders, who will recovene in September, to rethink ways to cut the budget deficit. Rising oil prices have virtually ended any chance of higher energy taxes, and American troop movements to the region mean that cuts in military spending are less likely.
As a result, alternative plans to generate revenue, like a tax on the trades of all stocks, bonds and commodities, have become more viable, almost by default.
 
'A Complicated Equation'
Of course, the same events may also cut the other way. That the Middle East crisis increases the prospect of a recession raises serious questions about the wisdom of imposing any new taxes on a fragile economy, whether on securities or beer. 
And, a tax that could eat into profits on securities trades and undermine confidence in jittery stock and bond markets might be unwise right now - so Wall Street hopes.
''No one wants to cause the stock market to crash right now,'' said Stuart Kaswell, a lawyer with Winthrop, Stimson, Putnam & Roberts in Washington. ''But, at the same time, the choices are narrowed, and that seems to push more in favor of the tax. It's a complicated equation.'' Mr. Kaswell is a former staff lawyer for the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which reviews securities laws.
Arthur Levitt Jr., the former chairman of the American Stock Exchange who now heads the Levitt Media Company, said he gave the measure ''60 to 70 percent odds of passage.''
 
Wall Street's Position
Wall Street, already buffeted by layoffs, declining business and sharpened global competition, contends that the tax will only hurt. It says the surcharge will drive up transaction costs, drive down securities prices and send business to tax-free markets overseas.
''The Street is unified on this as anything I've seen in my years,'' said Edward I. O'Brien, the president of the Securities Industry Association, a trade organization based in New York. ''The proposed tax is really a slap at the heart of our business.''
And Wall Street has not been shy about lobbying. The nation's stock and commodities exchanges, pension funds and insurance companies have written leading Congressional officials. Even Wall Street's biggest guns have been pulled into the fray.
For instance, just before Iraq invaded Kuwait, John H. Gutfruend, the chairman of Salomon Inc., and William A. Schreyer, the chairman of Merrill Lynch & Company, called on Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, a former chairman of Dillon, Read & Company, to voice opposition to the tax.
 
Tax in Discussion Phase
But this lobbying is taking place even though no formal proposal for transfer tax has been made. The tax, which was first suggested by House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, in 1987, is only being discussed. But it is being considered by the highest levels in the Bush Administration and is on the ''short list'' of the bipartisan group scheduled to resume talks on reducing the deficit after Labor Day.
Initially, it appeared that the proposed tax would be 50 basis points levied on all securities upon sale. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. According to the Congressional Research Service, a branch of the Library of Congress, this would have generated $12 billion a year.
Now, discussion is centered on a tax of 15 basis points, or fifteen-hundredths of a percentage point, which would raise an estimated $3 billion annually. The tax would be imposed on all stock, bond, commodities, futures and options trades. Only Treasury securities would be exempted -something opponents contend is an open admission by the Government that the tax would only increase borrowing costs.
 
The Street's Problem
Yet, even before the Middle East crisis, Wall Street faced a tough challenge. Republicans have insisted that income tax rates not be touched to cut the deficit. Meanwhile, Democrats say any final tax package must be progressive - weighing more heavily on the rich than on the middle class or on those with low incomes.
On their face, few of the new taxes proposed, like higher ones on beer or gasoline, met both political requirements - except for the securities transfer tax.
''The securities industry has a tough battle,'' said Mr. Kaswell, the Washington lawyer. ''There are no investment-banker poster children. And there are a lot more blue-collar workers than investment bankers. It comes down to taxing rich people or taxing six cool ones at the end of a day.''
Still, opponents are gathering volumes of information to argue that the surcharge could cripple United States securities markets. They say the tax is likely to cause big investors to flee the American markets, which would cause trading volume to drop and cut the revenues generated by this tax. Some Trades 'Won't Get Done'
A study from the Congressional Research Service shows that a tax of one-half of a percent would decrease the volume of equity trades by about 8 percent.
''We are talking about something that is reasonably significant here,'' said Donald W. Kiefer, a senior economic policy specialist who wrote the study. ''This will dramatically increase the cost of trading, particularly for institutional investors. So a lot of trades just won't get done.''
Pension funds and insurance companies contend that if the tax is imposed, they could end up paying more in taxes than in commissions for stock trades. For instance, the tax on the sale of a share of stock at $20 could be as much as 10 cents, compared with the 3 cents to 5 cents a share in commissions that institutionals pay.
This, the institutions say, will come out of the money available for benefits to retirees - very often, the middle class that some in Congress want to protect from regressive taxes. It could also force local governments to raise taxes to cover these shortfalls, again hurting the middle class.
''This will have an impact on the average working person who will receive a retirement benefit,'' said Roger C. Bransford, a consultant in the Atlanta office of TPF&C, a benefits consulting firm. ''You are talking about the retirement security of Americans.'' $9.5 Million Estimate James D. Mosman, the chief executive of the California State Teachers Retirement System with about $31 billion in assets, said that a 50-basis-point tax would cost the fund about $9.5 million a year.
''That's money that's not available for benefits,'' Mr. Mosman said. ''And with public funds, that cost gets passed back to the employer, whether it is the state or county. They will then shift it to the local taxpayers.''
The traders of bonds, options, futures, money market and other fixed-income instruments, are particularly concerned. In these markets, profits are often made by betting large sums on small and quickly changing price anomalies. The tax could be larger than the discrepancy in prices, eliminating any reason to trade.
''A transaction tax would have an extremely significant structural impact on fixed-income markets,'' said John Brookmeyer, a senior managing director at the Prudential Capital Managment Group. ''A lot of bond trading is based on anomolies, when relative prices are out of line. This means the markets would become less active, less liquid and a lot of the trading would go offshore.''
 
Sending Business Abroad
Opponents say the tax will drive business from the United States to markets where trading rates are cheaper. They say that some foreign countries have reduced, eliminated or have pledged to end transactions taxes after finding that the tax reduced trading volume.
West Germany, for instance, is eliminating a transactions tax that pushed trading in German securities to London, where foreigners are exempted from its transfer tax. London is planning to abolish its tax, and the Netherlands just ended its surcharge, as did Sweden after trading in Swedish companies moved abroad.
''Everyone has been talking about the globalization of financial markets for years,'' said Sarah A. B. Teslik, the executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors, a pension fund trade group. ''But only now is it beginning to be true. International competition is more cut-throat, and institutional investors do shop around.''

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine, Aug. 13

 BODY:
In a bid to bolster United States-Soviet trade, President Bush today raised a longstanding ceiling on the number of Soviet business people permitted to live and work in the United States.
Until now, only 69 Russians were allowed to reside in America while pursuing business deals. Now there will be no limit.
Mr. Bush called upon President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union to match his move with ''reciprocal improvements in the climate for American business in the U.S.S.R.'' He also cautioned the Soviets against trying to slip in spies on the pretext of doing business.
''This action is taken as an expression of our policy to build a more normal economic relationship with the Soviets,'' Mr. Bush said in a statement issued from his vacation home here.

HEADLINE: Dow Up 30.20 in Late Rally; Trading Light

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
The stock market recovered from an opening slump to finish sharply higher yesterday, showing resiliency in the face of uncertainty over Middle East developments.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 30.20 points, to 2,746.78, but declining stocks outnumbered those that gained by 766 to 726.
Volume was light at 122.8 million shares, with trading hampered by a fire in the Wall Street area that cut off power and telephone service at many brokerage houses in the downtown area. The New York Stock Exchange still had electrical power, but suffered some telephone problems. 
But trading on the American Stock Exchange and the five New York futures exchanges was halted soon after 1 P.M. The power outage shut down all systems and darkened trading floors on the Amex and the five exchanges - the Commodity Exchange, the New York Mercantile Exchange, the New York Futures Exchange, the New York Cotton Exchange and the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange.
Trading in the Nasdaq over-the-counter stock system was also disrupted when about 500 Nasdaq computer terminals in brokerage houses were cut off.
The Amex composite index finished the shortened day at 338.14, down 1.18 points. The Nasdaq composite closed at 408.30, up 0.27. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 3.32 points, to 338.84.
 
'Better Prepared' on Oil
Gene J. Seagle, director of technical research at Gruntal & Company, said that the market rise, which included blue chips like Eastman Kodak, which was up 2 1/2, to 43 1/2, and I.B.M., up 1 3/4, to 103 3/4, might have given a technical buy signal to the market. ''This market is much better prepared for an oil problem than it was in 1978,'' he added.
The market's rally from an opening plunge - the Dow fell as much as 32 points in the first half-hour - began with investors entering the market to bargain-hunt and was supported by a stabilized bond market. Declines in other overseas markets yesterday -the Tokyo market had ended down sharply and London was having an off day - were less important than the Treasury's 30-year bond, which closed unchanged at a price to yield 8.79 percent.
In Tokyo, the stock market rose today after a series of setbacks. The Nikkei 225-stock index gained 496.10 points, or 1.90 percent, to close at 26,672.53. The index fell 1,153.12 yesterday.
The low volume in New York trading was responsible for the large jump in the Dow, traders said, noting that light trading often made share prices extremely sensitive to spurts in buying or selling.
Birinyi Associates Inc., which keeps tabs on program trading by large institutions and brokers through certain fluctuations in trading activity, said there were six sell programs yesterday, four between 2:50 P.M. and 3:56 P.M., when the Dow rose 31.19 points.
Oil stocks were generally higher, and among the big gainers were ARCO, up 2 1/4, to close at 137 1/4; Royal Dutch/Shell, up 1 3/8, to 83 5/8, and Mobil, up 1 1/4, to 67 1/8.
Among airlines stocks, Midway Airlines was up 2, to 9 5/8. AMR, the parent of American Airlines, retained Goldman, Sachs & Company, to weigh a possible acquisition of part or all of Midway. AMR was up 1/8, to 51 1/8.
UAL rose 2 5/8, to 110 1/8. According to a report in Crain's Chicago Business, three unidentified banks and possibly four unidentified financial institutions may be interested in lending to the employee-led group seeking to buy out UAL.
Gold stocks were up, and several analysts recommended gold-mining companies, suggesting that the sector will continue to benefit from the uncertainty in the Middle East. Gold is often sought as a safe haven for investments in times of tension. Amax Gold Inc. was up 1, to 19, and Homestake Mining was up 1 1/8, to 23.
In over-the-counter trading, Survival Technology, whose business is medical injection technology, rose 1 1/4, to 14 1/2. The company said its shares gained on speculation that the United States military buildup in Saudi Arabia could increase demand for its nerve gas antidotes. It added that it was the only American-based supplier.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Security Prices Mixed

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were narrowly mixed in a session that effectively ended shortly after 1 P.M. yesterday, after a fire in lower Manhattan led to a widespread loss of electrical power.
The fire at the Consolidated Edison power plant just moments after the Treasury had conducted its weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills darkened trading screens and computers.
Had the fire not broken out, the auction would likely have been the highlight of an otherwise quiet summer Monday trading session.
''The market was lucky that the power outage happened on a day when not much was going on,'' said David R. Duerson, manager of government securities trading operations at the Security Pacific National Bank in Los Angeles. 
At the auction, bids on the three-month bills produced an average discount rate of 7.41 percent, up from the average rate of 7.23 percent at the sale a week ago.
 
Six-Month Bill Rates Up
Six-month bills were sold at an average rate of 7.31 percent, up from an average rate of 7.19 percent a week ago.
Trading in the secondary market for Treasury securities continued on a very limited basis after the fire. It all but ended at 3 P.M., Eastern time, when trading in bond futures contracts close on the Chicago Board of Trade.
''We tried to stay open in some limited capacity until the Board of Trade closed,'' said Bruce R. Lakefield, an executive vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities.
By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 99 17/32, down 1/32 point, to yield 8.79 percent, unchanged from late Friday.
Among note issues, the 8 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at 100 17/ 32, down 6/32, to yield 8.66 percent. And the 8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 6/32, up 3/32, to yield 7.89 percent.
The prices are quotes from a sampling of dealers by a New Jersey office of Telerate Inc., a subsidiary of Dow Jones & Company that provides price information electronically to market participants. The Telerate office was not affected by the power outage.
 
Pricing Extremely difficult
However, pricing securities was extremely difficult yesterday because three major interdealer brokers, the RMJ Securities Corporation, Fundamental Brokers Inc. and Cantor Fitzgerald & Company, were affected.
''The long end of the market is still very worried about oil prices and the Middle East,'' one government bond trader said. ''But the short end is likely to stay firm or do better because people are optimistic that the Fed will have to ease credit conditions to cope with a weaker economy.''
At the Chicago Board of Trade, the nearby September bond futures contract closed at 90 23/32, down 5/32 on the day.
''Developments in the Middle East will remain the key theme for some time,'' said Raymond W. Stone, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J. firm that provides research and commentary on developments in the foreign exchange and credit markets.
''But this week all eyes are on the economic data that will be released, beginning with the retail sales report this morning.'' On Thursday reports are due on the Consumer Price Index, industrial production, capacity utilization, housing starts and real earnings.
Mr. Stone and other analysts are projecting that retail sales rose by half a percentage point last month.
A more accurate barometer of consumer sentiment may be announced later in the day, however, when major auto makers are expected to report on how auto sales fared during the first 10 days of August.
''Those numbers will be the first piece of information we will have that bridges the oil price shock,'' Mr. Stone said.
''The sharp rise in prices had to do something to consumer confidence, and the numbers may show that consumers may be a little hesitant to purchase a car right now because with gasoline prices going up, they don't know what kind to buy.''
Although the severity of the fire's damage was unknown as market participants went home, many traders said they did not expect that activity would return to normal today. That could create difficulties if unexpected news develops.
''If we come in on Tuesday and the systems are still down, we could have a problem,'' Mr. Duerson said.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: Breeden Sees Industry Glut

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Aug. 13

 BODY:
The United States securities industry has ''substantial overcapacity'' that is similar to the overcapacity in the banking industry, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission said here today.
In a speech before the Atlanta Rotary Club, Richard C. Breeden noted that American banks had suffered loan losses of $80 billion in the last five years. 
''We see a situation as we look forward to the 1990's in which we have substantial overcapacity in banking, and, indeed, I think the same situation is generally shared in securities - at least if the pattern of trading volumes since the 1987 crash continues to be the case,'' Mr. Breeden said. ''We have all too many very large financial firms, but with extremely weak balance sheets.''
Mr. Breeden rated the performance of American financial markets during the Persian Gulf crisis as ''orderly.''
He said securities markets had already begun to react negatively to overall economic fundamentals before Iraq invaded Kuwait. ''Then when you have a specific event, you have an overlay over what is already an underlying economic assessment,'' he said.

Dollar Off Amid Prospects Of Higher Rates Overseas

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell yesterday against primary foreign currencies, which are expected to strengthen as interest rates rise overseas while those in the United States fall as monetary authorities try to avert the threat of a recession.
In New York, the dollar fell to 150.25 Japanese yen, from 150.40 yen late Friday. Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar rose to 150.65 yen, from 149.75 yen at Friday's close. In London, it fell to 150.35 yen. 
The dollar lost ground against the British pound. In New York, the pound rose to $1.8825, from $1.8735 late Friday. In London, sterling rose to $1.8842, from $1.8730 late Friday. The dollar fell to 1.5780 German marks, down from 1.5895 on Friday The dollar has been under pressure in recent weeks because of weakness in the American economy, and many traders expect the Federal Reserve eventually to move to lower interest rates to try to stimulate the economy.
But traders also expect rates to rise in Germany and Japan, as central banks there try to head off inflation because of rising oil prices.
The net effect would be to make the dollar less attractive to foreign investors.
''The only thing supporting the dollar is the flight to quality'' that is traditionally involved when international events are in turmoil, said Karen Gibbs, a senior financial analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
''The dollar is no longer perceived as quality - it's the Swiss franc, the Deutsche mark and the Australian dollar,'' she said.
Late dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late on Friday, included: 1.3165 Swiss francs, down from 1.3375; 5.2925 French francs, down from 5.3325; 1,156.25 Italian lire, down from 1,165.00, and 1.14625 Canadian dollars, down from 1.14705.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Friday's late rates, included: 1.5762 West German marks, down from 1.5895; 1.3160 Swiss francs, down from 1.3400; 5.2915 French francs, down from 5.3360; 1.7753 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7925; 1,156.00 Italian lire, down from 1,166.50, and 1.1475 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1476.

HEADLINE: Careers;
Executives Cautiously Optimistic

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
A survey on the views of American business leaders was released last week, and the findings indicated a ''guarded optimism'' about the economy. Because of the Middle East crisis, an update was quickly made to get the executives' reaction. They supported President Bush's stand.
The survey is the Chivas Regal Report on American Business Leaders: Executive Attitudes in a Time of Upheaval. Chivas Regal, a leading Scotch whisky brand, is a unit of Joseph E. Seagram & Sons. Last year it commissioned a similar study on American workers. 
Nicholas J. Tortorello, chairman of Research and Forecasts Inc. of New York, conducted this year's survey.
Mentioning the ''large dose of uncertainty'' that the managers find surrounding them, Mr. Tortorello pointed out that many were nonetheless reasonably optimistic. Even in the face of international turmoil and the possibility of a recession, many said they were not ready to alter earnings predictions for their companies.
More than half of the respondents are vice presidents, 20 percent are directors and another 20 percent are senior corporate officers. The survey found that their average household income was $186,000 and their average age slightly over 47 years. They had spent about 13 years with their companies.
Mr. Tortorello said he had little difficulty reaching the business leaders by telephone. ''Most people like to talk, if the questions are interesting and if they think they can learn something from organizing their thinking,'' he said. About 300 responded to the long questionnaire, which took an average of 24 minutes to complete.
The survey found that following years of mergers and downsizings, ''executives say they are working harder, have less job security and face more stress.'' Most are married, and the younger ones in particular said that at times of stress they talked to their spouses about business problems. Also, they believe exercise and participating in sports help at such times.
The day before announcing the results, the research firm telephoned 100 of the same respondents to get their views on the American reaction to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. About 78 percent approved of President Bush's stand. They even had some suggestions about what might be done if Iraq invaded Saudi Arabia - air strikes against Iraq, seizure of the Strait of Hormuz, and mining of Iraqi-controlled harbors.
As for the budget deficit and the savings and loan bailout, most of the executives said they thought Federal tax increases were likely, and a majority said they would be willing to pay higher taxes if the money went for special needs and was spent responsibly. At the same time, they gave ''a strong negative assessment of the Internal Revenue Service,'' contending that it operates ''abusively and inefficiently.'' Some 92 percent of those surveyed think tax laws are ''overly complicated and confusing.''
Looking ahead, most of the business leaders found ''disheartening'' the ''shortage of adequate candidates for the United States Presidency in the future.''
Many respondents had some military training and said the discipline helped them in their careers. In fact, the survey found ''a strong correlation between service as a commissioned officer and achievement of senior-level management positions.''
About 92 percent of those polled are college graduates, and more than half of these had some postgraduate study. In fact, top-level management increasingly shows more education credentials because college study became more available and important after World War II.
While the Chivas Regal questionnaire did not go into the professional backgrounds of the executives, a recent survey by Korn/Ferry International, the management recruiting firm, did make such a study.
As the nation's largest recruiting firm, it can tap into the thinking of many of its corporate clients, so it looked into the backgrounds of the executives now filling top jobs in this country.
''In 1979 when we conducted a similar study, finance and accounting were the fastest routes to the top,'' said Lester Korn, head of the recruiting firm.
Now, the firm found that marketing and sales were ''the quickest routes to the executive suites,'' with finance and accounting second and a general management background holding third place.
The respondents to the Korn/Ferry survey also took a look ahead and predicted that managers with marketing and sales skills would still be the leading source tapped for top management jobs in the year 2000. The primary reason is the growing acknowledgment of the importance of the consumer to business.

HEADLINE: BANKS' PAYMENTS TO INSURE DEPOSITS MAY JUMP BY 30%

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 14

 BODY:
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation moved today to raise the premiums banks pay for deposit insurance by $1.1 billion, or 30 percent, next year. The action reflects increased concerns about the safety of the deposit insurance system and about the effects of depressed real estate prices on commercial banks and the overall economy.
Although considered stronger than the sister fund that insures deposits at savings and loan associations, the reserves of the F.D.I.C.'s Bank Insurance Fund, as a percent of insured deposits, have reached the lowest level since the agency was created in the early 1930's. The fund is now at half the level Congress mandated last year in the savings and loan bailout legislation, and 1990 is expected to produce a third consecutive year of losses. 
''What we are trying to do is to assure that our fund moves back to the required level and that the burden not fall on taxpayers for any payment,'' said L. William Seidman, chairman of the F.D.I.C. ''We have a considerable way to go.'' #30-Day Comment Period The action today, a call for a 30-day period of public comment before a final vote by the agency's five-member board in late September, was the first step in a regulatory process that is all but certain to require banks to pay 19.5 cents in insurance premiums for every $100 of insured deposits. That would be up 30 percent from a scheduled 15 cents per $100.
The savings and loan bailout legislation signed a year ago had scheduled a premium increase for 1991 of 3 cents for each $100 of insured bank deposits, raising the premium as of next January to 15 cents, from the current 12 cents. The F.D.I.C. action today would add another 4.5 cents to that scheduled increase.
The move did not surprise bankers. During the last three months, Mr. Seidman has repeatedly warned that the bank fund is ''under considerable stress.'' Earlier this month, he predicted that the fund's reserves, now at $13 billion, could fall to $11 billion by the end of the year.
The increase is certain to squeeze the profits of banks in 1991. The industry's earnings are declining, and bankers are casting about both to sell unprofitable assets and find new, profitable businesses.
For consumers, the increase is likely to mean that the costs of many bank services, like charges for overdrafts and monthly fees on checking accounts, will be raised to cover the higher insurance premiums. The costs were likely to have risen in any case, to cover the original premium increase mandated by the savings and loan bailout legislation, but the move today may result in a bigger jump in customer charges.
Taken together, the 3-cent scheduled increase and the additional 4.5-cent proposed rise for each $100 of insured deposits would amount to a total of $1.9 billion more in insurance premiums in 1991.
 
'Fund Is Under Stress'
Many bankers called the increase in their premiums a necessary evil.
''It will certainly narrow profitability,'' said John F. Betar, legislative counsel for the Association of Bank Holding Companies. ''On the other hand, we have always advocated a strong deposit insurance fund. The fund is under stress.''
Janet Pavliska, chairman of the National Council of Savings Institutions, said, ''The Bank Insurance Fund has been under serious pressure in recent months and we understand the need for an increase in the premiums.''
She added: ''There are negatives. The higher costs add to already overburdened operating costs at a time when it is difficult to recoup the full amount of the increase.''
Mr. Seidman said the agency had considered an even larger premium increase, but decided on the advice of its lawyers that the 4.5 cents, on top of the scheduled 3-cent increase for 1991, was the most it could impose under provisions of the bailout legislation.
 
Savings Industry Had Complained
The action heartened some lobbyists for the savings and loan industry, who have complained for months that savings institutions must pay considerably higher premiums on deposit insurance than banks, giving banks a competitive advantage.
Savings and loans now pay 23 cents for each $100 of deposits - the most currently allowed by law.
Mr. Seidman said the aim of the agency was to begin rebuilding the reserves of the bank fund, to avoid the need for a taxpayer bailout like the hugely expensive rescue of the savings industry.
Under the bailout law passed last year, Congress set a goal for the bank fund of $1.25 of reserves for each $100 of insured deposits - a level that is considered adequate.
As recently as 1987, the fund's reserves were $1.10, but they fell to 80 cents in 1988 and 70 cents in 1989, and are projected to fall below 60 cents by the end of the year. Mr. Seidman said it would take at least five years to reach the $1.25 level, assuming the 19.5-cent premium.
''The level of reserves is historically low,'' Mr. Seidman said today, ''and the unfortunate trend in recent years'' has been downward.
''Clearly, this is unacceptable,'' he added, ''and a change in direction is needed.''
Mr. Seidman said that while the proposed increase would eat into the industry's profitability, the agency's staff had calculated that it would reduce overall bank earnings by only 4 percent.
 
Growing Real Estate Concerns
The action today was the latest indication that banking regulators are growing increasingly concerned about the toll that weak real estate markets are taking on banks.
Earlier this year, Mr. Seidman had predicted that the bank fund could break even in 1990, but in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee two weeks ago, he radically changed that projection to a loss of $2 billion. He also said then that this year, for the third year in a row, almost 200 banks would fail.
Analysts have said that the prediction of a $2 billion drop in the fund means the Government will spend $6 billion on failures this year. The agency will bring in $3 billion in income from premiums this year and another $1 billion in interest income.
Although Mr. Seidman has said he does not foresee the failure of a very large bank this year, many analysts say a $6 billion deficit would have to include the failure of a big bank, possibly one in New England, where a slumping real estate market has increased defaults on loans.
 
Problems Are Spreading
One indication that the agency is gearing up for greater real estate losses, particularly from bank failures in New England, is that it plans to open a liquidation office in Boston with a staff of more than 400.
The projected loss in the Bank Insurance Fund is also a sign of the breadth of the downturn in commercial real estate markets across the country. Mr. Seidman has warned that what began as regional weakness in the Northeast has spread to most parts of the country and that it will be a while before the markets turn up.
This is particularly alarming to regulators, because banks have plunged heavily into real estate lending in recent years. More than half of all new bank loans in the late 1980's were for real estate.

BUSH THREATENS A BLOCKADE OF JORDAN PORT AIDING IRAQ; KING COMES TO U.S. FOR TALKS

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Wednesday, Aug. 15

 BODY:
As truckloads of cargo rolled from the Jordanian port of Aqaba toward Baghdad today, King Hussein of Jordan arrived in Washington for a meeting with President Bush in an apparent attempt to mediate the worsening crisis in the Middle East.
Mr. Bush said at a news conference in Washington on Tuesday that if Aqaba was ''a hole through which commerce flows,'' the United States would blockade the port, which seems to be the only gap remaining in the international quarantine of Iraq. But the President also hinted that if Jordan cooperated with the embargo, the United States would help compensate it for the economic suffering that sanctions would cause.
 
Seeking Aid for Jordan
American officials said Tuesday that the United States was also pressing West Germany, Japan and Saudi Arabia to help offset financial losses by Jordan and by Syria.
The stated purpose of the Presidential news conference was to talk about the Federal budget, and Mr. Bush lambasted Democrats on Capitol Hill for their attitude in negotiations on the Federal deficit. [Page A21.] But the focus shifted to the Middle East. King Hussein is under domestic pressure to keep Aqaba open. Amman imports 90 percent of its oil from Iraq and sends 40 percent of its total exports to Iraq. In addition, Jordan's large Palestinian population is sympathetic to the Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein, whom they see as a champion of the have-nots. 
 
Doubts on Workable Formula
Reports in several Middle Eastern capitals said the King was carrying a letter to Mr. Bush from President Hussein, whom he met in Baghdad on Monday.
ABC News, in a report from Baghdad, said that Foreign Ministry officials said the letter conveyed that President Hussein would like direct contact with United States officials and a sign that negotiation remains a possibilty. CBS News, citing unnamed Jordanian sources, said the message called for an international conference to discuss terms for an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait in exchange for a freeze on the buildup of United States forces in Saudi Arabia, which has passed the 20,000 mark.
But two ranking Administration officials said they had no reason to believe that a workable peace formula would be produced by Mr. Bush's meeting with King Hussein, scheduled for Thursday at the President's vacation home in Kennebunkport, Me. The King arrived at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington early today.
Mr. Bush himself, speaking to reporters at the White House on Tuesday as he took a brief hiatus from his 25-day holiday, said he saw no prospects for a diplomatic solution to the crisis until sanctions had bitten deeply enough to convince the Iraqis ''that they've got to get out of Kuwait, and they've got to let the rightful rulers return to Kuwait.'' Iraq annexed Kuwait last week.
Although the President deflected questions on the subject, aides said he had agreed to try to work out a plan under which American warships and those of other nations, some already committed to the blockade and others not, could operate under United Nations auspices.
 
Idea Discussed at Meeting
The idea, first broached several days ago by the Soviet Union, was discussed at a meeting at the State Department among officials of the five nations with permanent seats on the Security Council - the United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France.
Mr. Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d were said to see the plan, which could involve a joint command or ships under separate commands all flying the United Nations flag, as an opportunity to involve Moscow in concerted international action, if complex problems of coordination could be resolved.
With American paratroopers moving into joint positions with Saudi soldiers to defend crucial oilfields, Pentagon officials said the Administration was considering a partial mobilization of the reserves. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told a veterans' group in Atlanta that the President had the authority to call up as many as 200,000 members of the National Guard or reserve forces.
Mr. Bush is to meet with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other officers at the Pentagon today before returning to Maine, and the question of the reserves could come up then.
 
U.S. Focuses on Aqaba
Although rules of engagement have not been issued for the blockade of Iraqi commerce, which the Administration prefers to call an interdiction, Mr. Cheney said that ''we are watching all traffic that may be headed for Iraqi ports or may have cargo intended for Iraq.'' Among a handful of ships under surveillance, officials said, is the Iraqi-flag Balqees, believed to be carrying a cargo of tanks, engines and other military equipment from Gdynia in Poland to an unknown port in the Middle East.
The biggest worry for those trying to complete the economic encirclement of Iraq is the port of Aqaba, which lies at the head of an arm of the Red Sea. It is linked to Baghdad by a highway and a small pipeline, the last functioning outlet for Iraqi oil.
During the Iran-Iraq war, much of Iraq's war materiel and food flowed through Aqaba. It is easily accessible to the Mediterranean Sea through the Gulf of Suez and the Suez Canal, which Egypt declined today to close to Iraqi shipping, although Cairo is the leader of the group of Arab nations that have sent troops to Saudi Arabia to deter an Iraqi invasion.
A dozen ships were berthed at Aqaba on Tuesday or anchored offshore. While it was impossible to establish the destination of all the cargoes, John Prescott, a London shipping specialist, said he had been told that at least three of the ships carried goods bound for Baghdad.
The Associated Press reported from the Ruweishid border post, on the main highway linking Baghdad and Aqaba, that an unusually large number of heavy trucks and tankers were crossing from Jordan into Iraq. Military officials in Washington confirmed that Iraqi trade through Aqaba appeared to be proceeding at a brisk pace.
Mutasem Belbeisi, an under secretary at the Jordanian Foreign Ministry, said that although the United Nations sanctions voted on Aug. 6 were binding on all member states, ''every country whose economy can be severely affected can consult with the Security Council to see what measures could be adopted and what sanctions could be imposed, if any.'' He said such consultations were under way in New York.
 
Israel to Take No Action
Israel, whose port of Eilat also lies at the head of the Gulf of Aqaba, just a few miles down the coast from Aqaba, said it would take no action to interefere with Iraqi shipping through Aqaba. Only if Iraqi troops move into Jordan, officials said, will Israel become involved in the crisis.
So far, the blockade, to which American, British and Australian vessels have been committed, has not had a significant test. Arab harbormasters in the Persian Gulf turned away two Iraqi freighters, and a British warship stopped a third merchant ship but released it when an inspection showed it to have no cargo.
The buildup of forces in Saudi Arabia accelerated further with the arrival of the vanguard of Syrian troops. The Syrians joined about 5,000 Egyptians, and contingents from Morocco and possibly Pakistan are expected within a week or so.
A total of at least 100,000 American ground troops is expected to reach Saudi Arabia in the next month or two, and Mr. Cheney said today that an Iraqi force of 200,000 was now deployed in Kuwait and southern Iraq.
In Kuwait and Iraq, at least 3,000 Americans, by the State Department's estimate, remained trapped.
Iraqi officials made conflicting statements about the status of the Americans and thousands of other foreigners. ABC News reported that a senior Foreign Ministry official in Baghdad called the Americans in Iraq ''restrictees'' who would have to remain until the crisis was over. And Iraq's Ambassador to Greece said in Athens that they could leave only when ''the threats from the United States and its allies have been eliminated.'' But the Iraqi Ambassador in Washington indicated that the release could come much earlier than that.

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf;
U.S. Remains at a Loss Trying to Predict Saddam Hussein's Next Move

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 14

 BODY:
Nearly two weeks after the Iraqi Army seized the desert sheikdom of Kuwait, the United States has little sense of what Saddam Hussein will do next.
Bush Administration officials are united in their assessment - even in their adjectives - that the Iraqi President is not a mad Arab warrior, but a tough-minded, ruthless opportunist who is more vulnerable now than at any time in his 22 years in power. But American intelligence on him is poor, and officials differ on whether or when he will strike next.
So far, the Iraqi President has shown no sign of abandoning his stranglehold on Kuwait or pulling his troops from the Saudi border. And in private conversations with Administration officials, two different theories of Mr. Hussein's intentions emerge. 
The more conventional theory is that he is an unpredictable figure who invaded Kuwait with no warning and that he might be just as willing to move against Saudi Arabia or provoke a conflict that would involve Israel.
 
'He Could Sit It Out'
According to that analysis, Mr. Hussein's overwhelming vulnerability in the face of American troops digging into the Saudi desert and the economic quarantine on Iraqi trade does not necessarily mean that he will turn pragmatic, conclude that he miscalculated badly when he invaded and annexed his neighbor and look for a face-saving exit. Mr. Hussein might just stay put and hope that the international resolve on sanctions weakens or that the Arab world might not keep its commitment of unity with Saudi Arabia.
''He's isolated in a way he never has been before and he's facing extraordinarily massive American military force,'' said a senior Administration official who has followed events in the Middle East for years. ''But that doesn't mean he will get out of it and not attack Saudi Arabia or turn his attention to Israel. No one knows that. Or he could sit it out, and hope the whole sanctions thing against him falls apart.''
The theory continues that Mr. Hussein is likely to continue to play to the streets of the Arab world to push Arab leaders into a compromise attractive to Iraq.
Mr. Hussein could try to provoke riots in Amman or in Cairo, perhaps with the help of Iraqi cash and agents posing as workers returning home from Iraq. On Monday, he opened up a radio station that beams messages to Egyptians to rise up against their Government. Or he could resort to terrorist acts intended to break down Arab resolve.
There is a second, less-popular theory within the Administration about Mr. Hussein's intentions, less popular because it would ultimately involve negotiations and could give the impression of rewarding the aggressor at a time when the United States is trying to act tough. Asked about negotiations in his news conference today, President Bush said that he saw no hope for a diplomatic solution, at least until economic sanctions force Mr. Hussein to pull back his army.
According to that theory, Mr. Hussein is a bully who invaded Kuwait because he calculated - wrongly it turned out - that it would be a quick, low-risk way of seizing the skeikdom's oil and wealth. Now, that argument goes, Mr. Hussein realizes he cannot move across the Saudi border.
''With each passing day the probability of an attack on Saudi Arabia lessens,'' said a senior Administration official who is watching events closely.
Mr. Hussein, the theory continues, is a man capable of compromise. His various justifications for invading Kuwait and his ''peace proposal'' on Sunday listing conditions for withdrawal from Kuwait may indicate that he is looking for a face-saving resolution.
 
About-Faces by Hussein
Experts on Iraq inside the Administration liken his situation today to that in 1975, when he did a dramatic about-face and recognized Iran's territorial claims to the Shatt al Arab waterway in return for Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi's promise to stop aiding Iraqi Kurdish rebels. Again, in 1982, when Iranian troops set foot on Iraqi soil, he abandoned his claim on Iran's Arab-speaking province of Khuzistan and desperately tried to end the border war he had started.
Despite public statements that the United States will not negotiate a settlement that would include concessions to Iraq, privately senior officials say a negotiated settlement might include free elections in Kuwait, and Arab financial support and some territorial concessions for Iraq.
If Iraq were to withdraw from Kuwait, that argument goes, the United States could settle for an Iraq confined to its borders, with Mr. Hussein still in power but with a long-term American military presence in the gulf.
The overthrow of Mr. Hussein is unlikely, and the destruction of his governing Baath Party impossible.
 
Ideas From Jordan's Leader
The Bush Administration may receive its first clear-cut indication of Mr. Hussein's intentions on Thursday, if King Hussein of Jordan delivers a message from the Iraqi President when he meets with President Bush. Senior policymakers privately have expressed the hope that the King, who has supported Iraq in the crisis, will provide some ideas for an eventual framework for a face-saving resolution.
But the King may not be able to offer any more insight into Mr. Hussein or his motives. Even officials who have followed his moves for years are mystified. ''He's clearly a tough, extraordinarily determined man,'' said a senior American diplomat with expertise on the Middle East. ''He's not in any way a maniac or out of his wits.''
But then, the official said, ''There are severe limitations in my own understanding of the man.''

HEADLINE: Taking Budget Offensive, Bush Accuses Democrats of Imperiling Economy

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 14

 BODY:
Saying the budget impasse at home deserved the same urgent attention as the crisis in the Persian Gulf, President Bush today dropped his gentleman's agreement with the Democratic leaders in Congress and accused them of endangering the economy by playing politics with the Federal deficit.
Accusing Congress of ''an abdication of responsibility that endangers our economic vitality and the jobs that go with it,'' the President termed the lack of a budget ''a real threat to the economic well-being of this country.''
Mr. Bush spoke at a news conference at the White House after a meeting with advisers who gave him an assessment of how the confrontation in the Middle East would affect budget negotiations between the Administration and Congress.
Trying to shift part of the nation's attention away from the the Persian Gulf, Mr. Bush began his news conference with a statement intended to satisfy the demands of his fellow Republicans that he take the offensive on the budget before the resumption of the talks early next month. 
 
'Process Has Broken Down'
''We're getting right down to the crunch,'' Mr. Bush said. He added, ''It is no secret to the American people that the Congressional budget process has broken down.''
The President has been saying he feels ''liberated'' to criticize the Democrats since a confidential Administration plan on taxes appeared in news reports last month. He blames Democrats for the disclosure and said the breach of the agreement to keep details of the budget negotiations secret allows him to take the offensive.
Presidential aides say Mr. Bush hesitated to do so last week because he did not want to strain the bipartisan support for his decision to send troops to Saudi Arabia.
The President has been smarting because the Democrats have managed to get an Administration proposal for taxes into the public debate without responding with any politically unpleasant proposals of their own.
 
Democrats Taken Aback
Democrats seemed taken aback by the tartness and timing of Mr. Bush's attack today.
''Frankly, we are flabbergasted at the President's remarks,'' said Ronald H. Brown, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee. ''At a time when all Democrats are hoping and praying for the success of the Administration's Persian Gulf policy, we do not understand why the President wants to divide Americans along partisan lines.''
Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, said: ''If there has been an 'abdication of responsibilities' on the budget, it has been on the part of the President.''
''Just a few months ago,'' Mr. Mitchell said, ''in his State of the Union address the President claimed that his proposed budget would reduce the deficit, meet the Gramm-Rudman target, and balance the budget by 1993, all with no new taxes. Every one of those statements was inaccurate, as he himself has now admitted.''
 
Threat of Vetos
The President warned that if there is still no budget agreement by Oct. 1, there would be a ''painful'' $100 billion cut in non-military spending programs, as required by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit-reduction law. He also threatened to veto ''any and every spending bill'' that he believed would stretch the budget beyond the limits imposed by the law.
''While they have the power of the purse,'' the President said of Congress, he has ''the power of the veto pen.''
''I'm still here in a nice tranquil mood, wanting to discuss it with them,'' Mr. Bush said, with a grin. ''But you see, we had this kind of a truce on this abiding by the Marquis of Queensberry's 'no comment' rules. And so, during this period of truce I'm going to put the focus where it belongs and where the American people year after year know it belongs, and that is on the party that controls the United States Congress.''
Mr. Bush renewed his attack on the Congressional budget process, calling it a ''procedural monstrosity,'' and arguing that ''nobody cares'' about Congress getting bogged down ''in the jurisdiction of this committee or another.''
Using a tried and true political technique, the President managed to blame the Democratic leadership of the House, including Speaker Thomas S. Foley and Richard A. Gephardt, the majority leader, by saying he was not going to do so.
''I'm not going to accuse Tom Foley of this or Dick Gephardt of this,'' he said, ''but I think there were some saying, 'Hey, we think we got the President over a barrel here. We've made him back away and give and give and give and get nothing.' And my view is, 'Well, fine, if that's the game that some up there want to play.' ''
 
Careful Selection of Facts
Both sides are carefully selecting their facts and emphasis to present the budget negotiations in the most favorable light for their side.
While the President asserted that Administration officials had refrained from ''divisive rhetoric'' on the budget, he was correct only in that they had not done so for public quotation. There have been several instances in which senior Bush Administration officials attacked Democrats in private sessions in which reporters had agreed not to quote them by name.
At the same time, the Democrats have yet to offer a specific alternative to the White House proposals.
Mr. Bush, who especially dislikes unauthorized policy disclosures, referred derisively today to the way an Administration plan that included some tax increases had ''oozed'' into news reports last month.
Senator Mitchell responded today by contending that it was a Republican negotiator who provided the information to reporters and noted that many Republicans as well as Democrats had criticized the plan.
''The President's anger at the leak of the Republican plan to the press by a Republican should not serve as justification for unfair and inaccurate criticisms of the Democrats,'' said Mr. Mitchell.
 
Top Budget Aides Absent
White House officials said Mr. Bush had returned to Washington from his vacation to discuss the budget with top advisers. But no new numbers or proposals were discussed at the meeting and the President could not answer afterward how much the deployment of American military forces to the Persian Gulf would cost.
Two of the pivotal figures on budget matters did not attend the meeting. Richard G. Darman, the budget director, was not at the White House and Nicholas F. Brady, the Treasury Secretary, did not come back from a Midwest campaign swing for Republican candidates.

HEADLINE: Excerpts of News Conference By Bush on Budget and Gulf

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Bush's news conference at the White House yesterday, as recorded by The New York Times:
 
OPENING STATEMENT
I know that the focus of the media attention today, and understandably, is on a crisis 6,000 miles away. But there's another important well-known longstanding crisis at home, and that's the failure of the budget process to produce a solution to this nation's deficit, terrible deficit.
And even while we address our critical international obligations, we must address that persistent, real need. And therefore, I want to just take a few minutes to talk about that.
Our current budget or lack thereof constitutes a real threat to the economic well-being of this country. And in this case the problem is a lack of action on the part of the Congress, and abdication of responsibility that endangers our economic vitality and the jobs that go with it. 
It is no secret to the American people that the Congressional budget process has broken down. Over the last couple of decades, we've seen the real problems of overspending. And we've seen the stalemate in budgeting, which is the result of internal Congressional conflicts and a committee system that is so complex that not only have the hard decisions been postponed or avoided, but today nearly all budget decisions are being finessed.
Previous Presidents have urged fundamental reform, fundamental budget reform. And we can all remember President Reagan slamming down that massive continuing resolution, and yet Congress has failed to straighten out this procedural monstrosity. As a result the deficit continues to grow. And with the growing threat such deficit spending poses, I took the initiative in May in calling on the Democratic Congressional leaders to join me in a bipartisan summit on the budget.
And the success of this summit is essential to insure the economic health of the nation, to resolve once and for all the deficit dilemma and in doing so to avoid the painful sequester cuts which will occur without an agreement.
 
Move to Jump-Start Budget Talks
As the talks flagged, I acted to jump-start them. And you're all familiar with that. When the Democrats sought to hold the talks hostage over new revenues, I made a very difficult decision to put everything, including taxes, on the table to make those budget talks succeed.
And to keep those budget talks going, the Administration kept - I feel I kept my share of the bargain - the Administration refrained from divisive rhetoric. We worked in earnest. We held meeting after meeting without any preconditions, and emphasized the need above all for progress to put a budget package together.
We offered billions in additional spending cuts even as Congressional committees were voting out spending bills that would bust the budget. Only July 26, both sides agreed to put budget plans on the table. We again had a complete proposal ready for negotiation. And after weeks of good-faith negotiating, we expected, we honestly believed there would be a specific Democratic plan in exchange.
And while the summit failed to move forward with specific solutions, the Congress continued with counterproductive legislation. For example, the House has already passed 10 appropriations bills, eight of which exceed my request for discretionary spending by $14 billion, and are $25 billion higher than the budget for last year.
And the Senate is asking the taxpayers now put up another $150 million to finance election campaigns of Congress. And let me be clear on that one: I oppose adding this kind of taxpayer financing of Congressional elections, and I'm going to veto any such bill that appears on my desk.
Now Congress is now on recess. And 100 days after I called on Democrats and Republicans in the Congress to work with me toward a bipartisan solution, I note, frankly in sadness, that after three full months the Democrats have yet to offer one single proposal at the budget summit.
 
Focus on Democrats in Congress
And I've been reluctant to go public in this matter. We've dealt in good faith with the leaders. We have played by the rules. And now it is up to the Democrats who control Congress. It is up to the Democrats in Congress.
And I stand ready to work on this process as long as it takes to get a five-year package which solves the problem. And I have postponed what I think was a very important September trip to Latin America so as to focus on this issue. And there are, however, a number of specific realities to be noted.
First, it's the Congress that has the responsibility to pass a budget. And while they have the power of the purse, like any power -President, I've got the power of the veto pen. And I will use that pen to veto any and every spending bill that busts the budget.
And second, if no budget is agreed - no agreement is reached, that means a sequester on Oct. 1 of about $100 billion. And painful as such deep cuts would be, I must uphold the law, I'm determined to manage them as best I can, knowing that I've done all in my power to avoid them.
And so, the Democrats in Congress should know that if it comes to sequester, they'll will bear a heavy responsibility for the consequences.
And third, if the Congress really wants economic growth and increased Government revenues, the place to start is not with tax increases, but with incentives for growth, investment in jobs. And again I cite the capital gains area as one that would stimulate and be investment oriented.
And fourthly, the Congress must recognize the utter failure of their budget process to control spending. It's got to be reformed. The process has to be reformed.
And fifth, our budget must maintain a defense posture consistent with the demands on American leadership in the world and in the dangers we face.
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Blockade and Annexation
Q. Mr. President, I have a two-part question. After successfully internationalizing opposition to the Iraqi aggression through the U.N., why did you jump the gun and unilaterally order a blockade, upsetting other members? And two, is the U.S. policy against the annexation of captured lands in the Middle East an across-the-board policy with the U.S.?
A. Upsetting? I don't think we've upset members on our policy of interdiction. We are acting within our legal rights, and I don't think - I think the world wants to see these Chapter 51 sanctions carried out. And that's the role that the United States is trying to do.
Q. But you didn't go through the step-by-step with Chapter 7.
A. Well, we're doing it the way our attorneys and others around the world recommend. And I think we're doing it properly. And I hope we're doing it to the degree that all ships will turn back if they're - if they're in contravention of the U.N. action.
Q. How about the last --
A. The last, what was that?
Q. Opposition to annexation of conquered lands.
A. Well, I can only address myself in the current - currently. I don't know whether there are any exceptions or not. But I know that annexation, if this is what one calls this invasion of Kuwait, is unacceptable. And that is - it won't stand.
 
Jordan and Iraqi Sanctions
Q. Mr. President, Jordan says that it's abiding by the U.N. sanctions, yet truckloads of goods are rolling through Jordan into Iraq coming from the port of Aqaba. Do you think that Jordan is subverting the sanctions, and what will you do about it?
A. Well, before I answer your question, I ought to let King Hussein tell me whether -you know what is happening - and if a country is not, is permitting a flow of commerce, it would be in violation of the sanctions. But I -you know he's coming here and I'll have a chance to talk to him and explain the U.S. view, though I'm pretty sure he understands it clearly.
Q. Let me ask you, what do you think about King Hussein's charges that the American forces in the Persian Gulf have created an explosive situation.
A. I don't know what he means by that, but I don't agree with that. I think we are there not to have the situation explosive but to supplement fully what the United Nations has done in condemning this outrageous aggression, so we'll discuss that one, too. It's going to be an interesting conversation, I'd say, if you're writing his agenda for him.
 
Reason for King Hussein's Visit
Q. Why is King Hussein coming when he called to ask you that he'd like to come? His brother has told reporters in Jordan that one of Jordan's problems is it would suffer so, economically, if it abided by the sanctions. They complained that they had no guarantees or assurances from the West. What can you offer?
A. Maybe that's what he wants to talk about. I hope it is. Because clearly we've always been a friend of Jordan. We've helped them in the past. We'd help them in the future, if they fulfill their obligations here. But I, Anne, I can just tell you what he told me on the telephone yesterday when he called. He said I'd like to come over and talk about the whole situation. There was no agenda; there was no discussion of any support for action of that kind.
Q. But you are willing to support him economically or have other countries in the region help him?
A. I think we would, provided Jordan joined these other countries in fulfilling these sanctions, obligations under the sanctions.
 
Outlook on Diplomatic Solution
Q. Mr. President, is there any hope at all of a diplomatic solution to this crisis?
A. I don't see it right now. But as the sanctions begin to take effect, and it's going to take a while, I would hope there would be a diplomatic solution to this crisis.
Q. But, sir, like the other day when Saddam Hussein offered his proposal, which I realize was totally unacceptable to you, I mean, could that serve as a basis for perhaps some type of negotiation?
A. I don't think just any proposal serves as a basis for negotiation. No, I couldn't, I don't see enough positive elements there to think that that would be a basis for a negotiation at all. It was bringing all extraneous problems and it did not address itself to the fundamental problem, which is that they took over Kuwait and that they've got to get out of Kuwait. And they've got to let their rightful rulers return to Kuwait. So I don't see that as a, you know, possibility to negotiate from that, those proposals at all.
 
U.N. Command in Action on Iraq
Q. Mr. President, you have ambassadors coming to the State Department presumably to discuss a U.N. multinational quarantine or interdiction, whatever word you want.Is it now the policy of the United States to potentially submit to a joint U.N. command or to reflag U.S. ships under a U.N. command?
A. That is not the plan right now, but we are talking to see how we can make this naval presence most effective. But that, what you said there, is not the policy of the United States.
Q. Well, sir, may I ask do you consider in any way - there are reports out of the U.N. that there is some criticism that you have acted unilaterally and perhaps outside your legal authority in this de facto blockade that's going on. Do you consider that you've had your hand slapped, or do you think --
A. No, I don't think so at all.
 
Sharing Costs of Operation
Q. Mr. President, given the staggering, given the staggering number in the deficit and the cost of the military operation in the gulf and in Saudi Arabia, doesn't it make sense that some of the countries that are relying on us will pay some of the cost? I'm thinking, of course, of Japan, Germany, France, Italy. Shouldn't they pay some of the cost of our troops over there?
A. I think that we will find a very cooperative spirit in that regard from countries. I'm convinced, from a good talk I had - I think it was yesterday - with Prime Minister Kaifu - that the Japanese are more than ready to entertain proposals along those lines. I've not talked to Kohl about that recently. France, of course, has vessels and are spending funds on their own right now, but I think you'll find - I think we'll have a cooperative - cooperative effort here, some on the financial side, some on the military and shipping side.
Q. What about the Saudis themselves? They're the most direct beneficiaries?
A. Yes, I think the Saudis will do their part in helping out along the way. I'm confident of that. And I also would say - the question hasn't yet been asked - that I am also confident that other countries will make up the shortfall in production that comes about from Iraqi oil, and Kuwaiti oil, not going to market. I can't give you the details on that, but I've had enough conversations with people around the world. Jim Baker has as well -General Scowcroft - to feel that things are moving in the right direction there. Yeah, John?
 
Americans Held by Iraqis
Q. Mr. President, the Iraqis have now held Americans for 12 to 13 days. Are you willing to sacrifice those Americans should it come to direct military action?
A. I'm never willing to sacrifice the life of any American. Sacrifice? No.
Q. Do you believe the Iraqis are using those Americans as a shield against potential American --
A. I don't have that feeling now, and I hope I never come to that because you see difficulty of others getting out and so it's a - but it's a troubling situation when people are held against their will or delayed from leaving. It troubles me.
Q. What's their status in your view?
A. Status is inconvenienced people who want to get out and it's not only them but a lot of others. And I hope that it doesn't become more than that. I have no reason to think at this juncture that it will. But the more we talk about it and the more we speculate about it, the less helpful it is, I think. But I'd like to feel that all foreigners who want to leave Kuwait or want to leave Iraq would be free to do so. And there have been some encouraging statements - you heard from their Ambassador this morning - that make me say, well, let's see, let's wait and see on that one.
 
U.S. Presence in Saudi Arabia
Q. Mr. President, should the American people look forward to an ongoing American presence in Saudi Arabia over a period of years?
A. I don't know about a period of years, but certainly we're going to be there long enough to get the job done.But I can't, I'd like to give you a time frame. I can't.
 
Iraqi Withdrawal From Kuwait
Q. Mr. President, just very briefly, you have called repeatedly for the Iraqis to be out of Kuwait, to withdraw unconditionally and completely. You've helped put sanctions in place to try and force them to do that.How important is that withdrawal? Is it important enough that if the sanctions don't seem to work after a short period that you will promise to use military force to force Saddam Hussein out.
A. That is too hypothetical a question. We have a plan, and the plan is to implement fully the United Nations's sanction and also a part of our plan is to - arrangement with King Fahd is to help protect Saudi Arabia in a part of a multinational force now of quite a few countries against aggression from Saddam Hussein, the same kind of aggression that took over Kuwait. So that's where we are. That's the plan, and I just can't help you by going in a hypothetical sense any further.
Listen, I hate to run, but I do have an appointment in here, and thank you very much.

HEADLINE: Congress Acts to Admit More Skilled Immigrants

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 14

 BODY:
In a step long favored by free-market economists, Congress is moving to admit more skilled immigrants - scientists, engineers, medical technicians - to compensate for expected labor shortages in the 1990's.
The number of immigrants selected on the basis of their job skills, now about 23,000 a year, would rise to more than 85,000 under a bill passed by the Senate. The number would be 75,000 under a companion bill moving through the House of Representatives.
Congress, the Labor Department and many researchers see the admission of permanent immigrants, not temporary workers, as a way to correct the mismatch between labor supply and demand. 
The notion has aligned free-market economists with immigrant-rights advocates in support of increased immigration, giving more weight to job skills in selecting newcomers. But it may also revive an old debate over the role of immigrants in the economy, including their effects on the job prospects of members of minorities already here.
 
New View on Immigrants
For decades, it was assumed that immigrants took jobs from Americans and depressed wages and working conditions in industries where they were concentrated. But increasingly, research suggests that immigrants create jobs and pay much more in taxes than they get in social welfare benefits.
''The debate has definitely shifted,'' said Representative Bruce A. Morrison, Democrat of Connecticut, who, with Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, is leading the campaign for immigration legislation designed to tap needed job skills. ''In the past, few people focused on legal immigration as an economic issue. But a growing body of evidence shows that immigration creates jobs and stimulates demand. You need a growing economy to produce jobs for unemployed workers, and labor shortages can be a barrier to economic growth.''
The Senate has passed a bill revamping the system for choosing immigrants. Mr. Kennedy, who is chairman of both the Committee on Labor and Human Resources and the Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, said his bill ''recognizes future U.S. labor needs, especially for skilled professionals.''
The House Judiciary Committee approved Mr. Morrison's similar bill on Aug. 1, just before the Congressional recess, and the measure is likely to win approval from the full House. Its fate may depend on whether the Bush Administration works actively for or against it.
 
Administration's Position
The Administration says it supports ''a modest increase in the number of legal immigrants'' and prefers the Senate bill over the House version.
The Senate bill includes a point system for assessing would-be immigrants. Points would be awarded for education, occupational training, work experience and age, with credit going to those in 21 to 44 years old. Under current law, most immigrants qualify for visas because of their family connections. While not diminishing preferences for relatives of United States citizens and permanent resident aliens, the Senate and House bills would increase the number of immigrants chosen for their job skills.
The United States has been admitting about 500,000 immigrants a year, not counting refugees. Under the Senate bill, the number would rise to 630,000 a year. The House bill would permit an increase to 775,000. The additional visas would be made available to workers, their spouses and children and the relatives of United States citizens and permanent resident aliens.
The number of skilled workers wishing to migrate to the United States far exceeds the number of available visas, so there is a waiting list of several years in some countries.
 
Labor Backs House Version
The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations supports Mr. Morrison's bill, in part because it would establish stricter criteria for admission of temporary foreign workers.
A report for the Labor Department by the Hudson Institute, ''Work Force 2000,'' has popularized the idea that labor shortages threaten the United States' ability to compete in world markets. The study said the United States population and work force would grow more slowly in the 1990's than at any time since the 1930's. ''The fastest-growing jobs will be in professional, technical and sales fields requiring the highest education and skill levels,'' it said.
Under current law, the United States annually admits about 23,000 immigrants chosen on the basis of their job skills. Demetrios G. Papademetriou, director of immigration policy and research at the Labor Department, said that 44 percent of those foreign workers obtained their visas for jobs requiring ''low skills and education.'' Many are domestic workers, cooks and hotel and restaurant workers.
Under the Kennedy bill, such unskilled workers would have much more difficulty obtaining visas, Mr. Papademetriou said. Under the Senate bill, the United States would still admit many immigrants from the third world, but those chosen on the basis of their job skills would, in general, have more formal education and training than those who now get such visas.
 
Concern About Unskilled
Many businesses say it is cheaper and easier to import foreign-born professionals than to invest in the education and training of unskilled, poorly educated Americans. Some blacks, like Milton D. Morris, research director at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a research institute, express concern that ''if we turn too quickly to immigrants to meet labor-market needs, we might be sidestepping our responsibility to develop the human resources of people already here.''
Under the House bill, companies with 50 or more employees would have to pay a fee of $500 to $1,000 for each foreign worker they hire. The proceeds would be used to educate and train American workers.
Economists as diverse as Milton Friedman and John Kenneth Galbraith subscribe to the emerging consensus that ''the long-run benefits of immigration greatly exceed any short-run costs,'' as President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers said this year.
With the birth rate relatively low, immigration now accounts for 27 percent of population growth in the United States, and the Census Bureau says it will account for a steadily growing share in the next two decades. Even with no increase in admission quotas, immigration would have a major impact on the composition of the American labor force.
At the same time, the politics of immigration is changing. Rick Swartz, an immigraton lawyer here, said: ''The pro-immigration coalition is expanding. In 1980, it involved churches, Hispanic and Asian groups and civil rights lawyers. Today it also includes major corporations, industry associations and conservative think tanks like the Heritage Foundation and the Hudson Institute.''

HEADLINE: Use the United United Nations

 BODY:
The first sour note has sounded in President Bush's exemplary management of the Persian Gulf crisis. He is faulted for unilaterally ordering naval interdiction of Iraqi ports without waiting for United Nations support. Though Mr. Bush acted legally, the criticism is valid. He can best respond by working with the Security Council to create a joint U.N. command to enforce mandatory economic sanctions against Iraq. 
The chief reason Mr. Bush has not gone that route is Pentagon skittishness about practical difficulties, like winning rapid agreement on rules of engagement for a multinational force. But the benefits so obviously outweigh the difficulties that a prompt course correction is in order. Indeed, Secretary of State Baker is making that case, evidently with some success.
The U.N. has surprised even itself with the unanimity and vigor of its response to Iraq's lawless grab of Kuwait. The Security Council has voted tough mandatory sanctions and refused to countenance Baghdad's annexation of a tiny neighbor. Crucial to this consensus has been the support of the Soviet Union, which also favors a multinational force.
The President had ample legal grounds to move on his own. Kuwait's deposed rulers asked the U.S. to help enforce a U.N. embargo. As Mr. Bush noted yesterday, his response was consistent with the U.N. Charter. But as a matter of policy, the better course would have been to strive for Security Council approval first. It is far from clear that moving so fast has won him advantages that outweigh the cost of bypassing the Security Council and its permanent members.
The political case for joint action is compelling. A multinational fleet in the gulf, flying a U.N. flag, can blunt Saddam Hussein's most powerful propaganda weapon: anti-Americanism. It can offer a protective umbrella to Arab rulers now being assailed as foreign accomplices and Israeli stooges. And success in the gulf would serve powerfully to deter future transgressions.
Indeed, the United States has now decided to support a Soviet suggestion for reactivating the U.N.'s moribund Military Staff Committee. This was the instrument envisioned by the charter for carrying out military operations under the command of the Security Council's permament members. Superpower rivalry neutralized this useful entity after the bitter Soviet experience in the Korean War. Taking advantage of a Soviet walkout, America won a U.N. mandate for the forces in Korea.
President Bush deserves credit for his energy and skill in mobilizing the collective global response to Iraq's aggression. And the U.S. buildup in Saudi Arabia has been swift and efficient. But it is the truly united United Nations that has emboldened Arab states to add their troops to a multinational army. Americans have every reason to press for a similar collective effort at sea.

HEADLINE: Mr. Rinfret on Garbage

 BODY:
Pierre Rinfret, the Republican gubernatorial candidate, believes that one way to give plausibility to his quixotic campaign against Gov. Mario Cuomo is to offer dramatically unconventional solutions to New York State's problems. He now proposes to resolve the struggle over landfills and incinerator sites by allowing local communities to bid for the right not to have them. That's certainly an original idea. It's also nonsense.
The winners in any such auction would assuredly be the wealthier counties and municipal governments. Poorer upstate communities would stand little chance against the resources of, say, Scarsdale, Bronxville, Rye and other well-heeled communities in Westchester County. What Mr. Rinfret proposes is to give the destructive principle of Nimby - Not in My Backyard - the imprimatur of market economics.
The plan also oversimplifies a hugely complex problem. To the dismay of many other states, New York already exports 11 percent of its trash, in part because existing landfills are closing for environmental reasons. Any plausible solution to the solid waste crisis requires a larger strategy combining recycling, waste-to-energy plants and equitable siting of landfills.
Mr. Rinfret is quite right to suggest that Albany has no such strategy now; but putting trash up for auction is hardly the answer. One environmentalist calls his proposal ''the worst case of toxic imperialism I've ever heard of.''
It also contradicts other aspects of his environmental program. In the same speech, Mr. Rinfret criticized proposals to limit development in the Adirondacks because they would be unfair to local residents. But those same cash-poor residents would almost certainly wind up as the reluctant recipients of other people's garbage.

HEADLINE: Immigrants Help Others Lost in Maze

BYLINE: By KAREN De WITT

 BODY:
Sung Soo Kim, a native of South Korea, does not know Esther Cartagena, formerly of Puerto Rico, or Philippe Wilson Desir, formerly of Haiti. But in their adopted city, they each serve a similar role: helping to guide compatriots recently arrived from their homelands through the bureaucratic maze that governs social services, the education of their children and how they do business.
Immigration experts say those guides and others like them are in greater demand than ever before, as New York City adjusts to its third great wave of immigration since the middle of the 19th century.
The latest influx, which began in the 1960's, approaches 100,000 immigrants a year. About 2.6 million people, or one-third of the city's population, are estimated to be foreign-born. 
''The new immigrant needs a broker to help navigate the public bureaucracies,'' said Lido Tomasi of the Center for Migration Studies on Staten Island. ''Today the Federal and state governments play a direct fiscal role where 100 years ago they weren't players. The 1986 amnesty situation, outreach to the undocumented, direct involvement of state agencies to provide English language classes, that kind of involvement is relatively new.''
 
'Parties Are Less Important'
Years ago political parties were an important source of and conduit to jobs for new immigrants.
''That's changed now so that parties are less important, and what you have is publically funded social service agencies,'' said Josh De Wind, a professor of anthropology at Hunter College. ''People who are representative of immigrant groups try to become social service providers by making application for reading programs, health programs and things like that or just knowing about them.'' Mr. Kim is one such person. Five years ago, Mr. Kim, a former political science professor at the University of Seoul, formed the Korean American Small Business Service Center of New York Inc. Since then he has sponsored more than 30 seminars on the ins and outs of doing business in the United States.
Out of his tiny second-floor office in Flushing, Queens, packed with books on New York City and state business codes, Mr. Kim tries to clarify, amend and decode for his fellow countrymen the labyrinth of laws that govern how they and other small merchants do business. Below is his constituency: Korean-American greengrocers, dry cleaners, nail parlor operators and deli owners.
Mr. Kim said that Korean shopkeepers, often touted as model immigrants because of their business acumen, often end up handing out much of their profit in fines, often because they know neither the rules nor their rights of appeal. Spilling off Mr. Kim's desk and out of folders are pamphlets he produced in Korean on everything from how to read a water meter to how to make a profit.
Though much of his day is spent wielding phones and searching documents, the 50-year-old Mr. Kim is just as likely to find his work out on the streets during a luncheon break. Recently on Roosevelt Avenue, he had just such a situation.
'' 'The usual problems. The usual reasons.' Do you hear him? 'The usual.' What is this 'usual'?'' Mr. Kim repeated like a litany Environmental Control Board Superintendant J. G. Kennelly's explanation for checking the dimensions of two fruit and vegetable stands at the Big Apple greengrocer on Roosevelt Avenue for the second time in two weeks.
 
Government's Tape Measures
Sun Yong Back, 35, who works in the shop his family owns, stood mute while Mr. Kim argued.
Mr. Kennelly knew Mr. Kim from seeing him at hearings, but he and Inspector Frank Merlo had their work to do and their tape measures out. Each stand should take up no more than 10 by 4 feet of space. The stands were a foot or so larger than the limit.
Mr. Kim told Mr. Back that he would go down to appeal. Maybe it would work, maybe it wouldn't, but he had been effective in the past.
Last November, after eight months of negotiating, Mr. Kim saved the greengrocers $1.5 million when he persuaded the city's Environmental Control Board to halve $3 million in fines for dirty sidewalks and sanitary violations. Some storekeepers owed as much as $70,000 because they hadn't appealed the fines. ''These people work 12 and 14 hours six days a week,'' said Mr. Kim. ''They cannot shut their stores to go down and appeal this overenforcement.''
Mr. Kim wants the city to institute night appeals court for such violations. He also wants to change the standards. ''These stand regulations were established in the 1930's. What hasn't changed since then? Everything but these laws.''
Mr. Kim sees political action as the best way to solve the group's problems. ''It's not just the A B C's that we need, but teeth and muscle. That comes through political involvement.'' But Mr. Kim isn't hopeful that his community will assert itself in the political arena any time soon.
''People say they don't have time or they don't want to make trouble. They're too busy making a living, trying to get an economic foothold in this country. Leave it to the next generation, they say, but I say that we should be doing both now,'' said Mr. Kim.
Mr. Kim's counterpart in Brooklyn is Mr. Desir, a former lieutenant in Haiti's coast guard.
 
Radio Voice for Haitians
Earlier immigrants depended on fliers or newspapers in their native languages to keep up with affairs at home. More often today it is radio and television that link ethnic communities.
Thousands of Haitian immigrants know Mr. Desir through the nine and a half hours of community affairs programming he broadcasts each week on New York City radio stations.
As a result, dozens of people go to his small storefront on Eastern Parkway in the Crown Heights section each week looking for everything from news about the latest political shifts in Haiti to a translation of a French document into English.
The walls of the triangular shop are covered with Haitian paintings and awards from Haitian emigre associations. On a recent day, several people sat on metal folding chairs waiting for Mr. Desir, who was late because he had to see his family off at the airport.
The air was filled with the quiet murmur of French and Creole, but the office came alive with the arrival of Mr. Desir, a compact man with a sleepy-eyed, dour expression.
 
An Assurance in Creole
Before he could get into the door, a man politely accosted him on the street, gesturing to a woman who was standing a few feet away.
In Creole, Mr. Desir assured the man that he would help the woman with her immigration problem.
''This is my neighborhood. This is my territory,'' said Mr. Desir, who is president of the Alliance of Haitian Emigres in Brooklyn. ''Anything I can do to help, I do.''
Mr. Desir fled to the United States with his family in 1970. After Haiti's first elections in 30 years were canceled amid terrorism at the polls in 1987, it was to Mr. Desir's office that many immigrants retreated to find out the fate of relatives still in Haiti.
On the Lower East Side of Manhattan, recent arrivals from Puerto Rico, a commonwealth of the United States, soon hear about Esther Cartagena, the woman who can help them find ''little jobs.''
''I think of myself as an example of what anybody can do,'' said Mrs. Cartagena, 44, who recently took a job as director of the Department of Puerto Rican Community Affairs, an agency of Puerto Rico. ''Look around. What are the needs? What can people do.''
Mrs. Cartagena worked for several years for the Lower East Side Housing Coalition and began her informal job-referral service there.
 
'Looking for Esther'
''I had so many meetings to go to and other women at the meetings were like me. They'd run in and say, 'I had to leave my kids by themselves, so I'll be getting up to call them a lot during this meeting.' We had so much guilt. Then one day I realized that one of the people who came to my office, a woman who had only a welfare check and a Social Security check, she could do a bit of babysitting.
''Or many of the landlords would tell me that they had to raise the rent because they had to paint. And I'd say 'Hey, if I can get you some people to paint who won't cost so much, maybe you won't have to raise the rent so much.' So I'd say to some unemployed men, listen guys, here you can make some money painting. They would do the work for less money than a regular contractor.
''This wasn't my job, but people started looking for Esther.''
Mrs. Cartagena says she believes in immigrants' getting jobs in their neighborhoods because it eliminates traveling costs, provides needed service to the community and frequently does not require knowledge of English.
''It doesn't have to be a big job, or a full-time job, just a job,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Once a Hotel Desert, Times Square Blooms

BYLINE: By PAUL GOLDBERGER

 BODY:
Times Square, which has been a near-wasteland for hotels since the Beaux-Arts splendor of the Astor met the wrecker's ball in the 1960's, is now at the center of a virtual tide of new hotels. Coming in the wake of a wave of high-rise construction on the West Side, two brand-new skyscraper hotels, the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza on Broadway at 49th Street and the Hotel Macklowe on West 44th Street just east of Broadway, have opened in the last few months. A third new high-rise hotel, the Embassy Suites at the corner of 47th Street and Seventh Avenue, will open in September.
Together with the Marriott Marquis, which opened in 1985 on Broadway between 45th and 46th Streets, they hold the potential to make Times Square a locus for visitors to New York in a way that it has not been for a generation.
Joining with those new buildings is the renovated Paramount on West 46th Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenue. The hotel, once the Century Paramount, has been redone by the French designer Philippe Starck for the hotelier Ian Schraeger as a budget version of Morgans and the Royalton, the innovative hotels Mr. Schraeger created with his late partner, Steve Rubell. The Paramount has remained open throughout its renovation, and the Starck-designed guest rooms are now all complete; the new lobby, restaurants and public rooms were completed yesterday. 
Though it is the one Times Square project that is not a completely new building, the Paramount, which is part of Mr. Schraeger's Morgans Hotel Group, is the one that holds out the most promise as a work of design and architecture: Mr. Starck's rooms, which begin at $90 a night, have a kind of sensual chic to them. The low price has meant that the rooms are small and tight (the configuration of the original rooms at the Paramount, built as a middle-class hotel, was left intact to keep renovation costs down) but they have the same aura of crispness and sensuality that marked Mr. Starck's rooms at the much more expensive Royalton a few blocks to the east.
The lobby is shaping up to be a handsome, wonderfully proportioned space of richly colored marble and cool gray plaster, its rear marked by a canted wall of silver against which a staircase slices its way up. The work of Mr. Starck, who was aided here by the architect Anda Andrei, has always had a curious mix of theatrical flamboyance and modernist discipline, playing on the swoops and curves and colors of 1950's modernism and integrating those things into a kind of 1980's sensibility.
This lobby manages to be sumptuous yet restrained, and with its brand-name concessionaires - a restaurant by Brian McNally, a take-out gourmet shop by Dean & DeLuca - it may feel to many visitors as if SoHo has drifted three miles uptown.
 
Better From the Inside
No more characteristic of the seedy, faded elegance that is the traditional image of Times Square is the lobby of the Hotel Macklowe on West 44th Street. This lobby is a spectacular interior set within a mediocre new tower of dark green glass on a stone base that appears to have been designed for another building altogether. If ever there was a building in Manhattan where it is better to be inside looking out than outside looking in, it is the Hotel Macklowe. Here, one of Manhattan's most banal outsides hides one of its most appealing new insides.
The building was designed by the firm of Perkins & Will along with the architect William Derman, the head of the design staff of the hotel's developer, Harry Macklowe, who gained some notoriety five years ago when a contractor hired by one of his companies illegally demolished a single-room-occupancy hotel on this new building's site.
Mr. Derman himself did the interiors, and they are among the city's most impressive and sophisticated new public spaces. The lobby, a mix of marble, metal and mahogany, comes closer than any space since the renovated Rainbow Room to evoking the spirit of New York City in the 1930's - not literally as it was in the 30's, but how it would have been had the image of the city from the movies existed in real life.
 
Homage to the City
There are hints of Viennese turn-of-the-century modernism in this space, echoes of Rockefeller Center in the gray and black carpeting and columns and stairs, and even, in the handsomely matched mahogany of the hotel's conference center lobbies, allusions to the grill room at the Four Seasons.
In a sense this hotel is a kind of homage to the best of New York, or at least to the best of New York's 20th-century architecture: it manages to feel the way a New York hotel ought to feel, to emit a sense of belonging in New York and not, like so many other hotels, of having been dropped onto Manhattan from another planet. The Marriott across Broadway from the Hotel Macklowe, for example, always felt like an oversize UFO from Atlanta; it seems made for swarms of visiting conventioneers who like the fact that its massive size means they can spend their days going up and down the glass elevators and will never have to march onto the city's streets.
The lobby of the Macklowe, by contrast, looks like the sort of place where you would expect to find other New Yorkers, as the Algonquin was in its heyday, or as the Royalton has to some extent become. There are surely no tourists gawking at the glass elevators here; the elevators at the Macklowe are splendid cabs of mahagony and metal, crafted to evoke the same sense of idealized Manhattan elegance that the lobby does. They may well be the best wooden elevator cabs of any Manhattan tower since the Chrysler Building.
The second and third floors of the hotel contain a large conference center with meeting rooms that look more like sleek corporate boardrooms than anything usually found in a hotel. Joined to this area will be the old Hudson Theater next door to the Macklowe, which is being restored and will reopen this fall as the hotel's main auditorium and meeting space.
It is only in the guest rooms, unfortunately, that the dreary quality of the building itself reasserts itself, if only partially. The level of taste here is still high - this is the only new high-rise hotel that could be said to be the equal in sophistication of something like the Paramount - but the solid, weighty feeling of the public rooms is gone. The guest rooms feel both tight and light, like the rooms in any cheap new high-rise tower, even if they have been improved by better furniture and more serious art (in the form of very au courant architectural prints) on the walls.
 
Behind the Signs
If the Hotel Macklowe feels like New York on the inside and like anywhere on the outside, the reverse is true of the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza, designed by Alan Lapidus. This tall tower of salmon-colored brick and pinkish-brown glass was designed in accordance with the city's new Times Square zoning district, which requires elaborate signs on the facades of new tall buildings.
Mr. Lapidus chose not to struggle to make his building's signs disappear, as some architects in the area have done, but to do the reverse, to make the building itself disappear behind the signs. The Holiday Inn is essentially a container for signs, and as such, it looks vastly better at night, when it is ablaze with neon, than it does during the day, when it seems only like a failed effort at elegance, with a particularly feeble marble arch over the entrance.
 
Small, Cramped Rooms
The building as of now lacks a full complement of signs; the city's zoning laws did not take into account the possibility that an economic downturn would make it impossible for developers to rent all of the large and expensive signs that are required to decorate the facades. The Holiday Inn is still waiting for tenants for some of its sign spaces, and much of the facade is covered by temporary metal framing awaiting the erection of signs over it.
Inside, the best thing are the views back outside - the opposite completely from the Hotel Macklowe. Some of the restaurant and bar areas offer sweeping views down Broadway toward the lights of Times Square, as do many of the guest rooms. The rooms themselves, unfortunately, are small and cramped.
The Embassy Suites Hotel, which is rising atop the old Palace Theater, was designed by the architects Fox & Fowle, and its exterior is perhaps the best of the three new hotels. This building will also have signs around its base, but the tower itself makes a stronger effort architecturally: It's a kind of jazzed-up International Style building in gray masonry, with red stripes and blue accents, all meeting the sky with a crisp 1930's spire-like sign. If all this seems to be old-style modernism made sleek and trendy, it feels energetic and zestful, and is just right for Times Square.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Asserts Federal Courts Shift Obligation

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOLTON LANDING, N.Y., Aug. 14

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo told the country's leading state court judges today that the Federal courts had increasingly ceded the task of protecting basic liberties to the state courts and in the process had abandoned their obligation to address a number of national problems.
Speaking to the annual Conference of Chief Justices at a resort hotel on Lake George, Mr. Cuomo said there was a ''judicial new federalism'' that was similar to the political new federalism practiced by Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bush. The policies of those Administrations, Mr. Cuomo said, have forced the states to accept the fiscal and policy-making responsibilities for solving national problems like drug abuse, homelessness, education and the decaying infrastructure. 
Mr. Cuomo said those policies had failed because they had placed neighboring states in economic competition. He also said the recent behavior of the Federal courts had built an unwieldy and unbalanced judicial confederation.
''Our national values, national resolve and national capacity are strengthened when we have a firm set of overarching standards that apply to every American, no matter where he or she lives,'' said Mr. Cuomo. ''I do not believe that the fundamental liberties and rights of members of our national community should vary, depending on what side of the state line one happens to be on at the moment.''
 
No Great Detail
The message conveyed by Mr. Cuomo was not particularly novel, but several justices said the speech was significant because of the Governor's national stature, both as a politician and as a legal thinker.
Mr. Cuomo did not support his contention with great detail. He referred in passing to cases involving government financing of abortion, the economic disparity between school districts and a patient's right to die as areas where the states had set precedents with little direction from the United States Supreme Court. In a news conference after his speech, the Governor declined to list other examples.
Most of the justices in the audience agreed with Mr. Cuomo's assertion that the Federal courts had pushed more responsibility onto the state bench, particularly in areas of criminal law, like the proper conduct of searches and seizures. But not all the listeners thought it was bad for legal standards to be set by the courts closest to the people.
''I think criticism of the Federal courts is going to come from partisan sources,'' said Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, who also spoke at the conference. ''But the American people, I think, look to our courts as a major protector of their rights and liberties.''

HEADLINE: Suspect Arrested in Rabbi's Slaying

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS

 BODY:
A 35-year-old Brooklyn man was arrested on Monday and charged with the slaying of a leader of the Satmar Hasidim in February in the Williamsburg section of the borough, Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown said yesterday.
He made the announcement at a news conference at the 90th Precinct station house, where relatives and friends of the victim, Rabbi Chaskel Werzberger, crowded in a room. Most of them wore the black hats and fringed prayer shawls of the 25,000-member sect.
Mr. Brown said the suspect, David Ranta, an unemployed house painter, was the gunman in the killing. The police said another man might have also been involved. Mr. Ranta, a former convict with a long criminal record, was arrested on 73d Street, near his house on 81st Street, in the Bensonhurst section, Mr. Brown said. 
After the conference, some residents of the area said they were relieved that there was a suspect. ''It makes me feel good,'' the owner of a store on Lee Avenue said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ''They should hang him up in the middle of the street. They should build a pole. Everybody will give money to build the pole. Even if the person is a Jew, that is our feeling toward him.''
 
Accounts From Witnesses
Rabbi Werzberger, 58 years old, a survivor of the Auschwitz death camp. is still widely mourned. ''He was so well loved around here that you miss him, even if you were not part of that congregation,'' said a woman managing a candy store on Lee Avenue.
Rabbi Werzberger was the sexton, an assistant to the grand rabbi, at Congregation Yetev Lev D'Satmar.
The arrest was made after more than six months of old-fashioned detective work, Mr. Brown said. The accounts of witnesses to the shooting, at 5:45 A.M. on Feb. 8, helped the police track the suspect, other officials said.
Rabbi Werzberger had just left his apartment in a public housing complex at 130 Clymer Street and was opening his car door when he was attacked, the police said. He managed to close the door and enter the car, but the gunman, who had apparently tried to rob another man in the apartment building, shot him through the window, the police added. A bullet struck Rabbi Werzberger above the right eye. The assailant pushed the rabbi out of the car and sped away, the police said.
His car, a 1985 Oldsmobile Cutlass, was found in another neighborhood. Paint was splattered on the front seat and windshield, apparently in an effort to conceal fingerprints, the police said in Februrary.
Rabbi Werzberger, a native of Hungary, died three days after the attack. His funeral at Kiryas Joel, a community he helped found in the 70's near Monroe, N.Y., drew several thousand mourners.
Mr. Ranta faces charges of second-degree murder and criminal possession of a deadly weapon, said a spokesman for the police, Capt. Stephen P. Davis. Mr. Ranta's criminal record includes 15 or 16 arrests on various charges and prison time for robbery, Mr. Brown said.
No weapon was recovered. Captain Davis said the police believed a .44- or .45-caliber gun had been used. Mr. Ranta, a thin blond mustachioed man who was wearing a football T-shirt and ripped jeans as he was whisked from the station house to a police car, made no statements ''of any substance,'' Captain Davis said. Hasidim shouted at the suspect and pounded on the car as it passed.
A neighborhood resident, Shulem Landau, said the man who had almost been robbed before the rabbi had fled by hurling himself and his cart with diamonds into his car and driving off. ''The rabbi was just in the wrong place at the wrong time,'' Mr. Landau said.

HEADLINE: Nowhere Vacations: Beyond TV and Fax

BYLINE: By LENA WILLIAMS

 BODY:
AH, to get away from it all: the faxes, the phones, the FedExes, the Filofaxes, the people. You remember what vacations used to be, before advanced technology made it easier to reach out and touch someone, wherever they may be. When the average workweek was 40 hours or less and employers wouldn't dream of interrupting your personal or private time, let alone a vacation, unless it were an emergency.
While many Americans, fearing a recession, are taking shorter vacations or sticking close to home, others are finding ways to escape totally from life's daily routines and petty annoyances. More than a few resort to keeping vacation destinations under wraps or otherwise limiting their accessibility, and some choose a remote vacation spot and go native.
That's what Neale S. Godfrey did last March when she left her son and daughter at home with her mother, and along with her sister took a boat with an Indian guide up the Amazon River, and camped in the jungle. 
''I wanted a vacation that was really an escape,'' said Ms. Godfrey, chairman of the Children's Financial Network, a Manhattan-based company that teaches children about money, banking and finance. ''No phones, no electricity.'' No American Express card, even. Ms. Godfrey used her cosmetics to barter with the Indians, though she said few seemed to like her shade of nail polish.
Social scientists say the pressure-filled 1980's, which ushered in desk-top personal computers, cellular telephones and hotel business centers, and a corporate culture that often measured loyalty, dedication, ambition and drive by the sacrifices one was willing to make, changed the meaning of work ethic and the way society viewed leisure time.
''Employers feel more entitled to imposing on your time,'' said Howard J. Kogan, a psychotherapist and director of training at the Training Institute for Mental Health in New York City. ''It's almost become universal that the most important thing about a person is what they do, and people themselves and their employers think that.''
But more and more people are beginning to resent this kind of intrusion and will stop at nothing to keep the office from going on vacation with them. Take Dale W., for example.
Dale, a newspaper reporter, asked that his full name not be used because his editors believe that the nearest telephone to the cabin he rents each year in the Rocky Mountains is a half-mile down the road.
''There's a phone in the cabin,'' Dale said with a chuckle. ''I just never bothered to have it turned on.''
People like Ms. Godfrey and Dale W. appear to be the exception, rather than the rule. Most people still wouldn't dream of taking a vacation without leaving a forwarding address, telephone number or a detailed itinerary.
''It's amazing how many executives are afraid to go somewhere and be unreachable,'' said C. C. Smiley, senior vice president of Inverness Travel in Manhattan, which has a large professional clientele. ''I've been an agent for a long time and I've never had anyone call me who said, 'Send me someplace where I can't be reached.' ''
People 50 years and older, who have achieved success and are still active in business but who are less afraid they would lose something by being out of contact, are more likely to go on vacations and not worry about being incommunicado, said Francis Goranin, owner of Vega International, a travel agency in Chicago.
''The younger crowd is more concerned about appearances,'' he said. ''They want to know what's going on, so they won't lose out on anything.''
The truth is, there is hardly any place in the world where a person couldn't be reached sooner or later. Even the Bora Bora Hotel in French Polynesia has a fax number.
Ms. Smiley remembers tracking down a client who was on a barge in France and relaying a message for her to call her office. ''It meant getting in touch with the company that ran the barge trip,'' she said, ''but we got a message through in time.''
To cut down on what many view as unnecessary interruptions, vacationers will leave their whereabouts with an intermediary like a travel agent, who is usually too busy to come right to the telephone, or a neighbor who is usually not at home. And if that doesn't work, try a cruise or a train trip. For reasons unknown, many people believe it's extremely difficult to reach someone on a moving vessel, so they seldom bother.
''It's a tried and proven principle: If people have to go through someone else to get to you, they're less likely to try, unless it's a real emergency,'' said Arlene Reeves, a substitute teacher in Washington, who has taken a cruise every summer for the last five years for that reason alone - she doesn't want to be bothered. ''I remember after one cruise, I returned home and found that my basement was flooded. My sister said she tried to reach me on the ship to let me know, but wasn't sure how to go about it. Thank goodness.''
Although many people may still look askance at someone running off for days or weeks at a time without leaving a forwarding number or address, a growing cottage industry is helping travelers to do just that.
Some of these are businesses like Andrew Harper's Hideaway Report, a monthly newsletter described as a ''connoisseur's guide to peaceful and unspoiled places''; Ocean Escapes Inc., a yachts-for-charter business billed as an ''escape to a timeless paradise from which you may never want to return''; and Wilderness Inquiry, which organizes outdoor adventures and whose itineraries read more like Lewis and Clark expeditions than fun in the sun.
Places appreciated for the amenities not included, like a television or daily newspaper delivery; secluded little hideaways; and sparsely populated islands are becoming increasingly chic. Some resorts are still fairly well-kept secrets, like Culebra, an island 12 miles from Puerto Rico whose beaches are so devoid of people that visitors are greeted with suspicion by the island's 2,000 residents. Or try Keeper's House on Isle au Haut, Me., where there is no electricity, so dinner is by candlelight and bedtime is early.
Those are the kinds of places Mr. Harper likes. A man who says he ''disdains crowds, flash, pomposity, plastic, name-dropping hotels and copycat motels,'' Mr. Harper started his magazine, based in Sun Valley, Idaho, for like-minded people. Apparently, he's found plenty. Since its first issue in 1979, the Hideaway Report has grown in circulation from 87 readers in 11 states to 15,000 subscribers in 50 states and 71 countries.
''The premise I had for the newsletter was to seek out peaceful and unspoiled sanctuaries,'' Mr. Harper said. Total-escape vacations can have a sobering effect, say some who have tried them. ''You come to realize that you aren't indispensable,'' said Ms. Godfrey, who is 39 and divorced. ''That you can go off for two or four weeks and the world continues to function without you.'' And you without it. Just ask Nancy Kesselof Charleston, W. Va. A registered nurse married to a surgeon, Mrs. Kessel said she and her husband, James, are always tied to the telephones.
''We have a phone in every room of the house,'' she said, ''a pager and an answering service.'' Mrs. Kessel is also an insulin-dependent diabetic.
Which is why she thought twice about going on the Wilderness Inquiry's 10-day kayaking trip around British Columbia's Queen Charlotte Islands last September. Not only was she worried about not being near any doctors, but ''there's no call-forwarding to the wilderness,'' she said.
''I didn't have any problems,'' Mrs. Kessel said recently. ''I was able to adjust my dosage of insulin and was more stable in the wilderness than I am at home, where stress often comes into play. I came back and I really think my family expected to find me pale and exhausted. Instead, I had this beautiful tan and looked healthier than I had in 10 years.''

HEADLINE: In New Book, Trump Is on the Attack

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
Two months ahead of schedule, ''Trump: Surviving at the Top'' goes on sale today in bookstores across the United States. In his new book, Mr. Trump says that his financial and personal troubles have been compounded by his own mistakes, by a softening economy and by unfair and sensationalized news reports.
The book's publication has generated anxiety within Random House, some of whose executives are known to fear that the public may have become satiated with reading about Mr. Trump's triumphs, and more recently, his travails. But to justify the large advance, reported to be almost $2 million dollars, and as a sign of confidence in the book, the publishing house has printed 500,000 copies, a number usually reserved for sure best sellers by authors like Robert Ludlum and James Michener. 
Mr. Trump's first book was a best seller for 51 weeks in hard cover and paperback. His new book is written with Charles Leerhsen, a senior writer at Newsweek.
In the book, Mr. Trump describes himself as a changed man as a result of his personal and business troubles. And he expresses confidence in his future.
Individual chapters are devoted to Mr. Trump's purchase of the Plaza Hotel, his ownership of the yacht Trump Princess and his acquisition of the Eastern Shuttle, since renamed the Trump Shuttle. He writes that he made a tactical mistake in telling The Wall Street Journal that he would sell the shuttle for the right price, because it made the public lose confidence in the shuttle. ''The shuttle is now profitable,'' he writes. ''Frankly, I'm glad I saved it.''
 
Chapter on Mrs. Trump
Mr. Trump also devotes an entire chapter to his wife, Ivana, saying that personality and life-style differences were responsible for the breakup of his marriage, and not, despite numerous press accounts, another woman. His wife, he wrote ''aspires to the aristocracy,'' and loves gala society events and expensive clothes. Mrs. Trump did not return a telephone call to her office. Her husband describes himself, by contrast, as ''a man of very simple tastes.'' He said he did not know what would result from their separation.
There are few revelations about his financial difficulties. Of his protracted negotiations with bankers to restructure his almost $2 billion in debt, Mr. Trump says only that he ''worked out a terrific deal that allows me the time, the money and the leeway to come out stronger than ever.''
Mr. Trump and his publisher appear to be betting that this book, unlike his first, ''Trump: The Art of the Deal,'' with Tony Schwartz, will sell not merely because of his tips about business, but also because of his caustic opinions of public figures.
He charges, for example, that Malcolm Forbes, the late publisher of Forbes Magazine, ''favored those who advertised in his magazine and tried, with surprising viciousness, to punish those who didn't.''
Malcolm Forbes Jr., president and editor and chief of the magazine, said, ''His allegations are as truthful as his estimates of his wealth.''
 
'Pendulum Has Swung'
Mr. Trump's book also criticizes coverage of his troubles by Liz Smith, the syndicated gossip columnist for The Daily News, the tabloid press, Time and Newsweek, and television talk show hosts Geraldo Rivera and Phil Donahue. A telephone call to Ms. Smith was not returned.
''I've also been in the public eye long enough so that the pendulum has swung,'' he writes, ''and many of the same media people who once put me on a pedestal now can't wait for me to fall off.''
Because of Mr. Trump's separation from his wife and his deteriorating financial condition, the book's publication was moved up from October and it was published in relative secrecy. Finishing touches were still being added last month and the editing was not completed until July 16, said Peter Osnos, the book's editor.

HEADLINE: Eastern Can Trim Pilots' Pay

BYLINE: By ERIC WEINER

 BODY:
In a ruling that gives Eastern Airlines some financial relief, a Federal Bankruptcy Court said yesterday that the beleaguered carrier could impose temporary wage and benefits cuts on pilots. At the same time, the airline reported a $35.6 million loss for the second quarter, an improvement from the period a year earlier.
The ruling by Judge Burton R. Lifland paves the way for Eastern to cut the pilots' wages 20 percent, a move that could save the airline $7 million to $9 million a month, said a lawyer familiar with the case.
Although most of the 1,900 pilots now flying for Eastern are not union members, they had been represented by the pilots' union in court proceedings. 
The ruling grants Eastern ''emergency relief'' from its obligation to abide by the pilots' contract, giving the airline a bit more financial breathing room. ''It's clear that prompt cost reductions, including pilot labor-cost reductions, are essential if an imminent liquidation is to be avoided,'' Judge Lifland said in his ruling.
 
Negotiated Settlement Sought
The ruling ''gives us the economic relief we need on an interim basis,'' said Karen Ceremsak, an Eastern spokeswoman. ''The long-term solution is a negotiated settlement with the pilots.'' Ms. Ceremsak would not specify how much the pilots' wages would be cut.
The bankruptcy court also gave the airline permission to remove another $50 million from its escrow account yesterday.
Lawyers for Eastern had argued that if the airline was not allowed to impose the wage cuts it would not meet its financial projections and might shut down. Lawyers for the pilots' union argued that Eastern was using its dire financial condition as an excuse to break the union contract.
''They were using the bankruptcy court as a convenient tool'' to break the contract, said James L. Linsey, a lawyer for the pilots' union.
 
Elimination of Dispute Boards
Mr. Linsey said he was especially disturbed by Judge Lifland's decision to allow the airline to eliminate its arbritration and pension dispute boards, which were used to settle retirement and disability claims. Earlier this month a Federal District Court in Miami ruled that Eastern was obligated to allow 178 union pilots to return to work. Most of Eastern's pilots had honored striking machinists' picket lines.
The $35.6 million loss for the second quarter compares with a $130 million loss in the period last year. The Miami-based airline said revenue totaled $545.2 million in the second quarter, compared with $89.6 million in 1989. Eastern, which lost $170 million in the first half of this year, has been operating under bankruptcy protection since March 9, 1989. a few days after the machinists began their strike.
Martin R. Shugrue Jr., Eastern's court-appointed trustee, has projected that the airline will lose $510 million this year - much more than earlier projections of a $330 million loss. But Eastern's outlook may be even bleaker, because the business plan does not take into account the sharply higher fuel prices that have resulted from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
On Monday, Eastern announced a new marketing plan that includes fares that are 15 percent to 40 percent lower this fall. The fares, which range from $69 to $139 each way and must be booked by Aug. 29, are in stark contrast to the fare increases announced by most airlines as a result of higher fuel costs.
Still, many analysts are doubtful that Eastern will survive in the long term, and avoid a liquidation. ''Today's action is a diversion from the true questions facing Eastern, which is when are the parts going to be dismantled and who will they go to,'' said a lawyer working with Eastern's bankruptcy proceedings.
 
 LORENZO FAREWELL
 HOUSTON, Aug. 14 (Reuters) -Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. may be losing Frank Lorenzo, but it will be gaining a new image, Mr. Lorenzo said during an emotional goodbye ceremony today. Mr. Lorenzo, who choked back tears as he addressed 3,000 Continental employees, said the airline would introduce changes after his departure as chairman and chief executive.
Mr. Lorenzo said that as Continental moved into the fall it ''will be coming out with some really dramatic changes in the whole perception of Continental, the whole look, the visual image of Continental: colors, paint jobs, so forth.''

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar In Plunge Vs. Mark

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The dollar fell yesterday to its lowest level against the West German mark in that currency's 42-year history, breaking through a significant barrier on a decline that economists said should bring it even lower against the mark and other currencies before the end of the year.
With interest rates expected to rise abroad while they decline in the United States, the downward pressure on the dollar has been mounting because Americans and foreigners are being attracted to non-dollar investments.
Reports that the American economy is in or near a recession, combined with the negative impact on growth of higher oil prices, have heightened the expectation of lower United States interest rates. And this has been enough to overcome the lift the dollar would have been expected to get as a traditional safe haven in the Persian Gulf crisis. 
 
Little Possibility of Action
For the United States, faced with a recession and prospects of rising inflation because of the Iraqi-induced jump in oil prices, the lower dollar is not good news. But there appears to be little that American policy makers can do about the decline now.
''Net, net it should be seen as a negative, especially because it will make the job of the Federal Reserve more difficult,'' said Geoffrey Dennis, chief international economist for James Capel Inc. in London.
In late trading yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.5635 West German marks, from 1.5780 on Monday. That was its lowest close in New York since the German currency was created in 1948. Its previous New York low of 1.5700 was reached on Dec. 31, 1987. That came at the end of a two-and-a-half-year effort by the United States and its economic allies to bring the dollar down from peaks that had helped push the American trade deficit to record levels.
 
New Lows for the Year
The dollar also fell against other currencies yesterday, including the British pound, the Swiss franc, the French franc, the Italian lira and the Canadian dollar. It hit new lows for the year against all these currencies and was at its lowest level in a decade against the Canadian dollar. The British pound rose against the dollar to $1.8980, from $1.8825 on Monday.
The only exception to the dollar's slide has been the Japanese yen. Although the dollar fell to 148.80 yen yesterday, from 150.25 on Monday, it is still stronger than it was at the beginning of the year and is far above its record low of 120.90 in November 1988. The yen has remained weak because of uncertainity about the economic outlook in Japan and the declines of its bond and stock markets, which have sent Japanese abroad looking for investments.
The lower dollar will worsen American inflationary pressures by making imports more expensive. And the added pressure comes with inflation already in the 5 percent range, a level the Federal Reserve believes is too high.
The expectation of a further dollar decline and a recession could also make foreigners even more hesitant to invest in the already weakened stock and bond markets because of the loss they would face when sales are translated back into their stronger currencies. In addition, it could be more difficult to attract the foreign investment needed to cover the Federal budget deficit.
 
Higher Deficit Seen
David D. Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services, said the combination of a recession and the cost of the military buildup in the Persian Gulf could push the Federal budget deficit to more than $300 billion. This, he said, ''is a new twist'' in the economic outlook, and a declining dollar now ''is going to make it harder to finance'' this deficit.
Despite the consequences, both the United States and its allies in the Group of Seven, which includes Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada, are confronting economic problems to which solutions are generally negative for the dollar.
For the Federal Reserve, a recession is just as troubling a problem now as inflation. Many economists still expect the Fed to lower interest rates, as an anti-recession move, rather than raising them to fight inflation and support the dollar.
''Sometime in the next month, the Fed has to move to lower interest rates,'' said Victor M. Polce, manager of foreign exchange sales at the Algemene Bank Nederland in New York, who believes a recession has already begun.
 
Not Worried About Drop
West Germany and Japan, meanwhile, are no longer worried about a dollar decline, as they were in the past.
A stronger mark will help the Germans fight any inflationary surge from the unification of the two Germanys and the recent rise in oil prices, which are set in dollars. And while the Japanese have been unsuccessful so far, the Government and the Bank of Japan want a stronger yen to help bring some stability back to the country's financial markets.
The Germans are expected to raise interest rates soon to slow growth and inflation, which should add support to the mark, weakening the dollar further. The Bank of Japan has been hinting strongly that it will raise interest rates, which are already about as high as they are in the United States. But both may delay the moves until they see how the Middle East situation is working out and how high oil prices are likely to go.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
What Price Cleaner Air?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
Like purer hearts or thinner thighs, cleaner air is an unalloyed virtue. But like other virtues, cleaner air can only be attained through sacrifice. And according to Paul R. Portney, an environmental economist at Resources for the Future in Washington, Americans may be on the verge of giving up too much for too little: They are not likely to get their money's worth from the sweeping amendments to the Clean Air Act now being cobbled together by Congress.
According to Mr. Portney's startling analysis, to be published in the next issue of the American Economic Association's Journal of Economic Perspectives, the amendments will double the current $30 billion cost of the air quality regulation. But the benefits will probably be worth just $14 billion, Mr. Portney concluded. His analysis is all the more depressing because the legislation is the first to draw on the expertise of efficiency-minded economists. 
The first of the three big-ticket items in the clean air package would require coal- and oil-fired power plants to slash emissions of sulfur and nitrogen oxides. The likely bill for antipollution equipment and more expensive fuel: about $4 billion annually. But the benefits should exceed the costs. Mr. Portney reckons that the value in better health and reduced damage to forests, lakes and farms will run about $5 billion.
Thereafter, however, the economics of the clean air amendments is all downhill. Tougher regulation of urban polluters will cost $19 billion to $22 billion annually. But the benefits, everything from reduced incidence of asthma to increased crop yields downwind, will probably fall in the $4 billion to $12 billion range, Mr. Portney says. The third expensive item, reductions in emissions of 190 cancer-causing industrial chemicals, Mr. Portney estimates, will probably run $6 billion to $10 billion annually. But by Government analysis, the risks from these toxic effluents is much smaller than commonly supposed; lives saved will probably not exceed 500 annually. Valuing these lives at $3 million each, the total benefits will fall short of $2 billion.
These estimates, Mr. Portney readily acknowledges, are educated guesses. But the guesses, from a variety of sources ranging from the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment to studies commissioned by the Environmental Protection Agency, do apparently represent the state of the scientific art.
Some environmental advocates - perhaps a majority - deny the relevance of such analysis. Cleaner is better, they insist, no matter what the green-eyeshade types say. But for economists (and those who think like economists), comparisons of costs and benefits must matter in a world of limited resources. An extra billion spent sanitizing the air around oil refineries is a billion less to spend on, say, safer tankers or tastier tomatoes. And if regulation itself breeds inefficiency - if less money spent elsewhere could accomplish the same task -the approach is even more problematic.
That raises a troubling question. Never have so many smart, free-market-oriented economists been so involved in drafting new environmental rules. If resulting legislation is such a bad deal, why are they now silent?
One reason is that the free-market enthusiasts within the clean air lobby did win one big victory: Utilities will be allowed to buy and sell rights to pollute, insuring that the polluters who can cut emissions most cheaply will do the cutting.
This will reduce the acid rain cleanup cost by $2 billion to $3 billion annually, Mr. Portney says. Moreover, ''emissions trading'' on acid rain could serve as the precedent for a least-cost solution for the big kahuna of environmental problems, containment of the ''greenhouse effect'' gases that cause atmospheric warming. But the price of this victory was acquiescence on air toxics regulation, which many environmental economists privately concede will be about as cost-effective as the Pentagon's $600 toilet seats.
The other bargain for silence cannot be rationalized so high-mindedly. President Bush's economic advisers have long been unhappy with the urban air quality amendments as well as the air toxics provisions; the former, it is argued, would effectively force the whole country to use expensive emission controls that make sense only for the dozen most heavily polluted cities.
But the self-proclaimed environmental President seems readier to settle for a wasteful bill than to share the blame for a legislative deadlock. And the pinchpennies in the budget office, who might have been expected to stiffen Mr. Bush's spine, seem unconcerned because Washington won't foot the bill. Consumers will.

HEADLINE: Sales of U.S. Vehicles Down in Early August

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 14

 BODY:
Sales of domestically produced cars and light trucks fell 18.8 percent in early August and analysts attributed the decline to the weakness in the United States economy and unusually strong sales a year earlier.
Cars sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.6 million units for the 10 days ended Aug. 10, compared with 7.9 million in the same period a year earlier. During the 30 days ended Aug. 10, cars sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.9 million, while the seasonally adjusted selling rate for the first half of the year was 6.9 million.
Over all, sales of passenger cars fell 20.7 percent in early August, to 150,897 units. Sales of light trucks, including mini-vans, declined 15.6 percent, to 95,895 units. Rise in Japanese Models While the Big Three domestic auto makers reported a collective decline in sales, the Japanese manufacturers reported a 5.3 percent increase in sales of vehicles produced in their factories in the United States. 
Auto makers said they detected no movement of buyers to smaller, more fuel-efficient models in the wake of sudden increases in the price of gasoline resulting from the crisis in the Persian Gulf. Some dealers, however, said sales of small cars had picked up, while larger cars were selling more slowly.
''Customers are talking more about fuel economy, but they are not switching to different, more fuel-efficient cars,'' said Joel Pitcoff, the Ford Motor Company's manager of research and analysis.
Analysts predicted that a prolonged conflict in the Persian Gulf, resulting in still higher gasoline prices or greater disruption in oil supplies, could begin to affect retail auto sales by September.
Gasoline would have to rise by 25 cents to 50 cents a gallon before customers would begin switching to smaller, more fuel-efficient cars, said Maryann N. Keller, an automotive analyst and vice president at Furman Selz in New York.
''If the hostilities keep up, the truck market is much more vulnerable than the car market, because that is where the inefficient product is located today,'' said Ms. Keller.
Vehicle sales in the 10-day period last year were especially strong as customers rushed to take advantage of clearance sales at the end of the model year that included generous cash rebates and discount financing.
The cash rebates offered by manufacturers are smaller this year than last, and with inventories significantly lower than last year, dealers and analysts predicted that further price discounts on 1990 models were unlikely.
General Motors reported sales of its cars fell 22.2 percent in early August, to 65,611 units. G.M.'s light truck sales were down 18.1 percent, to 41,818 units.
Ford's car sales declined 21.3 percent, to 48,369 units, while sales of Ford's light trucks fell 4 percent, to 34,250. #38.6% Drop for Chrysler The Chrysler Corporation posted a 38.6 percent decline in sales of its cars, to 15,667 units. The company said in a statement that the big drop in car sales was a result of ''extremely high sales of the Shadow and Sundance in the 1989 period,'' when the company was offering some of the biggest rebates in the industry's history. Sales of Chysler's light trucks and mini-vans were down 25.8 percent, to 17,339.
The Toyota Motor Corporation posted an increase of 64.3 percent in sales of its cars, manufactured in Georgetown, Ky., to 8,573 units.
Sales of cars made by the Honda Motor Company at its plant in Marysville, Ohio, declined 15.4 percent in early August, to 7,617 units. The Nissan Motor Company posted a decline of 32.4 percent in sales of cars made in Smyrna, Tenn., to 1,988 units. Sales of Nissan's domestically made light trucks fell 34.5 percent, to 2,296 units.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Up in July, But Outlook Is Negative

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 14

 BODY:
Retail sales rose one-tenth of 1 percent in July from the month before, the Commerce Department said today.
The gain would normally have been seen as an indication that consumers were spending enough to keep the economy moving sluggishly higher. But with the recent oil crisis created by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, analysts focused more on future conditions, which they expect to be unfavorable. 
''There are two big negatives overhanging the economy now,'' said Lynn Reiser, senior economist with First Interstate Bancorp, a bank-holding company in Los Angeles: ''the Middle East crisis and its impact on oil prices and the deteriorating outlook for new jobs.''
 
Earlier Decline in Jobs
The Government had already reported that the unemployment rate climbed in July to 5.5 percent from 5.2 percent in June, and that new-job growth slowed sharply. And since the Iraqi action earlier this month, retail gasoline prices have risen about 15 cents a gallon.
''Consumers will spend more on petroleum products, leaving them with less money to spend on other products,'' said Richard Rahn, chief economist with the United States Chamber of Commerce.
The Government had reported previously that growth in the nation's total output of goods and services, or the gross national product, had slowed to an anemic 1.2 percent annual rate between April and June, before the onset of higher oil prices.
 
Upward Revision for June
The July sales gain followed a 1.1 percent increase in June, which the Commerce Department revised upward today from the previously reported five-tenths of 1 percent gain. Sales had declined in May, April and March, and were flat in February.
Before June, the last significant monthly rise was a 2.8 percent increase in January. The department also revised the May decline to one-tenth of 1 percent from a six-tenths of 1 percent drop reported previously.
The two revisions suggested that inventories of unsold goods were smaller than had been believed, a potential benefit in times of slow economic activity.
''It does not look as though inventories will be a major overhang, which, if we do go into a recession, would mitigate the impact of it,'' Ms. Reiser said. She said that low inventories would give manufacturers a reason to keep production lines going even in a sluggish economy.
 
Building Materials Strong
Total sales in July were a seasonally adjusted $149.5 billion. The increase from June was led by sales of building materials, which rose 3.9 percent after a 3.2 percent rise the month before.
Sales at auto dealerships, which account for about 20 percent of the monthly retail sales measure, fell six-tenths of 1 percent after rising by six-tenths of 1 percent in June. Excluding that volatile category, retail sales were up by three-tenths of 1 percent last month after increasing 1.2 percent on a similar basis in June, the department said.
Sales of gasoline at service stations fell three-tenths of 1 percent in July after a 1 percent June rise.
Sales of durable goods, meant to last three or more years, rose three-tenths of 1 percent in July after increasing four-tenths of 1 percent in June. Sales of nondurable goods, like food and disposable items, were unchanged in July after a rise of 1.5 percent in June.

Bank in Brooklyn Sets Fall Opening

 BODY:
The Community Capital Bank, Brooklyn, said yesterday that it had met its goal of raising $6 million of shareholder capital, and it planned to open for business in November. The bank, which attracted about a third of its shareholder funds from 41 religious organizations and another third from institutions like the American Express Company and J. P. Morgan & Company, promised to concentrate on lending to small businesses in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods of New York City.
From an office on Livingston Street, Brooklyn, the bank will also offer consumer services, with federally insured deposits at market interest rates.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
New Fiber-Optic Cable Will Expand Calls Abroad, and Defy Sharks

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BALTIMORE

 BODY:
Like Brobdingnagian spools of thread, three giant steel cones in the hold of an unusual ship here are wrapped with up to 3,000 miles of cable no thicker than a garden hose. The cable, composed of six hair-thin strands of glass covered by steel and plastic, can carry 40,000 telephone calls across the ocean floor at a time.
The American Telephone and Telegraph Company, which owns the ship, hopes to lay 20,000 miles of such cable within several years. The effort is but one of many by the world's major telephone companies to keep up with international telephone traffic, which is doubling every four years and is expected to grow faster if a recently proposed United States rate-cutting effort succeeds.
The telephone companies are not only speeding up the laying of fiber-optic cables to supplement copper ones, but also making the first large round of orders for cable-laying ships in a generation. At the same time, research into better electronics is producing cables that can carry even more calls, while new techniques are providing more protection for cables against hazards ranging from shark bites to equipment used by fishing boats to harvest clams on the sea floor. 
The next trans-Atlantic telephone cable, scheduled for deployment in 1992, will use sophisticated electronics to carry 80,000 lines - compared with 48 lines on the first telephone cable, laid in 1956. The latest cables are armored against shark bites with two layers of steel tape and buried deeper than before under the sea bed in shallow waters to prevent damage from fishing boats.
International traffic has soared largely because of increasing facsimile and computer communications, together with a trend by manufacturing and service companies to set up offices and factories in many countries, said Gregory C. Staple, a Washington consultant who has written two studies on the trend.
 
Caught by Surprise
A.T.&T. says the sustained growth in traffic during the 1980's has caught it by surprise and forced it to lease extra call-transmission capacity aboard satellites and cables laid by other companies. But satellite capacity is limited, and many corporations demand undersea links from their long-distance telephone companies because fiber-optic cables provide connections with less static and echo.
While A.T.&T. says existing and planned cable capacity will be sufficient for its needs, the MCI Communications Corporation, the second-largest long-distance company, says it needs more capacity. MCI wants the Federal Communications Commission to give it some of A.T.&T.'s lines in cables built by consortiums that included A.T.&T. and MCI. A.T.&T. owns almost all of the existing outbound American telephone cable lines and most of the planned capacity, while MCI owns little of either.
Traffic could grow even faster if the F.C.C. succeeds in its effort to force foreign governments to reduce the rates their phone companies charge for receiving international calls. Reducing these charges could halve the price of an international call from the United States within three years, the F.C.C. says. Some economists think this could cause traffic to double, on top of the current annual growth of 20 percent.
 
Heavy Demand
All the capacity on a $430 million trans-Atlantic cable planned for 1992 by a consortium of major telephone companies has already been sold to consortium members, while spare telephone circuits in previously laid cables are also in short supply.
Installing a new cable requires several years of negotiations to assemble a consortium and arrange financing, while actually laying a trans-oceanic cable can be done in a month. ''If we had the cables right now, we'd put them in,'' said James M. Barrett, the head of submarine cable operations at A.T.&T.
A shortage of cable-laying ships is crimping the telephone industry's response. Few such ships have been built in recent years. A.T.&T.'s Long Lines, the ship based here, began laying its first cable in 1963 and is not well suited to lay fiber-optic cable because it is not very maneuverable.
A new generation of cable-laying ships is under construction, mostly in East Asian shipyards. A.T.&T. is spending $100 million to build two vessels in Singapore that are better suited for laying fiber-optic cables, which transmit telephone calls by laser through their fibers.
 
Strange Ships
British Telecommunications P.L.C., Teleglobe Canada Inc. and the Kokusai Denshin Denwa Company of Japan have each ordered a new cable-laying ship.
These ships are among the oddest vessels afloat. In the holds are not only the 25-foot-high steel cones but also buoys twice the height of a person, refrigerator-size grapples for dredging up damaged cables and even one or more small laboratories for splicing cable and testing its electronic properties.
On the deck stands a remote-controlled submarine, used to inspect cables after they have been laid, and an undersea sled, used to bury cables under the sea floor in shallow waters near shore where fishing boats troll for shellfish. A turret typically protrudes from the bow to haul submerged cables aboard for splicing or repair.
The new ships share these features with older vessels like the Long Lines. But they also have design improvements.
 
Limit on Maneuvering
One weakness of the Long Lines is that while a propeller in the bow allows the front of the ship to be maneuvered laterally, its single propeller in the stern simply drives the ship forward, giving the captain little ability to maneuver the stern. ''We can control the bow very easily, but we really have no control over the stern except the rudder,'' said Leonard J. Becicka, the captain of the Long Lines.
That is a problem because unlike copper cable, fiber-optic cable must be fed out straight from the stern. Severe twisting, such as when wind, waves and currents toss the stern about, can stress the glass and reduce its ability to carry phone calls. ''You don't want to bend it, you don't want to drag it around,'' Captain Becicka said.
To remedy the problem, each of the new A.T.&T. ships will have two lateral propellers in the bow and two propulsion propellers in the stern that can rotate the boat from side to side.
The extra maneuverability is also needed so vessels can continue to lay fiber-optic cable during bad weather. Because this cable is lighter and finer than copper cable, a vessel can carry enough of it for a month's work at sea, and over that period at least one storm is likely. In the past, cable-laying ships scurried out of harbors after storms to lay a few hundred miles of copper cable, then headed back to port before rough weather returned.
 
Renewing the Signal
Another technological leap that could help relieve the shortages of capacity would be the development of a way to dispense with so-called repeaters. These are $800,000 torpedo-shaped blocks of electronic circuitry encased in steel that are now placed every 35 to 45 miles along a fiber-optic cable to renew the signal, which tends to fade as it travels.
A.T.&T. and other companies are working to lengthen the distance between repeaters, and the next trans-Atlantic cable is scheduled to have one every 70 to 85 miles. The goal is to develop cables that need no repeaters, so that the electronics on land at either end of the cable could be upgraded periodically to increase the number of calls a cable can handle. This cannot be done now because the repeaters cannot be reprogrammed once they are laid. Dredging up and replacing every repeater on a submerged cable is prohibitively expensive, so new cables are laid instead.
But the development of a repeaterless cable remains in the distant future. ''We've got a long way to go there,'' Mr. Barrett said. ''That's not on our horizon. It's in the laboratory.''

HEADLINE: 2 Nicaragua Currencies

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Aug. 14

 BODY:
Two official currencies were in circulation today in Nicaragua, one on par with the United States dollar and the other devalued almost into oblivion. The central bank announced today that it had devalued the old cordoba 7.2 percent, to 690,000 to the dollar from 640,000. Black market dealers offered 740,000 old cordobas for $1. On Monday the first bills of the new currency, the gold cordoba, began circulating when state workers cashed paychecks in the new money. The Government of President Violeta Chamorro has vowed to maintain the new cordoba on par with the dollar as part of a strategy to cut inflation, which was 62 percent in July.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Prices in a Slight Advance

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Bond prices rose slightly and long-term interest rates dipped yesterday, as credit market participants reacted favorably to a more stable oil market, rumors of institutional purchases of long-term securities and hopes that the meeting tomorrow between President Bush and King Hussein of Jordan may help to defuse tensions in the Middle East.
Price gains were concentrated among long-term securities, even though a number of analysts said they are convinced that economic weakness will force the Federal Reserve Board to ease short-term interest rates soon, perhaps as early as next week.
Indeed, market participants suggested that yesterday's small gains in bond prices were likely to prove ephemeral until and unless the warlike atmosphere that prevails in the Middle East evaporates.
''It is hard to imagine the market going higher without a solution in the region,'' one government bond trader said. 
''Last week. the long end got killed because of oil prices, and if the situtation over there gets resolved, presumably oil prices will come down and the long end will take off.''
 
Kennebunkport Meeting
Word that King Hussein would be traveling to Kennebunkport, Maine, bearing a letter from Iraq's President Saddam Hussein to President Bush at his vacation home flashed across trading screens in advance of the President's 4 P.M. news conference and led to some speculation that a deal that would end the conflict might already have been struck.
That notion was quickly dispelled when Mr. Bush began his meeting with reporters by talking tough on the Federal budget.
The President's remarks, in which he re-emphasized the need to cut $50 billion from the budget in the coming fiscal year, did not provoke much of a reaction from traders.
Nevertheless, ''his remarks were somewhat positive for the market,'' said Lawrence N. Leuzzi, a managing director at S.G. Warburg & Company.
''Given everything that has happened in the Middle East and its likely impact on the economy, he could have used this opportunity to backslide on what was needed and to reset the budget negotiations in a framework where smaller cuts would be sought,'' Mr. Leuzzi said.
Activity in the secondary market for Treasury securities was light yesterday, due in part to the lingering effects of the widespread power failures in lower Manhattan.
Although most dealers were fully operational yesterday, two major interdealer brokers, the RMJ Securities Corporation and Fundamental Brokers Inc., were still without power.
By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 99 22/32, up 5/32, to yield 8.78 percent, down slightly from 8.79 percent late Monday.
Among note issues, the 8 1/2 percent five-year notes were offered in late trading at 100 21/32, down 1/32, to yield 8.31 percent. And the 8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 1/8, down 2/32, to yield 7.92 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates rose slightly.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.43 percent late yesterday, up four basis points, or hundredths of a point. Six-month bills rose by three basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.32 percent. And one-year bills were offered at 7.17 percent, up three basis points.
 
Note and Bill Rates
Even though the view that the Fed will move soon to lower short-term interest rates was not reflected in note and bill rates yesterday, some market participants said that such a move was very likely.
''I don't think the Fed has any choice'' but to lower rates after its policy-making Open Market Committee meets on Aug. 21, said William M. Brachfeld, executive vice president at Daiwa Securities America Inc.
While such a move would do little to help cool inflation, ''we don't want to have a recession in this country,'' Mr. Brachfeld said.
Elsewhere, activity in the secondary markets for investment-grade corporate bonds and tax-exempt municipal securities was very light, dealers said.
Prices of most widely quoted corporate bonds were unchanged on the day. Meanwhile, prices of most municipal bonds rose by about 1/4 point.
New issues priced yesterday included a competitive offering of $115 million worth of insured tax-exempt serial bonds from the Ohio Public Facility for Higher Education.
The bonds, which are insured by the Municipal Bond Investors Assurance Corporation, were won by a syndicate led by Bear, Stearns & Company.
The serial bonds were reoffered to investors with coupons from 5.90 percent in 1992 to 7 percent in 2005.
The issue is rated AAA by both Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Gold Prices Decline Slightly As Investors Take Profits

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gold futures prices fell slightly yesterday on the Commodity Exchange in New York, after profit taking erased gains that had brought the market to its highest level in nearly six months.
Trading resumed yesterday on the New York commodity exchanges, which were shut down Monday afternoon by an electrical blackout. 
On the Commodity Exchange and the New York Mercantile Exchange, where oil futures are traded, exchange officials combined Monday's incomplete trading day with yesterday's session for price-quoting purposes. Therefore, the quoted changes yesterday in settlement prices for those commodities were relative to Friday's settlement prices, not to the prices at which the markets stopped trading Monday.
On the Commodity Exchange, gold futures settled $7.90 to $8.20 above Friday's settlement, with the contract for delivery in August at $404.80 an ounce, which was 40 cents below Monday's last price.
Silver futures ended 22.1 cents to 25.3 cents above Friday's settlement, with August at $5.191 an ounce, which was 4.6 cents above Monday's last price.
August gold traded as high as $413.50, the highest spot gold price since Feb. 23.
Analysts attributed the early run-up to fears of inflation and political unrest stemming from the Persian Gulf conflict.
The late profit taking was prompted by news that King Hussein of Jordan was carrying a message from President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to President Bush, and by a decline in buying interest as the December gold contract neared $425 an ounce.
''Some people who were running profits from last week tended to ring up the cash register, so to speak,'' said Don Tierney, an analyst with Stanley Bell & Company, a New York-based commodities brokerage.

HEADLINE: Mexico Debt Deal Is Denied

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 14

 BODY:
A senior Treasury official vigorously denied a Congressman's charge today that the Bush Administration had spent $192 million to subsidize Mexico's debt-reduction agreement with commercial banks.
Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the House Banking Committee, said such a Mexican transaction, completed in January, was just one of a number of ''back-door financing schemes'' put together ''behind closed doors'' to finance the Treasury's international operations. 
David C. Mulford, Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, said: ''We do not believe in producing subsidies for foreign governments. The entire debt strategy is an indication that our efforts have been devoted to curing this problem without recourse to taxpayers' money.''
The Mexican agreement was the first and most important struck under the so-called Brady plan. Named after Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, it seeks to induce banks to forgive part of the $1.3 trillion debt burden on third-world countries in exchange for economic reforms.
At issue is whether the United States gave Mexico a favorable price when it sold $2.99 billion in zero-coupon Treasury bonds.

HEADLINE: IRAQ SEEKS PEACE WITH IRAN, TURNING BACK SPOILS OF WAR IN MOVE TO END ITS ISOLATION;
Teheran is Pleased

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia, Aug. 15

 BODY:
Iraq took a dramatic step today to counter its growing international isolation over the invasion of Kuwait, offering to meet almost all of Iran's conditions for settling key issues persisting from their eight-year war.
President Saddam Hussein's apparent decision to give up his longstanding goals against Iran seemed intended to free military units deployed along the Iranian border for use if a conflict develops with forces in Saudi Arabia.
The decision may also reflect a calculated hope by Baghdad that Iran, in return for the concessions, might help Iraq evade international economic sanctions.
 
A Hint of Approval
Iran immediately implied that it would be amenable to Iraq's offer of peace, saying that it would be reviewed ''with optimism.''
But Iran, which initially condemned the invasion of Kuwait and later expressed concern at the decision of the United States and other Western powers to send troops to the region, has not indicated whether it will help Iraq in its economic plight. 
The initiative by the Iraqi President, made in a letter to President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran, represented one of the most significant moves since Washington's decision to throw its full weight behind an effort to protect Saudi Arabia and to compel Iraq to pull out of Kuwait.
 
'Fishing in Muddy Waters'
The Iraqi leader's letter held out a possibility of a ''new life in which cooperation prevails under the shadow of Islamic principles and that each of us respects the rights of the other and keeps away those fishing in muddy waters on our shores.''
It came as the two sides were nearing the 10th anniversary of the outbreak of the war, on Sept. 19, when Iraq invaded Iran, which was then holding American hostages and was in the throes of the Islamic revolution that toppled the Shah in 1979.
Ostensibly, Iraq invaded because of a dispute over Shatt al Arab, the strategic border waterway at the head of the Persian Gulf used by both countries.
President Hussein is bound to be faced by questions from his military about why Baghdad waged such a high-cost war with Iran, only to offer to return to the pre-war borders with Iran, something that Mr. Hussein had repeatedly said he would never accept.
There are estimates that more than a million people died in the war, in which a cease-fire was declared in 1988, with heavy casualties, air and missile attacks, human-wave assaults by Iran and the use of poison gas by Iraq. Millions of people were wounded or driven from their homes.
Iranian officials said secret and direct talks were held between the two nations over the last few weeks.
They added that they viewed the Iraqi concessions as a direct result of the economic and military pressures on Baghdad after the invasion of Kuwait, including trade sanctions decreed by the United Nations Security Council, naval interdictions by American and other warships and a buildup of an multi-national force in Saudi Arabia.
The Iraqi leader's conciliatory gesture to Teheran was announced over Iraqi radio and television. It promised the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from about 700 square miles of Iranian territory. It also called for the exchange of nearly 100,000 prisoners of war and an equal division of the Shatt al Arab estuary.
 
Iraq Canceled Waterway Pact
When the war broke out in 1980, Mr. Hussein canceled a 1975 agreement between the two countries to divide the waterway, which is Iraq's only outlet to the Persian Gulf.
Since then, Iraq had insisted that it would ''never'' allow Iran sovereignty over any part of the waterway. Iraq also insisted that it would not allow an exchange of prisoners nor pull back from Iranian territory until Iran had conceded this point.
The Iraqi leader said today that his troops would begin to withdraw from Iran on Friday and might start releasing prisoners of war even before reciprocal action by Iran.
Iranian officials said the first high-level contact between the two countries started in April with a letter from President Hussein to President Rafsanjani. It was followed by several unannounced meetings and one public meeting between foreign ministers in Geneva in July.
Shortly after that, Iran and Iraq cooperated in pressing other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to raise oil prices, just before the invasion of Kuwait.
These events seemed to confirm suggestions by many Persian Gulf experts that the two countries have many common interests in areas like oil policy and opposition to the United States military presence in the gulf area.
It was not clear whether Iran would be willing to take the kind of actions that could alleviate the growing international pressure on Iraq. Given the long border between Iran and Iraq, the worldwide embargo against Iraq could be thwarted if Teheran allowed its territory to become a transit route for Iraqi imports.
The announcement by Iraq underlined Baghdad's eagerness to ease the pressure on its frontier with Iran so it could concentrate strength in response to the military buildup in Saudi Arabia.
In announcing his offer today, President Hussein noted the Islamic heritage of both nations, even though his secular Baathist Government has harshly repressed the Islamic fundamentalist movement, Al Dawa al-Islamiya, which was allied with Iran, and executed scores of the movement's leaders.
 
'Dear Brother'
In his letter to President Rafsanjani, the Iraqi leader referred to the Iranian as ''Dear Brother.'' The letter said, in part: ''Everything has become clear and everthing you wanted and concentrated upon has been realized.''
The tone was a sharp change in Baghdad's attitude toward the Iranian Government. Over the last decade, the Iraqi press and broadcasting have repeatedly described the Iranian leaders, including Mr. Rafsanjani, as ''princes of darkness,'' ''Persian inferiors'' and ''imposters.''
In his message, President Hussein said he was looking forward to a peace treaty between the countries ''from an honorable position toward a new life in which cooperation prevails under the shadow of Islamic principles.''
In a move related to the gulf crisis, foreign embassies in Kuwait were ordered today to move to Baghdad. All Kuwaitis who served in the diplomatic service and their families have been taken to Baghdad and jailed.
Many of the newest refugees from Kuwait in Saudi Arabia say the situation in Kuwait is deteriorating and that food is scarce. Nine Britons who arrived in Bahrain last night said that shooting was heard every night as Kuwaitis continued to wage hit-and-run raids on Iraqi positions.
One of Syria's three vice presidents was reported today to be on his way to Teheran for consultations with the Iranian leadership. Syria, long a rival of Iraq, will probably try to persuade Teheran not to ease its pressure on Iraq.
In the Iranian capital, Morteza Sarmadi, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, seemed pleased with the Iraqi offer to settle all remaining disputes, stressing that it represented significant concessions to Iran.
 
Iran Hails Iraqi Offer
TEHERAN, Iran, Aug. 15 (Reuters) - Iran hailed Iraq's acceptance of its terms for peace as the biggest victory since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
It predicted a new era of ''lasting and just peace'' with Iraq after President Hussein announced that he was ready to accept a 1975 border treaty that he had renounced in 1980.

HEADLINE: IRAQ SEEKS PEACE WITH IRAN, TURNING BACK SPOILS OF WAR IN MOVE TO END ITS ISOLATION;
New Headache for U.S.

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 15

 BODY:
If it lasts, the peace settlement shaping up today between Iraq and Iran, once its arch-enemy, could significantly prolong the stay of American troops in the Persian Gulf.
Iran is the natural counterweight to Iraq in the region and if Teheran is not willing to play that role, it means that the United States may have to - at least for the near future.
If Iran is not only removed as a threat to Iraq, but decides that it is ready to serve as an avenue for the Iraqis to break United Nations economic sanctions, then even a temporary accommodation between these two longtime foes could have even more serious implications for Washington.
''Saddam Hussein's main fear now isn't war, but sanctions,'' said Representative Les Aspin, Democrat of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, referring to the Iraqi President. ''Iran has a huge coastline, not to mention sieve-like borders. This is potentially the most serious threat yet to our ability to squeeze Saddam. Like a nightmare that just won't go away, Iran could yet again trip up another American President.'' 
 
A History of Rivalry
It is far too early, however, to say that Iran is actually aligning itself with Iraq. The two countries have long been adversaries, a rivalry spurred by geography and religion. Iraq is a secular state led by minority Sunni Muslims, while Iran is an Islamic republic run by Shiite Muslim clerics. Any rapprochement between them may well be temporary.
For now, Iran stands to gain in many respects: peace with Iraq on its terms, higher oil prices induced by the Iraqi occupation and the subsequent worldwide embargo, from which Iran will profit as an exporter, and greater danger for Saudi Arabia, another bitter foe of Teheran.
The one disadvantage for Iran is the huge buildup of American forces in the Persian Gulf, from which Teheran has long worked to exclude United States influence.
Temporary or not, any lessening of enmity between Baghdad and Teheran has potentially far-reaching consequences. Iran and Iraq have been the only two nations in the Persian Gulf region in the postwar period with the size, population, wealth and military strength to strive for supremacy.
When Iran was economically strong, politically united and heavily armed under the Shah in the 1970's, it called the shots in the region. When Iran and Iraq were at war and neutralizing each other, as they were from 1980 to 1988, the small states around them could breathe easier.
When Iran found itself exhausted after eight years of war with Iraq, President Saddam Hussein of Iraq discovered that he had a virtually free hand in the gulf and that there was nothing restraining him from devouring Kuwait. Saudi Arabia, with its limited population and cautious leadership, could not project enough power to hold him back, and the small gulf oil sheikdoms, like Bahrain, Qatar or the United Arab Emirates were nearly helpless.
As a result, the United States sent forces to the region to counterbalance Iraq's strength by building up Saudi Arabia.
 
U.S. Overtures to Iranians
Some analysts had already begun to suggest that unless the United States could restore the balance of power in the region in the long term by also gradually building up Iran, American troops, or at least naval forces, would have to remain for an indefinite period.
The Bush Administration, through the Swiss and others, began sending out feelers to Teheran to see if a new relationship was possible. American officials were hoping, at a minimum, that the Iranians might be induced to reinforce their troops on their border with Iraq to force Baghdad to divert some of its troops from the Kuwait front.
But, it appears that President Hussein may have beaten the United States to the punch, at least for now.
''If this deal comes off, and if it effectively neutralizes Iran, it is going to be that much more difficult for the United States to withdraw its forces,'' said Robert W. Tucker, an expert on the Persian Gulf at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. ''It would mean that Saddam does not have to fear the one force in the gulf that can really cause him trouble.''
The political reality in the Persian Gulf, Mr. Tucker added, ''is that you have only two powers that can contest for primacy there, Iran and Iraq. That, of course, dooms them to rivalry. On the other hand, anything that produces a temporary peace between them, and even indirect cooperative behavior, puts additional pressure on America to stay. Saudi Arabia does not have the wherewithal to constitute a vibrant presence in the gulf. The Arab gulf states each add up to zero. So zero plus zero is zero.''
 
Comparison to 1939
President Hussein's move has a historical analogy in the 1939 Nazi-Soviet pact, in which the Germans agreed not to attack their strongest opponent on the European continent, the Soviet Union, in return for which the Soviets gave them a free hand in Central Europe.
The Soviets also enabled the Nazis to break the British blockade when World War II erupted by allowing the Germans to import war materiel through Soviet territory.
It is not clear that Iran will provide a similar vehicle for Iraq to violate United Nations sanctions. But the temptation for Iran to profit from Iraq's isolation will be great.
For Washington, however, there may be some good news from the proposed Iranian-Iraqi rapprochement, in that it might be a sign of Baghdad's desperation. Respite for Iraqi Leadership? A senior Administration policymaker said that militarily, today's diplomatic move will not mean much for Iraq, since its top fighting units, the divisions of the Republican Guard, had all already been transferred to the Kuwait front. All that were left manning the Iran-Iraq cease-fire were low-grade infantry units.
Domestically, though, the official said, a settlement of the war with Iran could give President Hussein a little more running room with his population. The war with Iran was unpopular and exhausting. Bringing it to a close could make the Iraqi people slightly more willing to sustain some of the sacrifices that will be required on the Kuwait front.
The official added that the Administration had understood from the start that its forces might have to be in the gulf for a while, in order to maintain the power balance. Even if Iran had been open to a new relationship with Washington, he added, building it up to be an effective counterweight to Iraq would take years.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Bush Says Iraqi Aggression Threatens 'Our Way of Life'

BYLINE: By R W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 15

 BODY:
President Bush told Pentagon employees today that American freedom and ''our way of life'' would suffer if President Saddam Hussein of Iraq ever gained control of Saudi Arabia.
On a day when a senior Baghdad official was quoted as describing the 3,000 or more Americans still trapped in Iraq and occupied Kuwait as ''restrictees'' who would not be released until the crisis in the Middle East was resolved, the President warned President Hussein, ''No one should doubt our staying power or determination.''
Stepping up the military pressure, the Pentagon announced that it would send an undisclosed number of its swallow-tailed, technologically sophisticated F-117 Stealth fighters, designed to evade enemy radar, to join American forces in the Persian Gulf.
Mr. Bush spoke in a strikingly martial setting, with generals and admirals in front of him, rows of brightly colored ribbons glinting on their uniforms. Seeking to picture the American deployment of tens of thousands of troops in the defense of Saudi Arabia as an act of democratic commitment, not economic self-interest, he said that ''we are striking a blow for the principle that might does not make right.'' 
 
'The Moment to Stand Firm'
Officials in the White House inner circle said Mr. Bush was willing to listen to, but unlikely to negotiate on, a peace proposal from the Iraqi President that King Hussein of Jordan is reportedly taking with him to a meeting with the President at his house in Kennebunkport, Me., probably for lunch Thursday. Mr. Bush is also scheduled to meet Thursday with Saud al-Faisal, the Saudi Foreign Minister, and with Prince Bandar, the Ambassador to Washington.
The officials said the Iraqi leader's decision to pull his troops out of Iranian territory and settle remaining issues between Iran and Iraq on Teheran's terms, which was announced this morning, demonstrated that the Iraqi leader was highly vulnerable.
''This is not the moment for us to be making deals,'' one official said. ''It's the moment to stand firm. And besides, if this proposal was really so hot, the King would have pushed hard to deliver it the minute he arrived last night instead of waiting almost 36 hours to hand it over.''
Another official said of King Hussein's peace mission: ''There are a lot of overbuilt expectations. I think that this is a nothing-burger.''
Although the international embargo seemed otherwise intact, and no Iraqi ships challenged the naval blockade set up by the United States and Britain, goods bound for Baghdad continued to be landed at the Jordanian port of Aqaba for onward transport by truck. More than 100 trucks, most laden with grain, were counted rumbling across the border from Jordan into Iraq in just a few hours this morning.
 
President Threatens a Blockade
President Bush threatened on Tuesday to blockade Aqaba if it continued to provide an outlet for Iraqi commerce, and the issue was expected to be an important part of the talks in Kennebunkport.
But Representative Les Aspin, the Wisconsin Democrat who heads the House Armed Services Committee, suggested that it was Teheran that might provide Baghdad with a ''gigantic breach'' in the United Nations sanctions, and experts on the Middle East agreed.
''Saddam wouldn't have done it if he didn't have hopes of getting something out of it,'' said Philip Sabin of King's College, London. ''Otherwise, pulling back like this just weakens his position.''
President Bush spoke at the Pentagon of ''Saddam's ruinous policies of war against other Muslims'' and condemned what he called his ''raw territorial ambition.'' It was the Iraqis, Mr. Bush said, who had made necessary what the President called ''one of the most important deployments of allied military power since World War II.''
''Our jobs, our way of life, our own freedom and the freedom of friendly countries around the world would all suffer if control of the world's great oil reserves fell into the hands of Saddam Hussein,'' the President said. ''A half century ago, our nation and the world paid dearly for appeasing an aggressor who should, and could, have been stopped,'' he added, referring to Hitler.''We are not going to make the same mistake again.''
Vowing once more to force the Iraqis from Kuwait and to restore the Kuwaiti Government, Mr. Bush said he would not allow the ''law of the jungle'' to prevail in the Middle East and pledged, in connection with sanctions, to ''insure that no goods get in and that not one drop of oil gets out.''
An effort to put the naval element of the international military operation under United Nations auspices, which was discussed at the State Department by the five permanent members of the Security Council, each of which has a veto, appeared to hit a snag when China, one of the five, expressed serious doubts about the idea.
In addition, the United States was said to favor a loose arrangement while Moscow, which first broached the idea of international cooperation, was said to want something formal.
With the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy sailing today from Norfolk, Va., and thousands of ground troops arriving daily at Saudi airfields, American and allied military might in the region was building rapidly. But the situation of American civilians in Iraq and Kuwait appeared to take a turn for the worse when the Iraqi Foreign Ministry said that the ''restrictees'' would remain for the duration of the conflict.
Iraq's Ambassador in Washington, Mohammed al-Mashat, contradicted Baghdad's statement. He said of the foreigners in Iraq and Kuwait, ''They are not restricted at all, and will be allowed to leave in good time.''
 
'Something Is Different'
Margaret Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said that even American diplomats and their families had been unable to procure exit visas when their seven-day waiting period expired today. The Iraqis had said a week ago that while others might be held back, those with diplomatic passports could go after paperwork had been processed.
''Something is different,'' Miss Tutwiler conceded. ''Frankly, they are finally admitting behavior contrary to all international norms.''
In Baghdad, Iraq's Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, today called the detention of Americans in Iraq and Kuwait ''temporary precautionary measures'' and pledged that no foreigners would be harmed.
Speaking on the ABC News program ''Nightline,'' Mr. Aziz also said his Government would consider allowing some persons, like those who are ill, to leave more quickly out of ''humanitarian'' concerns.
Nearly 9,000 Soviet citizens were among the hundreds of thousands of foreigners trapped, and the Foreign Ministry spokesman, Yuri Gremitskikh, said in Moscow that Baghdad has agreed to allow all 880 Russians in Kuwait to leave. Also free to go if they wish, he said, are all the Soviet women, children and invalids in Iraq, but not the men, who are about two-thirds of the group.
At the same time, Moscow announced that it was sending a special ambassador, Mikhail Sytenko, a former Deputy Secretary General of the United Nations, on a peacemaking mission to Syria, Jordan, Egypt and Iraq.
Officials at the Ruweishid border station on the Jordanian frontier with Iraq said more than 4,000 foreigners fleeing from the tensions of the region had flooded through in the last 12 hours, but others died crossing the desert in the 120-degree heat. Among those who made it into Jordan were 2,000 Egyptians and 360 Jordanians as well as groups of Syrians, Lebanese, Pakistanis, Indians, Filipinos, Yemenis, Tunisians, Poles and others.
 
Iraqis 'Stealing Everything'
Said Salman, a 40-year-old Egyptian driver, said after arriving from Kuwait, ''The Iraqis stole my video, typewriter and color television.'' Another Egyptian, Saadeddine Hassan, a 36-year-old civil engineer, commented: ''Things are very bad in Kuwait. There is no money in the banks and the Iraqis are stealing everything.''
The Foreign Office in London said that there had been wholesale looting in Kuwait but reported that food and gasoline were still available. Miss Tutwiler said telephone service was sporadic, with only two lines at the American Embassy still working.
Bangladesh joined Pakistan, which made an announcement on Tuesday, in agreeing to send small contingents to join the Syrian, Egyptian and Moroccan soldiers who have already arrived in Saudi Arabia as a result of an Arab League decision to aid the Saudis.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Kuwaiti in U.S. Speaks Of an Exile Leadership

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON Aug. 15

 BODY:
The Kuwaiti government-in-exile is directing an underground armed resistance and a wide assortment of public services inside its country, from garbage removal to emergency medical care, senior Kuwaiti officials said today.
''When the Iraqis invaded, we were in shock,'' said Sheik Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, in an interview in Washington. ''Then we got organized. The people need us.'' 
In a matter of days, Saudi Arabia donated to the exiled Government a building in the mountain resort of Al Taif for various ministries to set up offices, a base near the border at Dhahran for a 5,000-man reconstituted army, and a radio station by which the royal Sabah family communicates with its people. Using Bedouin couriers, officials send letters of instruction and money every day to key bureaucrats who continue to run vital ministries at the behest of exiled ministers.
 
Military Resistance Predicted
The officials say the couriers have sent orders to the underground, which includes Kuwaiti military units and civilians, to begin open military resistance next week. ''They will begin to feel us,'' said Mr. Sabah, the 61-year-old brother of the Emir, adding, ''Ours is like the French exile Government'' during World War II.
The Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein, has said he intends to merge his country and Kuwait into one. His occupation forces have fired the country's top ministers and ambassadors, and he has vowed that the Emir and his family will never return to power. But Kuwaiti officials say the Iraqis are effectively condoning the continued operations of the exiled Government to keep basic services such as health care and garbage removal functioning.
''We are coordinating all health services inside Kuwait,'' said Health Minister Abdulwahab Alfouzan. ''I'm getting good information on what is going on in our hospitals, medical centers - all we need to know. All the ministries are functioning the same, through indirect contacts.'' He said such services were a form of resistance.
''The people who pick up the garbage won't listen to the Iraqis,'' said Mr. Sabah, who is here to meet with President Bush, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. ''They only listen to us.''
The exiled Government and its agents in the field have set up neighborhood committees to take care of police services, garbage collection and emergency health services to supplement the Government.
 
Complicating a Settlement
Should the Emir's Government continue to be able to resist, not only would it make Iraq's occupation more costly, but it might also limit the kind of negotiated settlement that could be arranged for ending the Persian Gulf crisis. The Kuwaiti officials make it clear that they will never accept a compromise in which Iraqi troops leave their country on the condition that a new government is formed.
The Kuwaitis are organizing inside and outside their country. More than 100 Kuwaiti embassies continue to function, coordinating by telephone, telex and fax with the Government office in Al Taif, working to persuade governments to enforce an economic blockade against Iraq. They have also established committees of Kuwaiti students, tourists and residents to take care of the personal problems of Kuwaitis living abroad. They counsel the emotionally distressed, ease communication among family members and even give financial help to people who wish to travel to Arab countries closer to home.
The Kuwait Investment Office, the London-based bureau that handles Kuwaiti investments abroad, still operates, and it serves as the exiled Government's treasury. The office is working with foreign governments to release some frozen Kuwaiti assets in foreign banks to finance the exiled Government's operations. Mr. Sabah said the office was obtaining good cooperation from foreign governments, although it faced much legal red tape.
 
Sadness and Composure
There was deep sadness in Mr. Sabah's eyes, but he remained composed. As he sat among his advisers in a Washington hotel room protected by American Secret Service agents, he gazed from time to time at a television set tuned to CNN. He watched with special interest an interview with the wives of American servicemen on their way to the Saudi desert.
''My brother, five in my family, died in the invasion,'' he said, but quickly added that what made him most sad was ''that one Arab country would invade another.''
Mr. Sabah's escape from his country, along with the escape of his brother, the Emir, was chilling.
''We weren't ready,'' he recalled. ''President Mubarak, King Fahd and King Hussein said there would be no military strike. They told us not to mobilize our forces so not to aggravate Iraq.''
But in the middle of the night, while Mr. Sabah was sleeping, 100,000 Iraqi troops began to pour over the Kuwaiti border.
Mr. Sabah and several Cabinet ministers rushed to army headquarters to monitor the fighting. When it became apparent that Iraqi forces were rushing to take Kuwait City, they called the Emir to wake him for their escape. Not five minutes after they picked him up from the palace, Iraqi helicopters and ground troops attacked the building.
The Emir and his Cabinet fled in a caravan of limousines to the Emir's seaside home at Jelaiah. Shortly afterward, they crossed the Saudi border into exile.
Mr. Sabah said all was not lost. The entire Kuwaiti air force and most of the country's armed forces managed to escape, he said.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
With Loyalty Split, Arab-Americans Fault Hussein, but Question U.S. Too

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 15

 BODY:
Since the onset of the Persian Gulf crisis two weeks ago, most prominent Arab-Americans have joined the chorus of denunciation against President Saddam Hussein of Iraq for his invasion and annexation of Kuwait. Yet at the end of the chorus, Arab-American voices add one word: but.
* But why are the American Government and American news organizations so ready to go beyond condemnation and demonize an Arab leader, evoking images of barbarism that Arab-Americans fear may be rooted as much in ethnic stereotypes as in Mr. Hussein's own history?
* But why does Iraq's crossing of Kuwait's border lead to a rapid deployment of American troops and warplanes to Saudi Arabia, when Israel's crossing into Lebanon in 1982 provoked no such action? 
* And always there, though often muted: But what will happen to us?
''It's a serious emotional and political burden when your country is fighting your people,'' said Khalil Jahshan, a Palestinian who handles public relations for the National Association of Arab-Americans.
 
A Concept of Nationhood
Mr. Jahshan was one of a number of prominent Arab-Americans, interviewed in recent days, who responded to the crisis with both dispassionate analysis and emotional reflection on the history that unites and divides their people.
Among Arab-Americans, as in the Arab world, the concept of Arab nationhood - of respect, power and influence for an entire people - exerts a powerful pull, Mr. Jahshan said. ''It's not a movement, not a political party,'' he went on. ''It's basically an emotional desire for Arabs to be one. It's based on the notion of a glorious Arab past, and it's reinforced by the failures of recent history.''
The drawing and redrawing of national boundaries in the Middle East over the last century have left the two and a half million Arab-Americans with emotional ties to both present and former lands - Jordan, Syria, Palestine, Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq - and to a larger concept of kinship.
''When I was growing up in a Lebanese Maronite home in Utica, N.Y., and an Egyptian would come and visit, we kids would be in the kitchen wanting to get a peek at him because he was one of our guys,'' said James Zogby, the 44-year-old president of the Arab American Institute, a Washington lobbying group. ''There is a sense of commonness in culture, tradition and language.''
The ''serious emotional and political burden'' cited by Mr. Jahshan can result from a clash between that sense of unity and Arab-Americans' sense of loyalty to the United States. ''For Arab-Americans, this is their first country,'' said Osama Siblani, a native of Lebanon who is publisher of Sada al-Watan, a Detroit newspaper whose circulation of 20,000 makes it the largest Arab-American paper in the United States. ''America is where they chose to live. They fled persecution, oppression and poverty. And now they will try to prevent a catastrophe on both ends.''
 
Focus of Dialogue Changes
The crisis in the Persian Gulf has wrenched the Arab-American dialogue away from its usual focus on Israel and the Palestinian question and into equally complex terrain involving the Arab states' relations with one another and the resentment of the impoverished Arab countries toward the sheikdoms enriched by oil. But Israel and the perceived inequities of American policy in the Middle East are never far beneath the surface.
Mr. Zogby, Mr. Jahshan and others repeatedly invoke the comparison with Israel's 1982 invasion, although the comparison does not take into account a crucial difference: that Kuwait had not attacked Iraq, while southern Lebanon was home to Palestinian bases that had repeatedly shelled Israeli territory. Still, the distinction does little to eliminate the perception of Arab-Americans that United States policy in the Middle East has not been evenhanded.
''Kuwait must be restored,'' said Mr. Zogby. ''Saudi Arabia must be defended. But it is incumbent on America, if we want to win the hearts and minds of the Arab people, to be consistent to principle.'' He said Arab-Americans were ''looking to see that this is more than just a defense of oil.''
Many Arab-Americans share another concern: that an American campaign against an Arab state, in this case Iraq, could lead to a backlash against Arabs at home. James G. Abourezk, a Lebanese-American who is a former Senator from South Dakota and now heads the American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said a violent anti-Arab telephone message had recently been left on an answering machine at the group's Western regional headquarters. In 1985, at the time of the hijacking of the cruise ship Achille Lauro by a group of Palestinians, the Anti-Discrimination Committee's Western regional director, Alex Odeh, was killed by a bomb in his office. No one has been convicted or even indicted for the attack.
 
Borders Are Colonial
''By and large the Arab community supports the economic sanctions'' imposed against Iraq by the United Nations, Mr. Abourezk said, ''but I think they are very much opposed to U.S. troop intervention.'' If war breaks out between Arabs and Americans, he said, ''it's not going to be comfortable for people of Arab descent.''
Hisham Melhem, a Lebanese who was the Washington correspondent for al-Qabas, the leading Kuwaiti newspaper, said: ''Most Arabs, emotionally and intellectually, when they look at the map and see the borders among the gulf states or among Lebanon and Syria, Jordan and Iraq, they know that these were not historic national boundaries but boundaries drawn by colonial powers.''
People do not want to live in a country controlled by Mr. Hussein, Mr. Melhem went on, ''because they know how repressive he is.'' But he indicated that he was troubled by the reaction of Americans to the Iraqi President. Mr. Hussein has ''taken over Khomeini's position,'' he said.
''It seems now, beyond Communism, you like to look for someone who is the embodiment of evil,'' he said. ''If it's not Arafat, it's Qaddafi. If not Qaddafi, Noriega. If not Noriega, then it's Saddam. Saddam obviously is a dictator and has his place in the hierarchy of dictatorship. But he is not Hitler.''

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
Again, a U.S. Surprise Leaves Nations Upset

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 15

 BODY:
When Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d got a cat-that-swallowed-the-canary look during a Sunday morning talk show and announced an American ''interdiction'' of Iraqi commerce at sea, he set off alarm bells among startled world leaders.
By Monday, just days after Washington had galvanized global opposition to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, members of the Security Council were charging in a closed meeting at the United Nations that an impatient American President was imposing a blockade, calling it something else, using a questionable legal formula to justify it and doing it without telling anybody.
Those events reinforce two plain truths: how difficult it is in general for the United States to consult, even with its friends, and how quickly this image-obsessed Administration in particular can reverse itself in the face of a public outcry.
For all George Bush's personal diplomacy - his middle-of-the-night telephone calls to heads of state, his insistence that he has to know someone personally before he can do business with him and the constant talk of the need for collective action - people who know him well say he basically prefers to go it alone. 
In his news conference on Tuesday, Mr. Bush dismissed the criticism of the blockade as nitpicking, saying ''it doesn't disturb me in the least.'' A State Department official testily added, ''We're not going to tell everybody everything.''
But in the background, as the voices grew louder, there was a frantic effort to quiet things down. Mr. Baker got on the telephone with French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, saying, yes, perhaps the United States should have consulted more and assuring them that the United States wanted their help to enforce the embargo. Robert M. Kimmitt, the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, called in the ambassadors of France, Britain, China and the Soviet Union to propose putting warships in the Persian Gulf under United Nations auspices.
''The White House was clearly surprised by our reaction,'' said one Western official familiar with the Security Council meeting. ''It was a clumsy move because the sanctions in place were working beautifully. The Americans are not going to say it, but they gave us the impression they made a mistake. But why were the Americans in so much of a rush?''
One answer is that the American way of doing things is to do them fast, particularly when force is involved. Privately, American officials will say that consultations and consensus sometimes gum up the works.
The Reagan Administration repeatedly took unilateral actions that disturbed America's closest allies. In 1984, for example, the United States began withdrawing marines from Lebanon with only an hour's notice to the French and Italians, who suddenly had to scramble to get their own soldiers out. And at one point during the reflagging of Kuwaiti ships in 1988 the United States decided - alone and with scant warning - to attack Iranian oil rigs, leaving other nations' ships in the Persian Gulf unprepared.
This Administration has tried to do better, but Mr. Bush has not kicked the secrecy habit. He says over and over that he does not need to tell everybody everything he is doing. Since assuming office his standard response to tough questions about his intentions is ''Stay tuned.''
Latin Americans were furious when the United States invaded Panama last December without telling them, European allies were peeved when the Administration closed its embassy in Afghanistan with no notice last year and Asians were stunned when Washington withdrew its support for the opposition coalition in Cambodia last month.
For the moment, the behind-the-scenes smoothing of ruffled feathers is working. The Soviets are pleased that the Americans have seized the idea of a gulf force sponsored by the United Nations. Other countries are satisfied that the Administration is not ignoring them.
''Fundamentally the Americans have not changed their position, but they are now trying to accommodate our sensitivities,'' said a European official. ''Still, there's this American tendency to work by itself. But George Bush knows the importance of public relations.''

HEADLINE: False Arguments for Fancy Weapons

 BODY:
In the wake of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, some siren voices are inviting Congress to quit cutting the defense budget and restore money for threatened programs like the B-2 bomber and the Osprey transport plane. That's the way, they say, to maintain an indisputable military edge over third world dictators. The briefest reflection shows this to be pernicious advice. 
It's probably true that the B-2 bomber would be less vulnerable to Iraqi air defenses than the B-52's now available. And a plane like the tilt-rotor Osprey, a novel aircraft with many advantages over the helicopter, would also be nice to have.
But these weapons were designed during the Reagan defense buildup to be used in the context of the cold war. Their utility against countries like Iraq is marginal - and far outweighed by their enormous costs. At least $37 billion could now be saved by canceling the B-2 program and $24 billion by giving up the Osprey.
In confronting Saddam Hussein, the Pentagon does indeed find itself short of equipment - not glamorous weapons like B-2's or Ospreys but mundane items that it disdained to buy during the buildup years. The Navy always prefers to spend for warships than for mere transports to ferry the Army around. Former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger let the services buy whatever they wanted - and now the Navy finds it has so few fast transports that it can move only one division at a time to the Middle East.
Minesweepers are another type of humble craft that ranks far down on the Navy's priority list, even though mines are a Soviet specialty and an obvious defense for third world countries. When an Iraqi tanker was suspected of laying mines in the Persian Gulf on Tuesday, the Navy had three aircraft carriers in the region but no minesweepers.
If Iraq should attack American forces, the Air Force's most useful aircraft will be not its beloved B-2 but the A-10, a dedicated tank-busting plane but so slow, cheap and unglamorous that the Air Force has closed down its production line.
America's military capability against countries like Iraq depends on tactics, training and workhorse equipment. The stealth technologies in the B-2, and the valuable tilt-rotor technology of the Osprey, warrant development. But the chief value of these gilded weapons now lies in the fortune that can be saved by not building them.
Those savings are all the more urgent given the other pressures on the Federal budget. Pentagon spending needs to be reshaped, and the first step is to curb systems designed to meet the now-shrinking threat from the Soviet Union. Congress and the services find all reductions painful, but the first retrenchments have been made.
Secretary Cheney made another on Monday in deciding to stretch out purchases of the Seawolf nuclear attack submarine and the Aegis cruiser. Since these decisions are based on the diminishing Soviet threat, the crisis in the Middle East is no reason for reversing them.
Congress should no more listen to the special interests urging a slower cut in the Pentagon's budget than Odysseus's men should have heeded the enchantress Circe, who turned them into pigs. With serious turbulence both abroad and in the economy, this is an occasion when the national interest transcends mere pork.

HEADLINE: Kill the Fresh Kills Plan

 BODY:
New York City's Board of Estimate is likely to reject a Dinkins administration proposal today that would help short-term revenues but hurt long-term garbage disposal capacity. The board is on the right track; the plan is flawed and the city would be unwise to try to revive it later. 
City Hall hoped to raise money by reducing the dumping fees that commercial carters pay to use the city's only landfill - Fresh Kills, on Staten Island. The relatively high fees at Fresh Kills now send carters in search of less expensive landfills outside the city; lower fees would encourage them to return.
Reducing the fee from $40 to $25 a cubic yard would add an estimated $18 million to the city treasury - a most attractive thought, given the city's faltering economy. But Fresh Kills would fill up with garbage more quickly.
That wouldn't be a problem if the city had developed a coherent, long-range program for disposing of solid waste. It hasn't. Present recycling efforts will help, but not enough, and Mayor David Dinkins has yet to approve former Mayor Edward Koch's proposal for huge incinerators. For now, that leaves only Fresh Kills, and it is rapidly running out of space.
The board has ample cause to reject the idea. And City Hall would do well to drop it and get on with the business of developing a comprehensive plan for disposing of solid waste.

HEADLINE: As New England Goes, So May Go the Nation

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I take no issue with the findings of your July 23 front-page article that the worst recession in the United States has taken hold in New England, nor with the bleak opinions offered by the professional economists. But as a native New Englander and a noneconomist, I would like to offer my own analysis.
The problems of New England (and indeed other areas of the country) stretch far beyond the ups and downs of the last 25 years of the ''technological revolution.'' They are American problems anchored in industrial and investment patterns of at least a century and a half. 
In talking to remaining and transplanted New Englanders over the last decade, I find the consensus is that the region's economic turnaround, while dramatic and obviously good for many professionals, was not founded on bedrock.
For longtime residents, the ''miracle'' was elusive and illusory. Yes, there was no limit to service jobs at moderate-to-good wages, but many offered minimal benefits. Better jobs with leading companies offering a full range of benefits were restricted to those with specialized skills and, often, advanced education. Many higher paid workers were young newcomers recruited from other parts of the country. For those with only average education, there was always the feeling that the phenomenal growth of the 1980's was fragile.
Although mill towns such as Lowell, Mass., did benefit from high technology and Government grants, many former manufacturing centers simply languished, beset by urban ills, such as drugs and unemployment. To say that New England's economic resurgence never existed is to fly in the face of reliable figures. But the turnaround was spotty; some benefited, some did not.
One of the crazy-quilt elements in American life is that populations continually change. This was the story of New England in the 1960's and 70's, with its once prominent textile mills dead or dying and its light industry facing regional and foreign competition. Many of the best, the brightest and the youngest left New England in these years - and this continues today. Contemporaneous with this outmigration was inmigration. What is more significant is the polarized composition of this inmigration.
In the late 1960's and 70's, with the economy booming, people in many parts of the country (including many New Yorkers) began to cast longing glances toward New England. The region is blessed with beauty, including both seashore and mountains, and as the oldest section of the country, enjoys arguably the most cohesive, settled and ultimately human culture in the United States. In the 70's, a trickle of newcomers seeking to start businesses or perhaps to retire began to penetrate the more picturesque sections of Vermont and New Hampshire. Soon they would be joined by hordes of the equally well off and well educated, eager to settle and puzzle out the sayings of the natives.
Other portions of New England would experience an entirely different influx. In Bridgeport, Stonington, Providence, Boston, Ludlow, Lowell and other industrial cities - once bustling and now neglected - hundreds and then thousands of polyglot immigrants would arrive throughout the 70's and 80's. The impetus would be the economic and social promise of America weighed against the political and economic difficulties of their own countries. This latest migration consisted of Azoreans and Cape Verdeans, Puerto Ricans, Central and South Americans, and even a few Eastern Europeans.
As a population, these newcomers remain among the most marginal. Many are ill housed, most work in low-paying, uncertain jobs. Their families require extensive social services, yet because of language and cultural differences, many have already found it difficult, often impossible, to join the mainstream. In many respects their prospects are narrower than immigrants arriving before World War II. Industrial jobs are shrinking, and an uncertain technological revolution requires increasing education and technical skills.
One feels that if Dickens were to walk through the back streets of Lowell or New Bedford in 1990, he would instantly recognize the urban poor and a choking wave of despair. As the 21st century approaches, New England as an economic entity must answer this question: Can the oldest section of the nation overcome the burden of an aging infrastructure and a disparate working population, while demonstrating that a highly technical service economy can work? There is a lot riding on the answer, and it is of concern to all Americans.
New Englanders new and old have no lack of fortitude in their rocky, sometimes quirky corner of the nation. One hopes that the latest flattening of the economic curve is just a deviation. Still, there are no guarantees that a service and technical economy can be secure. If there is any bright side, it might well be that East Germans and Poles now struggling with the vagaries of market economies and nascent democracies can take heart from the New England experience: there are no easy answers.

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
Iraq and Atom Bombs

BYLINE: By A. M. Rosenthal

 BODY:
In 1981, a small country recognized a deadly danger to its existence. In a courageous act of self-preservation the country struck out militarily to save itself. In doing so, that country benefited not only itself but the world.
Nine years later, the danger has risen again - and again it is to all the nations. The challenge and opportunity to end it now fall to a great power. 
On June 7, 1981, Israeli planes bombed the Iraqi nuclear reactor near Baghdad. It thus prevented the Iraqi dictatorship from developing atomic bombs that were supposed to be its crucial instruments of blackmail, fear and death.
Much of the world screeched at Israel, a classic demonstration of global hypocrisy. But in truth every nation understood that Israel had moved the world one step back from self-destruction.
Then, blind with greed and suicidally stupid with self-delusion, the Arabs, the West and the Soviet Union stuffed Saddam Hussein with money, weapons and the material that allowed him to rebuild his nuclear weapon potential. He built a new plant near Turkey and every day moves closer to the bomb.
Saddam has used other weapons from which the world thought it was safe - chemicals that burn and choke before killing. He used them in Iran and against his people at home.
Who will now guarantee that this killer, once armed with nuclear bombs for the delivery missiles he already has, will never carry out or threaten a nuclear strike?
Shall we ask the State Department experts who said Saddam would never invade Kuwait? And while they are at it, can they also guarantee that Saddam will never slip a few of the bombs in his nuclear arsenal to his gangs of roving terrorists to stash away in some Middle Eastern warren - or in a Western city?
We are even now afraid to try to rescue our hostages, including the new thousands Saddam has taken in Kuwait and Iraq. Who will dare act against terrorists when they are armed with nuclear weapons?
We are at war with Iraq. When Iraq struck at vital U.S. economic interests and President Bush properly responded with blockade, that was war.
The questions now are how it will be fought and how it will be ended.
Saddam and assorted vassals, such as King Hussein of Jordan, did not expect Mr. Bush to react with such courage and force. Even some of Saddam's Arab ''brothers'' find themselves forced to stand up to him for awhile, to save their necks.
But the West would be even more foolish than usual to forget that some of our new Arab allies gave him billions of dollars before he threatened them directly. The biggest contributors to the Iraqi war chest were Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
They would be slaveringly happy to give Saddam money and weapons again as long as he went after somebody else - say, Israel.
So Saddam shrewdly sends word that he is ready for a deal, some arrangement allowing him to get ready for the next move. Maybe he would even be willing to save the bank accounts of the Kuwaiti Emir and his oil-fat family - for a cut, of course.
Saddam would keep his job and army and build his nuclear threat. In a couple of years, he will be ready again to grab for international domination. This time he will be armed with nuclear weapons stockpiled at home and scattered in his various terrorist bases abroad.
Rest easy, we will be told by our experts, he will never dare to use or threaten the use of nuclear weapons. Maybe they will be right at last. But suppose they are wrong, just one more time?
If Saddam wants peace to regroup, the minimum price must be the destruction of his nuclear plants, missile factories and launching pads.
After the embargo is tight enough to hurt Saddam, the United States should give him a short time - a few days - to permit the entry of an international team to supervise the destruction. If he does not accept, the United States should do it from the air, with its allies or without.
Yes, Israel will still have nuclear capacity. That will be a danger to the West - provided Israel surrenders democracy for despotism, cries Holy War against the West, takes our hostages and threatens our economic independence.
Pretending democratic friends and tyrannical enemies are the same helped bring us Hitler, Stalin and Saddam Hussein.
A peace that leaves Saddam Hussein ever able to lift a nuclear bomb in threat would be a betrayal of all American forces that are sent now to put him down - or that will face him in the future.

To Borough Chief, Ballroom Issue Is No Waltz

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
For more than a decade as a City Council member with little power and a staff that never exceeded six, Ruth W. Messinger was a thorn in the side of some of the most important people in New York City.
Now, as Manhattan borough president with a staff of more than 100, Ms. Messinger is still needling the establishment of which she has become a bigger part. But she also has some unaccustomed arrowheads in her own hide, more than a few of them fired by her friends.
''I don't know why she has gone that way,'' said Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch. 
''I was somewhat incensed,'' said State Senator Franz S. Leichter.
The fuss is over Ms. Messinger's challenge to Columbia University's plan to build a commercial biomedical center - intended to draw new businesses - on the site of the historic but crumbling Audubon Ballroom in Washington Heights.
The plan is backed by the community board and elected officials from the area, and by Mayor David N. Dinkins, whose administration crafted a compromise to save part of the ballroom, where Malcolm X was assassinated in 1965. But some preservationists and civil rights advocates want more, and Ms. Messinger, out-Dinkinsing Dinkins, has sided with them.
''I've got 15 major development items and 1,000 contracts to vote on,'' she said, a bit surprised at the stir. ''This was not where I planned to stake my claim.''
Whether Ms. Messinger will have to vote on the Audubon plan is unclear. It remains on the agenda for the last meeting of the Board of Estimate, which begins today. But using her powers under an obscure state law, she has already vetoed $8.1 million in funds from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey that had been earmarked for the $34 million project, unless her conditions are met. She wants to preserve the whole ballroom, make space for community groups and get guarantees on jobs for local residents.
Her old ally, Senator Leichter, whose district includes the neighborhood and who has sought to block a few development deals in his time, and Representative Charles B. Rangel, Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell and Councilman Stanley E. Michels think that's too much.
''The likely result of your action is a continued deterioration of the Audubon Ballroom with a consequent negative effect on the community, no memorial to Malcolm X and no economic development for northern Manhattan,'' they wrote her last week.
''When you reach the level that she's on,'' Mr. Leichter said, ''and you're asked to really produce something and do it in a climate that's quite different from the homogeneous hothouse climate of her political viewpoint, you just can't state all the ideal positions.''
Richard D. Emery, who represents a preservation group, the Sugar Hill Historical Society, called Ms. Messinger's decision ''courageous and wise.'' State Senator David Paterson of Harlem supports her, too. But she remains more alone than usual, or than any politician likes to be.
In her campaign last year, Ms. Messinger, a former social worker, tried hard to persuade people that for all her liberal crusading, she was not the anti-business, anti-development bomb thrower some feared. Now some of the old labels are back. Last week, a Daily News editorial called her Lady Macbeth.
''I don't think people should make a judgment on this one case,'' said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, ''although it is very troubling that she has taken such a position on a project that may now not be able to proceed, and with Columbia, an institution that is really sticking its neck out in trying to bring some new industries to New York.''
Ms. Messinger has raised objections to a number of other projects, but her stand on the Audubon may have as much to do with demanding clout and respect from her old friend the Mayor as anything else, especially with the Estimate Board on its deathbed and the borough presidents left trying to make something of untested roles under the new City Charter.
''If anybody can do that, Ruth can,'' Mr. Spinola said. ''She's exceptionally shrewd.''
''I think generally people have felt she's done an excellent job and not adhered to any rigid anti-development policy at all,'' said Nathan Leventhal, a former deputy mayor and now the president of Lincoln Center. ''I don't think this indicates anything other than a disagreement on this point.''
In fact, Ms. Messinger and the city are still talking, and senior mayoral aides said there might be a glimmer of progress. ''The notion is to negotiate a favorable agreement on that site,'' Ms. Messinger said. ''It will not, to be sure, satisfy every constituency that we've heard from.''

HEADLINE: Jail for Crime That Shocked Even the Jaded

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN

 BODY:
After a trial that shocked even veteran Bronx prosecutors yet drew scant public attention, a young Bronx man received the maximum prison sentence yesterday for the 1988 murder of an Israeli immigrant who had employed one of his friends.
After strangling the man with a shoelace and stabbing him, 19-year-old Angel Diaz and four other youths took the subway from the Bronx to Brooklyn. There, after snacking on doughnuts, they donned Halloween masks to rob, beat and gang-rape the man's wife and 16-year-old daughter. The women were then sexually tortured while the man's 3-year-old daughter watched from her crib. 
''You have committed some of the most heinous crimes in recent memory,'' Justice Antonio I. Brandveen of State Supreme Court told Mr. Diaz, who rolled his eyes toward the courtroom's brass chandeliers. ''Yet you have no remorse.'' Then he sentenced Mr. Diaz to 38Y years to life for his conviction last month on 13 counts of murder, robbery, burglary and conspiracy.
 
Grew Up Together
Mr. Diaz was acquitted on four counts of rape even though the man's wife and daughter flew back from Israel to testify that all five of the youths who broke into their Starrett City apartment had sexually assaulted them.
Victor Sanchez, a 21-year-old man who had worked for the Israeli man on small construction jobs and driving a livery limousine, admitted he planned the murder and recruited friends to help him. He was sentenced late last year to 15 years to life. Dutvall Guzman, now 17, who strangled the man and then tortured his wife and daughter with a bedpost, curling iron and umbrella, also pleaded guilty. Late last year he was sentenced as a juvenile to eight years to life in jail.
Two other youths, Brando Campos, 16, and Luis Gonzalez, 17, have pleaded not guilty and are to go on trial next week.
Friends said some of the youths grew up together, and all of them lived in the same apartment building at 1420 Grand Concourse in the Highbridge section.
Like the judge, assistant district attorneys who have for years moved criminals through the Bronx county courthouse and even homicide detectives at the 41st Precinct, said they had difficulty recalling a crime more lurid.
Many pointedly insisted that in the elaborate planning, the case was more horrific than even that of the jogger who was attacked in Central Park last year. And some took it as a measure of the volume of local violence that by contrast, the Bronx killing has received relatively little notice, either in the borough or by the press.
''It's really a horror story,'' said Mr. Diaz's lawyer, Paul I. Auerbach, who has handled many sex cases for years. ''But nobody was there to hear it. It was like a tree in the forest.''
As Justice Brandveen vowed to send a message with his sentence that the city would not tolerate wanton brutality, the courtroom was nearly filled with spectators. But when Mr. Diaz was led away in handcuffs, only his mother, aunt, and 16-year-old girlfriend left with him. Most of the others, defendants and their relatives, stayed behind to wait their turn.
 
'We Believe in the System'
Mr. Diaz, dressed in baggy white shorts, a loose-fitting polka dot shirt and green leather sneakers, said nothing in his defense. He showed concern only when his mother, Norma Diaz, and his 16-year-old girlfriend broke down in loud, uncontrollable sobs.
In her appeal for a harsh sentence, Cindy Zamzok, an assistant district attorney, noted that Mr. Diaz had been arrested four times for burgularies, robberies and assault before he turned 16. And she recalled that in speaking to the murdered man's wife and daughter, whose names have been withheld because of the sexual assaults, she had told them that probably nothing could expunge their nightmares or compensate their loss.
''No,'' Ms. Zamzok quoted the women as responding. ''We believe in the system. That's why we came back from Israel to New York to testify.''
In the courtroom gallery, Mr. Diaz's girlfriend, Diane Colon, loudly dismissed the system with an expletive.
Mr. Diaz was arrested after his mother and stepfather, suspicious of the money and new clothes he suddenly appeared with, went to tell detectives about a crime in which they thought his friends might have been involved. Mr. Diaz, who was unemployed, had told them he earned the money by beating up a crack addict for a friend. It was not known whether the clothes he wore in court yesterday were among those he bought with his share of the more than $5,000 stolen from the victims. Just Like Jean Valjean? Detectives found Mr. Diaz on Oct. 21, four days after the killing, in a delivery room at Bronx Lebanon Hospital. Miss Colon, then 14, was giving birth to the couple's daughter, Crystal.
Yesterday, Mr. Auerbach began the hearing by requesting an adjournment until after Sept. 5, which he said would be Mr. Diaz's next opportunity to marry Miss Colon on Rikers Island. The judge refused. In Mr. Diaz's defense, Mr. Auerbach likened him to Jean Valjean, the honest peasant in Victor Hugo's ''Les Miserables.'' Valjean begins by stealing a loaf of bread and hardens as a criminal in an unforgiving system of justice until he is belatedly given a chance at redemption.
''My client intended to steal to feed his family,'' Mr. Auerbach said. Justice Brandveen ignored the plea. ''These crimes are beyond anyone's worst nightmares,'' he said. ''It is the recommendation of this court that you should serve all of your sentence without the possibility of parole.''

Man Held in Robbing Of 31 Elderly People

DATELINE: PARKCHESTER

 BODY:
An unemployed man was charged yesterday with robbing 31 elderly people during a crime spree that began in January in the Parkchester section of the Bronx, the police said.
The suspect, Ramiro Serita, 33 years old, of 2264 Waterbury Avenue in the Schuylerville section of the Bronx, was identified yesterday by several of the victims at a lineup in the 43d Precinct station house, the police said. 
Mr. Serita was arrested at 1:15 P.M. on Tuesday after a resident of a building at 1480 Parkchester Road who had just been robbed pointed him out on the street to the police, said a police spokeswoman, Officer Janice Swinney. ''He would follow senior citizens into the lobby of their buildings, then into the elevator, where he would rob them at knifepoint,'' she said.
The robbery Tuesday fit that pattern, she said, adding that the police had recovered a 5-inch kitchen knife.
None of the victims - who lost a total of about $1,000 - was injured, Officer Swinney said. Mr. Serita was charged with first-degree robbery, possession of stolen property and possession of a weapon.

Eli Lilly Facing Million-Dollar Suits On Its Antidepressant Drug Prozac

BYLINE: By NATALIE ANGIER

 BODY:
As reports mount that the nation's most widely prescribed antidepressant drug may spark violent or suicidal behavior in a fraction of patients, lawyers and former users of the medication are banding together to file multimillion-dollar lawsuits against the drug's maker.
In the last three weeks, six lawsuits have been lodged against Eli Lilly & Company of Indianapolis, who manufactures Prozac, seeking a total of more than $300 million in punitive and compensatory damages. Lawyers working on the cases say that they and other lawyers are planning to file dozens of suits in the next few weeks.
Although the specifics vary from case to case, the plaintiffs of all six suits generally charge the maker of Prozac with failure to have tested the drug properly before introducing it on the market in 1987. The suits also contend that Eli Lilly was ''grossly negligent'' for not warning doctors strongly and clearly enough that the antidepressant may sometimes set off aggressive, violent or suicidal behavior. 
The lawyers maintain that while their clients were taking Prozac, they became far more hostile, despairing and uncontrollable than they had ever been before, committing extreme acts of self-mutilation, attempting suicide and endangering their families. The lawyers attribute the violence to the psychiatric medication. They say that by presenting its product as relatively safe and free of significant side effects, Eli Lilly has made claims that are ''shocking, absurd and totally misleading,'' said Leonard L. Finz, who heads a New York firm specializing in product liability cases.
 
Lawyers Relying on Report
All lawyers are relying on a report published in the American Journal of Psychiatry in February by Dr. Martin H. Teicher and his colleagues at Harvard Medical School and McLean Hospital. In that paper, Dr. Teicher described six patients who were free of suicidal tendencies until they started on Prozac. His findings led him to predict that from 1.9 to 7.7 percent of Prozac users may be at risk for mania, obsession with suicide and dangerously violent behavior.
Spokesmen for Eli Lilly, while refusing to discuss the details of any cases under litigation, insist that Prozac was well tested before being marketed, and that it is remarkably safe.
''Certainly our product was adequately tested,'' said Edward West, director of corporate communications. ''Laboratory testing began in 1976. More than 11,000 people participated in clinical trials. To date, more than 2 million patients worldwide have been treated with Prozac. Our experience with Prozac does not show a cause-and-effect relationship between it and suicidal thoughts or acts. Our safety track record has been well established.''
In the last few months, the Food and Drug Administration has received about 10,000 reports from doctors, pharmacists and others of adverse reactions to Prozac. But Dr. Paul Leber, director of the division of neuropharmacological drug products at the agency, said that the vast majority of reported side effects, like agitation or insomnia, are relatively mild and are included on the list of warnings that accompany the drug's packaging.
 
Caution by F.D.A. Official
Of more severe reactions, he said it was hard to prove a cause-and-effect relationship.
''The trouble is that most of the symptoms described, like violence or suicidal tendencies, are symptoms well known to accompany depression,'' Dr. Leber said. ''To date, we don't see anything about this drug that is associated with an increased risk'' of violence or suicidal tendencies.
Dr. Leber and other experts note that, Prozac notwithstanding, depressed patients are at strong suicide risks. They said that no single treatment for depression was completely effective, and that a certain fraction of patients receiving Prozac or any other medication would be expected to fail to respond to the treatment and thus to continue being at risk for suicide. ''Ten percent of people with a lifelong depressive illnesses probably will kill themselves,'' said Dr. Leber.
Medical experts are mixed in their response to the recent lawsuits against Prozac. On one hand, psychiatrists and other doctors say that many of the latest complaints are exaggerated and misleading.
They insist that Prozac is an extremely valuable drug for treating depression, and say that it has far fewer side effects than do the older generation of antidepressant drugs. The lack of unpleasant side effects like weight gain, sluggishness, dry mouth and hypertension has lofted Prozac to its current position as the best-selling antidepressant.
But a growing number of experts worry that the ease of using Prozac, along with early hyperbolic reports that described Prozac as ''miracle drug,'' has led to its being overprescribed.
 
Hopes on Future Drug Use
''My main concern about Prozac is that, given the low incidence of side effects, the likelihood has increased that people would use it more casually, and that doctors would monitor its use less intensely,'' said Dr. Frederick K. Goodwin, director of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration and the government's top psychiatrist. ''But this is a powerful drug, and any powerful drug will have powerful side effects. The backlash effect of all this adverse publicity probably will lead to a correction that won't hurt.''
Other doctors agree that if the publicity spurs doctors to be more judicious in prescribing Prozac and more vigilant in monitoring patients taking the drug, the new caution is for the best. But they said they would hate to see Prozac go the way of Bendectin, a drug marketed by Merrill-Dow to treat nausea associated with pregnancy.
In the early 1980's, several lawsuits were brought against the company, contending that the medication caused birth defects. Experts say that there was little or no scientific support for the claims, but as a result of the cost of the litigation, Merrill-Dow took Bendectin off the market.
Mr. West of Lilly said that while the company never comments on specific dollar figures for any particular product, sales for Prozac remain strong. ''There is no basis for even considering'' discontinuing the drug, he said.
Despite the difficulty of proving that Prozac causes violence, lawyers seem eager to pursue litigation. ''There's been a deluge of people coming to us,'' said Terry Hawkins, a lawyer with Morris, Hawkins & Dutton, in Louisville, Ky. ''Right now we're investigating eight or nine cases.''
 
Suits After Shooting Spree
Mr. Hawkins's firm represents three widows who are charging the pharmaceutical giant with partial responsibility for the deaths of their husbands. The men were among the eight people murdered and 12 others who were wounded when Joseph Wesbecker, an unemployed printer, went on a shooting spree last year at a printing plant in Louisville where he had worked. Mr. Wesbecker then turned the gun on himself.
An autopsy revealed that Mr. Wesbecker had ''therapeutic'' doses of Prozac in his blood at the time. He also had traces of other medications in his blood, as well as a history of mental disorders, but the lawyers in the case contend that Prozac transformed Mr. Wesbecker from a relatively innocuous if disturbed man into a homicidal maniac.
''We're looking at a man with a history of psychiatric problems, but he had never before done anything to carry them out,'' said Mr. Hawkins. ''He was never violent until he started on Prozac.''
The suits, filed on July 25, seek $50 million each in punitive damages from Lilly and unspecified amounts in compensatory damages.
The three other suits that have been filed involve former Prozac users who came close to committing suicide. In early August, Mr. Finz filed a suit seeking $150 million from Lilly on behalf of Rhonda Hala, a Long Island woman who was given Prozac to treat depression, which he said she had developed after a back injury left her slightly disabled.
While taking the drug, he said, ''she started to exhibit extreme and bizarre behavior. She attacked her doctor and herself, mutilating her chest, legs, stomach, anything to cut into the flesh.'' Mr. Finz said that when she was taken off the drug, her violent behavior ended. But he said ''there is no part of her body left that isn't scarred and mutilated.''
 
Other Suits Against Lilly
On Aug. 8, lawyers in Chicago filed a suit for a salesman in his early 50's, who had been treated for depression since 1985, but who never did anything violent until receiving Prozac in September 1989. Two months later, said his lawyer, Aron D. Robinson of Chicago, ''he attempted suicide by driving his car into the rear of a tractor-trailer.''
Another suit was filed on Aug. 7 in Indianapolis on behalf of Janet Sims, who says she was given Prozac to help her through her marital difficulties, but that she ended up being manic and obsessively suicidal. ''I ended up needing 15 electroshock treatments, just because I'd become suicidal from the Prozac,'' she said.
Dr. Teicher of Harvard says it is unclear why Prozac seems to occasionally spark violence or mania in patients. He says that all antidepressants can cause people to carry out their violent or suicidal fantasies. ''If patients were suicidal before taking antidepressants, their energy level may have been so low that they couldn't act on the impulse,'' he said. ''Sometimes antidepressants can energize them to go ahead and commit suicide before the drugs have a chance to relieve the depression itself.''
But Dr. Teicher believes Prozac is different than the older generation of antidepressants. ''In a small percentage of cases it will take people who aren't suicidal to become preoccupied with suicide,'' he said.
 
Speculation on Effects
He speculates that Prozac may on rare occasions have that effect because it influences the balance of serotonin, a chemical signal in the brain that is involved in emotion and aggressive behavior. The older antidepressants work largely through other signaling pathways in the brain, he said, affecting the neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine, which do not seem to be as directly involved in modulating aggressive impulses.
''It's possible that the neurochemistry of people who do badly on Prozac is more sensitive, or out of balance in a very particular way,'' he said. ''But it's amazing how little we really do know about the serotonin system.'' But Dr. Teicher said many of his fellow psychiatrists have seen excellent results from Prozac.
''I hear mostly the bad news, and I have to keep on reminding myself that most people are doing tremendously well on the medication,'' he said. ''You have to put this in the perspective of 650,000 prescriptions being written every month.''
 
 PROZAC' SIDE EFFECTS: 2 VIEWS
 
Lawsuits agaisnt Eli Lilly & Company allege that its antidepressant drug Prozac causes severe side effects, including suicidal and homicidal tendencies. The manufacturer says the drug has relatively few side effects. The Food and Drug Adminsitration says that violence or suicidal tendencies are not unknown among people with serious depression but are not among the adverse effects of the drug seen in clinical trials.
 
COMMON SIDE EFFECTS LISTED BY MANUFACTURER
 
* Nervous system complaints: anxiety, nervousness, insomnia.
 
* Drowsiness, fatigue; asthenia, the loss of strength or energy.
 
* Tremor.
 
* Sweating.
 
* Gastrointestinal complaints; anorexia, nausea and diarrhea.
 
* Dizziness and lightheadedness.
 
SEVERE SIDE EFFECTS ALLEGED IN LAWSUITS
 
* Suicidal tendencies, ideas and obsessions.
 
* Self-mutilation, attempted and actual suicide.

HEADLINE: Baby Trail Is Leading Couples To Peru

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru

 BODY:
THEY attract attention on the sidewalks of the Miraflores and San Isidro neighborhoods of Lima - foreign men and women in jeans and jogging outfits, pushing newborn infants in strollers as passers-by stop to ooh and aah.
Thousands of miles from home in the United States, Canada or Europe, these people have come to fulfill dreams of parenthood. They get their first taste of it in temporary housing in a city suffering political terrorism and economic chaos, where electricity is unpredictable and water is not potable.
''We really have to scramble to make formula and sterilize bottles when the electricity comes on,'' said Rodney H. Mykle, a judge from the Canadian province of Manitoba, who with his wife, Lori McBeth, adopted twin boys during a six-week stay here.
Those who come to Peru to adopt infants have been on adoption lists at home for years and explored possibilities in Asia or elsewhere in Latin America, only to discover that Peru usually has babies readily available. Adoptive parents also say it is the only Latin American country that allows single women to adopt children, although most prospective parents seem to be couples. 
The Peruvian system is not without its critics. Here babies are given to couples right after proceedings are begun, leaving open the possibility that they will not get the child after a bond has formed between them and the baby. Red tape can be interminable. No centralized system or organization oversees adoptions by foreigners. Rather, the would-be parents make their way here through a combination of referrals from adoption agencies at home and word of mouth.
Some find lawyers recommended by previous adopting parents, like from the list kept by Millie de Sacio, an American who owns the La Gringa handicrafts shop in Miraflores.
''Traveling down here seemed awesome at the outset,'' said Terry Cannon, a mental-health counselor from Delaware who, with her husband, J. Roy Cannon, adopted a newborn girl they have named Katy. ''But, as a result, I feel I'll be able to tell Katy about Peru someday.''
''When I met the birth mother in court, we both cried, and I asked her what she would like for us to tell Katy when she grows up,'' Mrs. Cannon continued. ''She said to explain that she was a woman alone with two other children to support and no family around to help her and that she had to work.''
Of those seeking to adopt children here, few have been to South America before; the trip tests their willingness to confront bureaucratic obstacles and judicial proceedings in a foreign country and tongue. Corruption is widely reported in the Peruvian judicial system. Foreigners are often uncertain whether a judicial delay is legitimate or a maneuver by someone looking for a payoff. In addition, a State Department advisory warns, ''both terrorism and crime are serious problems throughout Peru,'' including Lima.
For the Peruvians, national pride raises doubts about sending babies abroad and raises concerns about the motives of the applicants; those feelings can result from different attitudes toward adoption in Latin America and the applicants' countries.
Adoption by nationals of Latin American countries is rare. Most of those who are financially able to adopt children are whites of European descent; most of the babies up for adoption are of mixed Indian and European blood.
''Some people in Peru are suspicious about why blond people want to adopt Indian babies,'' said a Washington woman who spent six weeks in Peru this year in an adoption effort that went awry when the natural mother changed her mind.
The American, who requested that her name not be used because of concerns for her career, said in a telephone interview that the doctor who delivered the baby girl had told her he had heard that some Americans adopted children in Peru to bring them up to become servants.
Partly because of such rumors, the natural mother was shown photographs of Mrs. Cannon's home life in Newark, Del., with her husband and Andy, a 3-year-old they adopted from Korea. Mrs. Cannon said photographs of Andy playing with his American cousins demonstrated that he was an equal part of the family.
About 30 to 40 foreign adoptions a month are said to be processed by courts here. Legal fees mentioned by various adopting parents ranged from $4,000 to $16,000, with most in the $6,000 to $9,000 range - on top of any fees paid to referral agencies outside Peru.
Ms. McBeth of Manitoba, a schoolteacher, and Mr. Mykle, a justice of the Court of Queen's Bench in the city of Brandon, said that after waiting five years to adopt a newborn baby at home, they heard of friends who were successful in Peru.
The Manitoba couple got in touch with the lawyers in Lima who had represented their friends. With the legal help, the Manitobans put together the documents required, had a home study commissioned, and sent the results to Peru by courier mail.
Knowing the adoption proceeding would take 6 to 12 weeks, Mr. Mykle planned to spend only his three-week vacation period in Peru and then to go home and let his wife complete their mission.
''But as soon as my colleagues heard what we were planning,'' he said in an interview, ''they said, 'Your place is there,' and started signing up to take my case load. So we decided, why not adopt two?''
On June 23, advised that twin boys were available, the couple flew to Lima with five suitcases filled with formula and disposable diapers. They moved into a large house converted into small apartments, complete with cribs, across the street from the Anglo-American Clinic. The next day, the lawyers brought them the two boys, who were then about 3 months old. The process took exactly six weeks, during which the couple visited with the natural parents and also visited Lima's museums. They flew home with the boys on Aug. 3.
Terry Cannon said she and her husband were aware of possible complications because they had an acquaintance whose effort to adopt a child here failed at the end of the proceedings.
For that reason, she said, before they set out on their journey, they asked a social worker in Peru who worked with their lawyer if the mother was sure of her decision and were told she was, although they knew she could change her mind. ''I knew we were taking the risk,'' she said.
Indeed, some adoptions do not go smoothly. Kate Ramsey, 36, a nurse from Macon, Ga., who is single, has put her life on hold since coming to Peru in June 1989. Her house and leased car in Macon are unused, but they still have to be paid for every month; her house has been burglarized; the neighbors water the lawn; she arranged for a tax extension, and a friend has her dogs. The hospital paid her salary through the end of last year, and now her parents are paying her expenses.
''My guess is I'm spending my inheritance,'' she said as she watched the 14-month-old boy, Thomas Seth, run around the lobby of the hotel where they live.
Ms. Ramsey said her first lawyer brought the baby to her two weeks after she arrived and said the mother was giving him up. But after months of delays, the mother did not appear in court to swear to her decision. At the end of 1989, the court ruled against the adoption, saying the baby might be stolen.
With a new lawyer, Ms. Ramsey appealed and won a ruling that she had done nothing wrong. She is now going through the adoption proceeding again, asserting that the baby was abandoned. No one has ever appeared to claim him.
''I also have the sense the judge doesn't like single mothers,'' she said. ''He's always saying, 'Let's find a nice Peruvian couple to take the baby,' but I haven't noticed them lined up in the street waiting.''
''I made a decision a long time ago to take this one day at a time,'' she said. ''There have been days when I've cried a lot.''

HEADLINE: In Cars, Muscle vs. Mileage

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Experts on automobiles say technologies are readily available to make cars go much farther on a gallon of gasoline, reducing the demand for oil and therefore lessening the impact of events like the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. But a renewed taste for cars with muscle is devouring gains in fuel economy.
In the last two years, Americans have shown little interest. Instead they have been choosing new cars that are heavier, faster and on average less fuel-efficient than those bought in earlier years, for the first time since the oil shock of 1973.
Auto makers have already made substantial gains in cutting fuel consumption by making cars lighter and smaller and developing more efficient engines, and they argue that Americans can best reduce energy consumption by switching to smaller cars with less performance. 
 
'All the Low-Hanging Fruit'
''We've picked all the low-hanging fruit when it comes to fuel efficiency,'' said Albert J. Slechter, the technical director of Federal affairs at the Chrysler Corporation.
But experts outside the auto makers point to innovations that are already in use on some models that if more widely applied could improve the picture even if Americans do not move to smaller cars.
A recent study concluded that applying 17 existing technologies more broadly would raise average mileage to 43.8 miles per gallon from 28.3 in 1987 if size and performance of cars were unchanged.
While this would also raise the cost of the car, the efficiency savings would more than offset this; for every 53 cents invested, one gallon of gasoline, which costs considerably more, would be saved.
The analysis, by Marc. R. Ledbetter, an automotive expert at the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, a nonprofit group in Washington, and Marc Ross, of the University of Michigan Department of Physics, assumes that the mix of cars, including size and acceleration, will be the same as in 1987.
Among the improvements suggested by the study were these:
* Using engines with four valves per cylinder instead of the standard two. Having two valves to let in the fuel-air mixture and two for exhaust reduces friction in the gases passing through the cylinder, adding horsepower at high speed and enabling the use of a smaller engine. The fuel savings: about 6.8 percent.
* Electronically controlled shifting in an automatic transmission. This would pick a gear to maximize fuel economy rather than power, in most cases lowering engine speed. Savings: 8 percent.
* Intake valve control. The timing of the opening and closing of intake valves can be varied depending on engine speed. Savings: 6 percent.
* Overhead cam. The cam is a rotating shaft that controls valve opening and closing, and in most cars it is located under the parts it controls. An overhead cam has less mass and takes less energy to turn, reducing energy requirements, among other advantages. Savings: 6 percent.
* Front-wheel drive. Eliminating the drive shaft and rear axles allows a redesign to save space and cut weight. Savings: 10 percent.
* Aerodynamic changes to cut wind resistance. Savings: 4.6 percent. Limited Prospects? Car company executives say many of these technologies are already being used on most new cars, so the prospects for further savings are limited. And some innovations, they say, will hurt performance and could interfere with another goal for new cars, reducing air pollution.
Mr. Ledbetter responded that some gains from the new technologies have been offset by the increased popularity of more powerful engines.
The nation could also improve fuel economy without sacrificing car size if auto makers used lighter - but costlier - materials. A 10 percent weight reduction in a 3,000-pound car will save 6.6 percent in fuel, experts say. Floyd E. Allen, executive engineer of power-train engineering at Chrysler, said cars could be lighter if aluminum, magnesium and plastic were used to replace steel.
''But frequently the cost-benefit ratio is difficult to satisfy,'' with gasoline relatively cheap, he said. The average car uses 500 gallons a year, so a 10 percent savings at the current gasoline price would come to about $60 a year. Over the life of the car, saving that amount would justify hundreds of dollars in extra expense.
 
Reaction in the Showroom
But ''it doesn't necessarily make sense to the guy in the showroom, at a dollar a gallon and there's no threat of oil shortages on the horizon,'' Mr. Allen said. ''The reaction is going to be, 'My God, the price went up several hundred dollars.' ''
Indeed, gasoline is still so inexpensive that fuel economy is not a major goal for most drivers or car companies. ''If you tell me that gasoline will be at $2 a gallon in three years, I would say we'd all be searching for ways for better fuel efficiency, and spending money to find tenths of a mile per gallon,'' Mr. Slechter said. ''But that kind of mentality doesn't exist right now.''
In the months before the Iraqi invasion two weeks ago, ''gasoline was at the lowest price in recorded history,'' said James D. Johnston, the chief lobbyist in Washington for the General Motors Corporation, referring to the inflation-adjusted cost of gasoline needed to travel a mile. ''That's not a lot of incentive to conserve.''
With average fuel economy up by about 50 percent since the first oil shock in 1973, the cost of the gasoline needed to drive a mile is the lowest in at least 40 years, experts say.
 
Better Acceleration
The recent increase in gasoline prices is not expected to make much difference, unless it rekindles fear in consumers about future increases.
With gasoline so inexpensive, buyers have turned their attention to other characteristics, like better acceleration, and the car companies have responded.
The Environmental Protection Agency found that 1983 midsized models took about 14.5 seconds to go from zero to 60 miles an hour; the 1990's models take under 12 seconds. Some of the better performance comes from better engineering, but the auto makers have also added power by building bigger engines, which burn more fuel.
Another factor is the changing mix of vehicles. Small pickups and small vans, which represented only a tiny fragment of sales in 1978, now have nearly 20 percent of the market, the agency said. As a group, they are far less efficient than the passenger cars that many of them replace.
 
Declining Fuel Efficiency
Not surprisingly, then, Government figures show the 1990 model-year cars with an average efficiency of 27.8 miles per gallon, compared with 28.6 in 1988. (The calculations take into account how many of each model are sold.) The actual decline in mileage is probably even larger than the figures suggest, experts say, because of traffic congestion. The agency's ''combined'' figure assumes 55 percent of the miles are on the highway and 45 percent are in the city, but as roads get more crowded, experts say, the formula probably overstates the amount of driving done in highway conditions.
But if fuel efficiency in automobiles is still a low priority for most drivers, it remains a top priority for those concerned about energy conservation at times of uncertain supplies. The American vehicle fleet, a 32 billion-horsepower herd, is by far the biggest user of oil in this country, consuming about 7.2 million barrels a day - coincidentally, about the amount that the United States imports.
 
Environmentalists' Concern
The decline in average mileage also worries environmentalists. ''If this backslide continues, problems with nationwide fuel consumption will increase and global warming trends will worsen at a pace faster than is generally being assumed,'' according to an E.P.A. report in January. Carbon dioxide and other gases in car exhaust are thought to trap heat in the earth's atmosphere, contributing to climate change; the more fuel consumed, the worse the problem.
After the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo, the Government sought to mandate that by 1985 each manufacturer's product line would have an average performance of 27.5 miles per gallon. General Motors and the Ford Motor Company did not meet the standard, and they successfully petitioned the Department of Transportation to delay implementation of the standard. Chrysler met the standard by making heavy investments in plants to build smaller cars, but today the company does not count its compliance as shrewd.
''The market demand continued to go more and more toward luxury, power and what have you,'' said Mr. Slechter of Chrysler. Now, the three American manufacturers' fuel efficiency is nearly equal.
 
Less-Efficient Imports
Even the efficiency of Asian cars sold in this country is declining, from about 35 miles per gallon in 1988 to about 31 miles per gallon now, as consumer tastes move toward more powerful models. European imports show an even steeper decline, beginning in 1982.
Many energy experts would like to have the Government respond by setting higher energy efficiency standards for cars, as it has for such consumer equipment as refrigerators.
The auto companies vigorously dissent. At Ford, David L. Kulp, the manager of fuel economy planning and compliance, called for ''a cohesive policy,'' including giving consumers information on the importance of fuel efficiency and helping municipalities take steps to reduce congestion.
But Senator Richard H. Bryan, Democrat of Nevada, has proposed legislation raising average fuel economy 20 percent by 1995. By 2001, the average for new cars would have to be 40 miles per gallon. The bill would also set a statutory standard for light trucks for the first time.
 
Gradual Savings
The measure was approved by the Senate Commerce Committee earlier this year by a vote of 14-4, and is on the Senate calendar.
Even without mileage improvements, Americans could save oil merely by buying the most efficient model in its class. The Environmental Protection Agency reports that if every buyer of a 1990-model car of a given size - say, compact, or midsized - had instead bought the most fuel-efficient model of that class, average fuel efficiency would have been 32.5 miles per gallon, instead of the 27.5 miles per gallon actually achieved.

HEADLINE: Watch Urged On U.S. Loan Agencies

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 15

 BODY:
Federal auditors said today that the Government should sharply increase the regulation and supervision of Government-sponsored enterprises that lend money to home buyers and college students or else taxpayers might have to foot the bill in the future.
In a report to Congress, the General Accounting Office said the ''ambiguous status'' of such lenders - ''neither fully private nor clearly public'' - exposed the Government to potentially large financial risks, as in the savings and loan industry.
The report said the Department of Housing and Urban Development had been passive in monitoring two such lenders, the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac.
In addition, it said, the Student Loan Marketing Association, known as Sallie Mae, ''has no Federal regulator to oversee the safety and soundness of its financial activities.'' 
The G.A.O., a Congressional investigative agency, said the Government should treat such hybrid entities more like commercial banks and insist that they increase their capital with the risks they take.
Leland C. Brendsel, the chairman of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, responded that the report ''understates both the financial strength of Freddie Mac and the importance'' of its mission to provide credit for home buyers. ''We have a 20-year unbroken string of profits,'' he said, and Freddie Mac will not become a liability to the Government unless there is ''a nationwide economic catastrophe worse than the Great Depression.''
 
Other Agencies Respond
Similarly, David O. Maxwell, Fannie Mae's chairman, said his Congressionally chartered corporation had ''never cost taxpayers a penny.'' In fact, he said, ''over the last three years, we paid some $908 million in Federal income taxes.''
Mr. Maxwell added that he welcomed ''close scrutiny,'' but he denied that the special status of a Government-sponsored enterprise created ''incentives for management to take excessive risks.''
Edward A. Fox, the president of the Student Loan Marketing Association, said the report unfairly reinforced the ''perception among investors that the Federal Government will act as a credit backstop for all Government-sponsored enterprises.'' He said he saw no need to impose ''an outside regulator to monitor and evaluate the adequacy of Sallie Mae's capital.''
The General Accounting Office acknowledged that ''Sallie Mae's credit standing is quite high, and that there is no evidence to suggest that Sallie Mae represents an imminent risk of failure to the Government.'' But the agency said Federal supervision was needed because the Government would probably step in to provide assistance if Sallie Mae experienced financial trouble.
In general, the G.A.O. said, Government-sponsored enterprises enjoy certain privileges and benefits not available to an ordinary business. For example, it said, some can borrow money from the Treasury, and several are exempt from state and local income taxes.
Thus, the report said, ''the Government could face losses if an enterprise failed,'' so it is prudent for the Government to supervise their operations more closely.
 
No Discipline From Investors
The report said investors in the private market did not adequately discipline such lenders but assumed the Government would aid the institutions in times of financial difficulty, preventing default and protecting investors, even though the Government was not legally required to do so.
The study was required by the 1989 law that rescued hundreds of insolvent savings associations. The G.A.O. examined eight Government-sponsored enterprises with debts and other financial obligations totaling $800 billion. The obligations include bonds and other securities through which investors' money is ultimately made available for loans to home buyers, college students and farmers.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development ''has never used its authority to audit Fannie Mae,'' even though it has had the authority to do so since 1968, the G.A.O. said. ''Taxpayers deserve greater protection,'' the report said.
The Treasury Department ''has audit authority over Sallie Mae, but like H.U.D. has not exercised this authority,'' the report said.
 
'Inherent Conflicts'
The General Accounting Office did not assert that any particular Government-sponsored enterprise had inadequate capital. Rather, the auditors said they were dissatisfied because the Government had not established, through statute or regulation, minimal standards for the capital that such institutions must have to operate safely.
The agency also said the Housing Department was not in a good position to supervise Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. ''Inherent conflicts could exist between the department's short-term housing policy goals and its goals as a financial regulator,'' it said.
The recent history of the savings industry ''illustrated the disastrous effects of having regulators responsible for both promoting an industry and overseeing it,'' the report said.

HEADLINE: Talking Deals;
Loral's Fast Move Wins a Ford Unit

BYLINE: By Kurt Eichenwald

 BODY:
WHEN the Loral Corporation beat out giant competitors like Westinghouse Electric and Hughes Aircraft last month in bidding for the aerospace unit of Ford Motor, the victory had the air of David triumphing over Goliath.
But it now appears that Loral had something more than just a slingshot in its back pocket: about $85 million to $150 million from the aerospace division's overfunded pension fund. Loral agreed to let Ford keep a portion of the overfunded pension fund. At the same time the other two bidders said they thought the money was untouchable. 
So while Loral and Ford Aerospace announced that the deal was worth $715 million - less than another bid Ford received of $730 million - it is actually worth $800 million to $865 million.
The use of the pension fund, which was not publicly disclosed when the deal was signed, has prompted an inquiry by the Pentagon and left some on Wall Street wondering whether Loral and its equity partner, Shearson Lehman Brothers, outmaneuvered their competitors or overstepped the bounds of propriety.
Dipping into pension funds for a corporate buyout has generated storms of criticism in Washington in the last decade, but restrictions were few in coming. Now in the case of Ford Aerospace the issue takes on new dimensions.
The division depends in large part on Government contracts, meaning that the Pentagon pays for everything from the cost of materials to pensions for employees who work on the contracted business. So in the weapons industry, the cash in an overfunded pension fund, which companies might claim as their own, could be claimed by the Government.
Although the Ford Aerospace pension fund has assets of $300 to $400 million in excess of liabilities, the Government could say that the money was not Ford's to keep, said people who have examined internal company documents.
''A portion of that pension belongs to the Government,'' a senior Pentagon official said yesterday. The official said that the Pentagon had heard allegations about the use of excess pension assets in the Ford Aerospace deal and that it planned to examine the situation. ''We intend to do a complete and detailed review,'' the Pentagon official said.
Bankers involved in the deal said that they expected the Government to examine the deal closely and that there was nothing improper in it. ''No one is going to slide one by,'' one banker said.
Ford and Loral confirmed that the automobile company was keeping part of the pension fund, but stressed that more than enough money was being moved to Loral to cover the fund's liabilities.
''It seems to me the issue is not the amount of the surplus, but that more than sufficent funds are being transferred,'' said Tom Rhoades, a Ford spokesman.
Bernard L. Schwartz, the chairman and chief executive of Loral, indicated yesterday that the money from the pension fund being kept by Ford was not related to any of its Government contracts. ''Nobody has ever established that the Government has a claim on activities not involving the Defense Department,'' Mr. Schwartz said. ''We made sure that funds that were transferred in the pension was more than enough to take care of the requirements of the individual Ford employees.''
One adviser to a losing bidder said the pension money would come out of the division's satellite business, which has a large proportion of commercial and foreign contracts. ''I thought it was very clever on Loral's part,'' he said. ''Make no mistake about it, they found some real money.''
Excess money from the pension fund, unrelated to Government contracts would presumably belong to Ford. Essentially, some of the losers say, they may well have been outthought by the smaller competitor.
But those answers do not assuage some losers in the bidding contest, some of whom contend that they were told not to touch the overfunded pension fund.
An investment banker who represented a losing bidder also said that the information he had been given about Ford's position on the pension fund was different than the results.
But executives involved in running the deal said all bidders were provided with the same financial details. ''We do know that everybody got same information, the same instructions, and were told that each bid would be evaluated in terms of which bid would provide the greatest net economic value to Ford,'' one executive involved in the deal said.
Regardless of the outcome of the debate, some employees with Ford Aerospace say that they are getting more comfortable with the Loral victory. ''I think they were very smart to make the deal and beat out the other two groups,'' one middle manager said. ''What I have heard is that Loral's history with pension plans has been a very good one. That means more to me than anything else.''

HEADLINE: Industry's Output Flat Last Month

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 15

 BODY:
Automotive output dropped sharply in July, leaving overall industrial production unchanged from June, the Federal Reserve reported today. It noted that the economy continued its slow growth in most other areas of manufacturing.
The Federal Reserve said that ''excluding motor vehicles, industrial output rose two-tenths of a percent last month, about the same rate of growth that has been evident so far this year.'' 
Weakness in auto sales has been a major factor behind the economy's sluggishness this year, but Michael P. Niemira, an economist with the Mitsubishi Bank in New York, said he expected a strong increase in vehicle production this month.
 
'Intentional Car Buildup'
''We're going through an intentional car buildup in the third quarter,'' Mr. Niemira said, pointing to a backlog of just 55 days' supply compared with the normal supply of 60 to 65 days.
Michael K. Evans, head of Evans Economics Inc., a Washington forecasting firm, said he thought the auto industry was positioning itself for a possible strike when the Big Three labor contracts expire this fall.
Today's report also said there was a drop in the production of stone, clay and glass products that was a sign of weakness in construction.
Overall industrial production has fallen twice so far this year: 1 percent in January and one-tenth of a percent in April. But the rates of growth in the other months have been less than 1 percent. In June the gain was four-tenths of a percent.
Output in manufacturing plants making both durable and nondurable goods inched down one-tenth of a percent in July, after a gain of three-tenths of a percent in June. The June figure was a revision from a rise of five-tenths of a percent first reported.
Output of durable goods, which are vehicles and other relatively expensive items expected to last at least three years, fell four-tenths of a percent and offset a gain of four-tenths of a percent in June.
Manufacturing of nondurable goods like food and clothing was up three-tenths of a percent, after an increase of two-tenths of a percent a month earlier.
 
Mines and Utilities
Output at mines jumped 1 percent, after a flat June, while utility production was off four-tenths of a percent, after a 1.9 percent gain in June.
The Fed said its industrial production index in July stood at 109.9 percent of its 1987 base.
The Fed also said the operating rate of the nation's factories, mines and utilities - which usually move in tandem with industrial production -slipped two-tenths of a percentage point, to 83.4 percent. The operating rate measures not only output but also changes in productivity levels.
The operating rate at factories producing durable goods fell five-tenths of a percentage point, to 81.6 percent, while the rate at plants making nondurable goods was unchanged, at 83.9 percent.
The operating rate at mines was up 1.1 percentage points, to 90.2 percent, while it slipped to 85.7 percent, from 86.2, at utilities.

HEADLINE: Market Flat, With Dow Up By Only 0.50

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
The stock market ended flat for the second consecutive session, but only after fighting off earlier weaknesses in very choppy trading. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the trading session up 0.50, to 2,748.27.
The backdrop for most of yesterday's trading included a rally on the Tokyo stock market, where the Nikkei index of 225 stocks rose 1,439.59 points, or 5.4 percent, to 28,112.12. It was the Nikkei's third-highest one-day gain. 
But in trading in Tokyo today, the Nikkei retreated, falling 562.68 points, or 2 percent, to close at 27,549.44.
On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, volume totaled 135.2 million shares, with gainers outpacing losers by almost 3 to 2.
The Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks was up 1.12 points, to 411.45, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index, 0.67, to 340.06. The American Stock Exchange index rose 70 basis points, to 340.64.
 
Drop in Bonds and Dollar
Prices moved broadly higher in early trading yesterday amid signs that the crisis in the Middle East might be easing, and that moved the Dow up more than 15 points. Later, news that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries had opposed holding an early meeting and raising agreed production quotas pushed the stock market down through noon as oil futures rose, bonds fell and the dollar fell.
As optimism of a solution to the Middle East crisis began to fade, stock prices fell early in the session but investors remained hopeful that today's meeting between President Bush and King Hussein of Jordan will produce something positive.
''In all it was a dull day,'' said Robert H. Stovall, president of Stovall/ Twenty-First Advisers Inc. ''A day filled with a lot of offsets: The dollar ended higher, which bodes well for United States exports in the future. Crude oil prices rose, but oil stocks fell because of profit taking.''
Economic reports on industrial production for July, which was unchanged after two consecutive monthly advances; capacity utilization for July, down slightly, and inventory and sales for June, had little effect on yesterday's market.
Mr. Stovall did note that in the inventory liquidation figures for June there was an inference that excess inventories may have already worked themselves out and that would help make any recession a short-lived one.
Merck rose 7/8, to 87 7/8; Procter & Gamble was up 3/4, to 83 1/2, and Johnson & Johnson advanced by 1 1/8, to 68 3/8. Also traders said that there was heavy buying of the Johnson & Johnson stock because of early positive results from an AIDS treatment using photopheresis equipment.
Among the big gainers were Novo-Nordisk A/S, a Danish biotechnology group that makes synthetic insulin, up 3 1/8, to close at 54 5/8 on a report of strong earnings; CBS, up 3 5/8, to 181 5/8, and Medtronic, a maker of cardiac pacemakers, up 3 1/4, to 82 1/8.
Ambase, an insurance holding company whose disappointing second-quarter earnings results may have weakened its bargaining postion with bidders interested in its Home Insurance Company unit, fell as its banks demanded an early agreement. The stock dropped 4 3/4 to close at 2 3/4 on 1.9 million shares traded, the second-highest volume on the Big Board.
Wal-Mart Stores was the most active stock, with 2.03 million shares traded. Wal-Mart slipped 1/4, to 30 1/4, even though David Poneman, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said Wal-Mart and Target Stores had increased their shares of the apparel and furniture markets.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar, at Low Against Mark In Europe, Recovers in U.S.

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose yesterday against the German mark in domestic trading after sinking to an all-time low against the mark in Europe.
Against other major currencies, the dollar finished mixed in domestic trading after falling broadly overseas.
Gold prices turned lower after rising in recent sessions because of worries about war and inflation resulting from tensions in the Persian Gulf. 
The dollar sank to a record closing low of 1.5605 marks in Europe, down from 1.5685 marks late Tuesday and below its previous trading low of 1.5615 marks on Jan. 4, 1988.
Dealers said the dollar drifted even lower as trading began in New York with the currency dropping to about 1.5540 marks early in the session.
Despite the recovery against the mark, John McCarthy, chief currency dealer at Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank, said he did not think the sentiment toward the dollar had changed. ''It was just oversold against almost all currencies, and many participants were short dollars,'' he said.
Many analysts say weakness in the American economy will eventually force the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates to avoid a recession at a time when Germany, Japan and other nations will be increasing their rates to curb inflation. The net effect will be to make the dollar less attractive to foreign investors, currency analysts say.
In New York, the dollar fell to 147.65 Japanese yen, from 148.85 yen late Tuesday. Earlier, it fell to 147.15 yen in Tokyo, from 149.90 yen at Tuesday's close. In London, the dollar was quoted at 147.15 yen.
The dollar also fell worldwide against the British pound. The pound rose to $1.9000 in New York, from $1.8970 late Tuesday. In London, the pound rose to $1.9045, from $1.8930 late Tuesday. The dollar also gained against the Swiss franc, French franc and Italian lira in New York while falling against the yen, British pound and Canadian dollar.
Dollar rates as of late yesterday in New York, compared with late rates Tuesday, included: 1.30735 Swiss francs, up from 1.3042; 5.2570 French francs, up from 5.2555; 1,149.75 Italian lire, up from 1,149.25, and 1.14345 Canadian dollars, down from 1.14425.
Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Tuesday's late rates, included: 1.3005 Swiss francs, down from 1.3055; 5.2365 French francs, down from 5.2695; 1.7579 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7675; 1,145.75 Italian lire, down from 1,152.50, and 1.1435 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1452.
Gold for current delivery fell $2.20, to $402.60 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. The Republic National Bank quoted gold at $402.40 late yesterday, down $1.60 from Tuesday's late bid.
Earlier, gold fell to $401.25 an ounce in London, from $410.25 late Tuesday, and to $398.75 in Zurich, from $412 late Tuesday. In Hong Kong, gold fell $9.50, to $401.50 an ounce.
On the Comex in New York, silver for current delivery fell 12.3 cents an ounce, to $5.068.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Y.&R. Buys An Agency In Prague

BYLINE: By KIM FOLTZ

 BODY:
YOUNG & RUBICAM said yesterday that it had bought an agency in Prague, making it the latest American agency to further expand its presence in Eastern Europe.
The new agency, Young & Rubicam Czechoslovakia, is a venture between Y.&R. and AB Line Studios, a small private agency in Prague. Y.&R. will own most of the new agency, and its managing director will be Jiri Kratena, the founder of AB Line Studios. No terms were disclosed.
''We've been studying the business opportunities in Eastern Europe for the last two years, and we decided that along with Hungary, Czechoslovakia offers the best possiblities for growth,'' said Joseph DeDeo, the president and chief executive of Young & Rubicam Advertising. Y.&R., which has worldwide billings of more than $6 billion, set up an office last year in Budapest. 
Because of the political and economic changes in Eastern Europe, large agencies have been scrambling to establish beachheads in the region. Although it is not creating any advertising as yet, Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising Worldwide opened an office last month in Prague to analyze business opportunities in that country. Saatchi also has agencies in Hungary and Poland and plans to open one in Yugoslavia in the fall.
In addition, Ogilvy & Mather recently announced the appointment of a new executive to spearhead the agency's move into the area. Wolfgang Slupetsky, the head of Ogilvy's Austrian office, will oversee the agency's fledgling offices in East Germany, Budapest and Moscow, as well as its expansion into Poland, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia.
For agencies, the move eastward is motivated by their clients' desire to sell their products in Eastern Europe's growing free-market economies. ''Some of our biggest clients like Colgate, Kodak and Xerox are making serious plans to move into these markets,'' Mr. DeDeo said. ''We want to be there to help.''
Some analysts said agencies had often been forced by clients to open offices in other countries, even though the operations might not prove profitable for a number of years.
''International agencies open branches in places like East Europe because they simply cannot afford to say no to their big clients,'' said Alan Gottesman of Paine Webber Inc.
Mr. Gottesman said American agencies doing business in Eastern Europe were also hampered because they could not rely on picking up many local accounts to help make their offices going concerns.
Agencies and their clients are primarily banking on the future success of economic revolution in Eastern Europe. ''These won't be big markets for us for a long time,'' said Robert James, the chairman and president of McCann-Erickson, which has offices in Hungary and Yugoslavia. ''But that is the way it's always been in building an international business.''
Nonetheless, some of operations are already showing modest signs of success. Mr. DeDeo said that after just a year, its Budapest office had shown a profit, largely because of the success of Adidas athletic footwear, one of its main clients.
McCann's Hungarian branch is also turning a profit. McCann's clients there include Coca-Cola, Del Monte and Nestle. McCann intends to open branches in East Germany, Czechoslovakia and possibly Poland.
But setting up shop is not easy. Since the primary agencies in Eastern European countries are owned by the state, agency's like McCann have had to forge relationships with other media companies. In Yugosalvia, for example, McCann created its agency there by forming a venture with a Zagreb television production company.
''There are few private agencies to pick from, so we find a media-related company that we think will work the best in setting up an agency,'' Mr. James said.
Y.&R. was lucky to find an experienced private ad agency to be its partner in Czechoslovakia. Mr. Kratena, who founded AB Line Studios two years ago, was one of the first to create consumer-oriented advertising in Czechoslovakia, Mr. DeDeo said. Mr. Kratena's agency has created consumer ads for Kotva, a department store in Prague. The agency's other primary clients are Radio Vox, a private radio station and Motokov, a trading company dealing in consumer and industrial goods.
Before opening his agency, Mr. Kratena was a film director who made documentaries for Czechoslovak television.
In a telephone interview from Prague yesterday, Mr. Kratena said he had to teach himself how to create ''Western style'' advertising.
''There was no where in my country to learn how to make advertising aimed at consumers,'' he said. ''I taught myself by watching commercials when I visited Western countries.''

HEADLINE: Plan to Freeze Manila Debt

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: MANILA, Aug. 15

 BODY:
The Philippine Senate approved a resolution today asking President Corazon C. Aquino to negotiate a 30-month moratorium on payments on the country's $26 billion foreign debt.
The Senate resolution, which passed on its second reading, still requires a third vote. It then must be reconciled with a similar resolution, passed by the House of Representatives last month, before being sent to Mrs. Aquino.
Legislators want to divert the money to help pay for rebuilding areas of the country damaged by the earthquake last month that killed 1,650 people.
Senators estimate the country will be able to save $3.5 billion a year if a moratorium can be negotiated.
Lawmakers said a debt freeze, opposed by foreign bankers, has become a more attractive option because of a possible economic slowdown after the Persian Gulf crisis.
The Finance Secretary, Jesus Estanislao, and the governor of the central bank, Jose Cuisia, who just returned from the United States and Japan, said the country's main donors and creditors were willing to provide the debt relief and money needed to rebuild the Philippines.
Mrs. Aquino has ruled out any confrontational approach to the country's foreign debt problem, saying it would alienate the nation from the international financial community.

FOREIGNERS WARNED

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON Aug. 16

 BODY:
The Iraqi occupation authorities today ordered 6,500 American and British citizens trapped in Kuwait to assemble at two hotels in the Kuwaiti capital and threatened to remove the foreign residents forcibly from their homes if they refused.
The State Department said American and British diplomats in Kuwait, who received the order from the Iraqi authorities, reported that they had been given two hours to obey the instructions. Administration officials said they feared the order was a prelude to confinement of Americans citizens in Kuwait or Iraq.
Fifteen hours after the Iraqi deadline, however, ''very few'' Americans had obeyed the order, said Richard A. Boucher, a State Department spokesman. ''Most of the Americans are not interested,'' he added. 
Up to that point, there had apparently been no Iraqi action to enforce the order, which described the Americans and Britons as ''restrictees.''
 
No Advice From Embassy
The American Embassy informed American citizens of the Iraqi order, but officials offered no advice whether or not to comply. While the State Department told the Iraqi authorities and reporters that they thought the Americans would be better off remaining at home, its representatives in Kuwait left the decision whether to move to a hotel up to the American residents and visitors in Kuwait.
''We're not instructing them one way or the other,'' Mr. Boucher said. ''We don't know what if any actions the Iraqi authorities might be thinking of taking.''
Asked if the United States was abdicating responsibility by avoiding explicit direction to the Americans, Mr. Boucher said, ''We don't have the authority to order Americans to do things.'' He added that Americans were being informed that the United States was demanding that the order be rescinded.
American officials continued to refuse to characterize their citizens trapped in Iraq and Kuwait as ''hostages,'' saying use of the word might incite President Saddam Hussein of Iraq and make efforts to free them more difficult. But they privately acknowledged that it appeared that the Iraqis intended to use the captives either as bargaining chips or as shields against whatever military operations may come.
A senior State Department official said the Iraqi order ''obviously increases our concern for the well-being of foreign nationals.''
The British Foreign Office Minister, William Waldegrave, called the Iraqi order ''grave and sinister.''
Mr. Boucher told reporters at the State Department that the action ''was totally uncalled for.''
He added, ''We have instructed our charge in Baghdad to contact the Foreign Ministry immediately to protest the action, to demand an explanation, to stress that force must not be used against Americans, and to remind the Iraqi Government of its responsibility to safeguard American lives and property.''
Later, the Iraqi Foreign Ministry said it knew nothing about the military order in Kuwait.
 
Other Foreigners Unrestricted
It appeared that the Iraqis had singled out the estimated 2,500 Americans and 4,000 British out of more than a million foreigners they have refused to let leave Iraq or occupied Kuwait. Other foreigners may still move around Kuwait freely. A group of 117 foreigners, including 38 Americans, have been held under armed guard by Iraqi forces in Baghdad for almost two weeks.
In daily conversations with American officials in Washington and Baghdad since the invasion of Kuwait two weeks ago, Iraqi officials have given American officials varied and contradictory explanations of why they will not let foreigners out of territory they control. In recent days, they have said they will not release the foreigners until the United States stops threatening their country.
Mr. Boucher said top Iraqi military commanders summoned Nathaniel Howell, the United States Ambassador to Kuwait. Mr. Howell was instructed to tell all Americans that they had to move to the International Hotel, situated across the street from the American Embassy, in two hours. ''They explained that the order was the result of concerns about the protection of the American community from unspecified threats,'' Mr. Boucher said.
A State Department official who insisted on anonymity said ''the Iraqis did imply they would go out and find the people'' if the American Embassy did not gather them together at the hotel.
 
Called Safer at Home
Mr. Howell responded to the Iraqi order by saying it was impossible for his embassy to contact every American in Kuwait in so little time, and even then, it could not order its citizens to leave their homes. He added that he thought American citizens would be safer in their homes anyway.
But the American Embassy called as many American citizens as it could to inform them of the Iraqi order, but without recommending what they should do.
The Iraqi order produced a strong response from members of Congress. ''The Iraqi directive is clearly a hostile act,'' said Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of Westchester. ''I think it is important for President Bush right now to send a message that if Saddam Hussein intends to make the Americans hostages, he must know we will respond accordingly.''
Mr. Waldegrave, the British official, said he feared that the Westerners rounded up in Kuwait would be ''interned somewhere - most likely in Iraq.'' He said his Government intended to raise the matter in the United Nations.
 
8,000 Escape to Jordan
AMMAN, Jordan, Aug. 16 (Special to The New York Times) - Jordanian border officials reported today that at least 8,000 foreigners streamed across the border with Iraq during the 24 hours ending this afternoon.
Three naturalized Americans, originally from India, were among those who made their way into Jordan along with three naturalized Britons who had been born in Tanzania and a French woman born in Madagascar.
The Americans were the first to make their way out of Baghdad since Saturday, when 10 people attached to the United States Embassy and a 10-year-old California girl crossed into Jordan.
The three latest American arrivals passed through the border checkpoint unnoticed by a group of foreign journalists. Then, after driving an additional 220 miles, they checked in at the American Embassy here.
Reuters news agency reported that the Soviet Union was planning to run a convoy of cars and trucks with 230 Soviet citizens from Baghdad and Kuwait in the next day or two.
The Soviets estimate that 7,830 of their citizens were in Iraq and 880 were in Kuwait when the Iraqi invasion began there Aug. 2.

PEACE HOPE FADING

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE, Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 16

 BODY:
President Bush and King Hussein of Jordan failed today to make significant progress toward easing the Middle East crisis, and Mr. Bush was apparently unable to win ironclad assurances from the King that he would halt shipments to Baghdad through the Jordanian port of Aqaba.
''I did not come away from that conversation with a feeling of hope'' that President Saddam Hussein would withdraw from Kuwait, Mr. Bush said as a mood of heightened hostility settled over the impasse, now two weeks old.
 
The View From Iran
After a two-hour meeting at the President's home in Kennebunkport, Me., Mr. Bush said he had won the Jordanian leader's promise to enforce United Nations sanctions against Iraq, but he acknowledged that he was still worried about potential cheaters. For his part, King Hussein told reporters that he intended to honor the trade embargo but was still seeking clarification as to its exact terms.
Although that seemed to leave room for cargoes to move up the desert road from Aqaba to Baghdad, there were indications that Iran, to which Iraq made peace overtures on Wednesday, might not be willing to ship food and other goods to Iraq, as American officials had feared. 
President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran was quoted by the official Iranian press agency as saying that Iraq must ''evacuate Kuwaiti territory.'' A person with close ties to the Iranian Parliament told Reuters that Teheran would under no circumstances violate sanctions.
 
Two Tugs-of-War
In effect, two tugs-of-war were under way. The American point of view seemed to be prevailing in Iran, with the Iraqi position more persuasive in Amman.
President Hussein, Iraq's leader, denounced President Bush in a broadcast today as a ''liar,'' the same word Mr. Bush used about him on Wednesday, and said thousands of Americans would go home ''shrouded in sad coffins'' if war came. That, together with King Hussein's revelation that he had brought no message after all from President Hussein to the United States, doused the already slight hopes of an early diplomatic solution to the crisis.
Tonight, instructions formally putting into effect the American-led naval blockade that Mr. Bush ordered last Sunday were issued by the Pentagon to United States warships in the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, the Mediterranean Sea and the Arabian Sea. They were said to authorize the use of the minimum force, like shots across the bow, to block Iraqi commerce. The Navy's interception zone includes the approaches to Aqaba. Intelligence officials here said they were concerned that the Iraqi leader, cornered, was ''starting to flail around'' in a way that could produce some rash military action. But President Bush responded with markedly mild words, both to President Hussein's accusations and to news that Baghdad had ordered 2,500 Americans in Kuwait to gather in a hotel there, threatening that laggards would be forcibly rounded up.
The United States and Iraq moved more troops toward the heavily armed frontier between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Above them, Saudi and American pilots, flying joint combat patrols, played a cat-and-mouse game in which American fliers several times ''locked on'' to Iraqi planes with their fire-control radars, only to have the Iraqis turn and head for home.
Pentagon officials disclosed that more than 45,000 marines were joining an American ground force in Saudi Arabia that is expected to reach 100,000 in the next few weeks, and the Pentagon estimated that 160,000 Iraqi troops were massed opposite the Americans, in and around Kuwait.
Another sign of the growing intensity of the crisis came in Geneva, where a senior American arms negotiator, Stephen Ledogar, said the United States reserved the right to retaliate in kind if President Hussein used nerve or mustard gas, as he has suggested.
Although the Iraqis are believed to have installed Soviet surface-to-air missiles around the Kuwait airport, fears that a large-scale new hostage crisis might be at hand prompted one member of Congress, Representative Lawrence J. Smith, Democrat of Florida, to urge the President to dispatch military planes to pick up all Americans. Mr. Bush should tell the Iraqis, he said, that if there was trouble, ''the President of the United States will consider it an act of war.''
 
Jordanian Is Grim
The situation with regard to the port of Aqaba, through which goods bound for Baghdad have been flowing unimpeded despite the sanctions, remained clouded after the talks between Mr. Bush and King Hussein.
Looking grave, the King told reporters that his country had decided to observe the sanctions when they were adopted by the Security Council on Aug. 6. He said there had been no change in his Government's position as a result of his trip to the United States and declared that ''there are no shipments at the moment'' through Aqaba to Iraq.
But he added a comment echoing those of the Jordanian Foreign Ministry in recent days, to the effect that Jordan, as a country whose economy could be shattered by sanctions, had a right to appeal to the United Nations for special asssistance under Article 50 of the Charter. And he said that Jordan could not afford to entirely close Aqaba, which he plaintively called ''our only outlet to the sea and the rest of the world.''
Asked by Mr. Bush to explain what the King meant, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d made a seemingly different point, suggesting that the Jordanian leader had been talking about a provision that permits shipments of food and medicine for humanitarian reasons.
 
'Send a Message'
Asked whether he was satisfied that goods would no longer go through Jordan to Iraq, Mr. Bush replied: ''I'm not satisfied to total satisfaction on any point regarding the sanctions. We've got to guard against cheaters. But what I am is encouraged that Jordan, prior to the King's coming here, took this position, and I think that is encouraging, and I think it might send a message to some who need a little leadership in that regard.''
Mr. Bush has threatened to block the port to Iraqi ships, but he has also offered to help offset the cost of sanctions to Jordan, which sends nearly half of its exports to Iraq and buys 90 percent of its oil from its bigger neighbor.
The President said no shipments of oil appeared to be coming out of Iraq, ''and that is very positive because 90 percent of their foreign exchange is based upon petroleum.''
King Hussein called the President ''an old friend of mine,'' but Mr. Bush signaled that deep disagreements remained between the two, chiefly over the use of American troops in Saudi Arabia, when he failed to escort the King to his helicopter on departure. Asked if he had any reason for hope, King Hussein, under great economic and political pressure to side with Iraq, answered: ''I suppose one has to have hope. Without hope you can't get anywhere.''
 
Few Will Risk Attack
Lloyd's List International, a shipping publication, reported that traffic was thinning in any event at Aqaba and that Iraq's fleet of 80 tankers and cargo ships appeared to have stopped trading entirely. Peter Tudball, vice chairman of the Baltic Exchange, an international organization that coordinates freight and ship movements, said that ''there certainly wouldn't be anyone, at the moment, willing to take any cargo into Aqaba'' because of the threatened naval quarantine of the port.
''All shipowners will be wary,'' Mr. Tudball said. ''They don't want an Exocet missile going through their ships. That limits their trading possibilities in the future.''
About 150 trucks, many of them bound for Iraq, roared up the highway from Aqaba today, but shipping agents said most were carrying goods unloaded before the sanctions were voted. Only one ship, the Norwegian-owned Tanga, was discharging cargo for Iraq.
Iran's President, Mr. Rafsanjani, made his comments about Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait in a telephone conversation with President Turgut Ozal of Turkey, an important figure in making the economic sanctions work.
The Iranian press agency quoted Mr. Rafsanjani as saying that peace with Iraq and support for Iraq's annexation of Kuwait were wholly different matters. Some Middle East specialists had speculated that a new alliance between Teheran and Baghdad was in the works that would give the Iraqis a way around the trade embargo.
Mr. Bush also talked by telephone with Mr. Ozal today and said he was ''somewhat optimistic'' that the sanctions were going to stick.
 
Coup Report Discounted
Almost lost in the flurry of developments was a report by Egypt's Middle East News Agency that Iraqi officers close to President Hussein unsuccessfully tried to assassinate him on Wednesday. Baghdad denied it, and no hint of it was heard elsewhere.
It was also reported, this time from Tokyo, that Saudi Arabia had announced a 20 percent cut in oil production, just when Iraqi and Kuwaiti production has been at least temporarily taken off the world market. The Riyadh Government denied that, but it said it has asked for an early meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to discuss the new price and supply situation.
Nigeria and other nations objected, apparently hoping to force Western nations to run down their unusually large reserves, which would give the OPEC producers more leverage.
On the eve of Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's trip to Saudi Arabia to visit American troops there, the Pentagon announced the departure of two major troop units - the 3d Armored Cavalry Regiment from Fort Bliss, Tex., and the 4th Marine Amphibious Brigade, which will set sail from Norfolk, Va., in a flotilla of 13 vessels, headed by the assault ships Guam, Nassau and Iwo Jima.
Oil prices resumed their climb as a nervous market contemplated the continuing loss of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude. Business Day, page D1.

HEADLINE: New Mission at Energy Dept.: Bomb Makers Turn to Cleanup

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 16

 BODY:
Less than two years after the Energy Department acknowledged it had caused grave pollution problems at active and inactive nuclear weapons plants in more than 30 states, the department is headed toward becoming the Government's largest environmental agency.
Accelerated by the end of the cold war, new spending by the Department on its own environmental problems is soaring, while the Environmental Protection Agency is receiving only modest budget increases.
Nuclear weapons plants that have sustained the worst environmental damage of any Government installation are now base camps for biologists, chemists, soil scientists, hydrologists, engineers and other technical specialists. Lured by multimillion-dollar contracts, they are beginning a research and cleanup program that could cost $200 billion or more over the next 30 years and is destined to become one of the country's largest and most expensive public works projects.
 
Test of Government's Ability
At the Hanford Reservation nuclear plant in Washington State alone, the environmental thrust could swell employment from the current 13,000 workers to 15,000 in a couple of years. 
The cleanup program at nuclear weapons plants is emerging as a costly test of the Government's ability to confront complex environmental problems. And the rush of attention and spending has top Energy Department officials, Congressional leaders and critics worried.
Representative Mike Synar, an Oklahoma Democrat who is the chairman of a House committee that has spent years investigating the Energy Department, said: ''Is there an anxious feeling in Congress about this cleanup program? You better believe it.
''We know we're turning this over to the same contractors that caused the problem, the same people who watched it happen and did little or nothing to prevent it. They are being rewarded for the past mistakes. But we have no other choice but to let the fox clean up the chicken house.''
 
A Reversal in Priorities
The enormous spending on environmental programs, which began in 1989 under John S. Herrington, the former Energy Secretary, and has grown under Secretary James D. Watkins, represents a nearly complete turnaround for the nuclear weapons industry. For 48 years, production of nuclear materials for atomic bombs was regarded by top officials and line workers alike as the industry's most important job.
Evidence of the new priorities came a year ago, when Mr. Watkins said bonuses to contractors who run the weapons plants would be based more on their environmental performance than on meeting production quotas.
Pushed by the public, by Congress and by its own safety officers, the Energy Department has acknowledged the extent of the problems and is sending technical experts around the country to devise cleanup plans.
In no other nuclear weapons plant in the United States has the transformation from producing materials for atomic weapons to cleaning up radioactive and chemical wastes come more suddenly than at the 560-square-mile Hanford Reservation near Richland in eastern Washington. Hanford began operating in 1943 to manufacture plutonium for the bomb that destroyed Nagasaki two years later, and continued producing atomic weapon material until December 1988, when its last processing plant was closed for safety reasons.
Mr. Watkins vowed a year ago to turn Hanford into what he called ''a world class environmental research laboratory,'' and has lavished hundreds of millions of dollars on the plant this year for a cleanup program that could last 50 years or more and cost $50 billion, according to some estimates.
In Richland and its neighboring cities, Pasco and Kennewick, the prices of homes are increasing, office space is becoming more scarce and a boom-town atmosphere is taking hold as contractors move in to share the cleanup money.
 
Defense Department, Too
The Defense Department, which this year will spend $600 million on cleaning up chemical lagoons, water and other contamination, is also awakening to the extensive pollution at its own bases and production plants around the country. In June, Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, proposed shifting substantial sums from production of equipment to solving environmental problems.
The Energy Department acknowledges that its record on large projects has been poor over the last two decades. More than $15 billion was spent since the mid-1970's on new plants that simply did not work or failed to work as promised, department audits show. Billions more was spent on excess costs due to poor management.
Last month the Energy Department said the cost of cleaning up the weapons industry in the next five years would be 50 percent higher than it estimated just a year ago. The department has sought management assistance from the Army Corps of Engineers.
Mr. Watkins and his top environmental official, Leo P. Duffy, have said the agency has neither the technical experts nor the technology for the project, which is the most complex the nuclear weapons industry has tackled since the 1940's and early 1950's when the atomic bomb was invented and the industry was created.
This fiscal year, the Energy Department will spend $2.3 billion to develop plans and start cleanup programs in the weapons industry, almost a quarter of the $9.65 billion to be spent on nuclear weapons programs. The department's total environmental budget this fiscal year is $3.4 billion, the agency comptroller's office said.
 
May Overtake E.P.A.'s Spending
In the 1991 fiscal year, which begins in October, the Energy Department's budget for environmental programs will grow to $4.3 billion, more than four times what it was in 1985. Most of the money, $2.7 billion, is to be spent on programs at the agency's weapons plants and laboratories in 12 states.
If spending on waste and pollution in the nuclear weapons industry continues to grow at the pace it has for the past two years, the Energy Department may overtake the Environmental Protection Agency as the Government's largest environmental agency in 1992, budget officers in both agencies say.
The budget for the Environmental Protection Agency, which oversees environmental programs for the entire country, is $3.1 billion this year, including $1.3 billion for the program to clean up the worst toxic waste sites. In addition, the E.P.A. administers $2.4 billion for sewer projects and water treatment plants, bringing its total budget this year to $5.5 billion. In the 1991 fiscal year, the E.P.A. budget will grow to $5.8 billion, according to Congressional and agency estimates.
 
Dangers Were Known
In its 45 years of producing materials for weapons, Hanford's nuclear reactors, processing plants, machine shops and other installations produced radioactive wastes that will remain toxic for centuries.
The plants managers knew of the danger, Government documents show, but in the 1940's, 50's and 60's they sought to save money and routinely dumped millions of gallons of radioactive material on the ground or into shallow pits, long trenches and ponds. Contamination on the surface is spreading by 20 acres annually, the most recent analysis shows, and radiation is steadily leaking into groundwater and the Columbia River.
Where the managers took precautions of isolating the most dangerous wastes in tanks, studies have shown that some has leaked. Westinghouse Hanford Company, the Westinghouse subsidiary that has operated the plant for the Energy Department since 1987, has identified 1,100 sites that are contaminated. The Energy Department last year signed an agreement with the State and the E.P.A. that sets a 30-year schedule for cleaning them up.
''We give Hanford credit for helping the nation maintain its strategic deterrent for so many years,'' Mr. Watkins said last month at a news conference in Washington. ''But now is the time to pay the piper and clean up the 40 years of generation of a variety of waste.''
The difficulty and expense of the task are illustrated by several projects under way at Hanford that are costing fortunes. In one, slightly radioactive chemicals are being removed from four concrete pools, each about as large as an Olympic-sized swimming pool. The job, begun in 1985, will not be completed until 1992 and will cost nearly $16 million.
 
Encasing Wastes in Glass
The largest environmental project currently planned for Hanford is a $1.44 billion plant that will turn 28,000 cubic yards of radioactive liquid and sludge into glass, an easier form for permanent storage. Compounding the problem is that some of this waste in tanks at Hanford has broken down chemically and could explode, Energy Department specialists say.
The plant is in its final design stage and could be completed by the end of the decade. A similar plant has been built in South Carolina at the Savannah River Plant but is not operating properly. Robert W. Brown, the deputy project manager at Hanford, promises that ''our plant will work when it's finished.''
As important as the new equipment is, changing the longtime attitudes of Hanford's workers toward environmental matters is even more vital for the project to succeed. Energy Department officials have been urging Hanford's 13,000 workers for months to replace their fervor for fighting the cold war with new zeal for confronting an opponent many have long regarded with contempt.
Clearly, the officials are having some success, if only because that is a cause for which they have shown they are willing to spend money. ''Are we all becoming environmentalists? Not likely,'' said Jerry Holloway, a spokesman for Battelle Pacific Northwest laboratories, a division of Battelle Memorial Institute that is one of Hanford's largest contractors and a center of environmental research here. ''But we can see where the money is going and where the jobs are.''
Only two years ago, as Hanford's military mission ended, economists were predicting a slump in the area's economy. Now some are worried about a housing shortage; employment at the plant is expected to grow to 14,000 next year and could reach 15,000 or more, the highest in decades.
The money being spent on the cleanup has tempted top Energy Department officials who are pursuing environmental contracts. Michael J. Lawrence, the manager of Hanford since 1984, left the Energy Department on July 28 after a 21-year career to become a top executive at Chem-Nuclear Environmental Services, a subsidiary of Waste Management Inc. that was formed in January to compete for Energy and Defense Department environmental contracts at Hanford and other weapons plants.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER PRICES ROSE LAST MONTH BY A SHARP 0.4%

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 16

 BODY:
In a sign of inflation's persistent grip on the economy, the Labor Department said today that the Consumer Price Index rose by four-tenths of 1 percent last month, a higher-than-expected increase that came despite a sharp drop in energy prices just before the Middle East crisis.
But a troubling indication of a weakening economy came from the Commerce Department's report that housing construction fell by 2.6 percent in July, the sixth straight month of decline. The report said housing activity last month was at the lowest level since September 1982, during the last recession.
Yesterday's economic statistics caused prices in both the stock and the bond markets to tumble. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 66.83 points, or 2.43 percent, to 2,681.44, and the price of the Treasury's bellwether long bonds fell more than $15 for each $1,000 face amount, sending the yield up to 8.92 percent, the highest level in more than three months. [Pages D1 and D12.] Pressure on the Fed Today's economic statistics could put pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to stimulate the economy when its policy makers meet on Tuesday. Some economists say that the Federal Reserve and its chairman, Alan Greenspan, are caught in a bind between a course intended to dampen inflation, at the expense of pushing the economy into a recession, and one that tries to avoid recession, at the expense of making inflation worse. 
''We are facing an ugly combination of lousy growth and too much inflation,'' said Donald Straszheim, an economist with Merrill Lynch & Company. ''And the Fed's anti-inflation policy has been a failure.''
Robert Barbera, the chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers, said: ''Inflation looks worse and so does the economy. The likelihood that the economy can handle the upcoming energy shock and still have a downward glide and avoid a recession is pretty dim.''
Mr. Greenspan, who was appointed Federal Reserve chairman in 1987, long withstood pressures from the Adminstration to make credit more readily available. He contended that the chances of a recession were low and that fighting inflation should be the Federal Reserve's top priority. Cutting interest rates, he feared, would cause prices to rise even more in an already-inflationary economy. He did move to make credit more available last month but said fighting inflation was still the priority.
Today's data highlight Mr. Greenspan's quandary, and have caused economists to differ on what the Federal Reserve should do. The rise in consumer prices would indicate that the Federal Reserve should not ease credit, but the prolonged drop in housing construction would indicate that it should.
Adding to the problem is the certainty that inflation will rise in the months ahead - some analysts say the rate for August might be double that of July -because of rising energy prices. Still, the July index of producer prices released last week, an indicator of future economic strength, showed a drop of one-tenth of 1 percent, which was seen as a sign of a weakening economy and a declining demand from consumers for goods.
''The pressure will be on the Fed to ease credit next Tuesday,'' said Mr. Straszheim of Merrill Lynch. ''The housing numbers indicate the economy is staggering and would suggest easing credit. But easing would be risky when we've got as much inflation as we have. My guess is that they will just stand pat for a while.''
 
A Forecast of Inaction
Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust Company, said the combination of indicators could freeze the Federal Reserve into inaction, with the rising inflation numbers precluding any efforts to lower interest rates. ''They are in a position where the economy is sluggish, the housing market is crying for relief, and inflation is still unabated,'' he said.
One important consideration for the Federal Reserve, he added, is maintaining the confidence of the bond markets by not giving the appearance that the central bank has abandoned the fight against inflation.
The Federal Reserve tries to influence interest rates by raising or lowering the Federal funds rate, which is what banks charge one another for short-term loans. In July, the Federal Reserve lowered the Federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point. But Mr. Greenspan said that the action was taken to counter a shift by banks to an overly restrictive lending policy and that the move should not be seen as a softening of his anti-inflation position. Bond prices rose slightly after that, although many bond traders said they felt the Federal Reserve's action was premature.
While many economists say that the effects of anti-inflation efforts take time to show up, others like Donald Ratajczak, director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University, say that the economy is already in a recession. He termed the recession mild and said it would ''be one of the mildest recessions as measured by the barometers we use.'' Others were less optimistic.
Some said the economy was now mired in ''stagflation,'' a combination of slow growth and inflation last seen in the late 1970's and followed by a recession in the early 1980's.
 
A Call for Action
''We are teetering close to the edge of zero or negative growth in the economy,'' said Frederick Sturm, an ecnomist with Fuji Securities Inc. ''And if they wait until the economy is into a recession, they may have to ease willy-nilly. The time to take action is now. Perhaps they can say that they haven't abandoned their anti-inflation policy, but may have to take a holiday from it.''
Joel Popkin, an economic consultant and former assistant commissioner in the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said: ''The anti-inflation policy has been in place a year and a half, and it's got to be scrapped. The Fed has got to show it will not tighten credit because of the oil shock, but it can't ease credit willy-nilly either. It's got to convince the markets it's loosening, but only on a temporary basis.''
Prices rose across the board in July, particularly in the service sectors. What was particularly troubling was that core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, rose by six-tenths of 1 percent, higher than the overall rate. Rising shelter and medical costs led the way, and sharp rises were also noted for tobacco products, resort travel and used cars. Medical costs rose nine-tenths of 1 percent. But energy costs fell seven-tenths of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf;
Navy Begins Blockade Enforcing Iraq Embargo

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 16

 BODY:
The United States said today that its naval forces in the Persian Gulf, the Gulf of Oman and the Red Sea had begun their blockade of vessels carrying oil, food and other supplies to and from Iraq and Iraqi-controlled Kuwait.
The naval quarantine took effect at 8 P.M. Eastern standard time, or at 3 A.M. Friday in the Persian Gulf, Pentagon officials said. President Bush ordered the blockade on Sunday but it did not begin until the Pentagon completed its instructions to the Navy.
Even before the blockade began, most ships in the region had been honoring the international embargo on commerce with Iraq. A formal notice advising commercial shippers of the naval action has now been issued, a Pentagon spokesman said. 
The Pentagon said American commanders were authorized to use only the minimum force needed to halt any shipments of embargoed cargo. The main zones in which ships would be intercepted include the Persian Gulf waters south of Kuwait, the Gulf of Oman and the northern part of the Red Sea, including the Gulf of Aqaba.
 
Word 'Blockade' Still Avoided
The order covers ships sailing to and from Iraq and Kuwait as well as vessels from other ports carrying goods and supplies bound for Iraq and Kuwait. The Administration has described the naval effort as ''interdiction'' rather than using the word blockade.
Vessels headed to or from other destinations, like Jordan, will be stopped only if the Navy has reason to suspect that the ships are carrying cargo destined for Iraq, a Pentagon spokesman, Pete Williams, said. If officers find prohibited cargo, they will have the authority to take the ship into custody, officials said.
Pentagon officials said the Navy's instructions had been prepared earlier but that the White House apparently did not want to issue them until King Hussein of Jordan left for home after a meeting today with Mr. Bush in Kennebunkport, Me. King Hussein has said that a total blockade of the Jordanian port of Aqaba on the Red Sea would be devastating to his country's economy.
Mr. Williams said that while the Pentagon had identified the main zones for intercepting ships, enforcement action in other parts of the region could not be ruled out. He said that no ships carrying goods to and from Iraq were close enough to port to pose an immediate test of the embargo.
If a vessel is to be halted, he said, American naval officers will first signal by radio, loudspeakers, flags, blinking lights and other means. The ship would then be boarded.
 
'Minimum' Force Unclear
If a ship refused to stop, the Navy would then be authorized to use the minimum force needed to halt it. Mr. Williams declined to specify what force could be used, saying that those orders were classified. But naval experts outside of Government have said that such action could include firing warning shots across the bow of a ship, or at its rudder or motor to disable it.
In addition to ships traveling to and from Iraq and Kuwait, the United States is continuing to monitor an Iraqi vessel in the Mediterranean that is loaded with tank engines and other military supplies purchased in Poland. Other ships are also said to be under surveillance.
The beginning of the naval effort was announced as the Pentagon confirmed that American F-15's flying patrols over Saudi Arabia near the Kuwait border locked their weapons radar onto an Iraqi jet Monday night after it entered Saudi air space. Apparently sensing that it was being targeted, the Iraqi plane turned around and flew away, the officials said.
The encounter came to light after a pool of reporters with the American forces in Saudi Arabia quoted several Air Force crew chiefs as saying that American fighter planes had locked their radars onto Iraqi jets. When a plane ''locks on'' a weapons radar, it directs a radar beam at an enemy aircraft so that it can fire an air-to-air missile at it.
The Pentagon initially said it could not confirm that such encounters had taken place, but later acknowledged the incident.
Ground crew chiefs told the pool reporters that Iraqi planes had turned back after American planes locked the weapons radar on the aircraft. Warning systems enable pilots to determine when another plane has locked its weapons radar onto them.
 
'Cat and Mouse'
''There's been a little cat and mouse but when the weapons lock on, they're gone,'' said a crew chief quoted in the pool report.
Col. John McBroom, commander of the First Tactical Fighter Wing, declined to confirm the encounters or to say how close the planes had come.
''All I'll do is remind you our radars can lock on at pretty good range,'' the pool report quoted him as saying.
Pentagon officials also provided new details today about an encounter several days ago between the American Navy and an Iraqi vessel.
Pentagon officials said the Antietam, an American guided missile cruiser, had spotted an Iraqi merchant ship near Shah Allum Shoal in the Persian Gulf that appeared to be maneuvering in an erratic fashion. The Iraqi ship was equipped with large cranes.
 
U.S. Wary of Mines
The United States Navy believes that this part of the gulf could be a likely site for laying mines because the shoal limits ships' maneuvering room.
When the Antietam directed a Navy helicopter to approach the merchant ship, Pentagon officials said, the deck crew of the Iraqi vessel quickly covered up the items on the deck and went below. The Navy later designated the region a mine-warning area, but no mines were found there, officials said.
Defense officials said there had been a report on the discovery of a mine in the Gulf area, but that the mine may have been left over from the Iran-Iraq war. Fighting between the two countries ended when a cease-fire was declared in 1988.
The Pentagon said today that the cost of deploying forces in the Gulf to defend Saudi Arabia is projected at $1.2 billion through the end of September.
The estimate does not include the cost of the potential mobilization of some reserve forces. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told President Bush on Wednesday that it would be necessary to call up some of the reserves, Administration officials have said, and Mr. Bush said today he was considering such a step.
Nor does the Pentagon's estimate include possible additional military construction projects, or the cost to the Defense Department of rising fuel prices.
The Pentagon has refused to state publicly how many troops are now in Saudi Arabia, but one military official estimated ground forces there at about 30,000.
 
Dependence on Reserve Forces
While President Bush has not yet said whether he will call up the reserves, or how many might be needed, military officials say that such a move would be needed to support a long stay in Saudi Arabia.
Mr. Williams, the Pentagon spokesman, said that the military is heavily dependent on the reserves for major operations. He said the 1.6-million member reserve force accounts for two-thirds of the Army's combat support units, from cooks to military police to medical specialists.
Reserve forces also make up 93 percent of the Navy's stevedores, 82 percent of the Navy's minesweeping ship crews, 62 percent of the Marines' bulk fuel handlers and 67 percent of the Air Force's medical evacuation crews.
The President has the authority to call up as many as 200,000 members of the reserve forces for 90 days. He can extend the call up for another 90 days.
American officials familiar with intelligence reports reported today that Syria has moved a significant force to its border with Iraq to defend itself and help pin down the Iraqis.
There have also been continued intelligence reports of Kuwaiti resistance to the Iraqi occupation, as well as reports of widespread Iraqi looting in Kuwait.

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf;
Excerpts From TV Interview With Iraqi Official

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from an interview by Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq with Ted Koppel on the ABC News program ''Nightline'' Wednesday, as transcribed by Journal Graphics.
We don't have any intention against Saudi Arabia. This has been a fabricated allegation, sorry to say, by the American Administration, but that is the truth.
Iraq has never had an intention to attack Saudi Arabia militarily. This has been used as a pretext for the American intervention in the region, the American mass of arms of all kinds, in this region. 
We made it clear to the Saudi officials from the very beginnning of the crisis that we don't have such an intention. We said that clearly in the meeting in Cairo.
We said we are ready to provide any guarantees on the bilateral level, or under the auspices of the Arab League. They did not listen. They listened to you! They listened to the allegations and wrong stories that were brought from Washington.
As far as Iraq is concerned, we don't have any intention against Saudi Arabia, as I said. There is no reason for Iraq to attack Saudi Arabia.
 
No Claim on Saudi Arabia
People don't send their armies without reasons, sincerely, across the border. We didn't have a border conflict with Saudi Arabia. We didn't ever claim that Saudi Arabia was part of Iraq.
We didn't have a political dispute with Saudi Arabia, an economic dispute with Saudi Arabia. So wars or military actions must have reasons. You don't do that, you see, you don't move your military forces without reasons.
If the United States has sent this big arsenal to the region, to defend Saudi Arabia against an alleged attack from Iraq, I think the United States is losing its time, its money, its fuel and its nerves. Because there is not such an intention in Iraq.
The explanation here or the interpretation here in Iraq and in the region is that the United States has come to commit aggression against Iraq. To weaken Iraq, to dominate the whole region with its vast oil resources. We anticipated that a few months ago when my President spoke in the summit of Amman.
 
U.S. Domination Charged
He said that the United States was planning to dominate the region, to be the sole dominator of oil market, of the policy of oil, the production, the pricing, etc. in order to safeguard its needs first. Secondly, to dominate this strategic product and use it in its hegemonic policy in the whole world.
So this is the interpretation here. If the United States has another interpretation it has to convince people. Because this mess has been built on an alleged fabrication.
We did not commit an aggression against Kuwait. We have another version of the story. As I said, this is a question which has been living with us, with the Iraqis, with the region for a very long time. And experienced politicians in the region know the facts. . . .
Why things happen now and they did not happen before? Well, it might be philosophical, but from the political side, I would say that we tried, we did our best to live in peace with the rulers of Kuwait, tried to reach a normal relationship with them, with the safeguarding of at least the minimum possible rights of Iraq. They did not cooperate. They insisted on denying everything to Iraq. They insisted on conspiring against Iraq. . . .
 
Conspiring Against Us
I have to be frank. Yes, we made it, we made it clear. I sent two letters to the Secretary General of the Arab League. And I said that these people were conspiring against us with the United States.
They wanted not only to destabilize Iraq, but they wanted to impoverish Iraq. They wanted at least to bring Iraq to its knees. What does it mean when they deliberately try to cut off half or almost half of the income of the Iraqi people by resorting to a policy in oil production, which has no reasonable reasons? . . .
There was an agreement in the OPEC. And they had to stick to their quota, which was one-point-five. They did not respect their quota. They flooded the market with a glut of oil.
They brought down the prices from $18 per barrel, to almost $11 per barrel. And that is a conspiracy! That's a war. And here I have to bring your attention to a fact.
 
A War Against Iraq
During the summit which was held in Baghdad, at the end of the summit, my President spoke frankly, sincerely, to all the leaders, in the presence of those who are concerned.
He said: ''Look, my dear brothers, a number of oil producing countries are resorting to a policy which equals a war. War can be done by arms, war can be done by economy, economic means. This is a war against Iraq. We cannot sustain it. Please don't follow such policy.''
They listened to President Saddam Hussein. As I said, he spoke in a brotherly, sincere manner. But even after that, they insisted on that policy, and they spoke in an arrogant manner that they would continue it. So we reached the conclusion that this handful of sheiks, corrupt sheiks, selfish sheiks, wanted to destroy this nation, wanted to destroy this country.
Though Kuwait was small part of Iraq in the past, we could have co-existed with it. But when that small part of Iraq is used to destroy the motherland, then things have to be corrected. And that's what happened in August this year.

HEADLINE: After Long Decline, Teen Births Are Up

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 16

 BODY:
An 18-year-long decline in teen-age birth rates has reversed itself abruptly, with the sharpest increase among mothers 15 to 17 years old, the Federal Government reports.
The finding, by the National Center for Health Statistics, drew immediate concern from health experts and social scientists who chart the health risks and economic hardship long associated with unwed teen-age motherhood.
''Any time you see an increase in births to younger teens, that's alarming,'' said Ron O'Brien of the Children's Defense Fund, a nonprofit advocacy group based in Washington. ''Teen pregnancy is a roadblock to all kinds of things for young people, and the younger it happens, the more of a roadblock it is.'' 
Researchers said it was not clear whether the rise in births to teen-agers reflected more sexual activity, less use of contraception and abortion services, or a combination of both factors.
 
Still Well Below '72 Figures
But Jacqueline Darroch Forrest of the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit research organization, said recent studies indicated an increase in the number of teen-agers who are sexually active and an increase in the use of some contraception, particularly condoms. It was not clear, she said, whether pregnant teen-agers were more reluctant to seek abortions or were finding them harder to obtain. The number of doctors, clinics and hospitals performing abortions has declined in the past five years.
The health statistics center, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services, said the teen-age birth rate reached bottom in 1986 after declining steadily since 1970. It began climbing in 1987, and in 1988, the last year covered by the statistics, it recorded a sharp increase, returning to the levels of the late 1970's.
In 1988, the number of babies born to 15- to 17-year-olds exceeeded 168,000. This was the highest number in a decade but well below the peak figure -more than 230,000 in 1972, the year before the Supreme Court overturned state laws against abortion. There were slightly more women in that age group in 1972 than in 1988.
 
One Million Out of Wedlock
From 1986 to 1988, the birth rate among 15, 16- and 17-year-olds jumped 10 percent, to 33.8 per 1,000, meaning that more than 1 in 30 women in that age group had babies in 1988.
In all, 322,000 babies - about one-twelfth of the 3.9 million born in 1988 -were born to unmarried teen-agers. The number of births to all unmarried women also rose, exceeding one million for the first time.
Dr. Forrest of the Guttmacher Institute said publicity about state laws that require teen-agers to notify at least one parent before an abortion may have dissuaded some from seeking them. ''Young kids who may be hearing this discussion may get the wrong understanding, that either abortion is not allowed for them or they have to have the consent of their parents and the consent of both parents,'' she went on. ''The legal niceties are hard to distinguish.''
This year the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Ohio and Minnesota statutes requiring that at least one parent of an unmarried woman under 18 or younger be notified before she could receive an abortion. Under both laws, a young woman can seek a judge's approval if she feels she cannot notify a parent.
Asked whether the new figures would change the Bush Administration's opposition to increases in Federal family planning budgets, Louis W. Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, told reporters at a breakfast meeting in Washington today: ''We do have a commitment to family planning. We separate out family planning from abortion. We do not believe that abortion is family planning.''
 
'Behavior Changes'
Clarke Forsythe, general counsel for the Chicago-based anti-abortion group Americans United for Life, said he doubted that the rising birth rates reflected teen-agers' unwillingness to seek abortions in states with stricter laws. In Minnesota, he said, the rates of teen-age pregnancy, birth and abortion all fell in in the first half of the 1980's, when its parental notification law was in effect. ''When restrictive laws are in place,'' he said, ''behavior changes.''
Stephanie Ventura and Caroline Lewis, the Federal demographers who wrote the new report, said unmarried teen-agers accounted for about one-third of all the unmarried mothers in 1988, down from 53 percent in 1972. But compared to the early 70's, when more than two-thirds of teen-age mothers were married, two-thirds of the teen-agers who gave birth in 1988 were unmarried.
The sharpest increase in births to young teen-agers, according to the report, came among whites. The birth rate among young black women increased more slowly.
The report showed a continuation of other patterns, in particular the increase in births to women over 40, which have risen by a third since their low point in 1983.
The trend toward more births to women aged 35 and older also continued, reaching its highest level since 1971. But the birth rate for that age group was still less than half what it was in 1960, near the peak of the baby boom.

HEADLINE: Audit Shows Railroads Are Remiss on Payroll Tax

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 16

 BODY:
A number of the country's major railroads and railroad-related businesses are failing to pay large amounts of payroll taxes to the Federal Government to finance the unemployment, retirement and medical benefits for the industry's workers, an audit indicates.
A report by the Inspector General of the Railroad Retirement Board, which was made available to several news organizations today, found that in a three-year period, 14 of 19 small to medium-size rail organizations neglected to pay $52 million in payroll taxes. It attributed the noncompliance in large part to underpayment of taxes on vacation and holiday pay and faulted the Internal Revenue Service for lax audits of payroll procedures.
An official of the Association of American Railroads said that the trade organization was ''aware of the Inspector General's allegations,'' but would have no comment on them. 
While the report said it could not deduce from this limited audit what taxes the remaining 1,157 railroad employers may have failed to pay in the 1980's, investigators said that they estimated the loss of revenue to the retirement board, a government agency, to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
 
Warning About Future Benefits
The tax deficiency does not mean that pension benefits and medical bills of railroad workers and their families have gone unpaid. In fact, the Railroad Retirement Fund currently pays $7 billion in benefits each year to 967,000 retired railroad workers. However, Government officials warned that in the future the fund would be unable to cover its obligations. There are currently more than 300,000 railroad workers.
Bush Administration officials and Congressional investigators familiar with the audit added that without better tax compliance by the railroad industry, the taxpayers will almost certainly have to ante up billions of dollars over the long run to cover the shortfall in funds for pensions and medical care for retired railroad workers.
Such a taxpayer bailout would be small compared with the savings and loan scandal, but it would come at a time when the resources of the Government will be more strained than they are now, they added.
In addition to the investigation by the Inspector General, the failure to pay taxes by the industry is being examined by the House Government Operations Committee and the Office of Management and Budget.
 
Earlier Warning by Darman
Richard G. Darman, the budget director, flagged the growing concern about the railroad pension system in his budget report last January, in which he identified the inadequately financed pension system as one of the growing number of contingent liabilities of the Federal Government that could come back and bite taxpayers.
He described them as ''hidden Pacmen waiting to spring forward and consume another line of resource dots in the budget maze.''
In particular, he noted that the Railroad Retirement Board's fund is currently underfinanced, on an actuarial basis, by $14 billion. This means that by the time the last worker covered by the pension system retires, the fund's shortfall would total at least that amount, and because of certain Government guarantees, the taxpayer would be left with the bill.
The issue of tax noncompliance is also being investigated by the Government Operations Committee, whose chairman, Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat from Michigan, complained that the Bush Adminstration had not given this issue a high enough priority.
''The audits clearly demonstrate that the insurance and retirement funds of American railroad workers and their families are well below the radar of protection and oversight against financial predators,'' he said. ''Railroad employees' payroll taxes are not scrutinized by the Internal Revenue Service, internal auditors or public accountants.''
 
Industry Opposition Reported
Congressional investigators and a Bush Administration official said that Inspector General William J. Doyle 3d, after initially getting cooperation from the industry on his audits, was encountering considerable opposition from the industry.
''It appears the railroad industry is starting to circle the wagons,'' said one Congressional aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''He is having trouble getting access to records.''
Efforts to reach Mr. Doyle by telephone were unsuccessful.
The report by Mr. Doyle attributed the tax noncompliance in large measure to failure by the I.R.S. to audit payroll tax procedures by the railroad industry. The report carefully couched the loss of tax revenues as an issue of noncompliance, rather than alleging that the industry had intentionally underpaid taxes, which would be tantamount to fraud.
''The Office of Inspector General had serious concerns that the Railroad Retirement Board had no method of insuring that the railroad employers were complying with the railroad employment tax laws,'' the report said. ''As a result, the office initiated a strategy to perform payroll audits of the employers.''
It added, ''The statute of limitations allows us to go back only three years, and as a result significant tax revenues may be lost.''
Specifically, the report found that from 1986 to 1988 the group of 19 companies underpaid payroll taxes by $52.3 million, and that after adding I.R.S. penalties and interest, that amount is currently worth $73.6 million.
Congressional investigators said the industry's giant railroad networks had not yet been audited for payroll tax compliance by Mr. Doyle.

Quiet, Please! Air Traffic Rerouted From U.S. Open

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
As a result of the intercession of New York City's No. 1 tennis fan, players at this year's United States Open are less likely to be thrown off their games by the incessant roar of departing airplanes. Fans at the National Tennis Center should benefit, too, by hearing the distinct thwock of each serve and volley, not to mention the full range of Monica Seles's grunts and Andre Agassi's groans.
Responding directly to an appeal from Mayor David N. Dinkins, the Federal Aviation Administration announced yesterday that special takeoff procedures normally put into effect at La Guardia Airport only during the two days of men's and women's singles finals would be extended to the entire 14-day tournament, which begins Aug. 27 and runs to Sept. 9.
That means that to the extent weather conditions permit, planes taking off during tournament hours will not use the notorious Runway 13, whose normal takeoff pattern takes planes directly over the tennis stadium in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens. 
 
Would Bypass Park
And when conditions do force the use of Runway 13, planes will follow an established but rarely used takeoff pattern that bypasses the park.
The decision by the F.A.A. to modify takeoff patterns during the tournament came in response to a joint request by Mayor Dinkins and the Queens borough president, Claire Shulman, the same request, an aide to Shulman noted, that she had made routinely to the F.A.A. year after year without noticeable effect on F.A.A. procedures.
The difference this year, according to the Borough President's counsel, Nick Garaufis, was the enthusiastic intervention of a ''forceful'' mayor, who, as one of the mayor's spokesmen, Annabel Franzeschini, put it yesterday, ''really loves tennis,'' so much, she noted, that ''he plays almost every day.'' (By contrast, the Mayor's predecessor, Edward I. Koch, was famous for his active aversion to any athletic endeavor notJU involving chopsticks.) In addition to his own love for tennis, Mayor Dinkins had another incentive to press especially hard for the F.A.A.'s cooperation this year. The United States Tennis Association, whose lease on the National Tennis Center expires after the 1994 tournament, is expected to decide before the end of the year whether to renew the lease or move the tournament elsewhere. Such a development, the Mayor said yesterday, would cost the city economy more than $100 million in revenues from the two-week event.
Complaints about the noise of La Guardia takeoffs have been almost as incessant as the takeoffs themselves (about 500 a day) ever since the Open moved from its former home at the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills in 1978.
 
Curren Still Skeptical
Players often gripe about the distraction of departing aircraft, although few quite as forcefully as Kevin Curren, who once expressed the wish that the low-flying planes should be used to bomb the stadium.
Yesterday, Curren remained skeptical about what effect the new procedure would have. ''I'm sure it will definitely help,'' he said from Indianapolis. ''But in my eyes, the Open still lags behind the other majors with atmosphere. That's why they're looking for another venue. I don't think the fact that they're rerouting the planes will all of a sudden make it the best grand slam. You have to look at the overall picture.''
In announcing the changes, the F.A.A. stressed that takeoff patterns to be used during tournament hours were all well-established routines that posed no threat to safety or convenience of passengers.
''They will cause no delays,'' said Kathleen Berger, a spokesman for the F.A.A.'s regional commissioner, Daniel Peterson.
If weather or other conditions force the F.A.A. to resume using Runway 13 for takeoffs and to employ the alternate flight path to avoid Flushing Meadows, she said, the silence at the stadium would be achieved at the expense of residents of ''a small area of Flushing,'' the very residents, she ackowledged, whose complaints years ago led the F.A.A. to route Runway 13 takeoffs over the park in the first place. ''We plan to monitor things very carefully,'' she said. If all goes well, however, planes leaving La Guardia during tournament hours will simply use the airport's two other takeoff paths, No. 31, which is No. 13 going in the opposite direction, and No. 4, which heads straight over Flushing Bay. (No. 4's opposite, Runway 22, is almost never used for takeoffs because it leads to heavily congested areas.)

HEADLINE: Democracy Betrayed in Myanmar

 BODY:
It seemed like a fairy-tale ending to 28 years of ruinous military dictatorship in Myanmar, formerly Burma. In May, in the country's first free election since 1962, an overwhelming majority voted for a party of persecuted opposition democrats, the National League for Democracy.
But Myanmar's people have scarcely lived happily ever since. Their best remaining hope for compelling their rulers to honor the popular will is for increased diplomatic and economic pressure from the international community, including the United States. 
The Slorc - the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council - has been acting as if the election never occurred, and as if the Slorc itself had not pledged to turn over power to the victor. The newly elected legislators have still not been allowed to take their seats. Worse, the Slorc now says that the assembly will be allowed to do no more than adopt a Slorc-approved constitution. Then it will be disbanded and another assembly elected under new electoral rules.
Meanwhile, the leading figure in the National League for Democracy, Aung San Suu Kyi, remains in prison, even though her nominal sentence has run out. Hundreds of her party colleagues also remain jailed. Demonstrators supporting the election results and commemorating past massacres have been shot at, and in some cases killed.
The United States has properly kept its diplomatic distance from the Slorc since troops mowed down Burmese democrats in the streets two years ago. And Congress recently passed a bill sponsored by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York imposing economic sanctions if President Bush cannot certify concrete steps toward democratic rule by Oct. 1.
That will help, but the Slorc would be even more impressed by pressure from Myanmar's neighbor and trading partner, Thailand, and from Asia's economic power, Japan. Developments from South Africa to the Persian Gulf suggest that the international community can exert effective pressure, but only if it acts in concert.

Now Here's the Deal With the Oil Moguls

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Saddam Hussein is surely a villain worthy of the next round of Rambo movies. But as we commit ourselves to defend the rich, conservative, Persian Gulf monarchies, the American public and Congress deserve to know fully the deal we have made over the years with Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The deal seems to include the following main components: (1) The gulf monarchies agree to pump oil, lots of oil, in excess of the quotas of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. This oil surplus angers other petroleum exporters, but holds down world prices and our balance-of-trade deficit. (2) The rich, thinly populated gulf monarchies, not needing nearly all the oil revenue, agree to put much of it in United States banks and investments. This inflow of oil dollars is extremely important for our credit markets, property values, interest rates and the dollar. (3) The United States, in return, agrees to defend the gulf monarchies, first from Iran, now from Iraq.
Georges Clemenceau, the French statesman, once said, ''A drop of oil is worth a drop of blood.'' If it is Arab oil for American blood, let us know the full terms.

HEADLINE: LAW: AT THE BAR;
More lawyers are less happy at their work, a survey finds.

BYLINE: By David Margolick

 BODY:
An American Bar Association survey has corroborated what has become increasingly apparent to lawyers, legal recruiters and psychiatrists: job dissatisfaction among lawyers is widespread, profound and growing worse.
Since a similar survey was taken in 1984, the number of lawyers saying they are ''very satisfied'' with their work has decreased by 20 percent, to slightly more than 3 in 10. The rest, from all levels of seniority and kinds of practice, report that they are less fulfilled, more fatigued, more stressed, more caught up in office politics, more likely to be in unhappy marriages and more likely to drink excessively than they once did.
Authorities on the legal profession said the results reflect the growing economic pressures on lawyers in an adverse economy. ''People were miserable before, but were willing to put up with it because they were making a lot of money,'' said Celia Paul, whose six-year-old counseling service for disaffected lawyers now handles 2,000 people a year. ''If there's less money, other rewards have to fill that vacuum, and they just aren't there.'' 
Other explanations, they say, include the volatility of the legal marketplace, even among partners, and the coming of age of a younger generation that entered the profession either with unrealistic expectations or, in many cases, almost by accident.
''For about the past 15 years it has been sort of a knee-jerk thing that if you decide not to go to medical school or business school, you go to law school by default,'' said Carol M. Kanarek, a New York-based consultant on legal personnel matters.
That impulse, she said, was spurred on by the feelings that a law degree is ''infinitely flexible'' and that the profession is glamorous - an impression fostered by television portrayals of lawyers as sexy characters driving sports cars and working on cutting-edge issues.
''As a result, the gap between expectations and reality is much greater than in the past,'' she said. ''Our parents' generation of lawyers tended to have a more realistic sense of what the practice was all about.''
The bar survey also found that at a time when teetotalism is increasing, there has been ''an astonishing rise'' in drinking among lawyers, particularly women. In 1984 less than half of 1 percent of those surveyed reported consuming six or more drinks a day. That figure has now risen to 13 percent, including one in every five female lawyers.
That, in turn, is part of the still greater malaise among women in the profession, even as their numbers continue to grow.
Those questioned in the survey were selected at random from lists containing the names of almost all lawyers in the United States, both A.B.A. members and nonmembers. In March each was mailed a copy of the survey; those failing to respond to that or a follow-up postcard were then interviewed by phone. They were promised confidentiality.
Only 3 to 4 percent of the 2,289 lawyers participating in the survey, conducted by the bar association's young lawyers division, said they planned to leave the profession in the next two years. But even if an exodus is not imminent, the survey says, the prevailing levels of unhappiness bode ill for the law profession and the people it employs and serves.
''The increased stress of dissatisfaction and billable hours have disturbing and important implications for the profession,'' says the report, which was released at the bar group's recently concluded annual meeting in Chicago. ''These lie in the area of increasing social dysfunction or destructive behavior by lawyers and the impact of this behavior on themselves, their families, their quality of work and productivity, their firms and their clients.''
Ronald L. Hirsch, the A.B.A. official who conducted the 1990 and 1984 surveys, said the greatest change was not so much in the depth of the dissatisfaction as in its scope, which he attributed to ''a deterioration of the law firm environment.''
Mr. Hirsch said the bar association planned to hold what he called an ''ice-breaking, seminal conference'' next April, at which lawyers, psychologists, sociologists and others would discuss the growing malaise among lawyers and what could be done about it.
Twenty-two percent of all male partners in private practice said they were dissatisfied with their work, as opposed to only 9 percent in 1984. For female partners, the figure rose to 42 percent from 15 percent. Forty-three percent of all men in solo practice said they were dissatisfied; among women, it was 55 percent.
''It's not just young lawyers and it's not just in the largest firms,'' said Mr. Hirsch, a former senior administrator at the National Opinion Research Center in Chicago. ''It's systemic. It's everywhere.''
According to the survey, public notions of how much money lawyers make, based largely on the hefty salaries paid to beginning lawyers at large firms in New York, are wildly exaggerated. Fifty-nine percent of all lawyers nationwide earn less than the $83,000 paid to beginning lawyers on Wall Street. But unhappiness over pay is not a principle cause of low morale among lawyers.
Instead, the despair is felt over quality-of-life issues. Respondents cited growing political intrigue and backbiting in the office, greater pressure to work longer hours and a concomitant decrease in personal time and time with families. Half of those surveyed in private practice reported working at least 200 hours a month, up from only 35 percent six years ago; 13 percent say they work more than 240 hours.
In nearly every category, women report greater job dissatisfaction than men.
The women interviewed were less challenged intellectually by their work than were men, found the office atmosphere less congenial, complained that they had fewer chances for advancement than men, were less likely to be judged solely on the quality of their work and were more likely to feel they did not have enough time for themselves.
The disaffection has spread to the upper reaches of the profession, where the lucrative salaries based largely on seniority, collegiality and security have waned in a newly competitive marketplace.
''The camaraderie and the loyalty have broken down,'' said Elaine P. Dine, a legal recruiter in New York. ''With everything bottom-line orientated, many partners feel as though they're employees of a corporation rather than members of a firm.''
Perhaps more than any lawyer in the land, Alan U. Schwartz of Los Angeles personifies the upheavals and unhappinesses of a newly peripatetic profession. (Among Mr. Schwartz's clients is Mel Brooks. In the movie ''Spaceballs,'' when Mr. Brooks declared, ''May the Schwartz be with you,'' it was to Alan Schwartz that he was referring.) For 21 years Mr. Schwartz worked in the gentlemanly world of Greenbaum, Wolff & Ernst, where his clients included Svetlana Alliluyeva, Stalin's daughter. The firm disintegrated in 1982, and since then Mr. Schwartz has gathered little moss.
From Greenbaum he moved to Barovick, Konecky, Braun, Schwartz, Kay & Schiff, which merged with Fulop & Hardee, which then fell apart. He went to Finley, Kumble, Wagner, Heine, Underberg, Manley, Myerson & Casey, which closed in early 1988. From there he went to the Los Angeles office of Shea & Gould, which also disbanded, then to Meyerson & Kuhn, which recently filed for bankruptcy. He is now at Cooper, Epstein & Hurewitz in Beverly Hills.
''It was much more of a profession when I started,'' Mr. Schwartz said. ''People did not expect to make big bucks so much as they expected a kind of way of life and practice.''
Some younger lawyers have even decided to abandon law entirely in favor of something they enjoy doing. In April 1988, Lynn Armentrout, a 1981 graduate of New York University Law School, took a leave of absence from her post at the Legal Aid Society office in the Bronx to pursue a career as a dancer. She has since decided not to return to law.
''I went to law school to make a difference in the world and I wasn't,'' said Ms. Armentrout, a 35-year-old dancer with the Isadora Duncan International Institute. ''What was missing is the emotional and spiritual content - all the things that make life important.''
At WEGX-FM in Philadelphia, a lapsed lawyer named Sam Milkman is the host of a top-40 music show twice weekly. It is only one of the many tasks handled at the station by Mr. Milkman, a 27-year-old Cornell Law School graduate who until March was an associate at the Philadelphia law firm of Ballard, Spahr, Andrews & Ingersoll.
''I always felt like a misfit as a lawyer,'' said Mr. Milkman. ''I found myself in the middle of depositions not really caring what the outcome was.''
In making his move, he said, he was the envy of his former law firm colleagues. ''One of the associates, who has since become a partner, said, 'When one of the prisoners breaks free all of the prisoners are happy,' '' Mr. Milkman recalled. Maura Carlin, 29, of Manhattan was a litigator at Sidley & Austin before deciding to take a long-postponed shot at broadcast journalism. ''I can't tell you I hated the law or practicing it because it's not exactly true, but there was something else I really wanted to do and this is the time to try it or I'd be too old,'' she said. ''I always had this vision of myself saving the world, and the practice of law as I knew it was very far from that.''
Ms. Carlin said she was prepared to take as much as an 80 percent cut in pay. Speaking of her new salary, she said, ''It's such a ridiculous number, it's comical.''

HEADLINE: Surrealism Meets Politics in Festival Latino Film

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
In ''Gentile Alouette'' (''The Colonel's Star''), one of the most intriguing features to be shown in the 1990 Festival Latino Film series, Geraldine Chaplin portrays a Hispanic movie actress working in Paris who is stalked by a colonel of the secret police of an unnamed Latin American country.
The colonel, who is played by Hector Alterio, a star of the critically acclaimed 1985 film ''The Official Story,'' was once involved with the woman, and now he suspects her of being politically active in an anti-Government group. His memories and suspicions fuse in fantasy scenarios of capturing the elusive, chameleonlike woman who is ultimately invulnerable.
The French-Chilean allegory, written and directed by Sergio Castilla, combines surrealism and high comedy in a visionary style that with its echoes of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Luis Bunuel seems quintessentially Latin American in spirit.
''There has always been a strong element of surrealism in Latin American culture,'' Mr. Castilla said recently. ''If you go all the way back to 'Don Quixote,' there are many surreal elements of fantasy and ghosts. You have surrealism in American movies too, but it is confined mostly to genre pictures.'' 
''Gentile Alouette,'' which is to be shown on Aug. 28, 29 and 30, is among the 28 contemporary feature films in the festival, which has its first screenings today at the Worldwide Cinemas. Of those films, 25 are to be in competition for awards. The competition is only one arm of a festival that is to show some 150 films during two weeks. There are also to be separate retrospectives of Mexican, Argentine and Cuban movies and a program of documentaries and experimental and short films.
 
'A More Serious Event'
This is the sixth year of the Festival Latino Film, which is presented by Joseph Papp's Public Theater, and the second year that it has been a competitive event. The only other Latin American film event of comparable scope, said Cecilia Vega, who directs the festival with Oscar Ciccone, is the noncompetitive Havana film festival, which has been in existence for 12 years.
The New York competition was inaugurated, Ms. Vega said, to give producers more incentive to participate and to gain more attention from the press.
''Because of money problems in Latin American countries, it has often been difficult to get the films,'' she said. ''Since becoming competitive, it's become a more serious event, and producers have been more willing to invest in subtitles. This year, many of the producers and the stars will be here.''
The contestants this year were chosen from about 100 entries. Eleven countries are represented, including the United States. Among the new films in competition, the first two to be shown, at 6:45 and 9 this evening, are ''Cien Veces No Debo'' (''A Hundred Times, No'') from Argentina and ''Lo Que le Paso a Santiago'' (''What Happened to Santiago?'') from Puerto Rico.
Alejandro Doria's ''Cien Veces No Debo'' is a scathing satiric farce that ridicules the duplicitous sexual morality of the Argentine bourgeoisie. When the daughter of a middle-class Buenos Aires couple announces to her parents that she is pregnant and that she isn't certain who the father is, they frenziedly attempt to arrange a respectable-looking solution to the situation.
The portraits of the family members are etched in acid. The spoiled slatternly daughter rejoices in her sexual powers. Her father can barely conceal his desire for her, while her mother's curiosity about her daughter's sexual life is intense to the point of prurience. The mother is played by Norma Aleandro, who starred in ''The Official Story.''
Jacobo Morales's ''Que le Paso a Santiago,'' which is not in competition, explores love after the age of 60 and features Tommy Muniz and Gladys Rodriguez, the stars of ''Los Garcia,'' a popular Puerto Rican television series. Mr. Muniz portrays a retired widower and former accountant who confides his feelings to a mysterious woman who befriends him after a chance meeting.
The film, which was nominated this year for an Academy Award as best foreign film, is the third feature by the writer and director, who is also an actor, a poet and a popular Puerto Rican broadcasting personality. Earlier this month, he performed at the Public Theater with his ''Saturday Night Live''-style comedy troupe, Los Rayos Gamma (the Gamma Rays).
Mr. Morales recently said that his main character came into focus after he had seen a Puerto Rican production of Neil Simon's play ''The Sunshine Boys.'' ''Santiago,'' which has been sold for international distribution, cost a half-million dollars to make, he said, and is the first of his three films to have made a a profit.
''In Puerto Rico, we have all the elements to establish a very modest film industry that can do three or four films a year,'' he said. ''But with a population of only three million, we don't have enough people to recoup the investment without other markets.''
 
A New Yorker's Roots
''El Sol y la Luna'' (''The Sun and the Moon''), to be shown on Wednesday and next Friday and Saturday, is the festival's only American entry and its only English-language film. It describes a New York City woman's awakening to her Puerto Rican cultural roots. In the throes of a midlife crisis, she visits the South Bronx neighborhood where she grew up and organizes a tenants' association in her relatives' run-down apartment building. At the same time, she becomes involved with a lawyer who is active in the Puerto Rican separatist movement.
The film represents the directorial debut of Kevin Conway, who was recently seen Off Broadway as the unscrupulous Wall Street profiteer in the drama ''Other People's Money.''
Mr. Conway said recently that he had been involved in helping raise money for ''The Sun and the Moon'' and assumed the director's reins only after the original director became ill.
''The story intrigued me because my former wife is a Hispanic-American woman,'' he said. ''The film deals with the cultural schizophrenia of Puerto Rican Americans. They're divided between America and an island that many of them consider a country with a different culture and language than the United States.
''At the same time, they are already American citizens who are only three hours away by plane from New York and Chicago.''
 
A Film Noir
Some other competing films that have generated positive advance word of mouth include ''Baton Rouge'' from Spain; ''Kindergarten'' and ''Ultimas Imagenes del Naufragio'' (''Last Images of the Shipwreck''), both from Argentina; ''Festa'' (''Party'') from Brazil, and ''La Bella del Alhambra'' (''The Belle of the Alhambra'') from Cuba.
Rafael Monleon's ''Baton Rouge,'' which is to be shown tomorrow and on Tuesday, is a sexy film noir that stars three of Pedro Almodovar's favorite actors: Carmen Maura, Antonio Banderas and Victoria Abril. They respectively portray a wealthy woman, her scheming gigolo lover and the ruthless psychiatrist the two consult to cure her nightmares.
Jorge Polaco's ''Kindergarten,'' an obsessive love story to be screened tomorrow and on Monday, has the distinction of being the only Argentine film since the country's return to democracy to have been officially confiscated by the Government and labeled pornographic. Eliseo Subiela's surreal ''Ultimas Imagenes del Naufragio,'' to be shown on Aug. 27, 29 and 30, tells the story of an aspiring novelist whose life is taken over by a family that insists that he write its future.
Ugo Giorgetti's ''Festa,'' which has screenings tomorrow, Monday and Wednesday, is a comic variation on Sartre's ''No Exit.'' Two pool sharks and a harmonica player who have been hired to entertain at a fancy Sao Paulo party wait for what becomes an eternity in the host's basement. ''La Bella del Alhambra,'' a musical to be shown on Tuesday and Thursday, re-creates the Cuban cabaret world of the 1920's.
 
Heeding Hollywood
The festival's three retrospective series, to be screened at the Worldwide Cinemas, re-examine national cinematic traditions of Mexico, Cuba and Argentina. All three reflect a growing respect among Latin American film makers for work that pays heed to Hollywood styles and methods of movie making.
''During the 60's, Latin American film makers became very politicized and backed away from an industry they saw as based on the Hollywood models,'' said Paul Lenti, a press representative for the festival and a student of Latin American film.
''A lot of it came from the political movements in Cuba and Chile, but it was also influenced by the French New Wave. Then, the idea was to use cinema not just to entertain but to change society. But a lot of those social and political films became dated very quickly, and they didn't impact on the community as much as those films that used fiction to put across a message.
''That's why in the last five years the whole stress has been in getting back to the script. With that has come a re-evaluation and a new appreciation for work that in the past had been denigrated.''
The Mexican Films From the Golden Age series, which is to begin today, concentrates on six movies made in the 1940's and 1950's and featuring such stars as Dolores de Rio, Maria Felix, and Pedro Armendariz. It includes the Dolores del Rio classic ''Maria Candelaria,'' which is to be shown today and tomorrow.
The era being examined was one in which Hollywood producers invested money in Mexico to compete in the Latin American market, Mr. Lenti said. That investment had a political objective. Because Argentina had declared itself neutral during World War II, a goal was to destroy the Argentine film market, which was Mexico's main competitor in the Latin American sphere.
The Argentine retrospective, which is to begin on Sunday, consists of 16 films, beginning with ''Tango!,'' the first optical sound film produced in Argentina, in 1933, and featuring the popular star Libertad Lamarque. It ends in the late 1950's. The Argentine films, unfortunately, have no subtitles.
The 30-film Cuban historical survey, which is to begin on Wednesday, represents the largest retrospective of the Cuban cinema yet screened in the United States and the first to include Cuban films produced before the Communist revolution. The panorama was assembled by the Government-financed Cuban Film Institute I.C.A.I.C. (Instituo Cubano del Arte e Industria Cinematograficos), which was largely responsible for establishing Cuba as a significant film-making country in the 1960's. The best-known work to be shown is probably Tomas Gutierrez Alez's 1968 film, ''Memorias del Subdesarrollo'' (''Memories of Underdevelopment''), which is to be screened on Thursday.
 
With Documentaries
Rounding out the festival is its program of documentaries, experimental films and short fiction, which this year consists of 56 films of every shape and size from 14 countries, with Brazil and Cuba the most heavily represented. The series runs from Aug. 24 to 30 at the Public Theater. Films of special note include ''Desembarcos'' (''When Memory Speaks''), an Argentine film about the need to remember the thousands who were kidnapped and murdered during the military dictatorship; ''Permiso Para Pensar'' (''Permission to Think''), also from Argentina, which uses archive clips to explore the Juan Peron era, and from England, Jana Bokova's urban documentary ''Havana.''
If the Festival Latino series demonstrates the artistic richness and breadth of Latin American cinema, perhaps even more crucial is its role in keeping the economic lifeblood of a fragmented industry circulating.
''We want to create both a market and a base for the distribution of Latin American films,'' Ms. Vega said. ''Last year, our audience was 50 percent Latino and 50 percent Anglo-American. In the United States, the Latino population is more than 30 million. It is an important market for our cinema. Our festival is proving that the audience for Latin American films exists.''

HEADLINE: Auctions

BYLINE: By Carol Vogel

 BODY:
In 1988, Habsburg, Feldman, a little-known Geneva-based auction house with lofty ambitions, opened a New York City office in a grand town house on the Upper East Side.
The company, which had built its reputation primarily by selling clocks and watches, stamps and Art Deco furniture, wanted to expand its operation. It quickly added a department of Old Masters and 19th-century paintings. Then it created a department specializing in Impressionist, modern and contemporary art and hired Thilo von Watzdorf, a 17-year veteran of Sotheby's, to run it.
For the first year or so, the investment seemed to be paying off. As the auction market boomed, so did Habsburg, Feldman. But eventually the company's own unrealistic expectations and a precarious economy took their toll. Undercapitalized and overextended, Habsburg, Feldman started to sink. In April, David Feldman, one of the auction house's founders, left the company. 
Now, Habsburg, Feldman is retrenching. It has eliminated both of its paintings departments, and it has made major staffing cuts, both in New York and in Geneva. The company is even putting its town house headquarters up for sale.
In September, a group of Geneva investors, headed by Lowe Finance, will hold a majority of the company's shares, and the auction house will be renamed Habsburg & Company.
 
A 'Fatal' Market
''We really had no option,'' said Geza von Habsburg, one of the firm's founders, who ran Christie's office in Geneva for nearly 20 years. ''A small firm such as ours can barely survive in a buoyant market, but in a slump, as we are experiencing now, it's fatal.''
To some art-market specialists, this is a tale of naivete, the story of a group of auction-house veterans who should have known better. Experts say the New York operation was doomed from the start. ''They drew a road map that was not possible to follow,'' said Diana D. Brooks, the president of Sotheby's New York. ''The company expected instant results and got them the first year because the market was with them. But as soon as things went bad, they ran scared.''
Unlike small, local auction houses like William Doyle, which cater to the lower end of the market, Habsburg, Feldman tried to compete internationally for high-priced works of art and in the process was forced to stretch beyond its means. It issued lavish catalogues, often sending them to clients by overnight mail. It also produced a newsletter and held countless, opulent receptions.
''In order to enter into a new field, we had to be particularly aggressive,'' said Mr. von Habsburg, a great-grandson of Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria. ''We offered guarantees that were too big and put reserves on paintings that were too high.'' Guarantees are the prices the auction house assures that a seller will receive from the sale of his property; reserves are the confidential minimum prices below which the house will not sell property.
 
'The Kiss of Death'
In today's competitive climate, in which there are only so many good pictures on the market, Habsburg, Feldman was often forced to settle for selling second-rate works of art. ''Consigners are reluctant to risk selling big-ticket items to people who don't have a proven track record,'' explained William Doyle, owner of the Manhattan-based auction house that bears his name. ''As a result, Habsburg, Feldman was left to sell dealer's goods, paintings that had been on the market for too long. And that's the kiss of death.''
Moreover, said Francois Curiel, the managing director of Christie's Europe, ''There exists a lack of expert business-getters in the auction world itself. But for a new company, it's particularly hard to recruit them. And if the kitchen can't produce the food, then they're in real trouble.''
Even so, in the beginning Habsburg, Feldman did better than it expected. In its first year and a half in New York, the house sold art and objects worth more than $50 million. It was this spring, when the market began to soften, that things fell apart. Two sales in particular were disasters: in the house's May sale of Impressionist and modern pictures, 85 percent of the works found no buyers, and in a spring sale of contemporary Soviet artworks 50 percent of the goods remained unsold.
''Initially, 40 percent of the group's profits were from the Impressionist and modern paintings,'' Mr. von Wazdorf said. ''But at the first sign of trouble, the board of directors in Geneva decided to pull the plug on the whole department.''
 
The Boutique Approach
Like Sotheby's and Christie's, where the departments of modern and contemporary paintings are the main source of profits, Habsburg, Feldman expected money from sales of paintings to carry the New York operation. By marketing itself as a boutique firm - a small operation that showed works of art in a homelike setting - Habsburg, Feldman hoped to attract important clients by stressing its exclusivity and personal service.
''We were offering people an alternative,'' Mr. von Wazdorf explained. ''A proper international auction house where paintings wouldn't get lost, as they so easily could in the large sales at Sotheby's and Christie's. Pictures were even marketed in an international way, with previews in Japan.''
Initially, some were intrigued. Bryn Mawr College, for example, consigned Marc Chagall's ''Violoniste au Monde Renverse'', an early work dating from 1929 that sold in May 1989 for $4.62 million, a record price for the artist.
And during its first year in New York, the auction house reported five record sales of works by artists including Kees van Dongen, Maurice de Vlaminck and Auguste Rodin. ''When I had stock to get rid of, they were a good showcase,'' said Marzina Marzetti, the director of the Urban Gallery in Paris and vice president of that company's New York operations. ''I sold several works of art that would have gotten lost at Sotheby's or Christie's sales. Still, I would never have given them an important painting to sell.''
 
In Hindsight
As in any business, timing is everything. ''Looking back I realize we started too late,'' Mr. von Habsburg said. ''If we had gone into business five years earlier, we'd be all right now.''
And Mr. Feldman said the owners really had no idea what they were in for. ''We didn't know the auction world well enough,'' he said. Mr. Feldman is credited with creating several successful art businesses, including one of the largest stamp houses in the world.
Along with the struggles of putting together strong sales and carrying a large overhead, the company also faced difficulty in collecting payments from buyers. ''We have been out of pocket for over $10 million of receivables,'' Mr. von Habsburg said. ''A big company can absorb such problems. We can't.''
Internal conflicts, culminating in Mr. Feldman's departure, added to the company's problems. His reasons for leaving the auction house, he said, centered on personality clashes as well as basic business differences. This leaves three men to run the company: Mr. von Habsburg, Osvaldo Patrizzi, a Geneva-based auctioneer who is an expert on clocks and watches, and Karl Wellner, the chief executive of the company's New York office.
 
New Strategies to Compete
''We have decided to stick to fields we know we are good at,'' Mr. von Habsburg said. ''Clocks and watches, silver and Art Deco. That's not to say that we won't be venturing into new areas. We're planning a sale of jewelry and another of Old Master paintings. The company is also going to hold special events such as exhibitions where the works of art will be for sale and silent auctions.''
''In order to compete, we have to find new approaches to the market,'' he added. ''And to stick to niches where we can supply objects to the public that others can't.''

Housing starts fell 2.6 percent last month from June, the sixth straight monthly decline, cutting building activity to its weakest pace in nearly eight years, the Government said. [D4.] The number of new shopping-centers being built in the U.S. fell sharply in the first half of 1990, a trade group said. [D2.]
 
THE OIL JOLT
 
President Bush and King Hussein of Jordan failed to make significant progress toward easing the Middle East crisis, and Mr. Bush was apparently unable to win ironclad assurances from the King that he would halt shipments to Baghdad. [A1.]

Since Iraq's occupation of Kuwait, many industrialized nations have looked nervously to countries like Mexico, one of the largest producers of oil outside the Middle East. But Mexico's state-owned oil company, long past the glory days of the early 1980's when prices were high, will probably not be much help. Short of cash, it is worried about its ability to produce enough oil even to satisfy domestic demand, Indeed, the company, Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, is being forced into an important change: The institution that represents a nationalist aspiration to run the economy free of foreign interference is beginning to behave like an international corporation. It is seeking foreign investment and cutting costs, reducing the multimillion-dollar social programs it has subsidized for decades.
''What is forcing the change is the realization that we will not have enough energy,'' said Rogelio Ramirez de la O, publisher of an economics newsletter. ''Over the long run, unless we put enormous sums into petroleum and petrochemicals, we will have to import these products.''
The failure to invest significantly in oil exploration - capital spending has fallen from nearly $6 billion in 1981 to just over $1 billion - has reduced Pemex's potential output in recent years. 
Even if Pemex finds the money to undertake all-out exploration, the additional oil would not be available for three or four years, experts say. And some Mexican Government officials have expressed reluctance to increase exports sharply because this would deplete reserves and once again make the country overly dependent on oil revenues.
For the United States, which relies on Pemex for 7 percent of its oil imports and could put pressure on Mexico for more if Middle East supplies tighten, the changes at Pemex are not likely to show up in increased imports of oil. But Mexico has agreed to help out other nations temporarily by increasing exports by almost 10 percent for two months.
The meaning for Mexico of the changes at Pemex is that the big state company is beginning to chip away at its traditional role as a sort of symbolic bulwark against foreign interference. It is also reducing its huge support for Mexican society and becoming more of a profit-making company eager to exploit Mexico's huge oil reserves. Pemex not only supplies such services as secondary schooling and day care, but also spends hundreds of millions of dollars on contracts to build roads, bridges, housing and oil tankers.
On Fortune magazine's list of the world's 50 largest industrial companies, Pemex had $15 billion in 1989 revenues. That represented 6 percent of Mexico's gross domestic product, and Pemex's oil sales abroad brought in 23 percent of the nation's export revenue. The taxes funneled to the Government - nearly $8 billion in 1989 - are far and away its largest single source of revenue.
The tax drain is an important reason for Pemex's cash shortage. The other major reason is the collapse in oil prices in the 1980's, which deprived Mexico of billions of dollars in annual revenue.
Recognizing Pemex's key role in the economy - and the Mexican psyche - President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has promised never to sell the company. ''This decision is irrevocable,'' Mr. Salinas said in a recent speech, although he has put many other state companies on the block to raise money for debt repayment and to finance social services.
But even without privatization, Pemex is slowly acquiring the characteristics of a private corporation.
 
Evidence of Cost-Cutting
The cost-cutting by Pemex shows up in a number of ways. The Oil Workers Union once controlled the construction contracts awarded by Pemex; now they go up for competitive bidding. The Pemex labor force has been shrunk from 213,000 in 1988 to 150,000 today. The number of children in Pemex-operated secondary schools has dropped by 5,000 since 1982, to fewer than 50,000.
On another front, Pemex is for the first time allowing foreign investors to become involved in the processing of crude oil into petrochemicals. And while Pemex is not now planning to extend foreign involvement to other areas, including a stake in the exploration and pumping of oil, the decline in oil production is increasing the possibility that foreign companies may some day be given such a stake.
Until now, exploration and production have been assigned by the Mexican Constitution only to the state. Foreign companies are hired to run rigs, but they are never given what they most want in return: the right to keep a percentage of oil discovered.
 
Petrochemical Shortage
Under the current system, Pemex has been unable to produce enough petrochemicals to supply Mexican-based manufacturers of plastics, film and other products, and it lacks the money to build plants by itself. So the company changed the rules to get around a legal prohibition on foreign investment in basic petrochemicals.
Dozens of petrochemicals were classified in 1988 and 1989 as non-basic. That has allowed Pemex to negotiate with Mitsui, Celanese and other companies abroad for financing to build petrochemical plants. If agreements are reached, Pemex would own these plants, and would repay the loans not with cash but by delivering to the investing companies petrochemicals produced at the plants. This sort of payment in kind gives foreign companies a hook into Pemex that has not existed before, business people say.
Two petrochemical plants in mid-construction were completed in this fashion earlier this year, although no deals for new plants have been signed.
 
Exploration Stake Sought
One reason is that foreign oil companies want to tie petrochemical financing to a greater stake in oil exploration, said Gabriel Szekely, associate director of the Center for United States-Mexican Studies in San Diego and a consultant to Pemex and to foreign oil companies.
''They are saying that they should therefore get into the development and pumping of crude with the right to keep some of the oil discovered,'' he said.
Mexican Government officials say that Pemex will not - legally cannot - give ground on so key a tenet of the nationalized oil industry. But the failure to invest significantly in oil exploration has reduced Pemex production from 3 million barrels a day before petroleum prices collapsed in the early 1980's to 2.7 million barrels a day now. Some 1.2 million barrels of this daily production are exported, about half of it to the United States.
With domestic oil consumption rising (Pemex keeps retail gasoline prices at less than 50 cents a gallon) and production falling, many experts say that Mexico will become an oil importer by the end of the century unless more is spent on exploration.
 
A National Irony
Importing oil would be ironic for a country whose oil reserves are roughly equal to those of the United States, according to Joseph Riva, the oil expert at the Congressional Research Office in Washington. The United States produces some 7 million barrels a day and if Mexico were to approach this level over the next decade, it might rival some Middle East countries as a source of supply for the United States.
Despite the march toward a free enterprise strategy, Pemex officials and many Mexicans resist pushing up production beyond the nation's needs and roughly the present export levels. Even the Iraq-Kuwait crisis, with its promise of higher crude oil prices for months to come, does not seem to tempt many Mexicans.
''In the short term, increasing exports of Mexican crude may be beneficial, but in the long term, such exports could eventually harm our country,'' said an editorial in the daily newspaper El Universal that reflected the opinion of some Government officials. ''It would be absurd if future generations of Mexicans had to buy oil overseas, principally from the United States, whose proven reserves will remain more or less intact due to the fact that it is cheaper to buy oil here than to extract it there.''

HEADLINE: Oil Prices Resume Rise as Tensions Grow

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Oil prices resumed their climb yesterday, as a nervous market contemplated the continuing loss of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude, the heightened tensions in the Middle East and a delay by OPEC members in increasing their oil production.
In trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, oil for September delivery closed at $27.36 a barrel yesterday, up 90 cents from Wednesday.
Traders said the market also rose on confusing news about the level of output by Saudi Arabia. The Japanese Foreign Ministry said early yesterday in Tokyo that Saudi Arabia had notified American, European and Japanese oil companies of a 15 to 20 percent planned supply cutback in September, but the Saudis later denied making such a notification. Industry experts said oil jargon might have created the confusion. 
Reassessing the tightening embargo on Iraq and Kuwait, oil company executives and other experts are also concluding that more than the loss of crude is involved; the United States Navy is now also blocking the output of three sophisticated Kuwaiti refineries, which could create further tightness in the market for refined products, especially gasoline. Gasoline may be due for further increases anyway because prices thus far do not fully reflect increased crude costs, oil company executives say.
The rise in oil prices yesterday seemed to indicate a changing mood among traders. Last week and earlier this week, analysts said the absence of major developments in the Persian Gulf contributed to price stability. But now the mood is changing about who would benefit from a status quo, especially since Saudi Arabia has called for, thus far unsuccessfully, a meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to permit higher production. Saudia Arabia can produce far more oil, and Venezuela promised to do so, but they want an OPEC agreement first.
Analysts think an OPEC meeting would be exceptionally difficult because it would produce a dispute over who would represent Kuwait, among other problems. The organization met during the eight-year war between Iran and Iraq, but was not able to accomplish much, experts say.
Iran had some extra oil in storage and has been able to move it to market, experts say, but little if any oil from increased production is reaching the market.
''Last week people thought that no news was O.K. news, because there would be good news forthcoming,'' said Cheryl J. Trench of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York. ''Now, not only have we not had good news, but we've had little negative pieces that are troubling.''
 
Saudi Request
Two such pieces of news today were a Saudi request for an emergency OPEC meeting, without a date or time being established, and the report of lower Saudi production next month.
Vahan Zanoyan of the Petroelum Finance Company, a consulting firm in Washington, said the Saudis appeared to have cut ''nominations,'' but not deliveries. Nominations are orders from oil buyers, and they may have risen sharply in recent weeks. Even if the Saudis cut the nominations, the volume of deliveries could still rise from previous levels, he said.
But ''what's dominating the market now is the probabilty of a flare-up,'' Mr. Zanoyan said.
Shahrokh Nikkhah, an oil specialist at Prudential-Bache, said: ''The market obviously believes the only way out of this is a military solution.
''The market is anticipating, if not an all-out military conflict, certainly the potential for some skirmishes, which could lead to acts of terrorism against Saudi facilities, Kuwaiti facilities or even Iraqi facilities.''
While prices may already incorporate the fear of more fighting, they do not approach the levels that would be reached if that fighting occurs, or even if no new production comes into the market, analysts say.
''We are very bullish on this market,'' Mr. Nikkhah said. ''The probability of it going to $32 to $35 a barrel is very, very good.'' With military action, he said, ''the market could spike up substantially higher than $35.''
Lacy H. Hunt, an economist who specializes in oil at Carroll McEntee & McGinley, a government securities dealer, said: ''The longer this drags on, the more it serves to constrict oil supplies. At some point in time, it will be necessary to gradually release supplies from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, in order to prevent prices from going a lot higher.''
The Bush Administration has thus far resisted that move.
 
Five Million Barrels a Day
Mr. Hunt said that with the current crisis, five million barrels of oil a day had been removed from the world market. That compares with the four million barrels at the time of the Arab oil embargo of 1973-74, and about two million barrels at the time of the Iranian revolution, in 1979.
In addition, he said, the shortfall will be felt more this time because the United States now imports half its oil, up from about 45 percent in 1979, and 35 percent during the Arab embargo.
The American Petroleum Institute, the industry's main trade association, reported yesterday that imports accounted for 51.3 percent of the oil used in this country in July.
The institute reported deliveries of imported oil had been 6.5 percent higher than in the previous year, but that consumption had probably not grown that much, indicating that users at various levels were accumulating inventory, probably because prices were rising or expected to rise further. The report covers the period before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
 
Refining at Capacity
The United States imports about 20 percent of its refined products, and domestic refineries are running at virtually full capacity. Experts say that relatively few foreign refineries can make gasoline for export to this country; only half make unleaded fuel, for example, which accounts for about 94 percent of the American market. In addition, wide areas of the United States now require the use of specially formulated fuel with low butane content, to cut air pollution.
Apart from the rise in crude prices, many analysts are predicting that the price of gasoline will rise. A top executive of a leading oil company said yesterday that while his company was selling gasoline for about 10 cents a gallon more in the last six weeks, the cost of its crude oil had gone up about 25 cents a gallon.

HEADLINE: Stocks Fall To 3-Month Low Point

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
The stock market tumbled yesterday to its lowest close in more than three months after being pummeled throughout the day by a worse-than-expected inflation report, falling bond prices, higher oil prices and unsettling news from the Middle East.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 66.83 points, or 2.43 percent, to 2,681.44 - its lowest level since May 1 when it was 2,660.92. The drop was the fourth-biggest one-day decline in points this year.
With yesterday's close, the Dow has retreated more than 10 percent from its peak of 2,999.75 on July 17. Some traders say that when the market pulls back more than 10 percent from its high, it is an indication that the decline could be more than a correction. 
Overseas markets declined as well yesterday. In Tokyo, the Nikkei stock index fell 562.68 points, or 2 percent, to 27,549.44. Japanese stocks continued their retreat today, with the Nikkei dropping 700.58 points, or 2.54 percent, to 26,848.86 by midafternoon. Pressures on Wall St. There were other pressures on Wall Street yesterday morning. The Government reported that the consumer price index had risen a sharply higher-than-expected four-tenths of 1 percent in July and that housing starts had fallen 2.6 percent last month.
These reports undermined the bond market, where the price of the benchmark 30-year bond plunged and its yield soared to 8.92 percent, from 8.75 percent on Wednesday. [Page D12.] Investors were also unnerved by higher oil prices and tough talk by President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
Volume on the Big Board remained relatively light, with 138.8 million shares traded, compared with 135.2 million on Wednesday.
In the broader market, declines outpaced advances by a ratio of about four to one, with 1,300 falling and 330 gaining. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 7.67 points, to 332.39, and the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks fell 9.18 points, to 402.27.
 
'Market Was Disappointed'
''Basically, the market was disappointed over the C.P.I. in the morning, which crept into the market all day, and that did not include data collected before the Iraqi invasion,'' said Ron Schroeder, chief investment officer at J.&W. Seligman & Company. He expects the next consumer price report to be even higher because of the jump in oil prices following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
Mr. Schroeder said the real damage to stocks might have come from the sharp rise in Treasury yields. Higher yields generally encourage investors to move their money to bonds from stocks.
He added that bond yields were likely to remain high. ''The threat of higher inflation and a softer dollar makes it hard for the Federal Reserve to ease,'' he said.
Concern that the Federal Reserve Board would neither be able to reduce interest rates to help avoid a recession or raise them to help fight inflation added more worries to an already unsteady market.
The last time the Dow dropped more than 10 percent was in late 1987, when it fell 12.9 percent from a post-crash high of 2,027.85 on Oct. 21 to a low of 1,766.74 on Dec. 4.
Yesterday, traders reported some futures-related selling after the inflation and housing-starts reports were released.
 
Hussein Depresses Stocks
After a slight recovery in the morning, the market was hit when President Hussein of Iraq indicated that he would not compromise his position in the Middle East. Traders saw this as another sign that there would not be a quick resolution of the crisis.
There was little program trading in advance of today's ''double witching hour.'' The double witching hour, as opposed to a triple witching hour, involves the simultaneous expiration of stock options, stock index options and the major-market index futures. The major-market index is made up of 20 blue-chip issues, but it is not as widely watched as the S.&P. 500. Instead, it is considered confirmation of the Dow because it has 17 of the 30 Dow stocks, including A.T.& T., I.B.M., General Motors, Coca-Cola and General Electric.
Birinyi Associates Inc., which tracks program trades made by large institutions and brokers, reported only three big sell program trades all day. The net total decline in the Dow from the program trades throughout the day was 25.51 points.
Yesterday's low volume magnified the selling pressure, some traders said.
Mr. Schroeder said there could be a bright side to yesterday's activity. ''When the market reacts in the way it did, it does so in a broad-brush way, taking down stocks across the board and creating buying opportunities in certain stocks,'' he said. Among the stocks he mentioned were Dillard Department Stores, which fell 1 3/8, to 82 5/8; Newell, off 7/8, to 26 3/8, and Tyco Laboratories, down 1 1/2, to 54 3/4.
The most-active stock on the Big Board was Ohio Edison, which fell 2 1/2, to 17 3/8, on 2.19 million shares. The utility received a disappointing rate increase from the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio.
 
Pharmaceutical Stocks Off
Some pharmaceutical stocks also dropped. Eli Lilly, was down 4 1/8, to 71 1/2, and Merck, was also down 4 1/8, to 83 3/4.
Security Pacific lost 3, to 28 3/4, after the California banking said it was increasing its provisions for loan losses in the second half of the year.
Bankers Trust New York also fell, losing 1 1/4, to 37, after it said its problem loans might continue to rise for the remainder of 1990.
Deere dropped 3 5/8, to 60 5/8, a low for the year amid signs that the farm economy will weaken and hurt the company's core farm-equipment business.
And Hewlett-Packard lost 1 7/8, to 35 7/8, after the electronics company reported worse-than-anticipated earnings.

HEADLINE: Mall Building Has Slowed

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
Reflecting a cutback in lending by commercial banks, the number of new shopping-center starts in the United States fell sharply in the first half of 1990, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers, a trade group based in New York.
The council, which conducts quarterly surveys of its developer members, said that construction of new shopping centers fell 24 percent below the level a year earlier, the worst performance in a decade.
There were 1,529 shopping-center starts in 1989; if the current decline is sustained for the rest of the year, there would be only 1,130 starts in 1990. 
The decline was widespread, with reductions in all parts of the United States. The greatest drop, 28 percent, occurred in the Northeast, which includes the Middle Atlantic States. The other declines were 19 percent in the Midwest; 26 percent in the South, and 22 percent in the West.
In the survey of 450 developers, the council found that 78 percent said the most common problem affecting bank lenders was the inability to obtain construction loans from commercial banks. About 40 percent of all recent credit applications made by the respondents were not approved, the council said.
Developers said that tougher lending agreements and practices were responsible for the financing lag, including demands for excessive documentation, more borrower equity, additional collateral on existing loans, reduced loan amounts and higher fees and interest rates. Banks are refusing to finance joint equity ventures, the council said, renewing or extending existing loans and foreclosing in some cases.
Developers said the banks told them that stricter lending policies were the result of having tougher bank regulators and examiners, new limits on commercial and real estate loans, new capital requirements and bank directors' concerns about personal liability.
Developers said that if these conditions persisted into 1991, they were concerned there would be layoffs, corporate restructurings, discontinued operations and abandoned projects.

Ames Will Close Office in Syracuse

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SYRACUSE, Aug. 16

 BODY:
Ames Department Stores Inc. said it would close its regional accounting office here in a companywide plan to consolidate jobs and cut costs. The closing of the Ames downtown Syracuse office will put nearly 160 people out of work, a company spokesman, Bill Roberts, said. 
Ames filed for Chapter 11 protection under the Federal Bankruptcy Code in April, just two years after acquiring the Zayre discount store chain. Zayre had an accounting operation in Syracuse. Ames decided to move some of its operations from its headquarters in Rocky Hill, Conn., to Syracuse. Those responsibilities will now be shifted back to Rocky Hill. Mr. Roberts said probably fewer than 10 jobs would be transferred to Rocky Hill. Most of the jobs in the accounting office are clerical. Ames plans to close 221 stores nationwide in the consolidation.

HEADLINE: Hewlett In Move To France

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 16

 BODY:
In a move reflecting the growing importance of the European market, the Hewlett-Packard Company said today that it was moving the headquarters of its personal computer group from Sunnyvale, Calif., to Grenoble, France.
Hewlett-Packard also reported declining earnings today for its third quarter. Shares in the company, which were already depressed in anticipation of a disappointing quarter, dropped $1.875, closing at $35.875 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 
Official Appointed
Along with the move to France, Hewlett-Packard announced that Jacques A. Clay, who is currently general manager of the Grenoble personal computer division, has been appointed general manager of the personal computer group. Mr. Clay, who is 47 years old, succeeds Robert L. Puette, who left Hewlett-Packard in late June to become president of Apple Computer Inc.'s U.S.A. division.
Mr. Clay joined the company in 1973. A native of France, he has a marketing degree from Ecole Superieur Commerce in Lyons, France, and a bachelor's degree in law from Grenoble University. He has held various management positions in Grenoble and Sunnyvale.
''Currently, international markets represent more than half of Hewlett-Packard's sales of PC's and terminals and have great potential for expansion,'' Lewis E. Platt, Hewlett-Packard's executive vice president and head of the company's computer products sector, said in a statement. ''As such, it is quite opportune to have an international PC group headquarters.''
Hewlett-Packard has a more dominant position in the European PC market than in the United States, Mr. Clay said in a telephone interview. ''HP has been in Europe 30 years and we have been very active in the PC business since the early 80's, so we were one of the first entrants there,'' he said. Because of this lead, ''we were able to get substantial market share.''
Europe has always played a countercyclical role to the United States computer market, because it typically trails both the up and down swings in the United States economy. In addition, ''Europe right now is a little more attractive because of the investments pouring in,'' in anticipation of the removal of trade barriers in 1992 and opportunities stemming from the opening of Eastern Europe, Mr. Clay said.
 
Regional Headquarters
The personal computer group will keep its four regional headquarters in Grenoble, Sunnyvale, Singapore and Guadalajara, Mexico. The regional headquarters will all retain their present management, the company said. Mr. Clay will head both the worldwide and European PC operations.
The naming of Grenoble as group headquarters will not involve increasing the company's work force in Europe. The company has 4,000 workers in France.
Hewlett-Packard has two industrial sites in the Grenoble region that produce personal computers, terminals and cardiology equipment. Grenoble also distributes all Hewlett-Packard PC's sold in Europe and conducts research and development on PC's.
''International growth will be the geographic area where all domestic, European and Asian PC companies get the most bang for their buck in terms of ability to sell volume,'' said David Korus, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody. ''Hewlett, with a less intensive retail scheme in the United States than some of the others, would like to maximize their presence in Europe, where they can get the most return,'' he said.
Although most analysts anticipated a disappointing quarter for Hewlett-Packard, the company's revenues and earnings still fell below estimates. In addition, the company expressed caution about the prospects for growth in coming quarters.
For the quarter ended July 31, Hewlett-Packard had earnings of $178 million, or 73 cents a share, down 4.8 percent from $187 million, or 79 cents a share, in the comparable period a year ago.

HEADLINE: Housing Starts Fell 2.6% in July

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 16

 BODY:
Construction of new homes fell for the sixth straight month in July, cutting building activity to its weakest pace in nearly eight years, the Government said today.
Housing starts fell 2.6 percent last month from June and were 19.4 percent lower than in July 1989, the Commerce Department said.
Building of single-family homes fell 1.4 percent last month, while apartment building was down 6.5 percent, the department said. 
 
Below Expectations
Total housing starts dropped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.15 million units in July, from 1.18 million in June. Economists had expected a rise to a rate of 1.19 million units.
The last time housing starts were lower was nearly eight years ago, in September 1982, when starts were at a rate of 1.14 million a year.
Industry analysts, who had predicted a slight rise in building activity last month, said it appeared the industry's hopes were falling victim to a gradually deteriorating economy.
''It looks like housing is performing a fairly classic role of leading us into a recession,'' said David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders.
''There's not even a potential bright development,'' Mr. Seiders said, citing rising unemployment and an expected rise in inflation that will further shrink the buying power of potential home buyers. ''We're sort of surrounded,'' he said.
Analysts said the decline was a result of tight credit for builders, mortgage rates above 10 percent and the economic uncertainty that is making consumers wary of big new financial responsibilities.
Not since the June-to-November period of 1981 has home construction fallen for six consecutive months, department officials said.
 
Downturn Is Widespread
The weakness was widespread geographically. Housing starts were lower everywhere except in the West, where they rose 8.2 percent. They fell 5.3 percent in the Northeast, 5.5 percent in the Midwest and 6.7 percent in the South.
Even the normally optimistic National Association of Realtors sounded gloomy today.
John Tuccillo, the group's chief economist, said building was being choked off by tighter lending. He also said demand from buyers was fading. ''People simply are uncertain about what lies ahead, and they are pulling out of the market,'' he said.
 
No Sign of Upturn
Building permits, an indicator of future activity, fell 2.6 percent in July, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.08 million, after rising 4 percent in June.
Construction of single-family homes fell in July by 1.4 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 873,000 units, after falling by 1.3 percent in June.
Construction of apartment buildings fell by 6.5 percent, to a rate of 275,000 units, after a 4.9 percent drop in June.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Rates Surge to Three-Month High

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices plummeted yesterday and long-term interest rates rose to their highest levels since early May, as traders reacted with alarm to a disappointing report on inflation and heightened tensions in the Middle East.
The inflation report showed that the Consumer Price Index had risen four-tenths of 1 percent in July. Even though the figure was only slightly higher than expected, market participants were disturbed by it because, excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, the core inflation rate had risen six-tenths of 1 percent in July.
Worse, the recent sharp rise in oil prices since the beginning of August is almost certain to push the overall inflation rate higher in coming months. 
 
'Some Bad News Ahead'
''Over time, I think the oil price shock will be deflationary, because it is having an adverse effect on purchasing power,'' said Joseph Carson, a senior economist at the Chemical Bank. ''But in the next few months there is some bad news ahead for consumer prices. An increase of seven-tenths of a percentage point in the index for August is something that could be easily attained.''
Yesterday's inflation report appears to reduce the likelihood that the Federal Reserve Board will move soon to lower short-term interest rates, traders and analysts said.
Bond prices softened considerably after the consumer price numbers were released in the morning. And they plummeted later in the day after highly bellicose statements from President Saddam Hussein of Iraq flashed across trading screens. The situation was made even gloomier by reports that 2,500 Americans in Kuwait had been ordered to by Iraqi authorities to gather in the Kuwait Hotel to protect them against ''unspecified threats.''
''The market was on the defensive to begin with,'' after the inflation statistics were released, said James R. Capra, senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities. ''The Iraqi developments only made matters worse.''
 
Bonds Fall More Than 1 1/2 Points
The gloom and confusion was most readily reflected in the price of long-term Treasury bonds. But short-term interest rates also surged.
By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 98 1/4, down more than 1 1/2 points, or more than $15 for each $1,000 face amount of securities, to yield 8.92 percent, up sharply from 8.75 percent late Wednesday. It is the highest yield on the benchmark bond in more than three months.
Among note issues, the 8 3/4 percent 10-year Treasury notes were offered at 99 27/32, down 30/32, to yield 8.77 percent. The 8 1/2 percent five-year notes were offered at 100 1/8, down 5/8, to yield 8.45 percent. And the 8 percent two-year notes fell 9/32, to a late offered price of 99 27/32, to yield 8.08 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates also moved up. Three-month bills were offered in late trading at a discount rate of 7.48 percent, up 4 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates, meanwhile, rose by 12 basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.45 percent. One-year bills rose by a similar amount, to a late offered rate of 7.30 percent.
 
Federal Funds Rate Rises
The session was also marked by a rise in the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market, but analysts said the increase was largely a result of technical difficulties associated with the fire in downtown Manhattan on Monday rather than any change in Fed policy.
''I think the Fed's operations each day this week have made it clear that this has nothing to do with a policy change,'' said Neil M. Soss, chief economist at the First Boston Corporation.
During the day, the Federal funds rate moved in an unusually wide range of 8 5/8 percent to 8 1/8 percent, well above the 8 percent rate that is considered to be the Fed's target.
In the secondary markets for investment-grade corporate bonds and tax-exempt municipal bonds, prices also took a beating. Corporate bond traders said prices of most actively quoted issues fell by as much as 1 1/4 points, but added that trading was light. And prices of most municipal bonds fell by 3/4 point to a full point, traders said.
 
Security Pacific's Offering
Among new issues, the Security Pacific Corporation offered $100 million in three-year senior notes through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. The 8.85 percent notes, which mature Aug. 15, 1993, were priced at $99.955 to yield 8.867 percent, 67 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 percent three-year notes at the time of pricing. The securities, which are noncallable for life, are rated A-1 by Moody's Investors Service and AA-minus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday that all three measures of the nation's money supply rose during the week ended Aug. 6. The report had no noticeable effect on prices in the credit markets.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar at an All-Time Low Against Mark in New York

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar tumbled to an all-time low against the German mark during domestic trading as heightened tensions in the Middle East and signs of United States economic weakness spurred a wave of selling.
The dollar was quoted at 1.5525 marks in late New York trading, down from 1.566 marks late Wednesday and from 1.5645 marks Tuesday, the previous low in the modern mark's 42-year history.
The dollar was also sharply lower against the Swiss franc and British pound. The pound rose to $1.9095 in New York, from $1.9090 late Wednesday. In London, sterling fell to $1.8985, from $1.9045 late Wednesday. 
''As long as the U.S. is involved in this crisis I think we're going to find that the dollar is not the safe haven it once was during international crises,'' said Scott Horwitz, a vice president for foreign exchange trading with Bank of Boston.
After rising in overseas trading, traders sold heavily in New York after a fiery speech by Iraq's President, Saddam Hussein, that offered little hope of a quick end to the standoff over the invasion of Kuwait.
That normally would support the dollar, but the weak state of the U.S. economy has overwhelmed the currency's traditional attractiveness as a haven during times of international turmoil.
A Government report that consumer prices rose four-tenths of 1 percent in July added to pessimism about the economy's course and contributed to the selloff.
''Even though the tension may have escalated in the gulf, the market is focusing on two trajectories in the U.S. economy - weaker growth and higher inflation,'' said Marc Chandler, a currency analyst with MMS International in Chicago.
In New York, the dollar fell to 147.25 Japanese yen, from 147.65 yen late Wednesday. Earlier in Tokyo, it rose to 147.90 Japanese yen from 147.15 yen at Wednesday's close. In London, the dollar was quoted at 147.62 yen.
Other dollar rates as of 4 P.M. in New York, compared with late rates Wednesday, included: 1.2915 Swiss francs, down from 1.30735; 5.2220 French francs, down from 5.2570; 1,143.25 Italian lire, down from 1,149.75, and 1.14815 Canadian dollars, up from 1.14345.
Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday, included: 1.5630 German marks, up from 1.5605; 1.3025 Swiss francs, up from 1.3005; 5.2495 French francs, up from 5.2365; 1.7610 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7579; 1,149.75 Italian lire, up from 1,145.75, and 1.1477 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1435.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Gold Prices Are Up Sharply As Investors Seek Security

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The prices of gold futures surged yesterday on the Commodity Exchange in New York as developments in the Persian Gulf initiated a rally in oil prices, a dive in the stock market and a renewal of inflation fears.
On other commodity markets, livestock and meat futures were mixed, while grains and soybeans also finished mixed.
Gold futures settled $6.20 to $6.90 higher, with the contract for spot August delivery up $6.60 at $409.20 an ounce. Silver was 9.9 cents to 10 cents higher, with the spot August contract at $5.168 an ounce. 
The perceived safety of precious metals lured investors from the stock market as President Saddam Hussein of Iraq unleased new demands.
The crisis in the Middle East has given gold a shot in the arm, but Fred Demler, an analyst at Paine Webber Inc. in New York, said he was optimistic on gold, based on the market's factors of supply and demand, even before Iraq invaded Kuwait slightly more than two weeks ago.
''Once the Mideast situation blows over, we think there will be a setback in gold prices, but then we think they'll strengthen again based on other fundamentals,'' he said.
On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, livestock and meat futures were mixed, as cattle traders evened up their positions before today's monthly cattle-on-feed report is released by the Agriculture Department.
The report is expected to show active placements of cattle onto feedlots and active marketings off feedlots last month.
Live cattle settled 0.10 cent lower to 0.12 cent higher, with the August contract at 78.47 cents a pound; feeder cattle were 0.05 cent lower to 0.20 cent higher, with August at 89.97 cents a pound; live hogs were 0.10 cent lower to 0.70 cent higher, with August at 57.57 cents a pound, and frozen pork bellies were 2 cents lower to 0.05 cent higher, with August at 48.95 cents a pound.
On the Chicago Board of Trade, grain and soybean contracts ended narrowly mixed in lackluster trading as buying prompted by Middle East tensions offset selling pressure stemming in part from forecasts for good growing weather in the Midwest during the latter half of next week.

HEADLINE: Study Finds the U.S. Lags In Communications Goods

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
A study of the nation's telecommunications equipment industry, released yesterday by the Commerce Department, has found that the United States is no longer competitive in markets for consumer products like telephones and facsimile machines and is losing ground in markets for business and telephone company equipment.
For the last five years, the United States has run an annual trade deficit in telecommunications equipment of about $2 billion. The study cited data that blamed an inadequate American educational system, a failure of American companies to incorporate technical breakthroughs into products quickly and the relatively high cost of raising money in the United States. 
Foreign market barriers to imports and foreign governments' subsidies to domestic producers have also hurt American equipment producers, the study said.
 
Antitrust Review Urged
The study called for a review of the application of antitrust laws to American telecommunications companies and recommended that the research and development tax credit be made permanent.
But the most serious problem appears to be a growing shortage of qualified workers, said Janice Obuchowski, the Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information. ''It's not clear that we're going to be able to sustain our strength unless we turn around our educational system,'' she said.
For example, the New York Telephone Company said it tested 57,000 job applicants in 1987 and found that 54,900, or 96.3 percent, lacked basic skills in math, reading and reasoning.
Congress ordered the Commerce Department to perform the study when it passed the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. James W. McConnaughey, a senior economist from the department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration, managed the project.
 
No Innovative Conclusions
The study did not reach any innovative conclusions, but did provide large quantities of data to document the conventional wisdom about declining American competitiveness, Mr. McConnaughey said. ''Instead of talking in glittering generalities, I think we've got some specifics,'' he said.
From 1984 to 1987, the American share of the world market for voice-grade corporate switchboards fell from 29 percent to 26 percent, the study said, while the share of data-grade switchboards plummeted to 36 percent from 100 percent, as European and Japanese companies entered the market.
The American share of the fiber-optic equipment market dropped to 50 percent from 75 percent in the period while the share of modems for sending information between computers fell to 37 percent from 49 percent.
American companies performed best in sales of central office switching equipment, which was a $6 billion market in the United States last year.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
BUSH SAID TO APPROVE PLAN TO ACTIVATE SOME RESERVES; U.S. TAKING OVER 38 AIRLINERS

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 17

 BODY:
President Bush has decided to call up a limited number of military reservists because of the Middle East crisis, Administration officials said today, and the Pentagon commandeered 38 wide-body jets from 16 airlines to carry troops and cargo to the region.
As the emergency entered its third week, the United Nations Security Council expressed ''concern and anxiety'' about hundreds of thousands of foreigners, including 3,000 Americans, who are trapped in Iraq and Kuwait, with evidence mounting that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq may plan to intern them.
The Speaker of the Iraqi Parliament, Sadi Mahdi, said today that Baghdad would not permit foreigners from ''aggressive nations'' to leave Iraq as long as it was threatened with war, the official Iraqi press agency reported. Mr. Mahdi said that Westerners would be moved to vital oil and military installations in Iraq and in occupied Kuwait.
As the American military deployment continued, allies like Japan, West Germany and France debated how far they should go in their involvement in the gulf conflict. [Page 6.] 
 
2 Iraqi Vessels Detained Two United States Navy ships, the guided missile cruiser England and the frigate Bradley, detained a pair of Iraqi coastal vessels in the gulf, but they were found to be empty and were permitted to proceed toward Iraq, the Pentagon said.
The two vessels were the first intercepted by American sailors during the first 24 hours of the official naval blockade, but they were not boarded.
Mr. Bush, who is back at his vacation home at Kennebunkport, Me., is expected to sign orders soon calling military reservists to active duty for service in the Persian Gulf or at home.
One official said that the number would probably not exceed 2,500 or 3,000, at least at first, and would be composed mainly of cargo handlers, medical teams and other specialists, but he cautioned that details were still under study.
Other Pentagon aides have said the total might reach 80,000, including members of the Army, Navy and Air Force reserves. Up to 200,000 of the nation's 1.6 million reservists are legally subject to immediate Presidential activation.
 
Cheney Sees 'Long' Stay
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney suggested today while en route to Saudi Arabia that the American troop commitment there would be ''long,'' perhaps lasting years.
The decision to take over the airliners, under a program known as the Civil Reserve Air Fleet, which had never been used before in its 30 or so years of existence, suggested that the Pentagon intended to speed up the already fast-paced deployment.
Pentagon officials who disclosed the decision said the airlines involved have only 24 hours to deliver the planes to staging points.
For the second time in less than a week, Saudi Arabia turned away an Iraqi tanker trying to reach the Red Sea oil terminal at Yanbu to break the international trade embargo, and American warships were tracking another Iraqi merchant ship, apparently laden with food, in the Red Sea not far from Jordan's port of Aqaba.
The American ships are enforcing an embargo on all shipments to or from Iraq, including food. Under the United Nations sanctions, there is an exemption on ''supplies intended strictly for medical purposes and, in humanitarian circumstances, foodstuffs.''
 
In a Famine, Policy Changes
White House officials have conceded that changes in American policy would be needed if widespread famine developed in Iraq, but they argue that this would be well into the future.
Jordan, through which large amounts of grain and other foods have been passing to Iraq during the last two weeks, has asked for a clarification on food, which a special United Nations committee is to provide on a case-by-case basis.
Jordan is also seeking relief under a provision in the United Nations Charter that gives countries the right to seek aid if they are ''confronted with special economic problems'' arising from their application of sanctions.
After an informal meeting convened at Britain's request, the Security Council voted to ask Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar to take whatever steps he considers appropriate to free the foreigners in Iraq and Kuwait.
 
U.N. Chief Urged to Act
Thomas R. Pickering, the United States representative, said that Mr. Perez de Cuellar ''should become immediately engaged in this humanitarian crisis.''
American policy-makers said any attempt to rescue the ''restrictees,'' as Iraq calls them, would be tactically all but impossible, given the large number of people involved and the strength of Iraqi defenses. But they expressed bitter frustration over inability to visit or even find 35 Americans who were moved from the Rashid Hotel in Baghdad during the night.
Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary, said the 35 were probably taken to another hotel. But the Administration was unable to discover exactly which one, although the State Department said it might be the Melia-Mansour Hotel. Mr. Fitzwater said there were some indications that the Iraqis wanted to keep the Americans away from correspondents.
Douglas Hurd, the British Foreign Secretary, bluntly described the 3,000 Americans and 3,400 Britons who have been detained as ''hostages'' whom the Iraqis intended to use ''as pawns in their game.'' For the time being, at least, ''we're going to have to live with that,'' he said.
Iraq's public comments on the foreigners have been inconsistent. Earlier this week, the Foreign Ministry said the foreigners would not be free to leave until the crisis ended, but Iraq's Ambassador in Washington, Mohammed al-Mashat said: ''They are not restricted at all, and will be allowed to leave in good time.''
 
Foreigners Cross Desert
Three Americans and six other foreigners, who feared being forcibly rounded up in Kuwait after Baghdad issued an order for them to gather at a seafront hotel, disguised themselves as Arabs, climbed into a pair of Land-Rovers and drove in a 13-vehicle caravan through the desert into Saudi Arabia today.
Mary Rindzius, who is from California, dyed her blond hair black to help avoid arousing suspicion.
''As soon as we left the paved road, we ran into Iraqis and they said we had to go back,'' said Stephanie McGehee, an Arabic-speaking photographer for The Associated Press. ''We moved away, then took another turn through the desert and made a dash for it. It was very, very terrifying.''
President Bush reacted in measured tones, telling reporters as he began a round of golf at Kennebunkport: ''I don't think that anybody ought to be moved against their will in contravention of international law.''
 
New Yorkers Talk Tough
Two New York Democrats used much tougher talk.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan said that if Mr. Hussein chose ''to show his contempt for the the laws protecting civilians, he will surely reap the whirlwind to follow.'' Representative Stephen J. Solarz of Brooklyn, speaking in Israel, said that if any American was ''brutalized or tortured or killed'' the United States would retaliate ''in a way that will result in the destruction of the military and economic infrastructure of Iraq'' - presumably meaning that the United States would bomb Baghdad and other targets.
Mr. Cheney set out for Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to visit American troops amid signs that the United States was building considerable offensive capacity into its huge military deployment to the Middle East, which President Bush has described as ''entirely defensive'' in character.
 
Stealth Aircraft and B-52's
The deployment of F-117 Stealth aircraft, as well as B-52's, the assignment of highly mobile marine forces and the presence of landing craft all suggested that Mr. Bush wanted to keep open the option of moving into Kuwait with force if economic sanctions failed to dislodge the Iraqis.
Baghdad taunted American troops in Saudi Arabia today, telling them in English-language broadcasts that they would be swallowed up the shifting desert sands.
Japan was reported to be pondering the dispatch of minesweepers to join the international armada in the Gulf.
The Soviet Union said it would send troops if the United Nations called for military action, and in New York, a special committee met to discuss compliance with trade sanctions.
Ultimately, the committee could move toward imposing a United Nations blockade to enforce them and could even send troops. For the moment, only the United States and Britain, citing a self-defense request from the exiled Government of Kuwait, have ships on blockade duty.
The Pentagon's decision to use commercial aircraft means that 38 planes, divided between passenger and cargo jets, will be pulled out of regular commercial service. Because vacation travel is at a peak, most of the long-range jumbo jets pulled from passenger service were fully booked, and airline officials said some flights would be canceled. But they said that passengers would be transferred to other aircraft or to other airlines.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
For Iranians, a Windfall

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 17

 BODY:
As a result of Iraq's surprise offer this week to meet Iran's terms for a peace treaty, Teheran faces one of the most fundamental questions of its 1979 Islamic revolution - whether to use its new position of strength to weaken Iraq or to join with it to push the United States, their common enemy, out of the region?
The answer is: Iran doesn't have to do anything. It gains the most by simply letting the crisis in the gulf run its course.
''Iran's best policy is to sit on the sidelines, get its peace treaty, wait for the Arabs to fight it out and hope in the end that Saddam will be humiliated and the foreign forces will leave,'' said Shaul Bakhash, a historian who has written extensively about Iran. 
Since the invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, President Saddam Hussein of Iraq seems to be gambling that peace with his onetime archenemy will remove a possibility that Iran will mass troops on his border. He would then be free to transfer military units to the Saudi front to face forces deployed by foreign nations, including the United States. A Way to Evade Sanctions? President Hussein may even have hoped that Iran, in return for regaining its territory, its prisoners and an accord on the vital Shatt al Arab waterway, would help Iraq evade the world trade embargo.
Today, as a first gesture, Iraq sent 1,000 Iranian prisoners of war home and began pulling back some troops from Iran territory along the border.
In the aftermath of the devastating earthquake this summer near the Caspian Sea, Iran is not in a military mood. Its five-year economic plan includes little spending to rebuild the armed forces.
Even a limited buildup of Iranian troops along the border would not have constituted a serious threat to Iraq.
As for a trade embargo, the issue is not whether there will be trade between the two countries but rather how much.
 
Trade Even During War
Trade is controlled not by the politicians in Teheran but by merchants along the border. Even at the height of hostilities in the eight-year war, carpets, livestock and food flowed freely into Iraq and consumer goods moved into Iran, mostly at night through the mountains of Kurdistan.
Other goods were transshipped through Dubai and other ports. Even Turkey, with its superior border controls, finds it difficult to block traditional smuggling routes along the long border with Iraq.
Iran has little to gain and much to lose by forging an alliance with Iraq and violating the embargo. Massive amounts of food and other consumer goods on cross-border highways might bring Iran hundreds of millions of dollars, but that is a tiny amount compared to what it could get out by selling its cooperation to the rest of the world.
Iran has already indicated that it would welcome the kind of help the Arab nations provided to Iraq during its war with Iran.
Just days after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the Iranian Foreign Minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, traveled to Oman and other small gulf states with an offer of cooperation in exchange for financial assistance.
Iran could also use the crisis to repair its severely damaged ties with Saudi Arabia.
 
Inducements for Embargo
''Iran might find itself in a position to bargain with countries that will say, 'Maybe Iran will break the embargo so let's ask Iran what it will need to keep the embargo on,' '' said Gary Sick, a former official at the National Security Council, who is writing a book on U.S.-Iranian relations.
At home, the burning issue for Iranian leaders is the importance of economic reconstruction and the establishment of better economic ties with the industrialized world.
Iranian leaders, particularly President Hashemi Rafsanjani, would oppose any attempt to sabotage Iran's five-year plan, which depends on $28 billion in foreign borrowing.
Since the plan was approved in January, Iran has assiduously courted possible lenders. Early this year, for example, it held preliminary talks with the International Monetary Fund, for the first time since the 1979 Islamic revolution, and received a World Bank mission to discuss borrowing for construction and social projects.
 
Japan's Aid Sought for Dam
Just last month, Iran requested Japanese participation in financing a $3.5-billion dam on the Karun River.
Certainly, Iran and Iraq share interests that could be exploited to the advantage of each. Both countries are eager to see the withdrawal of American forces from the region.
Iran wants to conclude a peace treaty with Iraq and will readily embrace President Hussein's proposal if it does not come with strings attached. The last few months have witnessed open cooperation between the two countries on higher oil prices.
But the goals of Baghdad and Teheran are linked only up to a point. Animosity between the two countries runs deep, largely a result of the eight years of fighting that killed more than a million people. The Teheran leadership would find it difficult to explain a policy of accommodation to its people.
Over the long run, it is not in Iran's strategic interest to strengthen Iraq or its control over occupied Kuwait.
Despite a promise by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who died in 1989, to throw the ruling families of the gulf states into ''the dustbin of history,'' Iran is more interested in the territorial integrity of the region, and Mr. Rafsanjani has called on Iraq to ''evacuate Kuwaiti territory.''
 
'Struggle for Dominance'
''Iran is engaged in a permanent geopolitical struggle for dominance in the gulf and anything that threatens it is unacceptable,'' said Graham Fuller, former vice chairman of the National Intelligence Council at the Central Intelligence Agency. ''It doesn't want to see Iraq permanently strenghtened by the acquisition of Kuwait's oil wealth.''
Part of that struggle is Iran's desire to end intervention in the gulf, and leaders in Teheran have already called for a withdrawal of all foreign forces.
But Iranian leaders must know that an alliance of convenience with Iraq to push American and other forces out of the gulf could backfire.
Iraq's determination to hold on to annexed Kuwait will prolong the presence of foreign forces in the region rather than send them away.
Besides, it would be difficult for Iran to calibrate such an alliance so that it would be just strong enough to maintain the crisis at its present level but weak enough to keep President Hussein under control.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF: Energy Policy Trade-Off;
Dependency Is Price Of Years of Cheap Oil

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 17

 BODY:
In the spring of 1986, George Bush traveled to Saudi Arabia to plead with the world's biggest oil exporter to stop flooding the market. Mr. Bush told the Saudis that their overproduction, by driving down the price, was jeopardizing the American oil industry, in turn undermining the nation's economic strength and security.
Now, President Bush finds himself imploring the Saudis to raise production by about 35 percent, or two million barrels a day.
Both pleas were probably well advised in the circumstances, many energy specialists believe. What the about-face in the United States' position underscores is the extent to which American policy sought to take advantage of an oversupply of oil to keep prices down - at the cost of a higher level of dependence on imported oil.
 
Relying on Foreign Oil
Before the latest round of increases that followed Iraq's seizure of Kuwait, a gallon of gasoline cost less, adjusted for inflation, than at any time in the last 30 years. At the same time, the United States' dependence on imported oil has grown to slightly more than 50 percent of consumption. 
In deciding to pursue a laissez-faire policy that had the benefit of stimulating economic growth, the United States relied heavily on an economic analysis that ignores the political instability of the Middle East, where world reserves are concentrated. But Adam Smith's economics breaks down when confronted by the barrel of a gun.
While the Reagan Administration did build a stratetgic stockpile of oil, many critics contend that its overall policy allowed the country to forget various hard-won lessons from the 1970's.
''We fell into a dangerous complacency as oil moved into ample supply and prices tumbled,'' said Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs International and a high-ranking State Department economic official during the Reagan Administration. ''We assumed the problems of the 1970's were permanently behind us.''
Heavy-handed Government intervention has been largely discredited, with widespread agreement that the Government's price and allocation controls were responsible for gasoline lines in the 1970's. The Reagan Administration veered to the other pole. Eight days after his inauguration, Mr. Reagan lifted all remaining price controls on oil and began a policy under which the United States, the world's biggest oil consumer, relied almost exclusively on unfettered market forces to direct supply and demand.
Subsidies for synthetic fuels disappeared; consumption taxes were shunned; conservation was played down; ration coupons were destroyed.
Critics predicted that decontrol would unleash huge price increases -and the Government enacted what became known as a windfall profits tax to capture the anticipated revenue. But instead, prices promptly sank, a sustained 65 percent decline that brought oil briefly below $10 a barrel in 1986 before prices rebounded to the teens.
Consumers and politicians found it appealing for the world to be awash in inexpensive oil, and they also enjoyed the lingering benefits of the era of expensive oil. These included new oil from producers outside OPEC and various increases in oil-use efficiency. Indeed, the low-priced oil helped propel an expansion of the American economy that is now in its eighth year, a peacetime record.
 
Cannot Compete Successfully
But an almost exclusive reliance on the free market came up against a major obstacle, one quite apart from guns. It is the geologically grounded fact that the United States, even with sophisticated technology, cannot compete successfully in the oil business with countries whose fields are vastly bigger and whose production costs are only a few dollars a barrel.
''For the last decade we have allowed market forces to determine energy outcomes,'' said James R. Schlesinger, a former Energy Secretary. ''But since the U.S. is the highest- cost producer in the world - the comparative advantage lying elsewhere -this has caused a steady decline in U.S. production.''
The drop in domestic production has been 19 percent in the last five years and 24 percent from the record 9.6 million barrels a day in 1970. The United States, with Alaska's North Slope now past its peak, produced at a daily rate of 7.3 million barrels in the first half of this year, only half its consumption.
With foreign oil cheap and plentiful, there was progressively little incentive for Americans to produce more - or consume less. While some measures raising energy efficiency, like higher standards for home insulation, remain in place, relatively little attention is paid to curbing oil demand. Big cars, in fact, have made a comeback.
Reflecting a 75 percent drop in exploration since the early 1980's, as measured by the number of rigs in operation, much of the domestic oil industry's equipment is stacked up and much of its expertise scattered.
Synthetic fuels programs withered because falling prices required ever- higher subsidies. And when marine oil spills resulted in stepped-up demands by environmentalists for moratoriums on drilling or production in certain areas, there was little political counterweight.
At the moment, for example, the 90,000-barrel-a-day Point Arguello field off the California coast cannot be tapped because state and local permits have not been issued. Charles J. DiBona, president of the American Petroleum Institute, calls the situation ''a little awkward'' at a time when the United States is pressing other countries to increase their production.
The main visible oil initiative of the Reagan Administration was to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which now holds 590 million barrels of oil and which could within a month pump out some 3.5 million barrels a day.
 
Policy Called Ineffective
''The Administration's oil policy has been to enhance energy security while maintaining economic competitiveness and environmental quality,'' the Energy Department declared in a 1988 review. But critics contend the policy amounts to little more than an ineffective blend of ideology and expediency within a political system in which there are 43 states that consume more oil than they produce.
''There is no policy, of course,'' declared James E. Akins, a political and economic consultant and former Ambassador to Saudi Arabia. For all its failings, the Carter Administration's energy program, he said, at least had the right goal - ''to decrease our dependence on imported oil.''
The Bush Administration, which in July 1989 began a study of the nation's energy situation that is due on the President's desk in December, has found no need to draw on the strategic reserve in response to the Iraqi invasion. No shortages have yet emerged, the price of oil is still moderate by the standards of the last 15 years and the Administration, in any event, is disinclined to tamper with the market.
Yet Deputy Energy Secretary W. Henson Moore acknowledged in an interview this week, ''It's been rather easy for the country to sit back and let our growing energy problem continue to get worse.'' He said Mr. Bush's energy agenda would not be the same as Ronald Reagan's.
While what Mr. Moore described as the Reagan policy of ''let the market do it'' was not being repudiated, there have been renewed Government efforts to supplement market forces, he said.
''Already you've seen an activism,'' Mr. Moore said, ''to use the Department of Energy as a bully pulpit'' to explain the energy facts of life and to build support for the inevitably hard decisions that will flow from the emerging study of national energy strategy.
The department, in offering some preliminary ideas this week, mentioned such demand-side palliatives as pumping up underinflated tires, strictly observing speed limits, car pooling, driving the more fuel-efficient car when there is a choice and making it easier for industry to switch fuels, such as from oil to natural gas.
Some analysts insist on stronger measures. Peter G. Peterson, a private banker and former Commerce Secretary, characterized the 1980's as a ''period of lethargy'' and ''costless choices'' and said one answer was taxes.
''I don't think there's any doubt that we should have had a substantial energy-consumption tax,'' Mr. Peterson said. Not only would it have cut imports and aided the environment, such a tax would also have substantially reduced the budget deficit, he said.
Others favor an import fee, which would also have the effect of raising the world price of oil, aiding domestic producers. There is also growing talk of a ''carbon tax'' on all forms of polluting fuels.
But whatever the remedy, declared Charles Ebinger, a consultant with the International Resources Group here, ''We've got to get some kind of consensus that energy is indeed a strategic issue.'' He said consumers must also be weaned from a misplaced sense of entitlement that fostered a belief that energy should be abundant and cheap.

HEADLINE: U.S. TRADE DEFICIT LOWEST IN 7 YEARS

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The nation's trade deficit narrowed a surprising 35 percent in June, to $5.07 billion, its lowest level in seven years. Exports surged to a record and a slowing economy at home cut imports sharply. But economists expect rising oil prices and other factors to push the deficit back up again.
The shrinking of the trade gap was a generally positive report at a time the Bush Administration and analysts are worried about the economy. The nation is near or in a recession, economists say, and the surge in oil prices after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait is expected to push inflation, already near 6 percent, even higher.
The rise in exports, some economists said yesterday, helped to keep the economy above water. But the sharp decline in spending for imports was seen by some as a sign that the already weak economy could succumb when the oil price shock begins to filter through. 
 
No Help for Stocks
The news did not help the financial markets because the crisis in the Persian Gulf, rising oil prices and the fear of a recession are the driving forces these days. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 36.64 points, to 2,644.80. The dollar also fell, although a smaller trade deficit is usually positive news for the currency. And the bond market was stable, torn between worries about inflation and the prospect of lower interest rates if there is a recession.
Roger E. Brinner, chief economist at Data Resources Inc. in Massachusetts, said the overall report from the Commerce Department was positive: ''These figures say that if we hadn't had the Iraqi invasion and the threat to consumer confidence, this economy could have escaped a recession.'' But, he added, he now thought that economic growth would begin to decline, starting the first recession in nine years.
''I take it negatively,'' Michael J. Drury, senior economist at the Boston Company Economic Advisers in Boston. ''The numbers suggest that the economy is in trouble,'' he said, referring to the import decline.
But Ara Jelalian, the international economist at the First Boston Corporation in Chicago, said the rise in exports gave him more data for his forecast that the economy will avoid a recession. ''We can still count on foreign growth even if the consumer pulls back,'' he said.
 
A More Difficult Task
While the concern about a recession is growing, the combination of a rise in exports and a decline in domestic demand produces the slower overall economic growth that the Federal Reserve has sought in its effort to bring down inflation. The sudden rise in oil prices, because it both adds to inflation and cuts growth, has made the central bank's job much more difficult and the formula less palatable.
For the first half of the year, the American trade deficit is now $45.8 billion, or about $91 billion at an annual rate. If the deficit comes in at that level for the year, it would be about $18 billion lower than in 1989 and represent another significant step toward taming the nation's troublesome trade deficit.
But because of the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq and the resulting jump in oil prices, which are now up 64 percent since Aug 1., the trade deficit figures for July onward should be higher. Economists said, however, that the increase from oil is not expected now to push the trade deficit higher than $100 billion for the year.
Several economists said yesterday that this oil-induced growth in the trade deficit should not be taken as a negative. They said they expect the non-oil portion of the trade deficit, which is now down significantly from last year, to continue declining.
This deficit averaged $5 billion a month in 1989 and fell to around $3.5 billion the first five months of this year. It was $1.4 billion in June. And it is this deficit that economists take as a measure of America's competitiveness abroad and the ability of the country's exporters to continue providing the economy with growth as demand declines at home.
In addition to oil price increases, analysts said the trade deficit could be pushed up in the next months because the jump in exports in June depended on sectors that can be volatile, in this case airplanes, food, feeds and beverages.
The rise in exports in June, by $1.5 billion, to a record $34.3 billion, showed that the economy was much stronger at the end of the second quarter than recent economic data had shown and that this sector was still providing the economy with some life. Mr. Brinner and Mr. Jelalian said the export increase combined with the decline in imports, which were both unexpected, would force the Commerce Department to raise the 1.2 percent growth rate for the economy in the second quarter to 1.5 percent to 2 percent.
 
Sign of a Slowdown
At the same time, the decline in imports, which fell by $1.2 billion, to $39.4 billion, was seen as another sign that the economy was slowing down. Half the decline was in lower oil imports at lower prices than in May. Some economists said the oil decline should not be counted when estimating the weakness of the economy because the numbers can be volatile. But Mr. Drury noted that the decline in non-oil imports was still sharp.
Mr. Brinner said he thought that the future impact of the oil price rise alone, which would curtail economic growth by reducing discretionary spending, would not be enough to send the economy into a recession. But he said the increase had also hurt consumer confidence, making people less willing to spend. ''The direct impact of higher oil prices we could absorb,'' he said. ''But if you add to it a loss of confidence of the consumer that lasts through the fall, we have a recession.''
The deficit for June, on a seasonally adjusted basis, fell $2.7 billion, from $7.77 billion in May. This was the lowest level for the deficit since the $3.96 billion deficit in June 1983.
Of the $1.5 billion rise in exports, 62 percent, or $922.7 million, came from sales of airplanes, computers and spacecraft. A jump in the sale of airplanes and airplane parts abroad accounted for $483 million. Another $276 million is from computer and computer parts sales. And exports of spacecraft and parts rose $163 million. About $500 million came from sales abroad of foods, feeds and beverages.
Exports of passenger cars to Canada at $55.1 million, Japan at $5.5 million and other countries at $31.5 million all declined.
On the import side, the $600 million drop in the value of oil imports resulted from a decline in the number of imported barrels of crude oil by 26 million, to 252 million, and the average price for a barrel fell 93 cents, to $14.64. This is far below the $28.63 close for oil yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The other import declines were in consumer goods, about $300 million, and industrial supplies and capital goods, including an $82 million decline in general industrial machinery.
With a lift from the declining dollar, the United States continued to have a trade surplus with Europe of about $800 million. Its deficit with Japan, however, rose to $3.1 billion, from $3 billion in May.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Japan Considers a Role in Gulf Force

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 17

 BODY:
In what would be Japan's boldest involvement in a possible military confrontation since World War II, the Japanese Government indicated today that it was considering sending nonmilitary support personnel to back American and other forces opposing Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
Taizo Watanabe, the Foreign Ministry's chief spokesman, refused to identify the options being considered. He stressed at a briefing here that Japan, which is more dependent on Middle Eastern oil than any other industrialized nation, would abide by its Constitution, which forbids its use of armed forces for all but defensive purposes. 
But he asserted that the Government was moving swiftly toward deciding on what he called some unprecedented steps to take part in the trade embargo being enforced against Iraq. This stood in contrast to the signs of confusion earlier this week on how the Government would respond to the crisis in the Persian Gulf.
Japanese press reports said that the possibilities ranged from dispatching transportation and communications experts to sending medical personnel. One report quoted a Japanese official who was not named as saying Japan might send minesweepers.
 
'The Earliest Possible Time'
Mr. Watanabe would not comment on these possibilities, but he ruled out sending military personnel without a change in the law, which he indicated was not likely because of the time it would consume.
''We feel time is short and we have to make our position firm at the earliest possible time,'' Mr. Watanabe said.
''Please don't think we are only considering sending money,'' he added. ''We are considering everything.'' Japan would not wait for a United Nations declaration supporting joint military action before committing itself, Mr. Watanabe said.
Japan's Constitution permits Japan to field only defensive forces. It has been interpreted as forbidding Japan from using its military power more than 1,000 miles from its shores.
Public opinion has tended to oppose strongly any move to become a major military power, although the Government has quietly initiated a major military buildup over the last decade, in response to American prodding.
But the Government has been struggling to develop a more assertive foreign policy to give it a voice in international affairs commensurate with its immense economic influence.
The briefing was held after Taro Nakayama, Japan's Foreign Minister, left Tokyo for an official nine-day trip to Saudi Arabia, Oman, Jordan, Egypt and Turkey. Mr. Nakayama was sent in the place of Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, who abruptly decided on Monday not to go himself on the long-planned visit.

HEADLINE: Equity Was Right the First Time

BYLINE: By Paul Winfield; Paul Winfield, an actor, is currently appearing in the film ''Presumed Innocent.''

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
When Actors Equity took its stand on ''Miss Saigon'' in favor of fair casting opportunities for its minority members, I stood 100 percent behind my union. Now that it has reversed its decision, I am just as firmly opposed.
Equity barred the casting of Jonathan Pryce, a Caucasian, in the role of a Eurasian in ''Miss Saigon'' for the Broadway run of the show. The union took the position that an Asian actor should have been given the opportunity to play the part. In retaliation, the British producer, Cameron Mackintosh, cancelled the show's American production, calling the Equity position racist. 
What is actually an extremely complex issue about equal opportunity in the professional theater was reduced to jeers about ''creative freedom'' and ''reverse racism.'' Equity was accused - wrongly - of formulating a policy that would prevent minority actors from being cast in Shakespeare, and of rolling back the gains we have made toward color-blind casting over 25 years.
While color-blind, or non-traditional, casting is a laudable concept, too many of my colleagues are never offered opportunities to play against ''type,'' especially on Broadway. And, as ''Miss Saigon'' proves, they have a hard enough time even getting the roles that are written for minorities.
But the most important issue raised by ''Miss Saigon'' is whether British producers will abide by our open casting policies when London hits are imported to Broadway. Right now, we don't have any kind of reciprocity or parity from Britain. We are barred from jobs there and when they come here, we are told ''take it or leave it.''
When James Earl Jones wanted to re-create his starring role in ''The Great White Hope'' in England, he was denied the chance because he is not a member of British Equity. When he was invited to play Othello for the BBC, black British actors rebelled against an American taking what few jobs they had. For all their protests, a white actor, Anthony Hopkins, played the role in ''brown face.''
Why must the members of my union be forced to live by another country's rules and casting traditions on their own ground? Why not have equitable, open readings for all roles, even in Broadway shows with $25 million in advance ticket sales?
Yes, I want to continue to be considered for traditionally white roles when I'm the best available actor. But on Broadway, the best available actor is somehow always, in box office terms, the most ''economically viable'' actor, i.e., white.
Just over two decades ago, Andre Gregory cast me in the role of the Gentleman Caller in Tennessee Williams's ''Glass Menagerie'' It was the inaugural season of the multiracial Los Angeles Inner City Cultural Center, subsidized by city schools. The casting was so unusual at the time that, to avoid having student audiences misinterpret a black man playing a white woman's suitor, I submitted to two hours of makeup daily to become a white man.
Importantly, the Inner City theater company presented many more productions that were racially mixed but without ''white face'' or other disguises. Today, drop into any high school or university across this land and catch the rainbow families inhabiting ''Our Town,'' ''You Can't Take It With You'' and other classics. Color-blind casting simply reflects the population of this country.
British producers have yet to catch up with America's open casting policies. And until they do, minority actors should not be denied employment in ethnic roles on Broadway.
Economics dictate that ''Miss Saigon'' will probably go on, but the issue it raises must not escape us again. It must not be raised after the fact, for the right reasons at the wrong time, or as a small missile in major economic warfare. Fairness must be the standard under which we operate.
Equity, which has been accused of blundering into this controversy, need only enforce the ground rules. What few job opportunities there are for minority actors must not be taken away before they have had a chance to audition. Visitors must observe the local customs as surely as the Shuberts and the Nederlanders must.

HEADLINE: Who Will Control the Legacy of the Woodstock Nation?

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BETHEL, N.Y., Aug. 16

 BODY:
For 21 years, this rural Catskills town has lived peacefully with its legacy as the site of Woodstock, the music festival that defined an era.
But eras change, generations grow old and new ones come along. And as thousands of Woodstock pilgrims gathered at Max Yasgur's farm this week to commemorate yet again the anniversary of the festival, Bethel is grappling with how to deal wtih its past without forsaking its future.
The farm's owner wants to capitalize on the site's historical value, holding gatherings and renting spots for vendors and campers. A developer who lives nearby has sued the owner and the town to stop this year's celebration, which he says is destroying the value of his properties. The Town Supervisor envisions condemning the site and creating, say, an arts and music center for tourists. 
At the same time, more than 3,000 people have set up camp on the farm, trying to recreate the mystique of the original. Most of them were too young to attend or were not born when the original festival drew 400,000 people here in 1969. We Are Stardust. . . ''It's like a flower of the 60's that's blossomed all over again,'' said Steve Wargo, a 42-year-old railroad worker from Stamford, Conn. ''It's like sacred land.''
The Town Supervisor, Allan C. Scott, said, ''Some people might say it's blasphemous, but I think this town has to realize that there's a big economy associated with this.''
For 19 years after the festival, which lasted from Aug. 15 to Aug. 17, no one paid much attention to the site. In 1984, a modest memorial appeared, but except for the occasional tourist and some intrepid interlopers who made yearly pilgrimages to the Mecca of the hippie generation, the site remained pastoral.
Then last year, spurred by nostalgia and vast amounts of media attention, 250,000 people passed through to celebrate Woodstock's 20th anniversary - a sort of spontaneous happening that many said was as groovy as the original.
''We saw plenty of smoke last year before we saw the flames,'' said Steven Dubrovsky, a real-estate developer, who lives a mile down the road. ''The people who live around here got the feeling it just sort of happened, like Woodstock. This year, it's a whole different atmosphere than Woodstock.'' We Are Golden. . . Mr. Dubrovsky, 41, owns 250 acres of rolling countryside straddling Hurd Road, near the festival site. Since he and his wife, Linda, moved here in 1983, his company, the Woodstone Developing Corporation, has built 15 country estates along Filippini's Pond, where concertgoers skinny-dipped, then and now.
His troubles began last month when campers arrived and built makeshift camps in the woods overlooking the site. Most were members of the Rainbow Family, a loosely knit spiritual group that wanders the country.
Mr. Dubrovsky said they - and later the vendors and hundreds more campers - had been lured to the site by organizers of a 21st anniversary festival. As the crowds have grown so has the noise, and panhandling campers have harassed neighbors, he said.
''Throughout the year, you see people of all ages stopping, looking around and saying, 'Hmm,' '' said Michael Mitchell, a vice-president at Tiffany and Company who lives near the site. ''That's what it should be.'' This year's free-for-all, he added, ''creates a different atmosphere.''
Then, earlier this month, Mr. Dubrovsky was showing a 10-acre property to a prospective buyer. As they drove near the site, they saw a man defecating on the side of the road.
''I saw a half-million dollar deal go down the drain,'' he said. ''I'm out of business until this thing is resolved.''
Mr. Dubrovsky, Mr. Mitchell and four other neighbors sued the town and the farm's owner, June Gelish, charging that a commercial festival violated the town's zoning laws. The town in turn joined in the suit, and last a State Supreme Court judge ordered Ms. Gelish to stop promoting commercial activities on the farm.
But more Woodstock pilgrims arrived. The activities have an air of unorganized organization. Security guards charge $5 for parking. The Rainbow Family has built an ''Info Booth'' and a free kitchen. Vendors are selling tie-dye shirts, jewelry and assorted Woodstock paraphernalia. We've Got to Get Ourselves. . . ''This is like a clandestine concert,'' said Will Hoppey, who said he was organizing the bands. ''Nobody has given us permission. And nobody has stopped us.''
On Wednesday night, Arlo Guthrie, one of the original performers, played for an hour, culminating his performance with a rendition of ''Amazing Grace.'' Rumors have spread that other original performers, including Carlos Santana, would perform.
Like others her age, Marla Bailey, a 19-year-old waitress from Hortonville, said she wished she had been at Woodstock, but ''it's a high just being here.'' Barefooted and wearing a tie-dye swimsuit, she said she was a child of the 1960's - ''I'm just not from then.''
A lawyer for the homeowners, Robert M. Rosen, said the lawsuit accomplished nothing. ''You can't start a stone rolling from the top of a hill and expect it to stop,'' he said. ''There is practically no way to stop these activities short of calling out the National Guard.''
Mr. Scott said that is out of the question. For his part, he has, bullhorn in hand, gone to the farm, urging people, ''in the spirit of Woodstock,'' to leave.
''It's obvious someone is conducting commercial activities at the site,'' Mr. Scott said. ''But it's unclear who that might be. We're powerless really. We've passed the legal stage. Now, we have to look to control the situation until Tuesday.'' Back to the G-a-a-r-rden! After that, the Town Board will try to condemn the farm and preserve it as a landmarked historical site, Mr. Scott said. With grants or other financial backing, the town could possibly create a yearly festival.
Jeff Gelish, whose mother, June Gelish, owns the 39-acre chunk of the Yasgur farm that includes the natural amphitheater that was the festival's epicenter, said his family has no control over the campers or the vendors. The family has twice gone to the town with plans for celebrations, but they have been rejected.
Plans for this year's gathering were aborted by the lawsuit, Mr. Gelish said, and his mother, distressed by the dispute, ''has gone into seclusion.''
Standing on the crest overlooking the stage, he said his family has been saddled with providing water and sanitation for the pilgrims. He said security guards ''are asking for donations'' to raise money for water and Port-o-Sans. Two 6,000-gallon water tankers arrived this evening, in addition to 15 portable toilets.
''It's just too bad we can't connect with the right people in government and give it the respect it deserves,'' Mr. Gelish said. ''Now, everybody's trying to get a piece of the pie.''

HEADLINE: New York's Guard Feeling Mideast Ripples

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

DATELINE: NEWBURGH, N.Y., Aug. 17

 BODY:
For Sgt. Michael Bruce, a paramedic in the 105th Military Airlift Group of the National Guard here, the hardest part of the Persian Gulf crisis has been explaining the possible mobilization of the American reserves to his 7-year-old son, Christopher.
''He knows I haven't been with him for the last couple of days because I'm playing G.I. Joe - that's what he calls it,'' said Sergeant Bruce, 34, of Highland. ''I told him that I may have to go play G.I. Joe for a while, and my son asked why, and I explained that you've got bad G.I. Joes and good G.I. Joes. You can't really get into politics with a 7-year-old.'' 
These are turbulent moments for the 1,600 men and women in the nation's largest Air National Guard unit, based at Stewart International Airport in the Hudson Valley, as they await a potential call-up. White House officials said today that President Bush had agreed in principle to call up a small number of reservists for important support jobs, including cargo handling and medical work.
Almost all the guard members here come from within 100 miles, including Long Island, Connecticut and New Jersey. About 900 are considered traditional guard members, part-timers with outside jobs who drill at the base one weekend a month and train two full weeks during the year, usually in the summer. The rest are full-time technicians responsible for day-to-day operations.
Though they are trained in warfare, the doctors, accountants, paramedics, lawyers and correction officers making up part of the country's ''citizen militia'' are usually called on for missions that are not strictly military. Last year, they flew supplies to Armenia after the earthquake and then to the victims of Hurricane Hugo on Puerto Rico and in the Virgin Islands.
The prospect of being called to supplement United States forces in the Middle East in the wake of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has charged this base with a peculiar mix of dread and excitement.
''Actually, I'm scared to death,'' Sergeant Bruce said. ''But if they need me, I'll go.''
Since the Defense Department hinted this week that it might tap its reserves, Sgt. Paula Page, 27, of Queens, a freelance writer and a member of the 105th Group for three years, said she had thought of little else. ''I keep wondering who's going to take care of my daughter, and whether we'll have an active or passive role,'' she said.
But it could also be their moment of glory. ''Being in the guard is sort of like being on a bench in a baseball game,'' Sergeant Page said. ''And then suddenly, you get to put your skills to use.''
Battle zones are not completely alien to guard members. Some volunteered for the American operation in Panama; 758 troops from Stewart airlifted more than two million pounds of cargo. ''Panama was our first involvement in a hostile theater,'' the commander of the 105th, Col. Paul A. Weaver Jr., said. ''We all looked at one another and realized that it wasn't a humanitarian mission. But I didn't see anybody go out the door either.''
There are 92 Air National Guard flying units, part of a total of 1,339 units. There are 3,500 Army National Guard units.
The fleet of the 105th is made up entirely of C-5A Galaxy transports, the largest aircraft in the Western world. No Air National Guard units have the immense planes, which are painted in green and brown camouflage. With a cargo compartment measuring 121 feet long, 19 feet wide and 13 feet high, the C-5A can haul 12 military helicopters, or, as a fact sheet points out, 10,682 bushels of unshelled peanuts or 26 million Ping Pong balls.
 
Bigger Than Wrights' Flight
''It's a lumbering giant and it flies like a luxury car,'' said Colonel Weaver, striding proudly through a plane's belly as he pointed out that the Wright brothers could have made their first flight in it, considering that the flight was 120 feet.
Virtually from the instant Mr. Bush committed forces to the Middle East, the unit here has been involved voluntarily, with more than half of its 12 C-5A's taking supplies and personnel to what is referred to as the ''theater.'' Colonel Weaver refused to say how many members had gone where, but he said they were ''flying into all of our allied nations'' in the Middle East.
''Even without a Federal call-up, people are banging on the door to participate,'' the colonel said.
But a call-up would be different. Some or all of the 1,600 troops would have to report immediately to the base. Wills would be made out, immunizations given, gear and uniforms checked and assignments made, either to the Middle East, another base in the United States or here at Stewart. ''This place would be buzzing,'' Colonel Weaver said.
 
Disagreement About War
Although a sense of duty prevailed on the sun-drenched base, guard members were not in complete agreement as to the worthiness of spilling blood to repel Iraq.
''I believe it's a good cause,'' Sgt. Barry Tabachnick of Newburgh, a correction officer and a medical technician in the guard, said. ''The United States has been pushed around by other countries enough. Our economy is based on oil, and by the Iraqis' taking it over, they could control our whole system.''
To Sergeant Bruce, however, ''war is needless.'' A former combat medic in the Marines, he said he joined the guard after leaving the military so he could have ''some control'' over his assignment in the event of war.
''If they chose for me, I'd have to be a trained killer,'' he said. ''But my job is to alleviate pain and suffering, and I'd rather save a life than take one.''

CORRECTION-DATE: September 21, 1990, Friday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Aug. 18 about preparations for the mobilization of the 105th Military Airlift Group of the National Guard at Stewart International Airport in Newburgh, N.Y., misstated the number of Air National Guard units equipped with C-5A Galaxy transports. There is one, the 105th. The error was brought to The Times's attention on the day of publication, but the correction was improperly delayed through another editing oversight.

HEADLINE: Rising Deficits Could Force Fare Increase or Cuts in Transit

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
Declining bus and subway ridership, a sharp rise in fare-beating and a weak regional economy could lead to substantial reductions in service and capital improvements and, possibly, another fare increase, New York City transit officials said yesterday as they released new deficit projections.
After a decade of healthy revenues and ambitious capital spending, the Transit Authority is scrambling to cope with rapidly swelling deficits. The 1990 deficit, estimated a few months ago at $83 million, is now expected to be $109 million, according to figures released at the agency's monthly meeting yesterday. 
The agency also released its first estimate of the 1991 deficit, which is between $200 and $250 million.
To meet this year's deficit the agency has already frozen hiring, scaled back painting projects and cut the number of late-night trains on a number of lines.
 
Offsetting the Shortfall
To meet next year's gap, the agency plans to offset about half of the revenue shortfall through cost-cutting measures, including continuing the hiring freeze, reducing management ranks, and adopting other operating efficiencies, said Dave A. Winfield, the agency's executive vice president.
But the remaining $100 million would have to be made up by a fare increase, sharp cuts in service, a rise in state subsidies or by settling new union contracts for far less than is now expected, he said. The Transit Authority plans to submit various alternatives to its board in the coming months, he said.
''If the current trend continues and things stay as they are, we face the possibility of cutbacks in service, fare or subsidy increases or very minimal union settlements,'' Mr. Winfield said.
The cutbacks already planned will save the Transit Authority about $83 million this year, and the agency plans to use $19 million from a discretionary fund to help offset the 1990 shortfall. The remaining $7 million is expected to come from a reduction in bond interest payments, Mr. Winfield said.
But consumer advocacy groups yesterday assailed the authority's plans to cut subway service, in particular, the reduction of late-night service. They called on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority Board, which is the Transit Authority's parent agency, the Mayor, the Governor and the State Legislature ''to stop the wholesale destruction'' of transit service.
''We are witnessing the beginning of curtailed late night and weekend service, and this is a precedent we cannot allow to happen,'' said Stephen Dobrow, vice chairman of the New York City Transit Authority Advisory Council, an independent consumer group. ''We see very little evidence of belt-tightening and other efficiencies at the Transit Authority. What we do see is a rush to cut service.''
The lines that will be affected by the service reductions are the A, B, C, D, E, F, G, J, M, N, Q, R, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Most of the service reductions are at night and affect the length of time between trains.
Jared Lebow, a spokesman for the Transit Authority, described the service changes as minor, except for the elimination of the B train at night along Central Park West. Mr. Lebow said that about six passengers a car use it at night and that the agency would save $1.3 million by eliminating it. After 7 P.M. the B train will replace the Q shuttle that runs from Rockefeller Center to Long Island City.

HEADLINE: Dow Drops By 36.64, To 2,644.80

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
The stock market closed with another sizable decline yesterday, finishing a tumultuous week down sharply. It had experienced even steeper declines earlier in the day that activated the New York Stock Exchange's restriction on program trading.
Traders cited continuing worries about the economy, a still-fluid Middle East situation, rising bond yields and steeper oil prices.
After tumbling more than 66 points on Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell yesterday by 36.64 points, or 1.37 percent, to 2,644.80. For the week, the drop in the Dow was 71.78. Yesterday's closing level was its lowest since March 1, when it was 2,635.59. In early afternoon trading, the index was once down 60 points. 
 
A Quiet 'Witching Hour'
Yesterday was also a ''double witching hour,'' which involves the simultaneous expiration of stock options and stock index options, as well as the Major Market Index futures. Futures for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index do not expire in a double witching hour, as they do in a ''triple witching hour''; they will expire next month.
The witching effect on yesterday's market was minimal, traders said. Indeed, it was one of the quietest witching hours in a while. When the market is undergoing a broad upward or downward trend, the number of last-minute orders is usually not so large, and the price swings are usually not so severe, they added. But buying related to certain options and futures contracts did help to cut the day's losses almost in half.
Volume was heavy for a summer Friday, but not for an options expiration day, said Michael Metz, chief market analyst for Oppenheimer & Company. The total number of shares traded on the Big Board was 212.6 million, up from 138.8 million the day before. Declines exceeded advances by a ratio of better than 4 to 1, with 1,330 stocks down and 310 stocks up.
 
S.& P. 500 Index Off 4.56
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell by 4.56 points, to 327.83, while the Nasdaq composite index was down by 8.78 points, to 393.49. The American Stock Exchange composite index fell 3.22 points to finish at 333.61.
Mr. Metz said: ''The market is basically gripped by risk-aversion. Presently, it is true for both the equity and bond markets.'' Mr. Metz added that he had observed a sense of helplessness among traders and a general feeling that the market cannot go up again.
''But at some point,'' he said, ''the most urgent sellers will be out of the way. And the market will define the low at the end of the trading range. I think we're almost there.''
''The problem is, no one has a convincing scenario as to how the Persian Gulf situation will end,'' he added. ''It raises anxiety and erodes confidence at best.''
Before the opening bell in New York, many overseas stock markets were already depressed by the gloomy outlook of the United States economy and by Middle East tensions.
The Tokyo 225-share Nikkei index plunged 762.72 points, or 2.77 percent, to 26,786.72 yesterday, on top of the previous day's slide of 562.68 points. Mideast and Inflation The market received a bit of good economic news in the morning, but it appeared to be overshadowed by the Middle East worries and Thursday's bad report on inflation - a higher-than-expected Consumer Price Index. The Commerce Department said the nation's trade deficit narrowed 35 percent to a seven-year low of $5.07 billion in June. But analysts said they expected it to resume growing once the impact of higher oil prices took effect.
By noon the market had fallen more than 50 points, setting off a ''circuit breaker'' - the New York Stock Exchange's 50-point index-linked trading rule, which was in effect most of the day. When the Dow falls more than 50 points, the rule restricts traders who use computer programs to initiate sell orders. Such programs are not permitted to sell stock on a downtick, or when a stock's last sale is lower than the previous sale.
Going into the weekend, investors were uneasy about holding positions, especially with prospects fading for an early settlement of the situation in the Middle East. Oil prices rose - on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the settlement price on a barrel of light crude was $28.60, up $1.27, in contracts for September delivery -and transport stocks weakened, with the USAir Group off 1/4, to 17 1/2; UAL down 3/4, to 101 1/2; Federal Express down 1 3/4, to 34 3/8; Airborne Freight down 1, to 20 5/8, and British Airways down 1 1/8, to 29 7/8. The stocks of oil producers, the chief beneficiaries of the rise in oil prices, accounted for many of the big gainers on the Big Board. ARCO rose 2 1/2, to 137 1/2; Texaco was up 1 5/8, to 63 7/8; Royal Dutch Petroleum gained 1 3/8, to 84 3/4, and British Petroleum was up 1 3/4, to 86.
Wal-Mart Stores, down 1 1/8, to 28, was the biggest trader on the Big Board, with 4.1 million shares. Other big retailers' stocks also declined, reflecting concern that retail sales would decline if the economy slid into recession.

HEADLINE: Saudi Move For OPEC Meeting

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Saudi Arabia, laying the basis for a sharp increase in its oil production without OPEC's approval, stressed to other members of the organization yesterday that it was seeking a meeting to discuss the issue and that opposition to such discussion was not reasonable.
The Saudis are arguing that the embargo of oil from Iraq and Kuwait is hurting third world countries, which generally have no oil-storage plants and are running out of supplies.
The oil minister of Iraq, Issam Abdul-Rahim al-Chalabi, meanwhile, reiterated a threat against nations that raise production and said the Saudi call for a meeting was a cover for their intentions to do just that. And an official in Venezuela, the other member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries with a substantial capacity to increase output, said the country still preferred to get OPEC approval but was nearly certain to produce more oil regardless of what OPEC did. 
 
Worries About the Weekend
Fear of military action dominated the oil markets yesterday, with traders' worries about what might happen over the weekend leading them to bid up prices. In contracts for September delivery, oil prices rose $1.27 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, closing at $28.63 a barrel. Wholesale gasoline rose 8.51 cents, to $95.97 a gallon, a record in five years of futures trading.
Nauman Barakat, a trader at Shearson Lehman Brothers, said that if the military standoff continues, ''the mid-$30's area should not be ruled out.'' If war breaks out, he said, prices would quickly jump $5 a barrel, but if 2.5 million to 3 million barrels a day of new production comes on stream, ''the market may come off by $5 or so.''
Saudi officials sounded firm yesterday in their determination to pump more oil, although they have expressed such willingness more than once since Aug. 7, when the United States committed troops to defend Saudi Arabia.
 
'Just Go Ahead and Do It'
''Our main concern is the overall world oil-supply situation,'' said one Saudi official in a telephone interview. ''Our concern is the overall international economy and what would happen if ample supplies are not available. If it means we will have to unilaterally act, or if it means that some members of OPEC will have to go about a decision, we will just go about it, just go ahead and do it.''
The official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified, noted that the current OPEC agreement calls for production of 22.5 million barrels of oil a day, and a $21 minimum ''reference price.'' Now, he said, production is about 18.5 million barrels a day and the price is about $26. ''Definitely, this situation warrants a meeting,'' he said.
Saudi Arabia could increase its production by two million barrels a day ''by tomorrow morning,'' he said, and could add an additional 500,000 barrels a day quickly thereafter.
An oil expert in the Persian Gulf said that in November and December of 1988, the Saudis had demonstrated they could produce eight million barrels a day, slightly more than the level now being proposed.
In Venezuela, an official who refused to have his name or position disclosed, said his country was trying hard to work within the structure of OPEC. ''The only way you really could keep control in the market, over supply, is to have some kind of commitment'' within the organization, he said. If an agreement is not possible, the official said, Venezuela will make a decision on its own and, ''I'm sure it will be very favorable to the United States.''
''We are a part of the Western Hemisphere,'' he said, ''and we must look to the Western Hemisphere.'' Venezuela's Spare Capacity During the Arab oil embargo of 1973-74, Venezuela raised its production by about 1.5 million barrels a day. At the moment, its spare capacity is about 500,000 barrels a day.
Several people well acquainted with Venezuela said yesterday that the final decision appeared to rest with the President, Carlos Andres Perez. Iraq and Kuwait between them have an OPEC quota of 4.6 million barrels a day, but analysts say they may have been producing slightly more than that before the Aug. 2 invasion by Iraq and subsequent embargo on their shipments. In addition to the 3.2 million barrels a day that Saudi Arabia and Venezuela could add to world supplies, experts say the United Arab Emirates could add 250,000 to 300,000 barrels to its July production, at least for a few weeks, and might quietly do so.
In Colombia, an OPEC member but a small exporter, the state-owned oil company said yesterday that it would increase oil production by 15,000 barrels a day.
 
Nigerian and Algerian Opposition
But the President of Nigeria, Ibrahim Babangida, reaffirmed on state radio yesterday that his country would abide by its OPEC quota. Algeria also expressed opposition to a meeting, according to Saudi officials.
Outside observers say the situation is extremely difficult for OPEC. If members act unilaterally, said Cyrus H. Tahmassebi, the chief economist of Ashland Oil, ''whatever discipline there may be will collapse.''
''It will create a lot of ill feeling among OPEC members and political problems,'' he said.
But if prices rise too high, Dr. Tahmassebi said, the result will be increased conservation and other developments that will hurt the long-term market for oil.
Sizing up the votes at a possible OPEC meeting, David T. Mizrahi, editor of Mideast Report, a New York-based newsletter, said that of the 13 members, Iraq and Kuwait were unlikely to attend. He said the nations that would favor increased production were Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Ecuador, and possibly Indonesia. That would constitute a majority at a meeting, he said. As the maneuvering among OPEC members continued, prices in this country rose, especially for gasoline. In Los Angeles, ARCO, which imposed a freeze on gasoline prices on Aug. 8, reported that 270 of its stations, primarily in Southern California, had run out of unleaded regular because they were selling it at 5 to 13 cents less than competitors.
Douglas Elmets, a spokesman for the company, said that ARCO had bought 100,000 barrels of gasoline on the spot market and had hired every delivery truck it could, in addition to its own fleet, to keep its stations supplied. ''Our volumes are just amazing,'' he said, adding that sales were up 10 pecent.
The company appeared to be trading profit for market share and floods of favorable publicity. The supplies it bought on the spot market cost $1 a gallon, and it was selling for an average price of $1.16, a margin that Mr. Elmets confirmed was not covering all costs.

HEADLINE: Market in U.S. Securities Steadies

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
The Government securities market stabilized yesterday after prices plunged and interest rates soared during the previous session. Dealers described yesterday's relatively lackluster trading activity as a tug-of-war between market participants influenced by inflationary fears and further weakness in the dollar and those counting on a continuing decline of the economy.
As a result, prices of Treasury coupon issues traded in a narrow range for most of the day, with the new benchmark long bonds, the 8.75 percent issue that matures in 2020, ending at 98 3/32, off 3/32 on the day, while its yield rose a basis point, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 8.93 percent, from 8.92 the day before. One week ago, the long bond's yield was 8.79 percent. 
Among other Treasury issues traded in the secondary market, the 8 percent notes of 1992 were unchanged at 99 27/32 with a yield of 8.08 percent; the 8 percent notes of 1993 rose 1/32, to 99 13/32, for a yield of 8.22 percent.
 
Long Notes Slip
The closely watched long notes, the 8.75's of the year 2000, slipped 2/32, to 99 24/32, for a yield of 8.79 percent, up from 8.67 percent a week ago. During the week, the yield on the 10-year Japanese ''long bonds'' rose to 8.05 percent from 7.98 percent, and the yield on the same West German bond maturity climbed to 8.89 percent from 8.83 percent.
With the worldwide demand for credit increasing, the competing rates on the Government bonds of major industrial countries not yet having rampant inflation are carefully studied by investment portfolio managers.
Leif H. Olsen, who heads an economic consulting and financial management organization bearing his name in New Canaan, Conn., said: ''The next batch of economic data due out in September should clearly show the economy in a decline. Perhaps this is why the market tended to ignore the sharp rise in the July Consumer Price Index and the impressive improvement in our trade balance for June. Both indicators did not reflect the surge in oil prices since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.''
In any case, he added, ''the Fed can not ease credit with energy prices and inflation climbing each day.''
The Federal Reserve, for its part, intervened to add reserves to the banking system through repurchase agreements. But the move was considered one of several taken by the Fed this week to offset the distortions caused by the power failure in New York's financial district earlier this week. As a result of the breakdown in computer and other transfer systems, which have now been restored, some banks were either debited for payments already made while others were given credit for much larger ''floats,'' in effect money claimed to be en route, than were warranted.
In any case, the Fed's intervention had little impact on the key Federal funds rate that banks charge each other for temporary loans. The funds traded between 8 1/8 percent and 8 3/16 percent almost all day.
 
Little Change in Bill Rates
There was little change in the discount rates on Treasury bills, which would be the most immediately influenced by shifts in Fed policy. The rate on the 90-day bills dipped a basis point, to 7.49 percent; six-month bills were off three basis points, at 7.44 percent, and the one-year bills declined two basis points, to 7.30 percent.
The Treasury announced that it would auction $10.5 billion of new one-year bills next Thursday.
In the corporate bond market, the mounting financial problems of the Trump Organization depressed prices of its debt. Late in the day, dealers said the Trump Plaza Funding's 12 7/8 percent first-mortgage bonds were off 1.5 points, at 68 bid, while Trump's Castle Funding's 13 3/4 percent first-mortgage bonds were also marked down 1.5 points, to 47, and the Trump Taj Mahal Funding lost a point, at 41 1/2. A point is equivalent to $10 for each $1,000 of face value.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar, Generally Down, Hits A New Low Against Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar sank to another record low yesterday against the German mark and fell against all other major currencies except the Japanese yen, reflecting continuing pessimism about the state of the American economy.
The dollar dropped to 1.5485 German marks in Europe, from 1.5630 marks late Thursday. Its previous closing low in Europe had been 1.5605 marks, set on Wednesday. 
In New York, the dollar ended at 1.5500 marks, a new low for that market. The dollar's previous low in New York had been 1.5525 marks on Thursday. For the week, the dollar sank by 6.7 percent against the mark in domestic dealings.
 
Small Trade Deficit
The latest decline came despite the United States report of an unexpectedly small trade deficit of $5.07 billion in June. Dealers said traders shunned the dollar because they believe that the economy may be headed into a recession and that the Federal Reserve will have no choice but to encourage lower interest rates.
When United States rates are falling relative to those in other countries, the dollar is less appealing to foreign investors.
''Dollar traders are just not interested in the trade picture,'' said Walter Simon, a currency options trader at Bank Julius Baer & Company. ''They are interested in the whole weakening of the U.S. economic climate.''
Dealers in Europe said the dollar was hurt by reported comments from the West German central bank's vice president, Helmut Schlesinger. He was quoted as saying that the dollar's decline fit the central bank's strategy because it reduces West German import prices.
The dollar rose in New York against the Japanese yen, to 147.60 yen, from 147.25 late Thursday.
The dollar lost ground against the British pound. In New York, the pound rose to $1.9230, from $1.9095 late Thursday. Sterling rose to $1.9195 in London, from $1.8985 late Thursday.
Other dollar rates as of 4 P.M. in New York, compared with late rates Thursday, were: 1.2820 Swiss francs, down from 1.2915; 5.1975 French francs, down from 5.2220; 1,142.25 Italian lire, down from 1,143.25, and 1.14365 Canadian dollars, down from 1.14815.
In the precious metals market, gold prices were mixed. After gold posted gains in other markets, the Republic National Bank in New York quoted an after-hours bid of $408.50 an ounce as of 4 P.M., down 50 cents from Thursday's late bid.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose 40 cents, to $409.60.
Earlier, gold rose to $409.25 in London, from $403.50 late Thursday and to $408.25 in Zurich, from $401.25 late Thursday. In Hong Kong, gold rose $9.95, to $410.96.
Silver for current delivery rose 1.1 cents an ounce, to $5.179, on the Comex. Silver rose in London to $5.20, from $5.13 late Thursday.

HEADLINE: Put the Old U.& D. Back on Track

BYLINE: By Donald L. Pevsner; Donald L. Pevsner, a native New Yorker, is a lawyer and consumer advocate.

DATELINE: MIAMI

 BODY:
Imagine you are seated in a rustic railroad passenger car, near a majestic river. The whistle blows, and you're under way - behind the nostalgic chuffing of steam power. Shortly, the level track gives way to a stiff climb, and the little engine must really work to get you up the grade. You emerge alongside the shore of a pristine reservoir, surrounded by wooded mountains, and skirt its banks for several miles. No roads intrude to mar the timeless beauty of the setting. Then you roll alongside a rushing mountain stream, world-famous for its trout fishing. Deer browse nearby, leaping at your passage.
Soon, a wall of mountains appears in your path. To surmount this obstacle, you traverse a sweeping horseshoe curve - so steep that even short freight trains were once forced to tackle it in two sections, rejoining at the top after ''doubling the hill.'' At the summit, the tracks run right by the front entrance of one of the country's largest ski resorts, and continue down the mountain into a beautiful, rural river valley. The stresses of big city life have been left far behind. 
The setting for this journey is not Colorado or California, but begins less than 90 miles north of midtown Manhattan, in Kingston, N.Y. - eastern terminus of the most scenic branch-line railroad east of the Rockies, the Ulster and Delaware . Though you cannot ride the U.& D. today, its passenger trains faithfully served the Catskill Mountains from 1872 to 1954, heading west from the Hudson River at Kingston past Ashokan Reservoir, Esopus Creek, Phoenicia, Pine Hill, Highmount (now the site of state-owned Belleayre Mountain Ski Area), Arkville and Roxbury to Stamford, N.Y., with service extended to Oneonta, N.Y. in 1900. This magnificent little line single-handedly opened up the Catskills in Ulster and Delaware Counties as a major resort area. At its peak, in 1913, it carried 676,000 passengers.
Then began the long, painful slide to oblivion. As regional highways improved and passenger-car ownership exploded, ridership declined. The Great Depression and World War II finished the job, while trucks took away the once-lucrative freight business. On March 31, 1954, the last, sad passenger train left Oneonta for Kingston. In 1965, the line's owner, the New York Central Railroad, abandoned it west of Bloomville. Finally, the last freight train rolled into history on September 28, 1976, as a New York State trooper stood memorably to attention at a Catskills grade crossing, his hat solemnly doffed and crossed over his heart.
Two years later, Ulster County, spent $1.5 million in taxpayers' money to acquire the Ulster portion of the line (38.6 miles from Kingston to Highmount, N.Y), with the announced goal of restoring steam-powered excursion trains to the Catskills. And the Delaware County trackage was acquired by the abutting towns, with funds for the purchase provided by the public-spirited A. Lindsay and Olive B. O'Connor Foundation of Delhi, N.Y. The Foundation proceeded, in 1981, to spend an additional $1.7 million to create the ''Delaware & Ulster Rail Ride,'' currently running diesel-powered excursion trains on an isolated five-mile line segment.
Yet Ulster County has no plans, 12 years after acquiring the line, to pay the approximately $8 million it would cost to restore it. As a direct result, a suitable steam locomotive and coaches owned by the current line lessee, the Catskill Mountain Railroad Corporation, remain stored in Kingston. The most scenic portion of the U.& D. remains impassable to excursion trains. Further, Ulster County refuses to even entertain the prospect of line renovation for a connection to Delaware County until at least the year 2011.
This short-sighted position robs the two counties of the financial bonanza that would result from a working line with tourist traffic originating at both ends.
When one considers the enormous economic benefits of steam tourist railroads in sites as diverse as Durango, Co.; Chama, N.M.; Williams, Ariz.; and Scranton, Pa., together with the superb location of Kingston, N.Y. - within an easy day's drive of more than 45 million people - it is difficult to understand or excuse the Ulster County Legislature's studied inaction.
Consider, for example, 200,000 annual railroad riders spending just $100 each in the two-county region. Given the acknowledged 8-to-1 multiplication of tourist dollars in any local economy, the new visitors would circulate $160 million through the region every year. Just one year's sales tax revenues would amply pay the one-time cost of the needed renovations.
Clearly, in the absence of a desirable private foundation or corporate support, it is up to Ulster voters to induce their elected officials to promptly restore this irreplaceable historic resource.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Hostages in Forefront

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 18

 BODY:
 In declaring that he would use foreigners as a shield against Western attack, President Saddam Hussein of Iraq has placed these captives at the forefront of the Persian Gulf crisis in just the manner the Bush Administration hoped to avoid. Mr. Hussein and Mr. Bush are now engaged in a struggle within a struggle, namely over whether the fate of the Americans and other foreigners in Kuwait and Iraq will weaken the international resolve to squeeze Baghdad hard enough to force a withdrawal from Kuwait.
For Mr. Hussein, foreign captives now appear to be his weapon of choice for countering the international quarantine that the United States has erected around him. He is threatening the welfare of the thousands of foreigners trapped inside Iraq and Kuwait if the United States and its allies do not back off.
For Mr. Bush, the challenge is to avoid letting the fate of the captives become the determining factor in his handling of the gulf crisis and to prevent a groundswell of public sympathy for the trapped Americans that could sap the country's willingness to confront Iraq, even with the use of force if necessary. 
Britain, France and other countries with citizens trapped in Iraq and Kuwait face similar tests, and the reaction of one may influence the conduct of the others.
 
Captives' Names Undisclosed
It was precisely to limit this danger that the White House, from the very beginning of this crisis, has leaned over backward to avoid using the word ''hostage'' to describe the trapped foreigners, and has even tried to pretend that their status was a secondary issue. Apparently in an effort to keep the issue from developing a human face in the United States, the State Department has refused to make public the names of any of the Americans trapped in Kuwait and Iraq, saying it would violate their privacy and subject their families to incessant inquiries from the press.
White House aides said the President went on vacation to Kennebunkport, Me., partly to persuade Mr. Hussein that unlike Jimmy Carter he was not becoming obsessed with recovering hostages or losing sight of the original goals of the United States military intervention in the gulf.
Even after the latest threats from Iraq, the White House still tried to sound a restrained note about the foreign captives. It said, ''The use of innocent civilians as pawns to promote what Iraq sees to be its self-interest is contrary to international law and indeed to all accepted norms of international conduct.'' But this use of language about international norms and laws only underscored a larger problem for the Administration represented by the captives issue. President Hussein parted ways with all accepted norms of international conduct a long time ago. He plays by his own rules, which are no rules at all.
The Iraqi leader is saying, in effect, that he is prepared to subordinate all questions of international law and civility to preserve his occupation of Kuwait. He will hold foreigners at key military and civilian installations to deter attack by the Western forces ranged against him, and he will put his captives on the same starvation diet that the United States is trying to put the Iraqi people on.
When faced with hostage crises, Mr. Bush's two predecessors, Mr. Carter and Ronald Reagan, found it difficult to subordinate the lives of American captives to their larger policy goals. Both the Carter and Reagan Administrations were politically damaged by their efforts to free hostages -Mr. Carter in the failed attempt to rescue the American diplomats in Iran and Mr. Reagan in the attempt to win release of Americans in Lebanon that led to the Iran-contra scandal.
 
A Harder Dilemma for Bush
But the dilemmas for Mr. Carter and Mr. Reagan were, in some ways, simpler. The hostage crises were forced on them by kidnappers from afar. The fate of the hostages - and how much to do or not to do on their behalf - were the central issues. The larger issue involved was whether the United States might be encouraging further hostage-takings by bargaining with terrorists and kidnappers.
The situation is different for Mr. Bush. The central issue for him, as he has defined it, is the reversal of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait to preserve the international order and the protection of vital American economic interests in Saudi Arabia. The question Mr. Bush may soon be squarely facing is whether, in pursuit of his larger goals he would be ready to risk the lives of the 3,000 Americans, as well as other foreigners, in Iraq and Kuwait.
The strain of that looming question seems to be taking a toll on the President, who does care about the lives of American captives and is not very good at playing the cold-blooded decision-maker concerned only about the national interest.
He was clearly in a testy mood this morning when he spoke with reporters while playing golf in Kennebunkport. When reporters asked him if he had been in touch with the White House Situation Room about the latest developments in the crisis, he snapped, ''I talk to them every morning at 5:30 A.M., and I am not going to take any comments up here.''
 
Some Unattractive Options
His options at this time are not particularly attractive. Mr. Bush can continue to respond in a restrained manner to the Iraqi leader's escalating use of American and other foreign captives, seeking United Nations condemnation as he has done, and hope that the Iraqi threats will not be carried out. But that would seem to be a holding action at best.
Attempting a rescue mission would be highly risky, given the degree to which the foreign nationals are spread out and the likelihood that any rescue attempt would precipitate not only violence against the civilians by Iraqis, but also the outbreak of a full-scale war.
Another option, which Administration officials say they have ruled out, would be to restrict Iraqi citizens and diplomats in the United States. American officials say this is would ''not be appropriate,'' and would be stooping to Mr. Hussein's tactics.
In the end, though, if the crisis keeps escalating, Mr. Bush may have no choice but to make the hardest choice of all: putting the national interest, as he defines it, ahead of the safety of the American civilians caught in the vortex of a distant war.

FOREIGNERS IN IRAQ WILL SHARE IN HARDSHIPS, BAGHDAD WARNS; SAUDIS TO INCREASE OIL OUTPUT;
'ACT OF WAR' SEEN

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Aug. 18

 BODY:
Declaring the American-led naval blockade ''an act of war,'' Iraq said tonight that thousands of foreigners, including infants, who have been turned into hostages would suffer the same food shortages as Iraqis.
Iraqi officials announced Friday night that as many as 10,000 American, British and other foreign citizens trapped in Iraq and Kuwait would be scattered among Iraqi military bases, oil production sites and industrial installations to serve as virtual human shields against any attack by the growing American and Arab military forces stationed in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf region.
The Iraqi Government left no doubt tonight that it had dramatically raised the stakes by seizing the foreigners to use them as hostages, saying that was ''one of the means for achieving peace.''
 
Will 'Play Host'
''The people of Iraq have decided to play host to the citizens of these aggressive nations as long as Iraq remains threatened with an aggressive war,'' the Speaker of the Iraqi Parliament, Saadi Mahdi Saleh, said in a statement issued late Friday night. 
In an emergency session tonight, the United Nations Security Council unanimously approved a resolution demanding that Baghdad allow foreigners to depart immediately from Iraq and Kuwait. [Page 10.] The White House today called the holding of foreign citizens ''totally unacceptable,'' saying, ''The use of innocent civilians as pawns to promote what Iraq sees to be its self-interest is contrary to international law and indeed to all accepted norms of international conduct.''
 
Where Language Matters
The Bush Administration has avoided using the word ''blockade'' because a blockade, in international law, is generally associated with declared wars. The Administration has preferred the word ''interdiction.''
France expressed its indignation today over Iraq's refusal to release Western civilians and warned Baghdad of ''grave consequences'' if the security of any of the 560 French citizens in Iraq or Kuwait was endangered. In London, the Foreign Office said only that it was aware of the Iraqi announcement.
The Iraqi authorities have ''been coordinating with a number of state ministries and installations that have the required accommodation facilities throughout the country,'' the Speaker's statement said, ''including the Ministry of Oil, the Ministry of Military Industrialization, the armed forces and air bases and other ministries and institutions and the refinery complex in Kuwait and other places, so they are provided with the appropriate accommodation.''
About 2,500 Americans are in Kuwait and rougly 600 more in Iraq, among perhaps 10,000 foreigners, including more than 4,000 British citizens who have been told they cannot leave.
The Iraqi announcement raised the prospect that they would be moved in groups to potential military targets from Kuwait's desalinization plants in the south to Iraq's main oil fields in the north. The places they could be interned could include the critical chemical warfare plants, other defense factories, air bases and military barracks.
Any air attack on these targets -which military experts saw as the most efficient way to strike at the Iraqi military machine - would risk killing the foreigners.
 
Escapes on a Huge Scale
More than 100,000 foreigners, mostly Arabs and third-world nationals working in Kuwait or Iraq have been allowed to flee over the Saudi Arabian and Jordanian borders. A small number of Westerners have also managed to escape in this manner.
Keeping the foreigners at the potential target sites, the Iraqi Government said, ''will only keep the threat of war and aggression at bay.''
The Iraqi announcement tonight said the United States and Britain had ''gone beyond an economic boycott'' to a state of war.
''They embarked on the implementation of an economic blockade by force of arms against Iraq, including food and medicine, and this is an act of war under world norms and international law,'' the Iraqi statement said.
American and British warships in the gulf and Red Sea have been authorized to use force if necessary to prevent merchant ships from carrying cargo to Iraq. On Friday, under the new orders, American ships for the first time stopped and checked two Iraqi coastal vessels, but allowed them to pass when they were found to be empty.
 
Equal Treatment
The Iraqi statement, issued in the name of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, said the children of foreigners, including babies, would share the same fate as Iraqi children. No accurate figures were immediately available, but there are believed to be hundreds of children among the trapped foreigners.
''The measures have caused and will cause shortages in imported food, especially milk for the Iraqi babies,'' the statement said. ''We have decided to treat babies of foreign families equally to those of Iraqis according to our humanitarian principles.''
Adult foreigners being held hostage, the statement said, could expect to eat less.
''Because foreigners are not going to be members of the military forces and are not going to participate in any activities related to war,'' the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs said, ''their share of food, the quantity and quality will be affected by the fact that our imports of food will be reduced.''
Iraq had low supplies of food before its invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 and now has little oil money or access to international markets to replenish its supplies. As of July 25, the Iraqi Government had enough wheat for two months of normal consumption, enough rice for three months, enough beans and barley for a month and less than two weeks' worth of corn, said John P. Parker, an Agriculture Department economist who studies Mideast food supplies.
During the day today, the Government issued a statement saying that ''brother Egyptians'' were excluded from the categories of foreigners who were not allowed to leave. Earlier, there had been a directive to treat Egyptians well even though their Government had sent forces to Saudi Arabia, giving an Arab ingredient to the American ground deployment. Both moves appeared to be attempts to appeal to popular sentiment.
Mr. Saleh, the Parliament Speaker, said in his statement that the American and other Western governments ''are intent on launching a war to starve the Iraqi people in a brutal way unprecedented in history.''
The Iraqi official went on to say that ''foremost of sacred missions should be the protection of peoples from aggression and injustice and the assurance of peace, and any conduct that in the end promotes this noble and humane objective gains deep legitimacy, which is the substance of the divine, secular and international laws.''
The taking of the foreigners hostage and the plan to hold them in potential military targets, he said, was devised ''out of our faith in this sacred mission.''
 
People of Many Nations Involved
In addition to the British and American contingents, there are thousands of other nationals from countries which have joined the actions against Iraq for its takeover of neighboring Kuwait who are now trapped.
Besides 850,000 Egyptians in Iraq and Kuwait, these include Japan, with roughly 600 citizens; Italy, 480; France, 560; West Germany, 560; Ireland, 350; Greece, 250; the Netherlands, 230; Spain, 230; Australia, 160; Denmark, 100 and Belgium, 60. There are also hundreds of people from Sweden, Switzerland, Austria, Finland Luxembourg and New Zealand.
Iraq also continued to warn that it would not hesitate to use chemical weapons.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Largest Force Since Vietnam Committed in 15-Day Flurry

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 17

 BODY:
In only 15 days, while Congress was scattered on summer recess and much of official Washington was on vacation, senior Bush Administration officials have committed the United States to its broadest and most hazardous overseas military venture since the Vietnam War.
Unlike the Vietnam engagement, which was improvised and incremental, the buildup in the Persian Gulf is guided by long military contingency plans that made deployment possible virtually overnight.
But to the public and most politicians, the impact of that buildup is only now taking shape. Military strategists, economists, and politicians say it is potentially enormous, affecting the economy, politics and international relations for years. 
The Administration has been reluctant to disclose the full extent of its military commitment, with Pentagon officials declining to tote up exactly how much armor or how many troops it is sending, or intends to send, or to say how long it expects they will be there, or to make public assessments of the risks to American personnel or prestige.
What is publicly known is that 20,000-plus soldiers are in Saudi Arabia, about 35,000 more are on 59 ships ringing the Saudi peninsula or bound there and up to 45,000 Marines are heading for the Persian Gulf.
How long the forces will be in place is something the Bush Administration has deliberately kept vague. ''Where we'll be a year or two from now, I wouldn't want to speculate,'' Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said on Friday.
Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware said today he was ''struck by the size of this.'' Mr. Biden, a Democratic member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a telephone interview from his home state: ''This is a big, big deal. I think the President has an obligation to put in as many forces as necessary to take care of the troops we have there.
''But quite frankly, I never contemplated talk of 250,000 troops in Saudi Arabia, or talk of an American presence there of several years,'' he said.
While not criticizing Mr. Bush's actions, he said the scope of the American action demands ''not only some consultation, but some extensive debate'' about the need for allied and Arab involvement in the crisis.
The decision that put in motion the most rapid military buildup in American history was effectively made by President Bush and a small circle of advisers in a weekend at Camp David, shortly after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
Most Congressional leaders were informed of the operation after it was ordered. Only one influential lawmaker, Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgian who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, appears to have been consulted in advance. So far, no member of Congress has proposed hearings to discuss ramifications of the action.
Most public figures scrambled to support the President's decision, but a handful of supporters like Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican who is on the Armed Services Committee, have begun raising the first caution flags about the operations.
''I think we'll stand it for a long period of time, as long as there are not casualties,'' Mr. McCain said in a telephone interview from Arizona. ''If you get involved in a major ground war in the Saudi desert, I think support will erode significantly. Nor should it be supported. We cannot even contemplate, in my view, trading American blood for Iraqi blood.''
The American public will undoubtedly back Mr. Bush's commitment to Saudi Arabia, and thus to American access to world oil production, said James Schlesinger, who was Defense Secretary, Energy Secretary and Director of Central Intelligence in the 1960's and 1970's.
''But it is not clear that there is strong public support for a rollback in Kuwait, especially if it will require heavy American casualties,'' he said in a telephone interview from Ohio. He said it was not clear that Americans had even considered the question of restoring the ruling family of Kuwait, although that ''has become a major policy objective of the United States.''
 
Lessons of the 1960's
As the Vietnam experience proved, public debate and Congressional action do not guarantee wise policymaking, several Bush Administration officials and former Government officials from the 1960's said in interviews this week. These officials also noted that President Bush has tried to build public support for his Persian Gulf decisions, holding several press conferences, making a televised speech and in general arguing the case that vital national security interests are at stake.
In the atmosphere of crisis, there is no evidence that extensive debate or consultations would have changed the American commitment in any way.
But some officials said that in keeping with Mr. Bush's demonstrated penchant for making decisions in secret, the White House has kept Congress, citizens and foreign leaders alike in the dark about the ultimate scope of the operation.
The pivotal decisions have been made by Mr. Bush and a handful of his top advisers, including the national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft; Defense Secretary Dick Cheney; Secretary of State James A. Baker 3rd and Gen. Colin Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
The Democrat who heads the House Armed Services Committee, Representative Les Aspin of Wisconsin, said Friday that the United States could easily be forced to maintain ''a more or less permanent force'' in the gulf, although probably under United Nations supervision.
Because the troops and supplies have long been paid for, the major costs so far are for transport and maintenance at wartime readiness. But a prolonged stay would require other expenses, like building shelter for thousands of soldiers now living in tents.
The ultimate costs are unknown, said a Congressional budget analyst who is a military expert.
''But if you have a shooting war,'' he said, ''all bets are off. Then you consume ammunition, fuel, and hardware. You start to replace tanks and planes and missiles. You increase your presence, and the cost jumps, depending on how hot it gets.''

HEADLINE: Military Agency Loses Authority Over Civilian Computer Security

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
President Bush has ordered a quiet dismantling of an aggressive Reagan Administration effort to restrict sources of computerized information, including databases, collections of commercial satellite photographs and information compiled by university researchers.
The Reagan Administration early on established a central office in the National Security Agency to set standards for the security of Federal and private computers. A Presidential order in 1984 expanded the power of the office and created a new security category of sensitive but unclassified information.
The moves were aimed at reducing unauthorized uses of computerized information and at restricting authorized uses so that foreign countries could not piece together sensitive information to learn the nation's secrets.
Civil libertarians raised alarms, saying they feared limits on the free flow of information. Some lawmakers and computer industry officials said they worried that the National Security Agency, a military agency responsible for electronic intelligence gathering, would somehow use its power of setting computer security standards to get around the very security systems it was regulating. 
 
Decentralizing Oversight
Congress passed legislation in 1987 to take away the agency's expanded powers and to give oversight of private security systems to a branch of the Commerce Department. But not until last month did President Bush sign a classified memorandum that tells the security agency to shift its focus to Federal classified systems, revising the original Reagan Administration orders. A summary of President Bush's directive was made public later in the month.
This month the security agency began disbanding its National Computer Security Center, moving most of its 300 employees into new jobs in the more secret communications security section inside the agency. A spokeswoman for the National Security Agency said on Friday that the agency would announce the change in the next few days.
Now some computer security experts say they are concerned that the Bush move goes too far in decentralizing oversight for computer security. An agency official warned that the United States was now in danger of losing its leadership in computer security to European countries that have been investing heavily in new technologies. And some private computer company officials say there is a risk that the security of commercial computer systems will not be a priority under the new system.
The Security Center was established in 1981 as part of the Reagan push to establish a centralized office for military and civilian computer security alike. The center developed computer security standards and evaluated commercial security products. The 1987 law shifted oversight of civilian and unclassified Federal computer security systems to the Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology. The revised directive brings Administration policy in line with the 1987 law.
 
Concern About Espionage
Jerry Berman, director of American Civil Liberties Union's information technology project, praised the latest change, saying, ''By drawing this line between classified and unclassified information and communications systems it provides protection for insuring the free flow of information and the public's right to know.''
Concern over the original directive reached a peak in 1986 after representatives from Government agencies visited at least six private information companies, including Mead Data Central, the publisher of Nexis and Lexis electronic databases. Government officials asked if the company would be willing provide lists of subscribers but the company refused, saying it would be an unconstitutional invasion of privacy.
The officials said at the time that they were concerned that foreign agents would be able to piece together classified information by using various commercial and Government databases that were not classified. The officials were also concerned that economic competitors of the United States would be able to steal strategic technology found in the databases.
While civil libertarians generally praised the moves, information industry executives said that the Bush Administration changes raised new questions about the direction of the nation's policies on information and computer security.
An increasing reliance on computer networks for the nation's commercial, educational, scientific and military operations lead some executives to argue that the country is not spending enough to protect its computer systems.
 
'A Black Hole'
''The Bush Administration is more sophisticated than the Reagan Administration in terms of how they're going to handle the issue,'' said Kenneth B. Allen, senior vice president for governmental relations at Information Industries Association, a trade association based in Washington. ''But it's putting the whole thing into a black hole. The issues regarding sensitive information or computer security haven't gone away.''
Civil libertarians have continued to express concern about Government monitoring of private information, including public electronic mail and computer conference systems. After recent Federal investigations into computer break-ins, several computer industry executives established an organization called the Electronic Freedom Foundation to fight perceived violations of the rights of computer users.
But some computer security experts said the disappearance of the National Center for Computer Security had left a vacuum because Congress had never given its civilian counterpart, the National Institute for Standards and Technology, adequate financing. The military computer security arm has received 10 times the money that the institute received, said Government officials.
''What about the banks and the insurance companies?'' asked Stephen T. Walker, a former Pentagon official who is now president of Trusted Systems Inc., a developer of computer security systems. ''Nobody is looking out for the private sector. The question is how are we going to serve public interests as well as those of military organizations?''
He said that under the new directive, less attention was likely to be paid to the security of mainstream commercial computer security products. And he said the nation would become more vulnerable to computer intrusions and possibly electronic sabotage if more effort was not directed at securing both Government and commercial computers and computer networks.
The original policy directive, NSDD 145, issued by President Reagan in 1984, gave the National Security Agency, the Department of Defense and the president's national security adviser leading roles in establishing data security policy and standards. It also created a category of Government information called sensitive but unclassified.
That category could have included a wide variety of technical sources of information including computer databases, libraries of commercial satellite photographs and information housed in universities.
 
Fewer Turf Battles
The revised directive shifts the security agency's focus to the national security systems that contain classified information and cryptographic data and gives the National Institute of Standards and Technology the task of protecting and evaluating commercial computer security.
''The revision essentially blesses what we are now doing,'' said John Lyons, director of the institute. Acknowledging reports of turf battles over the setting of computer standards, he said, ''There are always going to be conflicts between military and civilian agencies on these issues.'' But he added that the relationship between the institute and the security agency had recently improved.
Several Government officials and agency consultants said that the move shifting the functions of the National Computer Security Center inside the N.S.A. was being made to consolidate both the computer security and communications security work done by the agency into a single organization.
''It's the result of an old war between the cryptographic side and the computer side of the agency,'' said a computer scientist who has consulted with the agency and who spoke on the condition that he not be identified. ''They've decided to enforce a common ground so there is one management. The National Computer Security Center will exist only as a mail drop and phone answering service.''

HEADLINE: 3 Youths Guilty of Rape And Assault of Jogger

BYLINE: By RONALD SULLIVAN

 BODY:
Three young men were convicted last night of raping and beating a jogger in Central Park but were acquitted on the most serious charge they faced, attempted murder.
The verdict was reached after 10 days of bitter jury deliberations, and it ended a chapter in a case that has become a milestone in the public's sense of helplessness against the violence of lawless teen-agers. The crime itself had triggered both fear and soul-searching as experts tried - and failed - to explain what could lead seemingly ordinary young men to commit so vicious an act and to do it so icily.
The verdict was delivered in a packed, tense courtroom at 7:15 P.M. As the jury foreman, Earle Fisher, told the clerk of the jurors' decision on each charge, the defendants, Antron McCray, 16 years old, Yusef Salaam, 16, and Raymond Santana, 15, sat motionless at the defense table.
 
Detectives Raise Fists
Perhaps in response to Justice Thomas B. Galligan's warning against outbursts, there was little other reaction in the courtroom - except for the lead detectives in the case, who made fists of victory in the back of the courtroom and pounded them one on top of the other, expressing their elation. 
Bobby and Linda McCray, the parents of Antron McCray, comforted each other as Mrs. McCray sobbed quietly.
Sherronne Salaam, Yusef Salaam's mother, who was barred from the courtroom for screaming ''liar'' at one prosecution witness, did not know the verdict until a pack of reporters rushed out of the courtroom and raced past her in the corridor outside.
''What happened?'' she cried as she recoiled from the rush.
Although the defendants faced the same charges as adults would have, they will be sentenced on Sept. 11 as juveniles. They face a maximum of 5 to 10 years, as much as they would have received if convicted of attempted murder. They will serve the first part of their sentences in a juvenile detention center and go to state prison when they turn 18.
If they were to be sentenced as adults they would face from 16 and two-thirds to 50 years in prison.
 
Acquittal Explained
Members of the jury who agreed to be interviewed last night said the deliberations were so emotional that they often descended into screaming and name-calling. [Page 33.] Asked why the youths had been acquitted of attempted murder despite the jogger's near-fatal injuries on the night of April 19, 1989, one juror, Charles Nestorick, said: ''it was a very, very painful decision.''
''It was very dark in the park and we believed that they didn't realize how much damage they were doing,'' he said. ''They were too young to know.''
Another juror, Rafael Mirandez, said, ''They had knives and didn't use them.''
A third, Ronald Gold, said he had resisted convicting Mr. McCray of rape until yesterday. He changed his mind, he said, after watching the youth's videotaped confession played one last time.
''I sat and looked at the video one last time, and I gave up,'' he said. ''I felt that he had done it. I looked at the way he told the story, and I felt that he actually believed it.''
Confessions by Mr. McCray as well as by Mr. Santana were videotaped by the police after the youths had been seized as suspects, and the tapes became crucial elements of the prosecution's case. The police had also obtained signed written statements from the two that had incriminated them, as well as a written but unsigned statement from Mr. Salaam detailing his involvement.
Moments after the verdicts were read, Justice Galligan revoked the bail of Mr. McCray and Mr. Salaam, ordering them to jail on Rikers Island. Mr. Santana has been incarcerated, unable to make bail, since he was captured on Central Park West moments after the 30-year-old investment banker was attacked.
Three other defendants charged with rape, attempted murder and assault will be tried this fall. They are Kevin Richardson, 15, Steven Lopez, 16, and Kharey Wise, 18, the only one who will be both tried and sentenced as an adult.
Throughout the trial the Manhattan courthouse at 111 Centre Street has been the scene of frequent and volatile demonstrations, most by people protesting that the trial was grounded in racism, that the defendants were falsely accused and that they could not get a fair trial. Last night, a protest turned ugly when several demonstrators rushed at Elizabeth Lederer, the lead prosecutor, making threats and shouting obscenities.
''The devil herself, she's going to pay for it,'' some shouted through a phalanx of detectives encircling her.
 
Denies Making Mistake
Robert P. Burns, the lawyer whose defense of Mr. Salaam was criticized during the trial as risky and at times sloppy, was jeered by the protesters.
''Very incompetent! Traitor!'' they screamed. One man yelled, ''He's no Alton Maddox or Mason.''
He then stopped to answer questions from reporters. ''I am very surprised by the verdict,'' he said. ''The public got this case all wrong. This was not a racial case. This was about the relationship between the police and minority people who are accused of crimes. It was only racial in the sense that the jogger was white and the defendants black and Hispanic.''
Asked if he made a mistake in putting Mr. Salaam on the stand, he said: ''No, not at all. I would do it again because putting him on the stand forced the public to take a closer look at the case. Everyone thought it was an open-and-shut case that would be completed in a few weeks with a guilty verdict. But that didn't happen because they saw what kind of person Yusef was, and that there was more to it than the police had told them.''
Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan District Attorney, said last night: ''From the beginning I have insisted that this was not a racial case. The city is ill-served by those who have sought to exploit it to divide the races and advance their own private agendas.''
Even at the beginning of the trial nearly eight weeks ago, prosecutors said they would have trouble getting a conviction on the top count because they would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, as Justice Galligan instructed the jury, that each of the defendants intended to kill the woman, even if not with his own hands.
Nevertheless, the verdict was regarded as a major victory for the prosecution, given that there was no physical evidence or eyewitnesses who placed the defendants at the scene of the attack.
''It was the confessions, only the confessions,'' said Michael Joseph, the lawyer for Mr. McCray.
Peter Rivera, the lawyer for Mr. Santana, said the verdict ''was a case of middle-class morality convicting the defendants even before they came to court.''
Howard Diller, the lawyer for Mr. Richardson, who will be tried this fall, said, ''I strongly believe that prosecution will learn from this trial and bring a much tighter case against us.''
The emotions of the trial are likely to linger far beyond the verdict. In much the same way that the stabbing of Kitty Genovese in 1964 in view of her neighbors came to symbolize the indifference of New Yorkers toward brutal crime, this case crystallized the helplessness many feel when teen-agers rampage down a city street, a subway train or a park road.
The viciousness of the attack on the jogger appalled blacks and whites alike. But even before the case went to trial, issues of racism that went far beyond the question of whether the rape was racially motivated were written indelibly into the case.
 
Scottsboro Boys Recalled
Early on, many blacks worried that angry whites would stigmatize all young black males. And many blacks said the defendants had been railroaded, likening them to the Scottsboro Boys, nine black youths who became a cause celebre after they were accused of raping a white Alabama woman.
Questions were raised about a double standard: had the crime against a white Salomon Brothers investment banker received media attention denied nonwhite rape victims?
Some blacks questioned the competence of the suspects' lawyers, two of whom were assigned by the court because the defendants could not afford private counsel. There were times when the examinations conducted by Mr. Burns, the lawyer for Mr. Salaam, seemed to help the prosecution as much as the defense.
The case, like the Bensonhurst and Howard Beach trials, where victims and attackers were of different races, also played a part in New York City's mayoral race.
 
'Boyfriend Did It'
The lengthy proceedings polarized a city still divided over Tawana Brawley and other racial cases. Outside the courtroom the small but well-publicized group of protesters who championed the defendants also vilified the victim, accusing her of being sexually promiscuous, questioning her reasons for being in the park on the night of the attack, and screaming, ''The boyfriend did it.''
Last night a leader of the protest, the Rev. Al Sharpton, said the convictions ''will inflame the city.''
Through it all, the anonymous presence of the jogger stood out in the complicated, noisome trial. Every detail of her long, arduous recovery - as well as her amnesia about the attack - was chronicled in the newspapers. Her 12-minute testimony was the emotional high point of the trial, but even her name, which most newspapers did not print, became a battleground. The Amsterdam News, a black-owned newspaper, defiantly published her identity, contending that she had been granted special consideration denied to teen-age suspects whose guilt had not yet been proved.
The jurors - four of them white, four black, three Hispanic and one Asian - deliberated for 10 days. They asked to review a great deal of the evidence and for written testimony read and reread. No detail seemed too minute; one request was for the testimony of a police officer who reported a small fire in Central Park the night of the attack.
In the end, they were apparently convinced that what the police said the three had confessed to was essentially true: that the jogger had been raped and hideously battered and that all three young men had helped do it.

HEADLINE: On Soviet Farms: Collective Indifference

SERIES: Soviet Food Crisis: Farms Without Farmers - First of two artilces.

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIKHEYEVO, U.S.S.R.

 BODY:
On a rainy day in late July, the Dawn Collective Farm resembles a hog wallow in which someone has planted discarded tractor parts, rusting sheds and weathered buildings, creating a powerful impression of gloom and neglect.
Along the muddy ruts that pass for roads, groups of men tinker with aging combines or stand about smoking, some of them red-eyed and sullen from the previous night's drinking. They wait with an air of indifference for enough sun to dry the sodden grain fields and let the harvest begin.
Outside the peeling administration cabin is an honor roll of top workers, like the one posted in every Soviet factory. The honorees include a mechanic, an engineer, a driver, a brigade leader and a cook. 
A visitor who has come looking for some understanding of why this resource-rich country cannot feed itself has just found a first clue: on the Dawn Collective Farm, there are no farmers.
''These people have long ago acquired the habit of working under someone else's command,'' said the farm chairman, Viktor A. Gulov, a newcomer here and a reformer. ''They are used to being told, 'It is time to go and plow, time to harvest, time to use the rakes.' And if nothing grows, it's not their responsibility.''
Mr. Gulov arrived at the Dawn Collective Farm in March determined to turn this indifferent proletariat into ''masters of the land.''
Like most reformers in the Soviet Union, he is frustrated from above by a rigid system that rations his fertilizer and gasoline, sets his prices, oversees the conformity of his management policies and then requisitions almost everything he produces - meat, milk, grain and potatoes.
But he contends the greater problem - and the one most in his power to combat - is below, the human factor, because no amount of economic liberty can feed the country unless there are willing farmers.
Probably no subject has consumed so much of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's time, or caused his economists so much chagrin, as the degeneration of Soviet farming.
Until the late 1920's, when forced collectivization transformed farming into a rural factory system, the nation was an exporter of wheat, rye, barley and oats.
Today, agriculture employs an astounding 19 percent of the Soviet workforce - in the United States, the figure is 2 percent - and absorbs 17 percent of all investment. Yet even in a good crop year like this one, the Soviet Union will import millions of tons of food, and still the populace will complain of hunger pangs.
 
Visit to Canadian Farms: Rebuke to Soviet System
 Mr. Gulov, who is 42 years old, comes to this problem as a missionary for a kind of farming that is alien to the Soviet system.
A big man with a square face and wavy hair, he grew up on a state farm on the southern steppes, but he would look at home at a fair in Iowa. He keeps Dale Carnegie self-improvement books on his shelf.
Fifteen years ago he read an account of farming in Canada - the northern latitude is not unlike Russia's farm belt - and it set off a rethinking that is still under way. Last year, Mr. Gulov was part of a small Soviet delegation to Canada where he found every day a rebuke to Soviet experience.
''When I was in Canada, I saw a 6-year-old boy, a farmer's son, who could drive a tractor,'' he says. ''The boy has his duties, he is paid, and he makes plans. By the time he is 14, he will be able to buy a car. He is already a farmer.
''Here we have lost the tradition. It's gotten so bad that in school they warn children: 'If you don't study hard, you will stay on the collective farm to work.' ''
When he was the director of a large collective farm near Rostov, in the richer south of Russia, Mr. Gulov applied his theories with great success. He reorganized the farm into a conglomerate of small, self-sufficient, profit-oriented teams, called cooperatives, a step in the evolution toward real farms.
 
When Fear Disappears, What Is the Stimulus?
 ''It's simple,'' he says. ''People need a reason to work. The reason can be fear, but fear is disappearing in this country. So you have to give them some other stimulus.''
In Rostov, they earned more money, but there was also the satisfaction and responsibility of stewardship.
The Rostov success got Mr. Gulov on the A-list of Soviet farm managers who get invited to Kremlin meetings where President Gorbachev, also from the southern steppes, conducts meetings on the dismal record of Soviet agriculture.
In March, forced to leave Rostov because of his son's allergic condition, Mr. Gulov settled here and set out to duplicate his experiment in tougher circumstances.
 
Different Territories; Far Different Attitudes
 In Rostov, where the climate is better and the Don Cossacks had a tradition of private farming, collectivization had not fully exterminated the will to farm. But here, 100 miles southwest of Moscow, where the Dawn Collective Farm occupies 20,000 acres, there is little history of commercial farming.
Before the collective farms were organized in 1929, it was mostly subsistence farming. Women tended the fields and cows while the men joined construction crews to bring in money. After collectivization, the workers were sharecroppers.
''We never farmed for money,'' said Mariya Ivanova, 64, as she put up salted pickles in her wooden house on the collective farm. ''We worked for shares.'' Those who have ambitions are often lured away to Moscow. Those who stay behind are mostly educated for rote, factory-style labor and not the complexities of modern farming.
Most have not finished high school. They work an 8-to-5 day, and line up at the pay window to collect their paychecks.
''Liquor and drinking are all they are interested in,'' Mr. Gulov lamented one evening, his optimism flagging a bit in the face of his labor material.
They are wary of change and cynical about reformers. Mr. Gulov, with his southern accent, his enthusiasms and promises, is the sixth chairman of the farm in 10 years, and no one interviewed during three days on the farm expected him to stick around long enough to make a great difference.
''He should have taken time to get the lay of the land,'' said one farm wife, waiting in line at the general store. ''Instead, from the first day he started to break things down. And people here had gotten used to doing things a certain way.''
 
A Welfare Community In a Rural Setting
 The Dawn Collective Farm is less a business than a cradle-to-grave welfare community. For its 186 workers and their families, the farm provides cheap housing, kindergarten, a cultural center and gardens.
The garden plots seem to get more attention than the communal lands, for the simple reason that they repay each family's labor with food. Private plots account for about 3 percent of Soviet farmland, but produce nearly a third of the country's meat, milk and vegetables. The communal lands provide a paycheck but there is nothing much to spend money on here.
A general store about 200 yards from the gate of the collective farm shows little evidence of being in a food-producing region. It stocks bread, canned beets, some salty cheese, soap, shovels and, for ration coupons, lump sugar. But no meat and no vegetables except a crate of tiny green tomatoes.
The farm residents make do with bicycles and motorscooters. The waiting list for a car is years long.
Most residents are without telephones. Even Mr. Gulov, when he wants to call Moscow, drives eight miles to the post office in Medyn, the regional center. The farm also supports 120 pensioners.
 
Too Many Distractions From Task of Farming
 As director, Mr. Gulov is responsible for obligations that in other societies are the business of local governments - road paving, telephone installation, kindergartens, entertainment. One morning, he was busy lobbying a state construction crew from the neighboring region to build 10 houses for farm families. The builders plead other priorities and a shortage of building materials. Mr. Gulov wheedles and jokes, but gets no commitment.
''I'm not a balletmaster,'' he snapped. ''Yet I am the one who is supposed to arrange for dance classes at the cultural center. It's absurd.''
To Mr. Gulov's mind, the fatal flaw of this collective life is the notion that everything is ''ours'' and thus belongs to no one.
During a drive across pastures, Mr. Gulov pointed out a deep gouge in a river bank where a careless, or tipsy, tractor driver toppled his vehicle down the slope. He shook his head in dismay as if to say, ''Imagine a farmer doing that if he owned the tractor!''
A visitor to a collective farm is likely to hear the same joke repeated to make the point about collectivization: ''Which is better, individual sex or group sex?'' the joke goes. ''Group sex, of course, because it leaves you time to goof off.''
 
Weaning Farm Members To Work on Their Own
 Mr. Gulov's scheme is to wean people from collectivization by breaking the farm into smaller units and giving workers more responsibility, edging toward real farming.
His first step here was to divide the farm into 14 cooperatives, some devoted to farming and others to support services such as equipment maintenance, fuel and veterinary services.
Later, he says, the cooperatives will evolve into a cluster of autonomous businesses. The farm bookkeeping office, for example, is to become a peasant bank, plugged into a new commercial banking system. His administration office will become a marketing agency and extension service.
One of the more radical changes he intends to spring on the collective farm is to cut the labor force in half by letting the women stay home, if they choose, to tend their children and the garden. Now they are legally obliged to hold jobs but they still end up doing the household chores after a full day's work.
The collective farm's property will be further subdivided into smaller farms, at first on a leased basis.
''We need 50 good farmers to have 50 farms,'' he said one night over coffee in the office of the local Communist Party boss, whose approval is essential for every move by the farm director.
''The remaining people can hire on as contract laborers, but they will have to perform or no one will need their services,'' he said.
''At the end of the first year, those who successfully managed the farm will be able to buy the land for a small price and become landowners.''
At this point the party chief, Vladimir P. Glushakov, loudly set down his coffee cup and interrupted: ''I disagree. The land cannot be turned into private property.''
The party leader, while generally in favor of Mr. Gulov's experiment, contends that the state must remain the ultimate owner, with power to give the land to the workers it deems most capable.
Mr. Gulov says that without the security of being an owner, no farmer will put money into improving the property.
''In Canada we met two brothers working on a farm,'' Mr. Gulov said. ''They produce twice as much wheat per acre as their neighbors. But nobody takes the neighbors' farm away from them.''
The party boss was insistent: ''Only those who can take care of the land must use it, not lazy bums.''
''What you suggest means living under the Sword of Damocles. Your land can be taken from you at any time,'' the reformer replied. ''The minister doesn't like you, and you lose your land. With your system, I do not want to become a farmer, because if anything happens - say Colorado beetles ruin my potatoes - then you can say I am a bad guy and I lose my farm.''
They argue good-naturedly for half an hour, and Mr. Gulov lets the party boss have the last word:
''From the point of view of morality and ethics, selling land is blasphemy,'' the party chief says. ''The land should not be treated as some prostitute who goes with the guy who pays the highest price.''
But later, in his truck heading home, Mr. Gulov is still fuming: ''Now you see why I say I need a lawyer for the farm.''
 
What the Workers Fear: Loss of Their Security
 Mr. Gulov's ideas encounter just as much reluctance from his workers as they do from the party.
Aleksei Yegorov, the farm electrician and overseer of the liverstock equipment, is one of Mr. Gulov's most trusted workers. The son of a local blacksmith, he has no interest in leaving the area. But he said that except for a few old-timers, everyone is apprehensive about the idea of owning a piece of land and farming it for profit.
''Let's say I buy land,'' he mused, as he and a visitor toured the repair sheds that are his domain. ''What am I going to grow on it? Where am I going to sell my crop? What kind of equipment am I going to need? It would be very hard to get started.
''When my father was still alive - he hoped one day to have his own land - maybe I would have gone into business with him. But now, you see, I'm a mechanic. I don't work the land. I'm 40 years old.''
He dreads even more the idea of having to venture into a market and sell. He has tried a few times with the meat and vegetables his family raises on their private plot, taking their produce to the city market. Now they sell their surpluses to a state organization.
''I'm used to the idea that I should not work for myself, but for the collective farm,'' he said. ''I'd have to forget all my experience to remake myself into something else.''
Sergei Dvukhsherstnov, 26, is chairman of one of Mr. Gulov's new cooperatives but he, too, seems uncertain.
He points to a huge combine that belongs now to his cooperative, bought on time from the collective farm. How much did it cost? He does not know. Nor does he know the price the state will pay this year for grain.
''In a year, he'll know those things,'' insists Mr. Gulov.
Much as he disparages the collective farm system, Mr. Gulov believes collectivization must endure for a while to ease new farmers toward independence.
 
An Independent Farmer Meets With Hostility
 A few miles up the road from the Dawn Collective Farm, in Medyn, Nikolai Fyedkin doubts seriously that collective farms will cooperate in their own demise. Mr. Fyedkin, the son of Siberian peasants who took up individual farming under the agrarian reforms of 1910, has been fighting to get started as a farmer on his own.
In June, on the strength of his 24 years experience on state farms, he finally got a collective farm to rent him 40 acres, a broken tractor and five cows. He salvaged and repaired a primitive mower and horse-drawn rake. But he says he has encountered constant resistance.
''They will never help me, because I am undermining the foundation they sit on,'' he said. ''They are just waiting for my project to fail.''
''They blame the problems of the collective farms on the farmers,'' he said. ''But many of the people are capable. All they need is property and some guarantees.''
Mr. Gulov admires dreamers and pioneers like Mr. Fyedkin who have set out to become family farmers in the Soviet Union - the newspapers frequently recount their duels with the incorrigible bureaucracy - but he believes the Soviet Union cannot leap from its state-run factory farms directly to a land of family farmers.
Even if some peasants are ready, Mr. Gulov says, the system is too obstructive for someone to fight it and find time to farm, too.
When Mr. Gulov needs extra hands to bring in the harvest, for example, he turns in time-honored fashion to the local party boss, who calls factory directors in surrounding cities to mobilize workers as temporary field hands. Who will turn out for Mr. Fyedkin?
When gasoline is scarce, as during this year's harvest, Mr. Gulov spends hours lobbying local officials, who in turn lobby Moscow for emergency deliveries. A farmer on his own, he says, would be out of luck.
''I have nothing bad to say about Fyedkin,'' Mr. Gulov said of the individualist up the road. ''But you have seen what I have to contend with. Who is going to tend Fyedkin's cows while he is doing battle with the bureaucrats?''

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Statement by Iraq's Social Ministry

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: NICOSIA, Cyprus, Aug. 18

 BODY:
Following is the text of a statement issued today by the Iraqi Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs about the treatment of foreigners in Iraq, as transmitted by the Iraqi press agency and translated by Reuters:
In the light of the decision taken by representatives of the Iraqi people and announced by the President of the National Assembly yesterday affirming that the people of Iraq are a peaceful people who want peace and reject wars and those calling for them, And as the Iraqis have committed no aggression against the West and have not harmed its legitimate interests, And as certain Western countries have adopted a hostile attitude toward the people of Iraq at the instigation of the United States of America without any justification, and the U.S.A. and those who cooperated with it are inciting war against Iraq in addition to occupying Arab land and Muslim holy shrines in Hejaz and Nejd, And as the presence of Western foreigners in Iraq may be one of the means for achieving peace and preventing aggression and war, thus making the American President and those allied with him reconsider his aggressive policy, The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs announces the following: 1. America and its allies have gone beyond an economic boycott, which in essence means a ban on commercial exchanges. They embarked on the implementation of an economic blockade by the force of arms against Iraq, including food and medicine, and this is an act of war under world norms and international law. 
This measure has led and will lead to a shortage in imported food, including milk for babies.
As the world's babies, irrespective of their nationalities, are God's beloved and the beloved of the leader Saddam Hussein, and in harmony with our humanitarian principles, we have decided to treat babies of foreign families that the people have decided to host fully equally with the babies of Iraq in determining their needs. Should there be a shortage in babies' milk, medicine and other requirements because of the boycott, then whatever shortages of food, medicine, clothes or anything else affecting the babies of Iraq will also affect them equally. 2. In view of the circumstances of the boycott and economic blockade imposed by the U.S.A. and its allies through pressure, armed force and in a unilateral manner on Iraq, it will not be possible to insure food for all adults in the manner we desire. Some Europeans, and the British people in particular, have passed through such an experience or something similar to it. Thus, they appreciate such circumstances and the measures necessary.
Accordingly, it is quite natural that priority be given, as far as the type and quantity of food are concerned, first to the armed forces, because they are the shield of the homeland and the people against aggression, and then to workers in plants, factories and administrations related to war operations. The others will have a different level of interest.
And as the foreigners in question will not be among those engaged in the armed forces or activities related to them, their share of the food, the quantity and type, will be affected along with that of other Iraqis by our imports of food in one way or another. 3. On the basis of No. 2 above and to insure the necessary level and quantity of food for foreigners and Iraqis, the right solution is to end the boycott that the United States imposed on Iraq and the economic blockade that Bush and his allies are engaged in imposing by force of arms and unilaterally on Iraq. And as an advanced and speedy measure, everything related to food, medicine and humanitarian materials and goods should not be boycotted.
We call on the families of foreigners in Iraq, those in solidarity with them, and humanitarian associations in the West and in the world to raise their voices in support of these noble, humanitarian aims.
May God's success be with those advocating peace and love and rejecting war and enmity.

HEADLINE: Trouble on the Range as Cattlemen Try to Throw Off Forest Boss's Reins

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TWIN FALLS, Idaho, Aug. 14

 BODY:
In the high sage and scrub forest of southern Idaho, a handful of cattlemen have squared off against a stubborn United States ranger in a battle over land, water and a way of life as old as the mythology of the American West.
At one point, the squabble nearly became a shooting war as armed Federal officials confronted a group of cowboys and accused them of violating lease restrictions as they grazed their herd in the Sawtooth National Forest.
This week, a rancher said he and the other men who run cattle on public land south of here are ready to ''cut the throat'' of Donald Oman, the district ranger, if the Government does not transfer him.
 
Grazing Rights at a Price
The outcome of this conflict between ranchers and a ranger could determine how far the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management are willing to go to enforce new grazing guidelines called ''Change on the Range'' for the 250 million acres of public land used by cattle and sheep owners and managed by those two agencies. The guidelines are intended to limit overgrazing and abusive land practices. 
For generations the Government has sold to cattlemen the right to graze their herds on public meadows and grasslands, seeking to encourage the ranch economy and protect the land at the same time. The leases include restrictions on how many cattle are allowed, which environmentally fragile areas must be fenced off and how water holes are to be protected.
Some rangers and other critics of the Government's policy say the fees are too low, the herds are degrading the national forest land and the restrictions are being routinely ignored by ranchers who use their political influence with Western senators to undercut efforts to enforce the rules.
The cattlemen say that they protect the range as best they can, and that when they slip up, they have usually been given the benefit of the doubt. Their view is that a few zealous supervisors led by Mr. Oman are threatening their way of life.
Mr. Oman has been with the Forest Service for 26 years, but it has only been in the last three years that he was assigned to the Sawtooth Forest, a heavily grazed area. The ranchers want him removed from the district, where 320,000 acres of national forest are under his supervision. Most of that acreage is used as grazing land by 30 ranchers, who hold permits to run about 7,000 cattle over the dry and hostile terrain.
''Either Oman is gone or he's going to have an accident,'' said Winslow Whitely, who has one of the biggest herds in the district. ''Myself and every other one of the permit holders would cut his throat if we could get him alone.''
 
'Yes, It's Intentional'
Asked if he was making a specific threat on the life of the district ranger, Mr. Whitely said, ''Yes, it's intentional. If they don't move him out of this district, we will.''
Mr. Oman said he was appalled at how heavy grazing has destroyed fragile grasslands, ripped up narrow streambeds and changed the natural character of much of the land. The ranchers are angry at him, he said, because he insists that they live up to the stewardship terms of their contracts, and because he has confronted those who have defied him.
''This land belongs to 250 million Americans, not just the guy with the cattle-grazing permit,'' the 46-year-old Mr. Oman said.
Late last year, the cattlemen contacted the office of Senator Steven Symms, Republican of Idaho, asking that Mr. Oman be transferred from the Sawtooth's Cassia District. After several meetings among Forest Service officials, aides of Senator Symms and the ranchers, it was agreed that Mr. Oman would be transferred, according to several people who attended the meetings.
But instead of accepting a transfer, Mr. Oman filed a whistle-blower's complaint with the Inspector General's office of the Agriculture Department, which operates the Forest Service. The whistle-blower law is intended to protect Federal employees who feel they are being harassed for speaking out about specific abuses.
Mr. Oman said he does not want to leave the district or get in a prolonged fight with his superiors. ''The Forest Service is my life,'' he said. ''I practically wear green shorts to bed with my badge on them.''
 
'No Plans' to Remove Ranger
This week, Agriculture Department officials said they had completed a lengthy investigation of Mr. Oman's complaint, but have not reached a decision on whether he will remain district ranger in southern Idaho.
''There are no plans to remove Don Oman at this time,'' said Wallace Shiverdecker, a Forest Service spokesman. His superiors declined to comment about Mr. Oman while a decision is pending.
Mr. Oman's complaints have underscored several major land issues that have long been a source of conflict in the West, where ranchers have been grazing cattle on public land for more than a hundred years.
More than half of the 250 million acres of Government land subject to livestock grazing is in poor condition from overuse and lax land management, according to a recent report by the National Wildlife Federation and the Natural Resource Defense Council. In the Sawtooth National Forest, a two-million-acre expanse that embraces the desert district in the south and the alpine country north of Sun Valley, 37 percent of the grazing land surveyed by the General Accounting Office in 1988 was found to be in poor condition.
The accounting office, the investigative arm of Congress, reported that cattle had overgrazed meadows and stripped streams of vegetation, leading to erosion and consequently making it more difficult to support fish and other wildlife.
But cattlemen say it is in their best interest to keep the land in good shape. And Randall Brewer, of the Idaho Cattle Association, said that only isolated areas had been badly damaged.
 
History of Catering to Ranchers
The Government study said the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management have a history of kowtowing to the cattle industry.
''There's an old saying in the Forest Service that if you cross a stockman, you can expect to be shipped to Siberia tomorrow,'' said Jim Prunty, who retired from the service two years ago and, now as a private citizen, is trying to document land abuses here.
''Don Oman was the first person ever to say no to these people and that's why he's in trouble,'' Mr. Prunty said. ''They may sacrifice him at the Forest Service, but what he's doing is right. The grazing practices on these lands are leaving a legacy of desertification and destruction.''
Mr. Oman said he is not opposed to cattle grazing in the national forests, but he has insisted that the ranchers do more to repair the land. In the last three years, he has issued citations, threatened to revoke permits and required ranchers to repair fences and watering holes.
To the ranchers, Mr. Oman's worst offense was an unannounced cattle count last fall, in which the ranger, accompanied by two armed Federal officials, surprised a group of cowboys who were running their herd through the forest. Mr. Oman said he needed armed support because the ranchers had threatened his life. The cattlemen accused him of using ''Gestapo tactics,'' and some of the men said the situation nearly ended in a shootout.
Mr. Oman said the count showed that the ranchers had more calves on public land than their contract allowed. The ranchers responded that a handful of extra animals had slipped through.
 
Curious Costs of Grazing
Economics is another bone of contention between cattlemen and managers of public land. The ranchers pay only $1.81 for one month of grazing for each thousand-pound animal. The rate represents one-fifth of private grazing costs, Government studies show.
By Mr. Whitely's estimates, he will make about $250 in profit for each cow. With a permit that allows him to graze 1,563 animals this year, he stands to make just under $400,000, assuming that every one of those cattle is eventually sold.
When Federal officials proposed changing the grazing rate in 1986, President Ronald Reagan issued an executive order that retained the cost formula. Last year, the Forest Service spent $34.5 million on its range management program, and took in only $10.9 million in grazing fees.
Asked why the money-losing grazing program has changed little over the years, Deen Boe, the Forest Service's deputy director for range management, said, ''It's a political thing. We deal with what we're given.''

HEADLINE: 'Council School' Offers Training to Hopefuls

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
In an era devoted to managing skills and behavior - where finishing schools and canine obedience schools exist near treatment centers for sex or food addicts - perhaps it was inevitable that New Yorkers would get a training program for City Council aspirants.
The $300, three-week program will offer classes on the city's political structure, fund-raising, speech-making and press management, and will be limited to 50 ''serious contenders'' for Council seats. The application deadline is Sept. 1 for a course that begins on Oct. 15.
Already, people are talking about the ''Council school.'' And even if it is perceived as a tad idealistic in a city with a wary electorate bitten hard by fiscal problems, racial tension and crime, it is also greeted as a nice try. 
 
Larger Talent Pool
''Anything that would encourage people to run for office is a good idea,'' said Council Speaker Peter Vallone. ''What makes this a particularly unusual election is that with the 16 new seats there is more chance than ever to level the playing field for newcomers. Usually, incumbents have the advantage.''
The Council, long considered the Rodney Dangerfield of local politics, ascended to the center of city government with the demise of the Board of Estimate last week.
Sixteen new Council seats have been added to handle the new responsibilities.
But just how eager ordinary New Yorkers are to negotiate the campaign trail, however, remains to be seen. Only six applications have been received by the La Guardia Public Life Training Center. David Fleischer, associate director for the center at the Bank Street College of Education, said there have been 350 requests for applications.
''With the 16 new Council seats under the charter revision there has to be a much greater talent pool that is drawn from for the Council to be effective,'' said Mr. Fleischer, a lawyer and former campaign manager for Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan.
''My belief is there are a lot of good, decent people out there who haven't given up on the city,'' Mr. Fleischer said. ''There are a lot of people who would run for office if they had the knowledge of how to do so.''
 
Scholarships Are Available
The nonpartisan center will disband after the course and will not endorse candidates. Its co-sponsors include the New York City League of Women Voters and the New York Public Interest Research Group. The idea for the center, Mr. Fleischer said, came from discussions with about 100 political pundits, elected officials and educators. Their search was for a vehicle to help people enter politics.
Mr. Fleischer said the center is particularly interested in helping gay, women, black or disabled candidates. The two-page course application asks for recommendations and references, campaign experience, two essays on why the applicant wants a Council seat, their community work and people who have shaped their thinking. Scholarships are available.
Trainees will be selected by a board that includes former Mayor John V. Lindsay, the former school board president, Robert Wagner Jr., and the president of the League of Women Voters, Laura Altschuler.
Teachers will include Fred Schwartz, chairman of the charter revision committee, and an assortment of economists, issue advocates, journalists and other specialists.
 
Seeing Council as Creative
''I think it's a perfect example of groups of people recognizing the significance of the new Council under charter,'' said Eric Lane, counsel to the charter commission. ''I think it's an excellent idea.''
''If it's motivational, if it's creates interest, if it creates information about the government it's very useful,'' Mr. Lane said of the center. ''If 50 percent of what is intended gets done, that's good.''

HEADLINE: Homeless Man Is Indicted in Rutgers Fires

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., Aug. 18

 BODY:
An unemployed homeless man has been indicted on charges of setting fires at three fraternity houses and two private residences near the Rutgers University campus here.
The Middlesex County Prosecutor, Alan Rockoff, announced Friday that a grand jury had returned a five-count indictment on Wednesday against the man, Brian Keith, 33 years old. 
Mr. Keith was arrested on June 19 on charges of setting the fires the previous night. There were no injuries.
If convicted, Mr. Keith, who was being held at the Middlesex County Adult Correction Center in North Brunswick, faces a 20-year prison term and fines up to $100,000 for each aggravated arson count against him, Mr. Rockoff said.
He declined to discuss a possible motive for the fires.
Fires that burned through the three fraternity houses and two private homes on June 18 left 35 Phi Gamma Delta brothers without living quarters.
Damage to the private homes and the other fraternity houses was minimal, but the first-floor of the Phi Gamma Delta house was gutted.
Mr. Rockoff said Mr. Keith last worked at Revlon Inc., in Edison, about a year ago and was one of 14 tenants housed at a motel there by the Middlesex County Board of Social Services.

A Condo Project Strikes the Fancy Of Many Parents

DATELINE: BETHLEHEM, Pa.

 BODY:
Harold K. Tish said he knew that his University Square condominium project was going to be a success when he received a letter from a Lehigh University alumnus living on a remote island in the South Pacific. The alumnus, Thomas A. Bayer, was interested in buying a condominium for his daughter, Melissa, an incoming freshman at Lehigh.
''Here's a guy a world away who is interested in University Square,'' Mr. Tish said.
To bolster the local economy and to expand student housing options, Lehigh has been advising Mr. Tish on his project, which enables parents of Lehigh students to buy condominiums for their children and to realize tax advantages and, perhaps, a capital gain on an eventual sale. 
University Square is being promoted by the university's housing office, and the condos have been advertised in the campus newspaper and Lehigh's alumni magazine.
Mr. Tish said his $2 million project not only offers 14 two-bedroom condominiums, for between $85,000 and $90,000, but also includes offices and retail outlets.
 
Still Recovering From Slump
''This is the only mixed-use, upscale project of its kind in our area,'' said Mr. Tish, a real-estate developer from central New Jersey who moved to Bethlehem this year.
University Square, Mr. Tish predicted, will serve as a catalyst for other business ventures in South Bethlehem. The local economy has been slow to recover from the slump of the early 1980's that forced thousands of layoffs at the community's lifeblood, the Bethlehem Steel Corporation.
Many of the local businesses rely on Lehigh's 7,000 students to survive.
''This campus isn't busy just during the school year. It hops 12 months of the year,'' said Barbara Kreppel, Lehigh's director of auxiliary services. ''And there's a lot of opportunities to forge business-university partnerships.''
In 1988, when Mr. Tish first bought the half-acre property on the campus's main business strip, his idea was to market condominiums exclusively to the parents of students. But by the time the units were completed and ready for sale last November, Mr. Tish had received inquiries from a wide range of prospective buyers - from Lehigh employees to alumni. Tax Write-Offs, Anyone? Mr. Tish said parents who buy the condominiums can write offs mortgage interest and the monthly $64 maintenance fee. Since each unit can house up to four students, parents can also hire their sons or daughters as managers of the unit, paying them to collect rents, a salary that can be written off as a business expense, Mr. Tish said.
Half of the 14 units have been sold so far: 4 to students or their parents, 2 to alumni and 1 to a university employee. Mr. Tish said since none of the purchased units have been put up for sale, it is difficult to determine their resale value.
The units, equipped with washers, dryers and dishwashers, are housed in two red and dark green stone buildings.
Owen and Rose Carlin of Mendham Township, N.J., bought a unit last fall after their son, Thomas, a sophomore at the time, was unable to get on-campus housing through a lottery system.
''Our feeling was that it was certainly a break-even situation,'' said Mr. Owen, a retired chemical engineer. ''We figured we would save on housing costs for two years and then after our son graduated, we might realize a capital gain.''
Ms. Kreppel said working with Mr. Tish is part of an initiative by Lehigh to help continue South Bethlehem's renaissance, which has an active merchants' association.
Ms. Kreppel worked with Mr. Tish in luring business tenants to University Square. The new tenants included a travel agency and a printing company that have large contracts with Lehigh. A bank has also signed a lease.
''We're currently talking to a bagel company to rent space,'' Ms. Kreppel said. ''If we've had one outstanding request from students, it's to have a bagel shop on campus.''

HEADLINE: POP VIEW;
Anglo-American Music And a World Attuned

BYLINE: By John Rockwell

 BODY:
If the arts are mankind's mirror, then international popular music may be a reflection of international politics and economics. Or so I brooded recently in Hamburg, West Germany, listening to the music on a restaurant sound system. The fare consisted of a nonstop onslaught of English and American pop hits, not a German among them.
At the same time, the hippest thing in Manhattan is West African and Brazilian bands at S.O.B.'s, Kilimanjaro or the Beacon Theater. There is a powerful crosscurrent at work in the pop world today, as third-world and European musicians synthesize Anglo-American stylistic signatures with their own language and musical traditions. 
What is trendy today may well be massively popular tomorrow, presaging a reversal in the mainstream's flow. Such shifts not only reflect larger patterns in the relationship of the industrialized West to the rest of the world, but also suggest that third-world pop musicians may have hit upon what made Anglo-American pop so powerful in the first place.
What shapes musical fashion? One argument is that with the eruption of energy in the 1950's and 60's that defined modern popular music, something so potent was born of the blend of American black music, American and English white folk music and electronic amplification that it swept the world like an irresistible tide.
That potency was part esthetic - no one had heard anything like this before - but the music's power was also moral and political. It represented a liberation from constraint, an assertion of self. And as much as repressed American teen-agers in the 50's and idealistic world-changers in the 60's felt that extramusical impact, so do Eastern Europeans and Chinese and South Americans feel it today.
But there is a more cynical analysis to explain the domination of Anglo-American pop over the last generation. By that theory, American rock owes its success to marketing muscle: it is popular not because of intrinsic worth but because record companies, tour promoters and radio stations united monopolistically to drive out the competition, both economic and stylistic.
My own view, born of the belief that capitalism reflects genuine consumer desires, is that these interpretations are by no means antithetical. Even if Anglo-American rock has been artificially reinforced, the fact remains that it is indeed popular, and exerts an enormous impact worldwide. Last week, according to Billboard magazine, the top ''pan-European'' singles artist was M. C. Hammer and the top album seller was New Kids on the Block.
But if the domination were so complete, American trend-setters would not be doting on the likes of Salif Keita of Mali, Youssou N'Dour of Senegal and Milton Nascimento of Brazil. Especially outside Western Europe, indigenous folk styles and hybrid forms of electrified pop have been flourishing all along. If Anglo-American cultural capitalism were as all-powerful as some fear, it would have squelched such competition long ago. Now, capitalists are looking for ways to exploit the competition.
Instead of repressing indigenous talent, Anglo-American pop has encouraged it. What we are now seeing is the flowering of a generation of non-English-speaking pop stars who have adapted local languages and folk idioms to Anglo-American musical styles, above all electric guitars and a rock-solid beat. They have fashioned danceable, impassioned syntheses that are doubling back to influence English-language pop.
This all corresponds to larger patterns of post-imperialist politics and economics. English is the language of international politics and finance, and many world leaders wear Western-style suits, fly in Western airplanes and stay in Western-style, if not Western-owned, luxury hotels.
In popular music, however, English cannot dominate to the same degree that it does in diplomacy and finance. That is partly because it is a demotic art, appealing to the masses. Language binds a culture together: popular musicians use the native language as a political act - just as German composers did in the early 19th century, rejecting the bondage implied by composing their operas in the then-international musical language of Italian. The international popularity of Italian opera or pop songs in English or, now, songs in Zulu or Senegalese ultimately attests to the dominating power of music over words.
Thus popular music today has become a crossfire of conflicting, stimulating international and national influences, particularly in this era of rampant nationalist pride. Anglo-American rock and dance music remain ubiquitous because they are still esthetically effective and perceived as trendy - emblems of the good life to the rest of the world.
But increasingly, native-born, native-speaking pop stars have arisen throughout the world, speaking colloquially to their countrymen and often providing political and moral models in the same manner as American and English pop icons of the 60's. The singer and composer Fela Anikalupo Kuti, so popular that he talked of running for president of Nigeria, and the late reggae singer Bob Marley, almost assassinated as part of Jamaica's bitter political polemics, are but two examples.
That moral urgency, apart from the timbral allure of exotic trappings, may be the underlying reason for the success of so many third-world bands among American taste-makers. These are musicians who don't just offer something piquant to a jaded musical palate. They sing and play with a fervor born partly of raw talent and partly of excited ambition. But their intensity also owes something to an extramusical aura that has eluded too many Anglo-American pop stars of the 1980's, co-opted by the very marketing forces that won them international stardom in the first place.

Today's Yellow Brick Road Leads Straight to Hell

BYLINE: By CARYN JAMES

 BODY:
Sailor and Lula, the strangely sympathetic misfits in David Lynch's ''Wild at Heart,'' drive a big old convertible from Cape Fear, N.C., through New Orleans and on to Big Tuna, Tex. They are preoccupied with making love and steering clear of the law, but they always keep an eye on the yellow brick road.
''Too bad he can't just visit that old Wizard of Oz and get some advice,'' Sailor says sincerely when Lula tells about her cousin Dell -a Lynchian creature who doesn't need a heart or brain or courage, just the sense to stop putting cockroaches in his pants.
Where Dorothy tells Toto, ''I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore,'' Lula cruising down the highway and crossing state lines also knows a turning point when she sees one. Smoking a cigarette, snapping her gum and letting her long blond hair fly in the breeze, she tells Sailor, ''I guess you broke parole now.'' 
And when they land in dusty little Big Tuna, the lovers sense they can't outrun their bad luck anymore. ''I know it ain't exactly the Emerald City,'' says Sailor, and soon Lula has to admit, ''Seems we sort of broke down on the yellow brick road.''
A violent story of romance on the run, ''Wild at Heart'' both idolizes and undermines the most beloved of all road movies and points to a new twist in the genre. Though few do so as blatantly as Mr. Lynch, some of today's most astute and talented directors have also created road movies that subvert the classic route to Oz. Their films reflect contemporary struggles against crime, violence and unemployment, yet they are unwilling to surrender the dreams of freedom and happiness the road has traditionally represented.
Films like ''The Wizard of Oz'' (1939) and Preston Sturges's ''Sullivan's Travels'' (1941) defined the standard pattern for road movies: whether the hero was a scarecrow or a rich film director bumming cross-country during the Depression, characters traveled through danger and disillusionment to healthy self-knowledge and back to the safety of home. They followed an optimistic course as old as the American West and as deeply entrenched in our culture as Whitman's ''Song of the Open Road.''
But today's best road movies are bizarre, comic, one-way journeys to the dark side of self and society. ''Wild at Heart'' and Jonathan Demme's ''Something Wild'' portray the road as a lurid, chaotic, criminal place where characters discover their worst nightmares come true. In Jim Jarmusch's ''Stranger Than Paradise'' and in the young Finnish director Aki Kaurismaki's current ''Ariel'' (strongly influenced by American movies), the road is a bleak and grimy landscape where hapless, unimaginative heroes seek out small grains of luck or love. These roads are fraught with dangers more real than flying monkeys; botched robberies, prison cells and even death are surprisingly common.
On one level, such films are the cultural descendants of cynical 60's road movies like ''Bonnie and Clyde'' and ''Easy Rider,'' stories of thwarted freedom that sharply defined the distance between respectable, law-abiding society and the rebellious counterculture at its height. The lawless heroes of ''Bonnie and Clyde'' and ''Easy Rider'' were symbolic free spirits, and the fact that they were ultimately destroyed only made these films more of a rallying cry against social conservatism.
But the new road movies are more ambivalent. They often have forced happy endings, which suggest a nostalgic longing for the road to Oz even while the film's surface depicts a broken-down society. And their humor offsets the characters' fear of a journey into the metaphorical darkness of the open road and of their own hearts.
In ''Wild at Heart,'' all the references to ''The Wizard of Oz'' -including Lula's wicked mother riding through the sky on a broomstick and Glinda the Good Witch descending to earth in a bubble - are Mr. Lynch's additions to the spare, realistic novel by Barry Gifford on which the movie is based. But even without that obvious motif, ''Wild at Heart'' would be a pure example of the new, subversive road movie.
As they run from Lula's disapproving mother, who has put a private detective and a hired killer on their trail, Sailor and Lula (Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern) experience an ominous sense of death on the road. The radio news is full of reports of necrophilia and crocodiles eating corpses in the Ganges. They pull over to a roadside accident and see a young woman die before their eyes. Yet when they run out of money in Big Tuna, Sailor leaves their shabby motel room to take part in a robbery that he says will give them enough cash to go ''far down the yellow brick road.'' The road, yellow brick or otherwise, still represents a bright future, against all the harsh evidence. And the robbery, one of the most violent scenes in recent movies, only proves how misguided Sailor's hopes have been.
Like Mr. Lynch's films, especially ''Blue Velvet,'' Jonathan Demme's are also marked by a strong sense of the texture of American life. Even more than Mr. Lynch, he finds America on the road. In ''Melvin and Howard,'' Melvin Dummar drives along in his pickup truck and stops for a straggly old man who claims to be Howard Hughes. This is the basis for the classic Demme scene in which Melvin and Howard bump along the road in the pickup singing one of Melvin's original songs, ''Santa's Souped-Up Sleigh.''
But Mr. Demme's sense of the road is at its most astute and vibrant in ''Something Wild.'' Like Lula in ''Wild at Heart,'' Lulu in ''Something Wild'' is Dorothy turned inside out, hellbent on leaving home and finding sexual adventure on the road. When Lulu (Melanie Griffith) kidnaps Charlie, the buttoned-down businessman played by Jeff Daniels, she takes him from New York to Pennsylvania along the kitschy roads of small-town America. In a motel room, she handcuffs him to a bed and wildly distracts him while forcing him to talk to his boss on the phone.
She crashes her old green convertible into a flashing sign that reads: ''Whoa! You just passed the best scrapple in Penna.'' They travel along a road filled with liquor stores, signs for real-estate companies, used-car dealers and gas stations with convenience stores that sell drinks, baseball caps and souvenir T-shirts that read ''Virginia is for lovers.'' This witty, cluttered, tacky route redefines the idea of the romantic, wide-open road.
And just when Lulu seems transformed into a girl with an All-American past, her criminal ex-husband appears. Soon Charlie is implicated in an armed robbery, is forced to confront his own uneasy attraction to Lulu's disreputable life, and finally engages in a violent confrontation with the ex-husband. ''Something Wild'' suggests that being dragged onto the road frees Charlie from his repressive, unnhappy past. But the upbeat ending is undermined by the film's dark and violent episodes.
There is nothing so violent in Jim Jarmusch's genial films. For him, the road is not sinister; it is merely banal. In Mr. Jarmusch's brilliant and unpretentious deadpan style, ''Stranger Than Paradise'' overturns the classic image of America as a boundless paradise and an Eden for immigrants. When a young woman named Eva travels from Budapest to live with her aunt in Cleveland, she stops in New York and stays with her cousin Willie. For her, New York is the inside of Willie's shabby apartment.
And the rest of America seems just as cramped. When Willie and his friend Eddie - both small-time gamblers in slouchy hats - drive to visit Eva, the road to Cleveland evokes a slushy industrial landscape that seems especially stark in the film's black-and-white photography. Finally Eddie realizes, ''It's funny. You come someplace new and everything looks just the same.''
Aiming for adventure, the trio heads to Florida, where Eva is left in a tiny motel room while Willie and Eddie go to the race track. Except for the weather (''Now we look like real tourists,'' Willie says after he buys everyone sunglasses), they might as well be in Cleveland.
This low-key comic approach to life on the road - the road to limited possibilities - also informs Mr. Jarmusch's ''Down by Law,'' in which three men find themselves in a shared jail cell where they dance around and sing, ''I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream.'' They escape to become fugitive companions in the Louisiana bayou. Except for the trees, they might as well be in Cleveland, too. And as the hero of Mr. Kaurismaki's ''Ariel'' drives a Cadillac convertible through the snowy landscape from Lapland to Helsinki, it looks like all roads lead to Cleveland. ''Ariel'' features a landscape as bleak as Mr. Jarmusch's and an unemployed hero named Taisto, who is even more bereft of imagination than Willie and Eddie.
Though Mr. Kaurismaki has been compared to Mr. Jarmusch, his sense of the road is both more dangerous and more hopeful. Almost at once, Taisto is robbed of all his money at a hamburger stand. Later, his luck changes when a meter maid who is about to write him a ticket falls in love with him instead. Yet other twists of bad luck follow a pattern typical of the subversive road movie: prison, an escape, a bank robbery and eventually a murder in self-defense. Along with the meter maid and her son, he escapes on a cargo ship called Ariel, which will take them to Mexico, while ''Somewhere Over the Rainbow'' in Finnish is sung in the background. As in ''Wild at Heart,'' this pointed reference suggests how far film makers have come from ''The Wizard of Oz,'' even while the song acknowledges the movie's tenacious hold on our imaginations.
In fact, the ending of ''Wild at Heart'' may be the best expression of how deeply Oz has shaped the contemporary road movie. Without revealing the film's ending, it is possible to say that it is more upbeat than the one in Mr. Gifford's novel and that it involves Glinda, who tells Sailor, ''If you're truly wild at heart you'll fight for your dreams.'' The creators of today's road movies recognize that the road leads to the nightmarish wilds of society and of their characters' own hearts. But in their films' happy endings, they fight for the persistent hope that the road still leads to a place where dreams come true.
It is a dream that wrestles with reality and with other kinds of road movies. In some films the road remains a simple convenience, as in ''Rainman,'' where it allows Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman to be isolated together; the road and the landscape are mere backdrops. But in the Australian trilogy ''Mad Max,'' ''The Road Warrior'' and ''Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome,'' the road is a post-apocalyptic battleground for survival; civilization has virtually crumbled; cars have become weapons for futuristic gladiators, and gasoline is a commodity worth killing for. It is a cartoonish version of the journey to self and society, but one that is in tune with the new, subversive road movie.
It is easy to imagine ''Somewhere Over the Rainbow'' as a heavily ironic comment on Mad Max's adventures, easy to see how far film makers have come from the road to Oz.

In the Brazilian Jungle They Have a Story to Tell

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: BELEM, Brazil

 BODY:
Working in the jungle one degree south of the Equator, the heat on the set repeatedly hit 108 degrees. At dusk, tropical downpours washed out key shots day after day. Exotic ailments felled several of Hollywood's finest. During one week of night shooting, the call sheet warned actors of ''insects and crawly things around the set.''
Finally, the actor Tom Waits rose up one evening from the torpor of the Hotel Anaconda bar. Wild-eyed and disheveled, he angrily confronted Hector Babenco, the film's Argentine director.
''Don't jerk us around!'' the perspiring Mr. Waits ranted. ''We're American citizens! You got that? American citizens!'' 
Mr. Babenco, suppressing a smirk, replied in broken English: ''Please - complain it to your American Embassy. Use my radio - no charge.''
In the humid blur of the Amazon, it was not a revolt on the set, but practice for a scene of a movie version of Peter Matthiessen's 1965 novel, ''At Play in the Fields of the Lord,'' which is now being shot in the Brazilian jungle.
The script features Indians, missionaries, gold miners and ''developers of the forest.'' But the assemblage of acting, writing, directing and producing talent guarantees that this will not be a rain forest quickie.
The screenplay is by Mr. Babenco and Jean-Claude Carriere, who also wrote the screenplays for ''The Unbearable Lightness of Being'' and for a number of Luis Bunuel's later movies.
Mr. Babenco, who is currently Latin America's most prominent director, also directed ''Pixote,'' ''Kiss of the Spider Woman'' and ''Ironweed.'' The producer is Saul Zaentz, who also produced ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,'' ''Amadeus'' and ''Unbearable Lightness.''
The cast includes the largest collection of North American acting talent seen in South America in many years: Kathy Bates, Tom Berenger, Daryl Hannah, John Lithgow, Aidan Quinn and Mr. Waits.
''A film like this comes along once every 10 years,'' said Ms. Hannah, who plays a missionary's wife. ''Very few films really have the intention of being something. When you get an offer like this, you jump at it.''
From another side of the Belem Hilton swimming pool, Mr. Lithgow, who plays Ms. Hannah's intolerant missionary husband, said: ''The film is about the collision of cultures, the destruction of one culture by another. These are mighty issues to grapple with. These are people who make serious films.''
The movie is set in Mae de Deus, an imaginary Amazonian river town that represents a sordid end of the line for ''Western civilization.'' Upriver are the Niaruna Indians, inhabiting a universe still undisturbed after five centuries of European colonization of the continent. Enter two American missionary couples bent on converting the heathen. Enter two American soldiers of fortune (Mr. Waits and Mr. Berenger) who lose their way in the forest and land their 1957 Beaver DeHavilland on the town's grassy airstrip. Painted on one side of the fuselage is the duo's business card: ''Small Wars & Demolition.''
Playing the Americans off against one another, an unscrupulous Brazilian police chief (Jose Dumont) is willing to use either American Bibles or American bombs to open the Niaruna area up to ''progress,'' in the form of ranchers and gold prospectors.
But a bombing mission goes awry when one of the mercenaries (Mr. Berenger) resuscitates his Cheyenne Indian roots. He literally bails out of the Western world and joins the Niaruna.
In interviews in Belem and on the jungle set, Mr. Babenco and the actors bridled at suggestions that ''Fields of the Lord'' might represent the latest twist on a long-running Hollywood formula for success: set dramas involving first-world protagonists against third-world backdrops. (Examples of the genre might include ''Missing'' and ''Out of Africa.'') ''This is not going to be a velvet painting for white people and their problems,'' growled Mr. Waits, a blues singer who can be as wild-eyed and disheveled off the set as on.
In his 11th-floor hotel suite overlooking this river port, Mr. Babenco, who was born in Argentina but has lived in Brazil for the last 18 years, echoed that conviction. ''The Indians are the most important part of the movie,'' he said. ''The Indians are not an excuse for the Anglo-Saxons to do their thing.'' As if to underline the point, he had decorated two walls of his suite - home for the six months of filming - with a collage of color photographs of aboriginal peoples from the Amazon to Africa.
''These human beings live in perfect harmony with the environment; they are the real keepers of the forest,'' the director said. ''Then we white people tell them how great our civilization is, how great our God is. The transparent universe is broken.''
Except for scenes on an American Indian reservation and at Venezuela's Angel Falls, ''Fields'' is being shot in Brazil. One third of the movie will be filmed at an Indian ''maloca'' or traditional style thatch-roofed roundhouse that has been built in theforest, 30 minutes by boat up the Guama River from here. Unwilling to be ''a character of their cultural destruction,'' Mr. Babenco has refused to film in a real Indian village. To cast the Niurana, a mythical tribe, the director assembled 140 Indians from ranches and roadsides all over the Amazon.
''They don't speak Portuguese; they don't even know what a movie is,'' the director said.
A talent scout found one protagonist, Samuel Karaja, a Bororo Indian, lying intoxicated on a bench at the Brasilia bus station. Mr. Karaja, will play Aeore, a Niurana warrior who favors murdering the missionaries.
''It's the most perverse and contemptible way of destroying a civilization - and it has been happening since the 15th century,'' Mr. Babenco said, recalling a visit last year to a Yanomami Indian village in the northern Amazon that had fallen under the tutelage of a Protestant mission.
Down by the hotel swimming pool, Mr. Waits, who plays the mercenary Wolf, had a blunter view of the catechizing zeal of the Amazon's missionaries. ''The missionaries get into the hearts and minds of Indians through Bic lighters and Johnnie Walker scotch,'' he charged in a gravelly voice. ''I don't understand people who feel compelled to shove their religion down other people's throats. It's like painting a fence. You don't want to miss a spot, or else God will get mad.''
On film, Mr. Berenger in the role of Moon, the half-Cheyenne adventurer, will demand of a missionary, played by Aidan Quinn: ''If the Lord made Indians the way they are, who are you people to want them different?''
Symbolizing the double threat to the Indians, the film's logo shows a lone tribesman aiming an arrow at an airplane. ''The Indian shoots an arrow in the direction of the plane, which casts a shadow in the shape of a cross,'' reads the script. ''The arrow flies up into the air and falls again. The Indian shouts at the plane - without being heard.''
Ms. Bates plays Hazel Quarrier, a missionary wife. ''We are not doing a putdown of Christianity or of missionaries, who, rightly or wrongly, have given a lot of their lives,'' she said. At one point in the script, Mrs. Quarrier teaches the Indian children to sing in Niurana, ''Jesus Wants Me for a Sunbeam.''
In this aging river port, long the gateway to the Amazon, members of the local missionary community have expressed their disapproval of the film project, but ecclesiastical objections are the least of the obstacles facing ''At Play in the Fields of the Lord.''
Ever since reading the novel a quarter of a century ago, Mr. Zaentz has wanted to produce a film version. But Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer refused to sell or act on the film rights. ''Every time a new management came in at M-G-M, they were insecure,'' said Mr. Zaentz, who is 69 years old, over lunch at a Japanese restaurant, a favorite with non-Portuguese-speaking members of the crew because of its picture menus.
Finally, a deal was struck in 1988, and Mr. Zaentz bought the rights. By that time, copies of Mr. Matthiessen's book were scarce. The copy the producer finally obtained for Mr. Babenco bore the stamp ''San Antonio Public Library.''
The screenplay was written in close collaboration with Mr. Matthiessen, who is expected to visit the set in October.
Filming in this locale has proved no easy task. Clovis Bueno, the Brazilian production designer, searched the Brazilian Amazon for three months for a village that could serve as Mae de Deus. He finally gave up and decided to construct an artificially somnolent village at the edge of a rubber plantation owned by the local affiliate of the Pirelli tire company. The only rent demanded by Pirelli was the removal of a barge loaded with tropical timber that had sunk, blocking a waterway. The barge was removed.
Scouting around Belem for bona fide shack material, Mr. Bueno found some slum residents who were moving into new public housing. Offers of $100 cash for each shack were snapped up. ''They adored it; it turned into a big party,'' Mr. Bueno recalled of the slum-dismantling project. Where new planks were needed, instant aging was accomplished with acid baths, sand blasting and blow torches. The result is convincing, down to the rotting dugout canoes converted into herb planters.
The Amazon town is so convincing that the Pirelli manager has asked the film makers to tear down the set after filming. He is afraid that squatters will move in after Hollywood moves out.
Set on a fork of the Guama, an Amazonian tributary, the site was too marshy for a landing strip. A boardwalk runway had to be built of piles, railway ties and dirt.
While the film's producers were engrossed in the art of producing artificial languor and decay, the outside world intruded. On March 15, Fernando Collor de Mello was inaugurated as President of Brazil. To cool Brazil's 85 percent monthly inflation rate, he immediately froze virtually all bank accounts over $1,200 for 18 months.
''We had $250,000 frozen,'' said Paul Zaentz, the associate producer and a nephew of the producer, making a nasty face. Gyrations in the cruzeiro-dollar exchange rate added more costs, pushing the total budget from $24 million to $28 million.
While the cast and crew of 290 people became frequent flyers on Varig airline's weekly Miami-to-Belem air hop, the film's transportation fleet here swelled to include 2 airplanes, 2 helicopters, 10 boats and 39 cars. ''We have everything that people avoid in movies - tides, boats, airplanes, children,'' said Paul Zaentz. To film at the Indian village and at the mission site, the production will house the crew on a cruise ship which will be anchored one and a half hours upriver from Belem.
Local conditions present local solutions. ''The 'bug wrangler' is a specialist who searches the set for scorpions, snakes and tarantulas - and takes them away,'' said Paul Zaentz in the safety of the Hilton cafeteria. Another job of the bug wrangler will be to drug a butterfly so a missionary child, played by Niilo Kivirinta, will be able to catch it. Locals suggested mixing rum with pineapple to slow down the butterfly.
''We are one degree off the Equator,'' said Chris Newman, the sound recorder, describing a new set of problems. ''All day long the sun is directly overhead, then at 6 P.M., it drops like a stone. If you put a mike on an overhead boom, it casts a shadow. If you put mikes on the actors, they sweat into them and the mikes have to be replaced.''
To further complicate making the soundtrack, jungle background noises constantly change - frogs, cicadas and diesel-engine fishing boats. Said Mr. Newman: ''When you cut all that together, you have to make it believable.''
Although the actors have their own trailers on the set, most major players have been briefly laid low by a variety of ailments - dehydration, diarrhea, voice loss and bacterial blood poisoning.
Fortunately, most angry passions have been restricted to the script. Several players attributed this to the calming influence exercised by Saul Zaentz, a bearish, bearded man who is quietly determined to shepherd his 25-year-old dream into film. If all goes well, filming will conclude in November and the film will be in American movie houses by the end of the summer of 1991.
''Last night, Saul showed us how to play hearts,'' said Ms. Bates. ''You usually associate producers with suits with hovering. You can see the meters running in their eyes.''
Citing his close working relationship with the producer, Mr. Babenco said: ''It was only after five weeks of shooting that I got around to signing the director's contract. We had never discussed money or time.''

Now, a Real Vixen. That's Plausible Casting

BYLINE: By Donal Henahan

 BODY:
I'm sure many thoughtful people were upset recently by the Actors' Equity decision to refuse permission for an Englishman to portray a Eurasian pimp in an American production of the musical ''Miss Saigon.'' The issue of artistic freedom, after all, does arouse emotions in the hearts of almost every American, and rightly so. But I suspect I also speak for a sizable minority of theatergoers, and specifically operagoers, in fully supporting the action of the American actors' union. It is about time some action of this sort was taken.
We - if I may presume to speak for this side of the question - have long borne opera's obsession with disguises, makeup, charades and illusions of all sorts. Why? Because commentators have insisted for nearly 400 years that without illusion opera could not exist. Nobody, so the rationale goes, would leave the comfort of hearth and television set to attend an opera unless lured by these childish devices. Truth, we were told, simply does not work in opera. Why else would there be such an emphasis on rouge, masks and dim lighting? Such is the low estimate of the operagoer held by virtually everyone in the opera business. 
Now, however, buoyed by the liberating action by the actors' union, I feel free to call for realism in the musical theater. Realism and, of course, democracy. Opera has never been an equal opportunity employer, but the way to that goal may now be open. Here are a few suggestions for change, not all of which will be immediately realizable, I know, considering opera's infamous reluctance to move with the times.
Everyone agrees that it is no longer tolerable that the leading characters in ''Aida,'' ''Otello'' and ''Madama Butterfly'' be sung by heavily made-up imposters. For too long, these roles have been assigned on the basis of vocal suitability and availability, or in some instances artistic talent. The need for a change here is too obvious to belabor.
But what about the Turks in ''The Abduction From the Seraglio'' and the Arabs in ''The Italian Girl in Algiers''? How can opera producers go on insisting that these works need to be staged even if ethnically plausible singers are not available? In fact, isn't it clear that such alleged comedies about Western dominance over the ''lesser breeds without the law'' ought to be withdrawn from circulation?
Discrimination in opera is rarely subtle. Although Verdi's music shows some sympathy for Falstaff, it is common staging practice to depict him as a vulgar, womanizing fatso. All right, if that is what the director believes the public wants, but must the role be awarded almost every time to someone who needs stomach padding and a false red nose? Is it possible there are no naturally portly men or women out there willing to portray Falstaff? (I mention women in this context because it is easy to overlook the feminist aspect to this question - the recent triumph of a female ''King Lear'' reminds us how shortsighted and biased most theatrical directors still are.) In the interests of realism, opera certainly must abandon the ridiculous convention of the travesty role, which in works like ''Der Rosenkavalier'' and ''The Marriage of Figaro'' forces women to dress up like men and pretend to make love to other women. This is matched in decadence only by the mirror-image convention that allows men to parade around in female costumes in those same works.
I am not sure what stand to take on another affront to realism, the widespread practice of assigning castrato roles to women in ''Orfeo'' and similar Baroque works. There may not be enough unemployed castratos around nowadays to fill these parts, but if that is true it would be a good argument for dropping Baroque operas from the repertory until the shortage has been remedied, preferably not by the traditional methods.
In the same vein, might not opera companies be asked, as tactfully as possible under the circumstances, why the leading part in ''La Traviata'' cannot be assigned to someone with practical experience as a prostitute. Most Violettas appear to have no clear idea of what the role requires in mental and physical preparation. The last Violetta I saw would have been quite at home in the local library, absorbed in mastering the Dewey Decimal System. It is surprising, in fact, that the association of professional prostitutes (oh, yes, there is one) has not lodged a complaint against the discriminatory casting of Verdi's otherwise convincing opera.
The foolishness that passes for opera tradition defies complete indictment because it is all-pervasive. Are there really no hunchbacks with talent in America? Must the operagoer's sense of the credible be affronted by a Rigoletto whose pillow keeps slipping from side to side? Are there really no native Albanians who could be cast in the important romantic roles in ''Cosi fan tutte''? In every production of Mozart's opera that I have ever seen those parts are doubled by the tenor and baritone who sing Ferrando and Guglielmo.
I have witnessed, as we all have, the unsavory spectacle of German singers pretending to be French, of Englishmen pretending to be ancient Greeks, of Americans pretending to be just about anything but good Americans. I have seen, more often than I like to remember, opera singers pretending to be actors and actors pretending to be opera singers. I have seen unindicted criminals pretending to be directors.
I don't know if an embrace of total realism would solve all of opera's problems, but the need for a radical change is obvious. One result might be to eliminate the ultimate operatic silliness: when one is asked to believe in singers made up as animals, as in Janacek's ''Cunning Little Vixen.'' The casting of genuine foxes, hedgehogs and so forth could only promote plausibility. I hope some foresighted union will pressure opera companies in this area, following the Actors' Equity lead. It would strike a blow not only for enlightened casting policies but for animal rights.

HEADLINE: Oil's Big Chance To Shape the Future

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

 BODY:
For oil companies, Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has created a host of uncertainties about prices and supplies. But there is no question that the Mideast crisis, however it is resolved, has the potential to reshape the industry.
Not since the embargoes and sharp oil-price increases of the 1970's have oil companies faced the prospect of coping with a new, if as-yet-undefined, order among their major crude suppliers in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. And not in a decade or more has the industry had as promising an opportunity to influence critical decisions on how and where the United States will meet its energy needs in coming decades and to reverse what it considers excessive sensitivity to environmental issues.
''There is the potential for a changed environment for the industry, more so than at any time in the past 10 years,'' said Bernard J. Picchi, an analyst at Salomon Brothers. ''The issues have now captured the attention of everyone in Washington and of the man on the street.'' 
For the first time in more than a decade, Congress and the Administration are likely to focus seriously on whether the United States has endangered its own security by becoming overly reliant on foreign oil - the country imported half of its oil needs in the first half of this year, a record - and on whether the industry should be provided with financial incentives to reverse a decline in domestic exploration and production.
After years of seeing new domestic drilling projects thwarted by environmental concerns, and despite a public image badly damaged by recent oil spills, the industry could get a renewed and possibly more receptive hearing for its argument that a fear of accidents should not cripple the nation's ability to supply more of its own energy.
''The national security aspects of oil had been completely subordinated in recent years to the environmental concerns,'' said John H. Lichtblau, head of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York. ''Now you have the emphasis coming back to the security aspects. If there is a conflict between the two, it may no longer be automatically resolved in favor of the environmentalists.''
 
Investing the Profits
Assuming that crude oil prices remain relatively high, the crisis will have the immediate effect of generating more profits for many oil companies, although lower earnings from refining operations could hold down their gains. Companies will have to decide how much of those profits to invest in new exploration and production - and where that investment should go. The Chevron Corporation, for one, decided earlier this month to spend an additional $100 million this year to produce more oil in existing domestic fields. Others are seeking new places to drill abroad, including the Soviet Union.
Analysts and industry executives say some companies might respond by putting more emphasis on their production and marketing of natural gas, which although plentiful and inexpensive relative to crude oil is still the poor relation of the industry. Other companies might make more extensive commitments to developing alternative-fuel businesses. None seem likely to diversify outside of the energy field. The momentum for change could evaporate if the crisis is resolved quickly. And barring widespread shortages or dramatically higher prices, the Federal policy formulation process is likely to move slowly. Congress, which virtually ignored energy policy issues while oil flowed abundantly and relatively inexpensively over the past decade, has an understandable aversion to adopting any measures to help the industry at a time of rising prices.
Oil company rhetoric notwithstanding, policy changes in Washington to encourage more domestic production could never eliminate the nation's need for foreign oil. New domestic production is unlikely to offset the decline in output from sites that are slowly being pumped dry. At the giant Prudhoe Bay field in Alaska, for example, production is expected to decline from 1.3 million barrels a day to 500,000 in 10 years. In any case, the major companies continue to see more potential for new finds abroad.
''I don't care how much you drill in this country, you will never be able to replace imports with domestic sources,'' said Robert K. Watson, a New York-based energy specialist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental activist group.
Still, there are some indications that the pendulum is beginning to swing back in favor of whatever domestic sources can be found. Just a few days after the invasion of Kuwait, the Senate approved an amendment to the Defense Authorization bill requiring that the President take steps to reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil. Among the steps required by the amendment, offered by Senator Frank Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska, would be opening to exploration and production Federal lands that have previously been off limits, including the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. (See box.) Avoiding Hard Choices The legislation, which still faces a long battle before it could become law, also calls for oil import fees, tax and other incentives for domestic production and further conservation efforts. The actions, virtually all of which are supported by oil companies, would be required whenever imports exceeded 50 percent of the nation's oil needs.
''We are now relying on military force rather than energy policy for our energy security,'' Senator Murkowski said. ''Americans find it unacceptable to put American lives at risk because we have not made the hard choices to formulate a policy.''
After years of standing on the sideline, the Federal Government also decided last week to involve itself in a long-running environmental dispute over when the industry will be able to start pumping oil from a large field off the central California coast.
The Energy Department started trying to mediate the battle between Chevron, which leads an industry consortium, and local residents, who have held up production by pressuring state officials to deny the oil companies permits to transport the oil by tanker to refineries in Los Angeles. The project could eventually produce 100,000 barrels of oil a day, or about 15 percent of the amount the United States had been receiving from Iraq and Kuwait.
The industry's foes have by no means disappeared. Environmentalists continue to make forceful arguments against giving any breaks to oil companies, citing the damage that can be done by a single accident like the Exxon Valdez spill last year and the industry's spotty record of concern for the coastal and wilderness areas where most potential new oil finds are located.
Other critics say the answer to the nation's energy problems lies not with propping up the oil industry but in promoting alternative sources, including everything from nuclear power and natural gas to solar power, or in doing more to promote conservation and fuel efficiency.
''Energy efficiency is America's largest and least expensive energy resource, and we need to do more to tap it,'' said Mr. Watson of the Natural Resources Defense Council. ''The future is in using energy efficiently and getting it from alternative sources. Any additional drilling in environmentally sensitive areas would be a drop in the bucket in terms of the total amount of energy consumed in the United States.''
Moreover, the expressions of outrage among consumers and politicians earlier this month over the gasoline-price increases that followed so quickly on the heels of Saddam Hussein's grab for Kuwait were a reminder that Big Oil has never had many friends.
Several companies, led by the Atlantic Richfield Company, responded to complaints about price-gouging and to President Bush's call for restraint by capping wholesale gasoline prices temporarily. Fearful that allegations of profiteering could lead Congress to impose another windfall-profits tax on the industry, oil executives embarked on a public relations blitz to explain the complex oil markets and defend their actions.
Industry executives also tried again and again to reframe the debate in terms of national security instead of fouled beaches and exorbitant profits. But they clearly have a long way to go.
''The oil industry is one of this country's great assets,'' said George Babikian, president of ARCO's refining and marketing division. ''But these days, you mention oil company and people see some big, fat, greedy guy with a cigar and dirty fingernails counting his money. We don't have a hell of a lot of credibility.''
Greedy or not, the industry will have plenty of additional loot to count if prices stay up. Higher crude oil prices can have a dramatic impact on the bottom line, especially for those companies that produce more of their crude than they purchase from OPEC or other suppliers. ARCO, for example, produces virtually all of the crude oil that it refines into gasoline, jet fuel and other products. As a result, it stands to benefit substantially from higher crude prices. For every $1 increase in the price of a barrel of crude, ARCO's after-tax profits would rise by $140 million, or 83 cents a share, over the course of a year, according to the First Boston Corporation. Since early July, prices have soared $10 a barrel, to more than $28 on Friday.
For companies like the Exxon Corporation and the Mobil Corporation, which purchase roughly half of their crude oil from foreign sources, the benefits are not as dramatic, but they are still important. Exxon, for example, would reap an additional $272 million in after-tax profits, or 22 cents a share, for each $1 increase.
Higher profits mean the companies would have more money available for exploration and development projects or to make existing projects more efficient.
''I know we would take those profits and plow them back into exploration and bring more oil to the market,'' said Mr. Babikian of ARCO. ''We could do that at a faster clip to help find oil or develop oil fields that we know have more oil in them.''
 
Texaco Wish List
James W. Kinnear, Texaco Inc.'s chief executive, said that if more money becomes available for capital spending, the company would like to increase its investments in areas like coal gasification. Mr. Kinnear said the company would also like to spend more on recovering additional oil from nearly depleted fields.Processes like injecting water or carbon dioxide underground can force more oil to the surface.
''Each one of those things has the effect of bringing more energy on stream for the United States,'' Mr. Kinnear said.
Many companies had already begun to increase capital spending modestly because the nation's energy demands have been rising steadily. Most analysts and executives said sustained prices above $25 a barrel would be enough to spur significant additional drilling activity.
But industry executives and analysts say that in the absence of new incentives to drill in the United States, most new projects will continue to be abroad. The United States no longer has the equipment to support a return to the level of drilling activity experienced during the early 1980's. The most promising regions for new oil finds are overseas, and even if environmental concerns in the United States abate, the delays and expense they cause are unlikely ever to completely disappear.
''It will be much easier to explore for oil in parts of the world that do not have the luxury of worrying about environmental concerns,'' said Vahan Zanoyan of the Petroleum Finance Company, a consulting firm in Washington.
 
Boost for Natural Gas
For all these reasons, some analysts believe that oil companies will now be willing to spend billions of dollars on pipelines needed to develop the country's mammoth natural gas reserves, although any such efforts may encounter their own environmental obstacles. The huge costs of building a national delivery and storage network have greatly limited the use of natural gas.
''I think you'll find a very strong push for a pro-active natural gas policy,'' said Joseph Stanislaw, managing director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Cambridge, Mass. ''You'll see oil companies making themselves into oil and gas companies, with non-gas players making alliances with gas players.''
William L. Randol, an analyst at First Boston, said companies such as Chevron and Amoco that have large natural gas reserves may start pushing for legislation to mandate more use of natural gas in industries where either gas or oil can be used as fuel.
''I do think there is the possibility of fuel switching and I think the price of natural gas will probably increase,'' said Mr. Kinnear of Texaco.
Of course, the pace and nature of change in the industry will depend to a large extent on Arab and OPEC politics, and no one at this point has a clear idea of what that might entail.
''The old OPEC is dead,'' said Mr. Stanislaw. ''The new OPEC could have many faces.''
 
THE POTENTIAL ALONG THE BEAUFORT SEA
The coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge runs for 100 miles along the Beaufort Sea in the northeast corner of Alaska, a desolate region that is home to caribou and other tundra wildlife and is virtually untouched by man.
But the area is also widely considered to be the most promising in the nation for a major new oil find, putting it squarely in the middle of the debate over how to balance environmental concerns with the nation's need for more energy sources.
So far, Congress and the Bush Administration have turned a deaf ear to the industry's calls for opening the coastal plain first to limited test exploration and ultimately, if enough oil is found, to full-scale development and production. In the wake of the Iraq crisis, however, the industry is intensifying its lobbying efforts, and some in Congress, including Senators Frank Murkowski and Ted Stevens of Alaska, are calling for the issue to be placed back on the national agenda.
No one knows for sure how much oil there might be below the coastal plain. A report by the Energy Department estimated that the area could yield between 600 million barrels of recoverable oil - a relatively small find - and 9.2 billion barrels, roughly the equivalent of the giant Prudhoe Bay field just to the west.
''It's the only place we could expect to make a find that would add significantly to the country's reserves over the next few decades,'' said Tom Cook, an exploration representative for the Chevron Corporation in Alaska.
The companies that most need oil from the coastal plain are those that have the biggest existing investments in Alaska's North Slope, primarily the Atlantic Richfield Company and British Petroleum. They have already invested billions in building the trans-Alaska pipeline to carry oil south from Prudhoe Bay; the companies say it would be relatively easy to build a spur line 100 miles or so into the coastal plain to feed new oil into the existing system.
''The technology is there to do it with minimal impact and very low risk to the area and to wildlife,'' Mr. Cook said. Environmentalists are aghast at the very idea. ''We have a 20 percent chance of finding a significant amount of oil, and a 100 percent chance of trashing one of the environmentally pristine areas of the country,'' said Robert K. Watson, an energy specialist at the Natural Resources Defense Council. Mr. Watson said the idea that the companies could develop the coastal plain in an environmentally sound manner is absurd. ''If you've ever been to Prudhoe Bay, you've seen that they've completely steamrollered it,'' he said. ''They've completely ignored any environmental sensitivities.''
 
LITTLE HOPE IN SYNFUELS
It seemed like a great idea at the time. At the behest of President Jimmy Carter, the Federal Government in 1980 undertook what was supposed to be a massive effort to promote the development of synthetic fuels to reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil. With oil prices at $32 a barrel and the economy suffering from its second oil-price shock in seven years, the effort seemed justified, and Congress authorized the expenditure of as much as $88 billion. By the 1990's, synfuels were supposed to account for 25 percent of the nation's energy needs.
Within a few years, though, oil prices started tumbling and synthetic fuels - like gas produced from coal or oil produced from shale - no longer made much economic sense. Companies started bailing out of development projects, the Reagan Administration turned hostile to the program and the entire effort eventually died.
Today, with oil prices rising again and the nation once more concerned about reducing its oil imports, synthetic fuels remain a tantalizing but probably unrealistic solution.
A few companies, including Texaco Inc., are still investing in coal gasification and other synfuels projects. But most experts believe there will not be any major push into synthetic fuels unless oil prices go much higher and stay there for a long period.
''There are a lot of projects that could get off the ground with a lot of Government funding,'' said John C. Sawhill, who headed the program as Deputy Energy Secretary during the Carter Administration. ''But frankly I think it would be a mistake. As far as making a dent in the U.S. energy supply, I think we ought to forget about synfuels in the 1990's.''

With the United States facing a possible recession, there is little the Federal Reserve can do to counter the fall, which can add to inflationary pressures by raising the cost of imported goods. Those pressures have already been magnified by the huge increase in oil prices since the Middle East crisis began. By week's end, the dollar fell to 1.5495, just over two pfennigs below the previous low close in New York of 1.5700, reached on Dec. 31, 1987. Now traders are waiting to see how soon the dollar will reach its all-time low against the Swiss franc, which closed Friday at 1.2830. The current low, 1.2690, was also reached on Dec. 31, 1987.

HEADLINE: Unions Are Expanding Their Role to Survive in the 90's

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
Organized labor, battered by union-busting, concessions contracts and shrinking membership during the 1980's has begun to expand its services to attract new members and remain relevant for the ones they already have.
Labor leaders and experts say the organizations, to survive, will have to evolve more fully into providers of financial and social services, offering discount credit cards, for example, and readily available family counseling.
''Unions will have to become more social service organizations if they are to have much of a future,'' observed Audrey Freedman, a labor economist at the Conference Board, a business research organization in New York, ''Individual workers feel alone and at risk. Unions might provide a communal organization for individuals, although they are not doing it now.''
''Unions will have to offer innovative and different services,'' agreed Douglas Fraser, the former president of the United Automobile Workers. ''We can expand the employee assistance programs we have now to prevent alcohol and drug abuse to include family counseling and social services. They have to be available near where people work to do much good.'' 
Unions have already begun to make such changes by offering low-cost credit cards and checking accounts, but they will have to continue to do more, analysts say, because of the events of the 80's.
In particular, deregulation and international competition have severely limited organized labor's ability to win economic gains for workers. A return to the steady wage and benefit gains of the 50's, 60's and 70's, is not, they say, in the cards.
Unions no longer dominate entire industries, like automobiles, steel and rubber, the way they once did. Imports and nonunion domestic competitors do not allow companies in those industries to pass on higher labor costs to consumers as they once did. And changes on the factory floor that have given workers more discretion over how they do their jobs may make unions less important as processors of employee grievances.
Nevertheless, some positive signs for labor have emerged. For one thing, breaking unions appears to be losing its appeal as a management technique. Frank Lorenzo, who broke the pilots' union at Continental Airlines and tried to repeat the tactic at Eastern, has left the airline business. Greyhound Lines Inc., which hired permanent replacements for its striking bus drivers, was forced into bankruptcy and may find itself owned by an investment group that includes its opponent, the Amalgamated Transit Union.
''After Eastern and the Greyhound debacle, I don't think it is going to be fashionable to try to break unions,'' said Ben Fischer, director of the Center for Labor Studies at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh. ''It seems more effective at breaking companies than breaking unions.''
It's not that employee-employer disputes are a thing of the past. Nasty fights are certain to break out, for example, as the rising cost of health care prompts more corporations to try to trim coverage and shift some of the payment burden to employees. Job security will be a quarrelsome issue as well, with unions trying to protect current employment levels while companies seek lower-cost outside suppliers. But the clout of unions to influence the outcome of future battles has clearly been weakened.
Many union members feel President Ronald Reagan set the tone for the 80's, hurting organized labor badly when he broke the strike by the Professional Air Traffic Controllers, and the union along with it, in 1981.
There have, nevertheless, been some signs of union strength recently at the bargaining table and on the picket line. The Communications Workers of America successfully resisted demands by the Nynex Corporation to shift health care costs to workers, although it took a four-month strike to make the company back down. And the United Automobile Workers sent a signal to the General Motors Corporation that it is prepared to act tough by striking a parts plant over local issues before the Sept. 14 expiration of the national contract.
But the U.A.W. is no longer promising members that the once-sacred 3 percent annual pay increase, the so-called annual improvement factor, will be restored. Instead, it is likely to settle, as it has in recent negotiations, for some lump-sum increases that are not added into the wage base used to calculate pension and other benefits. Indeed, the union's chief goal is greater job security for workers in an industry where increasing sales of foreign-made vehicles are forcing plant closings and layoffs.
Unions are looking for new routes to relevance because their numbers in traditional industries have been declining. The United Steelworkers of America once counted over one million members. Today it has less than half that. Only the rapid growth of unions whose members work for units of government, like teachers and municipal workers, and the reaffiliation of the teamsters' union has enabled the A.F.L.-C.I.O. to sustain its membership at more than 14 million.
''Thirty-nine percent of all people who are represented by unions are in the public sector, and it will probably be over 50 percent by the end of the decade,'' Ms. Freedman said. ''That's a different world that was not under the competitive pressure of the private sector.'' There has been less pressure to cut jobs in the public sector.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. unions managed to sign up only 40,000 to 60,000 new members a year through traditional organizing during most of the 80's.
One method the federation is using to expand its membership is to create a new category of worker, called an associate member. An associate member is one who is not working in a union shop, but who wants to be affiliated with a union and participate in its benefit programs.
Associate membership is tied to a program the organization calls Union Privilege, available to both menbers and associates. In addition to the credit card (a Mastercard from the Bank of New York), Union Privilege includes reduced-rate legal services, supplementary life insurance, mail-order pharmaceuticals, higher rate savings accounts.
According to an A.F.L.-C.I.O. spokesman, 78 of the federation's 90 unions have signed up for at least one Union Privilege program. The credit card has been most popular, with more than 1.4 million currently in use.
The labor organization is planning to extend the program to include portable health insurance coverage for workers who lose their union jobs and reduced-rate home mortgages, college loans and auto insurance.
''Union Privilege's ultimate objective in developing a program of benefits is to find ways of using those benefits to attract new members to unions either as full members, or where full membership is not possible, as associate members,'' the executive council of the federation said in its 1989 convention report.
Unions are targeting former members now in nonunion jobs for associate status as well as union loyalists at locations where organizing drives failed and nonmembers in locations where union status is not necessary.
For example, the American Federation of Teachers has been recruiting non-A.F.T. teachers. The federation has also mounted a television advertising campaign with the theme ''Union, yes.''
Some people outside the labor movement see associate membership as an important tool to help recruit the droves of white-collar workers who have been wary of unions because of their blue-collar, heavy-industry image. They note that union representation among white-collar workers is considerably greater in Canada and Great Britain, than it is in the United States.
''Unions will have to think more broadly about what kinds of services they can offer workers outside the formal collective bargaining process,'' said Casey Ichniowski, an associate professor at the Columbia Business School. ''Associate-style unionism can be an important precursor to formal relations.''
Professor Ichniowski noted that teachers, policemen and firefightersbelonged to fraternal and professional organizations that evolved over time into bargaining agents for their members.
Peter Drucker, the noted student of management, sees broader union services as an alternative to an otherwise inevitable decline. ''The union might reinvent itself as the organ of society - and of the employing institution - concerned with human potential and human achievement, and with optimizing the human resource altogether,'' he wrote in a recent book, ''The New Realities.''
Such a union would retain some of its traditional role. ''The union would still have a role as the representative of the employees against management stupidity, management arbitariness and management abuse of power,'' he wrote. And there is a model for such an institution. ''Such a role may sound utopian, but it is pretty much the way the Japanese labor union functions,'' Mr. Drucker wrote.
Other union movements faced with declining membership and influence are considering similar approaches. ''Unions have to focus on the workplace, but their role goes beyond bread and butter,'' said William Callaghan, an economist with Britain's Trades Union Council.
In fact, the council recently adopted elements of the Union Privilege program, including a credit card and low-cost auto insurance and is seeking to expand. ''We've even pinched the 'Union, yes' campaign,'' Mr. Callaghan said. Although the prevailing opinion of the moment is that the unions must try these steps at revitalization, there are some who doubt that unions will have a great effect, given their inability to produce rich contracts and insure availability of jobs. ''The balance of power,'' said D. Quinn Mills, a professor at the Harvard Business School, ''remains with management.''
 
CAN UNIONS REGAIN THEIR LOST MOMENTUM?
''The concessions bubble has passed,'' declared Thomas R. Donahue, secretary-treasurer of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., meaning that the period when unions would willingly surrender to management is over.
''The 1980's were difficult years for trade unions, for the economy and for workers,'' Mr. Donahue said.
But, he added, ''Many unions have gained back what they gave up. The 1990's look like a brighter period for us.'' Mr. Donahue's vision of the future includes unions offering more services to members and prospective members, new laws to facilitate organizing and union participation in worker involvement programs.
Services provided by the union will go beyond the credit card and group purchasing opportunities currently available, he said. One possibility is keeping workers up to date on what is happening in the economy beyond the immediate workplace.
''As the world grows more complicated, people are hungry for information. They want to know about health and safety, where job training is available and where jobs are going,'' he said.
Mr. Donahue contends that the current system of organizing workers under the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board has become too cumbersome, expensive and time consuming.
''We need legislation that will give employees additional ways to participate in collective bargaining. The current system is such a legalistic hassle that some of our unions are avoiding it,'' he said.
And worker involvement plans, such as self-managing teams on factory floors, provide with opportunities that go beyond the old role of processing grievances.
''When you are handling a grievance you have the interest of only a small percentage of the members. The magic of worker participation schemes is that they involve a new layer of union activists that can fulfil a role beyond shop stewards,'' Mr. Donahue said.

The Diverse New Industry of Private Weather Forecasting

BYLINE: By NOAM COHEN

 BODY:
Wertfilms Inc. chose to shoot Nissan commercials in Seattle because it wanted skies that were overcast but not on the verge of a deluge. So the producers called Northwest Weathernet Inc., a private company that could render specific forecasts. ''Five or ten miles can make a difference,'' said Phil Breuser, the vice president of Northwest Weathernet. ''We can go hour-by-hour if they want.''
Private weather services, long used by fliers, farmers and shippers, are exploiting broad new markets. Although their annual revenues still total only about $200 million a year, many major industries depend on their work. Private meteorologists influence commodity prices, the outcome of lawsuits and government policy on global warming. They study where and whether new power plants should be built, and some - called forensic meteorologists - testify on the causes of airplane crashes.
On radio and television, Accu-Weather and the Weather Channel feed the growing demand for weather news. And Europeans, frustrated by the expense of their own government weather services, sometimes buy information in the United States. 
Private weather companies have new opportunities because the National Weather Service wants to confine itself to general forecasts and emergency warnings. For other, more specific information, the agency plans to refer callers elsewhere. ''The policy of the Administration has been to encourage private meteorology,'' said Louis J. Boezi, a deputy director of the service.
Under proposed new guidelines, the agency would shun what it calls ''specialized services.'' So someone asking whether the outlook for temperature, humidity and rain would be right for pouring a concrete foundation in the middle of next week would be told to call a private company. These companies typically charge $100 an hour, with the cost for a single forecast running between $25 and $75.
 
Military Roots
Filling a Niche Left by Government
 Private weather services are at least as old as the Old Farmer's Almanac, first published in 1792. But the modern industry began at the end of World War II, when meteorologists trained in the military started their own businesses to serve shipping and aviation. In 1955, the American Meteorological Society's directory listed 22 companies. Now it lists 112. Industry executives say the business is growing about 5 percent annually.
About 30 percent of the growth in forecasting assignments has come from utilities, somewhat less than 30 percent from transportation and about 20 percent from construction, says Jeffrey C. Smith, executive director of the Commercial Weather Services Association, a trade group. Utilities need environmental advice and early warnings of when foul weather might bring down transmission lines. Construction crews need to have enough notice of storms to come down from high-rise projects.
The increasing complexity of forecasts, and government's more restricted role, help increase revenues for private services. But sales remain dependent on the economy. ''We're a service industry,'' said Austin Dooley, general manager of the New York office of Oceanroutes Inc., which plans shipping routes. ''If cargo isn't produced and exported, and if the ships aren't sailing, we aren't going to have any business.''
 
Air-Quality Specialists
A New Emphasis On the Environment
 When North American Weather Consultants of Salt Lake City was founded in 1950, it provided forecasts and cloud-seeding for farmers. Now the company is more concerned about artificial weather of another sort: the pollution that issues from plants, especially those owned by utilities.
Only two companies listed air quality as their specialty in the American Meteorological Society's 1965 directory. This year, 44 did.
Gauging the amount of pollution escaping from a power plant smokestack is only half the task, weather services say. Determining how the emissions are dispersed and how they interact with other pollutants is also crucial. A power plant that would be fine in Omaha might fail to meet Federal standards in Los Angeles. ''Meteorology controls, to a large extent, the pollution in the air,'' said Don A. Griffith, a vice president at North American. Power companies also consult with meteorologists to decide on how much their emissions need cleaning up.
North American's own fortunes have been a barometer of the nation's environmental concern. The company only entered the air-quality business in the middle 1960's. The Clean Air Act was passed in 1970, and air quality consulting grew to become two-thirds of the company's business. But in the early 1980's, when emissions enforcement eased up and power plant construction slowed, it shed nearly 40 of its 60 employees.
Then came oil spills and a revived environmental movement. In the last few years, North American has begun expanding again, especially to help coal-generated power plants meet new governmentstandards. But so many pollution experts quit in the 1980's that the company cannot grow as quickly as it wants. ''We can hardly hire qualified people in air pollution anymore,'' said Keith J. Brown, the company president.
He says that North American's revenues will approach $3 million this year, about half from pollution work - a ratio he expects to rise to 75 percent in another few years. As Mr. Brown said, ''The 90's is the decade of the environment.''
 
An Insatiable Public
The Appetite For Weather News
 For two private weather forecasters, the broadcasting business seems to be raining money. Accu-Weather Inc. in State College, Pa., furnishes forecasts for about 3,000 clients in radio, television and other industries. The Weather Channel is available on cable in 45 million homes.
Accu-Weather, which considers itself the nation's largest private forecasting company, refuses to disclose its revenues but says that it has been growing at 10 percent a year. Founded by Joel Myers when he was a graduate student at Pennsylvania State University, Accu-Weather now has 225 employees.
Accu-Weather provides not only the forecasts for 125 radio stations and 200 television stations, but also about 40 meteorologists to explain the news on the air. Dr. Myers asserts that Accu-Weather's success comes from a recognizable name and better forecasts than the National Weather Service. The service declined to respond.
But Accu-Weather also owes some of its growth to the Weather Service's decisions in recent years to keep its own forecasters off the air. Alaska is one of the few places left where a Government weatherman delivers television and radio forecasts; river ice reports for fishermen are standard. Elsewhere, the Weather Service provides only the general forecasts that television and radio announcers can rip and read.
The Weather Service also does not illustrate its forecasts with whiz-bang graphics, leaving more opportunities for Accu-Weather and the Weather Channel. The only cable network devoted to round-the-clock weather, the Weather Channel has artists and computer experts to keep finding flashier ways of presenting the weather. Their latest: three-dimensional renderings of storm systems.
Media analysts say that the Weather Channel, founded in 1982 and owned by Landmark Communications Inc. of Norfolk, Va., is enjoying steady growth. Paul Kagan Associates. estimates its 1989 revenues at $31.5 million, with operating cash flow, or profits before taxes and depreciation, of $10 million. This year, Paul Kagan projects cash flow of $12 million on revenues of $35.3 million.
The National Weather Service has been one of the channel's greatest supporters. The agency has computer-coded its local forecasts so the channel could present each area with its own weather report. And the Weather Service makes certain that the Weather Channel receives weather warnings and watches the moment they are issued.
But just as specialized services have arisen to fill out the details in the National Weather Service forecasts, specialized cable channels - offering local reports for aviators or farmers, perhaps - might someday supplement the Weather Channel. ''I think you will see people popping up with this,'' said Edward Gross, the constituent affairs chief for the National Weather Service. But some might prefer receiving specialized forecasts on a different screen than their television, he added. ''The question is whether cable will satisfy those needs or the home computer will.''
 
THE BUSINESS IN EUROPE
The few private weather forecasting companies in Europe - an estimated 10 - find they get almost as much encouragement from America as at home. Harry A. Otten, whose Meteo Consult BV in 1986 became the first private forecaster in the Netherlands, was looking to package weather data for broadcasting, agricultural and energy companies. But the fees he was charged by the Dutch Government were hefty.
''In the United States, it is thought that taxpayers pay for the data, so they should be able to get all the data,'' he said. ''In Europe, it is thought that taxpayers pay for the data, so they should not be able to make a profit from it.''
Mr. Otten initially paid his Government $600,000 a year, but threatened to get his information far less expensively by computer and telephone from private American services. (British weather companies are also obtaining information from the United States that is far cheaper than what's available at home.) By 1988, the Government had cut its price to $200,000. It was not a total victory, however. Mr. Otten says that companies forecasting weather in the United States can get good information for a tenth the price.
Meteo Consult, with a staff of 16, still has the Government as its major competitor. The Dutch agency provides forecasts tailored to specific business needs - for a fee. ''Sometimes the Government is cheaper, but we have to be more accurate,'' Mr. Otten said.
Meteo Consult's enterprise has its roots in the United States. Mr. Otten, who had worked for the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute as a forecaster and later as a television weatherman, took a year-long sabbatical at Pennsylvania State University. There, he consulted for Accu-Weather and came up with the idea of bringing private forecasting to the Netherlands.
With trade barriers coming down in the European Community, Mr. Otten feels, governments will be less able to throttle private weather companies. The growth of private meteorology in Europe might be slow, but as Mr. Otten said, ''Accu-Weather didn't have 16 employees after its first five years.''

How the Big Oil Companies Blundered

BYLINE: By ALAN TOWERS; Alan Towers is president of Alan Towers Associates, a public relations firm in New York.

 BODY:
The rush by oil companies to raise gasoline prices after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait was a tremendous public relations blunder. By raising prices, these companies unraveled the thin cloak of credibility around their industry.
It is no secret that the oil industry has not excelled at public relations. It paid too little attention to public opinion during the 1973-74 oil embargo. Angry public reaction to rising prices made Big Oil No. 1 on America's most despised list. Congress followed by confiscating oil profits through the Windfall Profits Tax. 
Surely, all this should have been a lesson too painful for the oil companies to forget. But they did. Americans were angered by sudden, aggressive gas price increases. Once again, oil management miscalculated public reaction by failing to see price as a public relations lever, not just a financial calculation.
Several major producers finally agreed to hold or reduce prices. But the rollback came only after Congressional hearings, accusations of antitrust violations and threats of another tax.
Oil is not the only industry that has controlled a vital commodity, sought to take advantage of market imbalances and met with a public relations disaster. During the early 1980's, the property and casualty insurance industry raised premiums so high that public swimming pools and ski slopes were forced to close. Auto insurance costs accelerated beyond the reach of many drivers. Public anger came swiftly and predictably: tort reform to reduce court awards was stopped, and New Jersey, Pennsylvania and California mandated lower auto insurance rates.
In New York, accusations of rent gouging has created a populist drive for commercial rent control - legislation feared by real estate interests. The city's economic problems have cooled things down, putting supply and demand in closer balance. But with a liberal Democratic Mayor in City Hall and the chief proponent of controls now Manhattan Borough President, legislated commercial rents now have a fighting chance.
What can we learn from these lessons? Is it simply impossible for companies to pass along higher costs when the public welfare is involved? The answer illustrates the ironies of capitalism and democracy: in a free economy, the public's opinion is the most powerful regulator.
More pricing controversies will erupt soon if the cost of oil rises. But in all these cases, the cost of a product is only half the issue. Equally important is avoiding the attitude that pricing of a vital product is strictly the province of the private provider.
A company's reputation is its most valuable asset. Leaving pricing decisions for critical products within the marketing and finance departments alone may not provide the broader view required to protect this fragile asset.

Looking Beyond the Mideast Crisis

BYLINE: By ROBERT C. ALTMAN; Roger C. Altman, assistant secretary of the Treasury from 1977 to 1980, is vice chairman of the Blackstone Group.

 BODY:
The conventional wisdom in Washington was that President Bush took an immense risk when he shifted his stance on tax increases. But even before the Middle East crisis, the bond market was sending a different message. It signaled that major economic benefits would flow from a White House budget deal. Only if fiscal policy is tightened appropriately can interest rates come down and growth resume.
The bond market has been signaling this throughout the negotiations on the budget deficit. The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds was just under 9 percent immediately before the announcement of a budget summit between Congressional leaders and the Administration. Then, after the announcement, bonds immediately rallied, driving down the yield to approximately 8.60 percent. When the budget negotiations in Congress stalled, rates went back up. But then, when President Bush made his shift on taxes, yields fell to below 8.5 percent. 
Right now, all financial markets are in turmoil because of uncertainty over oil prices and supplies. But as soon as this volatility eases, it will become clear that budget cuts in the $5o billion to $60 billion range - which Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, termed ''major, substantive and credible'' - would push down interest rates to more than offset the economic drag of a tighter budget.
The Federal Reserve demonstrated in June that it is prepared to loosen monetary policy as a budget pact emerges. This should happen as soon as Congress realizes that the Persian Gulf imbroglio could swell the deficit even further. Without an energy tax, the budget package may be a bit smaller in its impact the first year. But, as long as the future cuts are solid, the pressure on Treasury borrowing and inflation will still be reduced. This will give the Federal Reserve its rationale for further easing of interest rates. In fact, in testimony before Congress, Mr. Greenspan predicted that a real budget deal could lower interest rates by as much as two full percentage points.
Over the last 25 years, there have been several instances when budgets were cut at the same time that interest rates were eased - in 1964-65, 1971-72 and 1986-87. In each case, growth increased the following year, typically by a substantial margin. The stimulus from a looser monetary policy overcame the drag of a tighter budget. With sharply lower interest rates now in the offing, there is reason to expect the same result in 1991.
Internationally, the economic consequences of this policy mix will be highly positive. Since President Bush's shift on taxes, lower interest rates have caused the dollar to soften considerably. This softer dollar will spur exports just at the right time. Growth in Europe is running substantially above American levels and the demand for our products is accelerating there. In this environment, American growth can get a major boost from rising net exports. And, with lower interest rates causing private investment to pick up too, our overall competitiveness will strengthen.
The budget pact also should restore our economic negotiating leverage, particularly with Germany and Japan. Washington finally will have held up its end of the bargain to reduce the trade and payments ''imbalances'' which have clouded economic relations at the negotiating level for six years.
For example, President Bush's shift on taxes broke the deadlock in the tense Structural Impediments talks with Japan and produced a surprise, favorable agreement. Forty-eight hours after the President made his move, the Japanese Government committed to a $300 billion 10-year program of public infrastructure investment at home. This spending, which will move Japan closer to a consumer society and raise its imports, had long been an American goal.
Perhaps the most important result of the President's decision, however, could be to restore a period of bipartisan economic leadership in this country. In recent years, deficits and the politics of taxes have paralyzed Washington and undermined public esteem for all government. But, Mr. Bush's bold move, and the corresponding spending cuts which the Congressional leadership will support, may usher in a period of bipartisan cooperation on economic policy. It is evident that in the 1990's Americans want leadership. On economics, Mr. Bush is showing that he understands this need.

Hanging Tough Won't Be the Only Test of Leadership

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE race is on. President George Bush versus President Saddam Hussein. There is no prize for coming in second.
Mr. Hussein's strategy is now clear: by presenting himself to the Arab masses as Robin Hood, come to steal from the rich Kuwaitis to give to the poor and come to purify the Arab world of corrupt lackeys and infidels, the Iraqi President hopes to generate enough popular support that it will become impossible for his fellow Arab rulers to isolate him for long.
President Bush's strategy, at least for the near term, is also clear: hold together a diverse Arab and international coalition boycotting Iraq long enough to choke Saddam Hussein, if not to death, at least into saying he will vacate Kuwait. 
The question is who will last longer? Saddam Hussein, all but cut off from world trade essential to his survival, or George Bush's coalition, which could slowly be eroded by its conflicting interests and priorities, not to mention by the brooding antipathy toward the United States now bubbling up on the Arab street.
Of course, the answer will depend in part on the steps and missteps made by the unpredictable Iraqi leader - steps over which Mr. Bush will have little control. But from Mr. Bush's perspective, it will also depend heavily on his own ability to lead the domestic and international coalition that he has assembled down what is an essentially uncharted course.
Because the gulf crisis is truly the first post- cold war crisis, everyone involved is a novice. They are on a course where surprises will be lurking around every corner. Experience may count less than instinct, intuition and adaptability.
Consider just a few of the lessons imparted by this crisis. It has already shown that the post-cold war era might be as dangerous, if in different ways, as the cold war was. While the two superpowers were focused on Europe, regional superpowers like Iraq were acquiring weapons of mass destruction that now enable them to act independently.
President Bush also appears to be learning that post-cold war crises, involving bizarre coalitions of Western and Third World nations, can require more sophisticated, imaginative and subtle American leadership than demanded by the black and white, largely static, confrontation with the Soviet Union.
More countries are involved, there seem to be more competing interests, and the actors are less predictable.
In the Middle East, in particular, the interests of certain Arab states in blunting the Iraqis is tempered by their disquiet about being in league with their former colonial occupiers. For American policymakers, falling back on hard and fast ideologically driven positions can be dangerous.
The Administration has already discovered tensions between its short-term interests in the Persian Gulf and its long-term interests, said Robert W. Tucker, an expert on the geopolitics of the Persian Gulf at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.
Washington's primary short-term interest in the gulf was insuring that Saudi Arabia was not attacked or intimidated by Iraq, because that would had have serious implications for Western economies dependent on Saudi Arabia's oil and its policy of keeping prices low. That interest has been achieved with the introduction of American troops.
But America also has a long-term interest - the stability of pro-American regimes in the gulf and the desire of the United States to remain welcomed in the Middle East at large. The danger now, argued Mr. Tucker, is that if the United States goes to war with Iraq to dislodge it from Kuwait, it could provoke an anti-American Arab reaction that would not only threaten every pro-American regime in the area, but also sour United States relations with the Arab world for years to come. Dislodging Saddam Hussein from Kuwait is an American interest and desirable, but doing it by force - either intentionally or inadvertently - could badly damage longer-term interests.
What Washington also has discovered is that even in this new multipolar world, only the United States is able and willing to be the policeman. The time has not come yet for America's last hurrah.
Why? Because, said Joseph S. Nye, Harvard University professor of international relations, America remains the only country with enough hard power - aircraft carriers and marines - and soft power - diplomatic sway - to launch and sustain the sort of massive initiative being undertaken to counter Iraq. That is why, when Mr. Hussein moved, it was no accident that all eyes turned to Washington for a response.
''Obviously we have weaknesses and strengths,'' said Mr. Nye. ''But the mistake many analysts were making was to take a single anecdote illustrating American weakness, such as a decline in auto sales or the fact that the Germans concluded a deal with Gorbachev, and extrapolating from that to some very broad general conclusion that we were going down the tubes. We still have a lot more strengths than weaknesses.''
 
The Equivocation of Europe
It would be equally mistaken, though, for Washington decision-makers to exaggerate their prowess on the basis of this crisis. To be sure, in the developing world military power still counts for a great deal and no nation can bring more of that to bear in third world conflicts than the United States. In the developed world, however, where economic might, trade surpluses and financial balances - not guns - are the stuff of power, Washington is still indisputably slipping behind Germany and Japan.
Another belief that seems to have been deflated by this crisis is that the new Europe, with its formal economic merger set for 1992, would become the world's third superpower. While the French and British have sent limited naval forces to the gulf, the French insist they will do it their way, the Germans have been discussing what to do, and the rest of Europe has played no role except supporting sanctions and quietly wringing their hands. The Italians, Spaniards and Greeks in particular are highly attuned to the anti-Saudi, pro-Hussein mood in the Arab street and want to keep their options open for the future.
Back in the 1950's the Europeans tried to portray another Arab leader - Nasser - as a Hitler and they feel they got badly burned by it at Suez. Save for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, European statements are devoid of the moral arguments coming out of Washington. For them, this is business, and business is business.
''This crisis really exposed the hollowness of European pretensions,'' said Bernard Lewis, a Princeton University historian.
''Here was a major crisis that affected Europe far more than the United States, since the Europeans are far more dependent on Persian Gulf oil than the United States. But nevertheless, the great new European colossus that we have been hearing about has either been passive or responding to the American initiative and not launching anything of its own.''
But this crisis is also revealing that acting as the world's cop, and persuading the American peo ple to make the sacrifices inherent in this role, is no easy task. Americans are not entirely comfortable sending their troops to distant corners of the third world, for vaguely defined vital interests.
Even in the crisis in Kuwait, where the stakes are clear - oil and evil personified in a single dicta tor - the President has had to grope a bit to justify the operation. He could not rely on the prefabricated justifications of the cold war era, and this meant thinking afresh about exactly what was at stake and how to explain it, both to the American people and to the allies.
The President's groping was clearly in evidence last week when he went to the Pentagon to give his first major address justifying the intervention.
''Our jobs, our way of life, our own freedom and the freedom of friendly countries around the world would all suffer if control of the world's great oil reserves fell into the hands of Saddam Hussein,'' he told the employees, generals and admirals. It was intriguing to hear the President evoke ''our way of life'' as his main motif. That is a value that was also often evoked in the struggle against Communism.
''There is one big difference though,'' said Michael J. Sandel, the Harvard University political theorist. ''When we talked about defending 'our way of life' in the cold war, we were talking about upholding basic democratic freedoms and a society based on the rule of law. When Bush says that 'our way of life' is threatened in the Persian Gulf, it is not our higest values that are threatened, not our democratic principles. It is a way of life dependent on cheap oil and profligate energy use to which he is referring.''
The way of life that used to be evoked in confronting Communism was ''something to be proud of,'' added Mr. Sandel. ''But when Bush evokes it here, it is just a polite way of referring to a bad habit.''
Which goes to the very core of the leadership challenge that Mr. Bush confronts. Newspapers are replete these days with generally approving articles about George Bush's ''decisiveness.'' Indeed, the President has acted decisively to counter both the economic threat posed by Saddam Hussein and his threat to world stability.
But the larger answer to the Gulf crisis is not simply to ask Americans to confront Saddam Hus sein, but also to ask them to confront themselves and to live in a way that would make the United States energy self-sufficient. Since the crisis began Mr. Bush has mentioned the ''C-word'' - conservation - only once. He has been decisive in compensating for America's energy vulnerability by moving troops, but he has yet to show a similar decisiveness in addressing the root of that vulnerability by moving the nation to greater conservation. In that sense, his leadership has been incomplete.

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
What IS Youth Coming To?

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
FOR years Americans have been bludgeoned by one report after another documenting what a mess the new generation is supposed to be. Their grade point averages and S.A.T. scores are falling while high school dropout rates are rising. They don't know when the Civil War was or what Lithuania is.
But even the most jaded observers seemed to take notice this spring when a report by a panel, including Dr. C. Everett Koop, the former Surgeon General, and Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers, came to the disturbing conclusion that teen-agers are less healthy today than their parents were when they were the same age. Because of drinking, drugs, unplanned pregnancies, violence, suicide, venereal disease and emotional problems, many of today's teen-agers ''are unlikely to attain the high levels of education achievement required for success in the 21st century,'' according to the commission, which was formed by the National Association of State Boards of Education and the American Medical Association.
The implication, it almost seemed, was that America was raising a lost generation, an army of aging Bart Simpsons, possibly armed and dangerous. Their Holden Caulfield was Clay, the withdrawn California freshman wandering through a suburban wasteland of drugs and anomie in Bret Easton Ellis's 1985 novel ''Less Than Zero.'' Instead of Woodstock, they had MTV. 
Is there anything to these fears, beyond the ritual anxiety each generation feels about its successors? Have a significant number of post-boom babies really inherited serious handicaps, perhaps from the social revolutions of the 1960's and early 70's? Given all the choices they have, why do these young people seem so confused?
These questions are being asked by social scientists, who are doggedly tracking the lives and times of nearly 37 million people between the ages of 15 and 25. The answers, as far as they exist, are inconsistent enough to make demographers wonder if there's a ''they'' out there after all.
A few things are clear. The people born in the late 1960's and early 70's have sex earlier than their parents did and marry later. They buy more condoms than their older brothers and sisters did, but the youngest of them, the 15- to 19-year-olds, have more babies. In surveys, they say they care about poverty and the environment, but they vote less often than their predecessors did and pay less attention to the news. They spend more time in school but they learn less. Overall, they take fewer drugs than their older brothers and sisters did. But more of them kill themselves, and each other, than was true for the generations that went before.
Many linger longer on the threshold of adulthood, hanging around college and their parents' homes the way they used to hang around the mall. Gingerly threading their way through a landscape littered with choices, they have an acute sense of what each choice may cost.
Andrew Cherlin, a sociologist at Johns Hopkins University, explained the squeamishness this way: ''Half of these children spent some time in single-parent families growing up. This is the first generation to feel the full impact of the great rise in divorce.''
Some psychologists and sociologists contend that the divorces of the 60's and 70's have had long-term pernicious effects on children's emotional health and on their ability to make commitments; but others argue that parental love and involvement are the deciding factors - not marital arrangements.
It is important to keep in mind that some ills afflicting young adults afflict the rest of society as well. Teen suicide, for instance, is near a record high - but so are overall suicide rates.
''For anyone to say it's a lost generation is pretty extreme,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of surveys for the Times-Mirror Company of Los Angeles, whose June study of young people's tendency to stay away from the ballot box and tune out the news was called ''The Age of Indifference.''
''This is a generation that hasn't been touched by any larger thing,'' he said. ''It hasn't been challenged. It may be now coming head to head with its challenge,'' he added, in a rueful reference to the crisis in the Persian Gulf. Reynolds Farley, a demographer at the University of Michigan, said: ''Since the end of the Vietnam War, we have had nothing cataclysmic that would be threatening to young people in the sense that World War I, World War II or the Depression were threatening to people. To some degree that widens your choices -you're not threatened with military service, not threatened with very high rates of unemployment. There's a wider array of choices, and that may be disconcerting, or troubling.''
But the range of options depends on your parents' economic situation. According to economists, two decades of factory closings have left little semi-skilled or unskilled work to go around, unless young people want to contemplate a lifetime of flipping hamburgers. The uniting theme for this generation may be life in an age of limits. But while people near the top of the economic scale are plagued by too many choices, the people near the bottom have too few. ''Maybe you can't make a general statement about this generation because the prospects for the haves are so much different than the prospects for the have-nots,'' said Mr. Cherlin.
At the lower end of the economic scale, the problem is lack of skills and growing competition, from immigrants as well as native-born Americans. Leonard Gordon, an Arizona State University sociologist, says one consequence is a sharp increase in hostility among the races. A small but growing group of white students are ready to accept and endorse racial stereotypes, he said.
''When we ask students what their aspirations are, there is no difference between black and white students,'' Dr. Gordon said. ''But there's an enormous difference on their expectation of achieving their aspirations. A smaller percentage of black and Hispanic students think they can.''
And even several of those who were more sanguine told researchers in follow-up interviews that they had become pessimistic. ''They had a zero-sum perception of the future,'' Dr. Gordon said. ''If someone gains, someone has to lose. The traditional American view of the future is that if one person gains, someone else gains as well.''
If a sense of shrinking horizons afflicts one end of the economic ladder, the people on the other end seem to suffer a kind of vertigo at the huge expanse of choices laid out before them, particularly if they have had an emotional buffeting in their home life. They are taking their time about reaching the traditional demarcations of American adulthood.
They marry later. The average age was 23 for women and 25 for men in 1987; their counterparts in 1970 tended to marry three years earlier. Increasingly, they take five years to complete college. And more of them live on and off with their parents when college is over.
Some of the explanation is economic: in the late 1980's, about a quarter of all college students had student loans, which build up at about $2,500 annually, according to the Department of Education. Housing inflation has pushed all but group rentals beyond the reach of many.
''In the 1950's a high school education bought you a reasonable job,'' said Frank F. Furstenberg Jr., a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania. ''Today that's not the case.'' Also, he said, in an era when women expect to go to work - and may have to - ''there's no question there's been a change in the centrality of marriage as a defining life event.''
But the reasons for hovering on the threshold of maturity seem more than simply economic. For many young people their parents' homes seem emotional as well as economic havens.
''A lot of the choices they are making now they are unmaking,'' said Martha Farnsworth Riche, an economist for American Demographics magazine. ''There's much more stopping out of college. When they unmake a choice'' - schooling, jobs, relationships - ''they go home,'' she said. ''When they choose again, they leave.''
But the sense of aimlessness - whether caused by too many options or too few - is not always translated into cynicism. Surveys of high school seniors and college freshmen by the University of Michigan and the University of California at Los Angeles show more interest in changing society than at any time since the early 1970's. Sociology departments are reporting increased enrollments.
And some choices are being made. Marijuana use, which peaked in the late 1970's, has been going down slowly but steadily. Cocaine use began to drop in 1985. But there is still far more drug use among adolescents and young adults than 20 years ago.
And there is far more sexual activity at younger ages. In 1988, 27 percent of 15-year-old and half of 17-year-old women had had sex, according to the Federal Government's National Survey of Family Growth. One result is ''the decision to marry has clearly become independent of the onset of sexual experience for the great majority of women,'' said Dr. William Pratt of the National Survey.
''There are just fewer societal norms about what ought to be done,'' said Dr. Farley. ''Those stabilizing forces that society once defined as important have disappeared.''
''They are making choices. They will make choices,'' said Ms. Riche. ''But given the changes in the world around them, they can't make definite choices at the same age people did before.''

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Japan Gives Its Leader A Long Honeymoon

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
WHEN he took office a year ago, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu seemed like the man least likely to succeed. He had no power base, no major record of achievement in government and almost no serious experience at political maneuvering, and he was faced with an electorate irate after more than a year of scandals and unpopular policies.
Today Mr. Kaifu has risen to become one of the most popular Japanese leaders in modern history. Even more startling, he has impressed President Bush and other foreign leaders as a new kind of Japanese politician, ready to play a more assertive role on the world stage and yet more flexible on trade and economic disputes. 
Underneath the surface lies a more complicated reality suggesting that many of the hopes being invested in Mr. Kaifu may be misplaced. Indeed, although the Prime Minister shows increasing confidence in his actions, many politicians say his hold on the Government is precarious and could be overwhelmed by problems that he and others in power are shunting aside.
Japan's difficulties were on display last week as Tokyo struggled to find a response to the crisis in the Persian Gulf. Since Japan is dependent on Mideast oil for nearly 70 percent of its energy needs, it might have been natural to assume that Japan would move swiftly to protect its interests.
Instead, the Government stumbled amid internal policy disagreements, forcing a cancellation of Mr. Kaifu's scheduled visit to the Middle East. A Government spokesman said the Prime Minister decided to stay home to determine what ''concrete measures'' to use against Iraq, aside from economic sanctions. But others made clear that he did not want to be seen undertaking an ''oil buying expedition'' that would anger Iraq and its rivals. Finally, the Government said it would consider sending nonmilitary support to the American-led efforts against Iraq.
Looking to others to show the way has been a theme of Mr. Kaifu's time in office.
 
The paradox of the
Prime Minister's political success is that he has succeeded in spite of his inability to deliver on any promises or to change the policies that caused so much anger a year ago. In what sounds like a zen twist, the Prime Minister is politically strong precisely because he is weak.
''Kaifu does not seem to be viciously in pursuit of power and profit like past leaders,'' Hajime Shinohara, a professor of political science at Seikei University, told one newspaper. ''He also draws sympathy because it seems he is being pushed around.''
The Japanese admire and reward the exercise of power even as they harbor misgivings and nervousness when power becomes too brazen. Mr. Kaifu has discovered that a key to his popularity is that people continue to believe that real power in the Government is wielded by the leaders of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's major factions, including former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, Mr. Kaifu's major patron.
It is the control of these party barons that has prevented Mr. Kaifu from changing the status quo that only a year ago was drawing the wrath of voters. Mr. Takeshita and then his successor, Sousuke Uno, were forced to resign because of voter anger over an unpopular new sales tax and the bribery and influence peddling scandal involving millions of dollars in gifts to politicians.
Mr. Kaifu took office pledging action on several fronts, but shows no sign of being able to revise or rescind the hated tax or to curb the influence of money in politics. But the latest polls show that he has exceeded approval ratings of 60 percent. The Japanese turned to him when they were weary of scandals and looking for stability. They seem to think that the fact he is trying is more important than his inability so far to succeed.
Japanese analysts say Mr. Kaifu has also eased trade tensions with the United States. By promising to make it easier for foreign countries to export more goods to Japan, the Prime Minister has earned a reputation as someone who is taking Japan's trade imbalance with the rest of the world seriously.
President Bush has not hesitated to call on Mr. Kaifu to step up with his money bags and bail out the United States in difficult situations. Tokyo now is a major aid contributor to the Philippines. It is poised to contribute considerable sums to Eastern Europe and, if there can be a political solution, to Cambodia.
But the Prime Minister's aides say three looming issues cast a shadow over his hopes for continued popularity. First, the Middle East situation could put a squeeze on Japan, ending its current high rate of growth. Second, Mr. Kaifu could fail to make promised political reforms. In either event, voters could turn against him. Third, Mr. Kaifu faces a major challenge getting Government approval to open Japan to a small amount of rice imports. Rice farmers and agricultural interests have long had a stranglehold on the ruling party, and Mr. Kaifu could be defeated if he attempts to take them on.
Should Mr. Kaifu stumble, there are plenty of candidates waiting to trample over him. Several senior politicians, such as Shintaro Abe, a former Foreign Minister, and Kiichi Miyazawa, a former Finance Minister, are known to be coveting the top job and ready to pounce. Even Mr. Takeshita is believed to be looking for a comeback. With so many rivals working against Mr. Kaifu, many politicians say he will be lucky to finish his current two-year term in office, which expires in October 1991.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD: The Gulf;
Iraq, Though Vulnerable, Has Strong Cards to Play

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER

DATELINE: CAIRO

 BODY:
SADDAM HUSSEIN, ruthless and wily though he may be, must be an increasingly worried man.
In Iraq's most audacious move yet, Baghdad announced late last week that thousands of Americans, Britons and other Westerners trapped in Iraq and Kuwait would become human shields, scattered as hostages among potential military and civilian targets.
But a measure of Mr. Hussein's unease was visible in his declaration of a virtual surrender to Iran, an astonishing turnabout in which he gave up all of the disputed lands and his claim to exclusive control of the Shatt al-Arab waterway -the goals for which he waged an eight-year war that cost more than a million casualties and impoverished both nations.
It was that war on which he built his cult of personality as the defender of the Arab nation - with billions of dollars from the oil-rich nations he is now squared off against. 
The peace, immediately heralded by Iran as its greatest victory, would free up about 30 Iraqi divisions and, presumably, secure Iraq's eastern flank as Mr. Hussein turns his attention to the American-led forces assembling in the Saudi desert and the growing international armada steaming into the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea to enforce an economic embargo intended to break his hold on his tiny neighbor and former ally, Kuwait.
Saddam Hussein may feel vulnerable on the battlefield, but his moves against the Western hostages show that he is not without resources and the ruthlessness to use them. Indeed, Mr. Hussein's real strength is that he plays by no rules.
Iraq, with more than a million men under arms and 5,500 main battle tanks, has long been regarded as the most powerful military force in the Arab world. But this is a relative term. After quick initial gains by surprise in the war with Iran, the Iraqis' performance was hardly brilliant. It was only Mr. Hussein's willingness to use poison gas that stopped the Iranian human wave attacks.
The Iraqi President's style is that of a neighborhood bully, but his ability to size up his opponent's staying power is sometimes flawed. In 1980, he wrongly calculated that he could seize what he wanted in a few days from an Iran weakened and militarily demoralized by the Islamic revolution. Instead, his forces got bogged down in eight years of now pointless carnage. He appears to be basing his estimate of American steadfastness on the Reagan Administration's abrupt flight from Lebanon after suicide bombers detonated an explosive-laden truck at a United States Marines barracks near Beirut, killing 241 Americans. But that was a peacekeeping force; the troops now in Saudi Arabia are primed for combat.
As long as he sits tight in Kuwait and stays in power at home, Mr. Hussein has some advantages.
''He probably can't be beaten,'' said a Western diplomat who spent several years in Baghdad at the height of the Iran-Iraq war. ''The West is going to have to go home at some point and in five years' time, if Saddam wants to raise oil prices, all he'll have to do is snap his fingers.
''The man is not a retreater,'' the diplomat added. ''Who can force him out of Kuwait?
Perhaps the Americans can, but at a cost that can't be foreseen. It's not a walkover. The numbers are going to be big.
And whatever happens, he'll be able to bluster, bluster that he was the only one to stand up to the West, the foreigners, the imperialists.'' It is this effort to assume the Arab nationalist mantle of Gamal Abdel Nasser that the Iraqi leader seems to be banking on in the face of the unexpected closing of Arab ranks, led by Egypt, against him. In bombastic speeches, he has not only inveighed against the deeply resented foreigners, but set poor Arabs against rich, portrayed the oil-wealthy emirs as decadent, selfish spendthrifts and - in a touch odd for a leader who espouses an avowedly secular pan-Arab ideology -made a religious appeal to protect Islam's most sacred shrines in Saudi Arabia against the ''infidels.''
His speeches have a visceral appeal to many poor Arabs working in the gulf and to Palestinians in refugee camps, because much of what he says about other Arab rulers is not without truth. Few Arab regimes have real legitimacy; most rule through a combination of inertia and secret police. Of course, Iraq is one of the toughest police states of all, as millions of ill-treated Egyptian workers there can attest, but in a long confrontation Mr. Hussein might be able to win Arab supporters to his cause. In the meantime, he must appease those within his own military embittered by his acquiesence to the Iranians.
There is also the potential for terrorism: Abu Nidal, the renegade Palestinian terrorist, has reportedly moved his base back to Baghdad.
''This is the Middle East,'' said the diplomat who had served in Iraq, reflecting on the dizzying events of the past two weeks. ''For every scenario you can envisage, three more will pop up.''

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
Psychological Counseling From the Company Store

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER

 BODY:
AFTER two decades of rapid growth, employee assistance programs, which have helped millions of workers suffering from angst and workplace stress, are experiencing an identity crisis of their own.
In the best of circumstances, the programs offer a ''win-win'' situation. The worker receives professional help, either from in-house counselors or through referral to outside therapists or treatment programs, and is restored as a productive member of the team. The company reaps the benefits of reduced absenteeism and is spared the corrosive conflict of dealing directly with problem workers or their union representatives. 
The attractiveness of this proposition has fed the growth of a small industry that now provides aid to workers in more than 12,000 companies. Reliable numbers are hard to come by, but people in the field estimate that there are 10,000 to 12,000 counselors and other workers providing services to employees, including many who might not otherwise seek help.
Even when employees are referred for outside treatment, the employee assistance programs can help them keep down out-of-pocket costs, supporters say. ''A good E.A.P. is aware of the high costs of treatment and is certainly not going to send an employee to a service he cannot afford or which is not covered by his health insurance plan,'' said Tom Delaney, executive director of the Employee Assistance Professionals Association, Inc., an organization in Arlington, Va., with a membership of 6,300.
According to the association, maintaining an employee assistance program costs approximately $1.50 per month for every employee on a payroll, though only 5 to 10 percent may actually use the services over the course of a year. The sponsoring companies can expect a 5-to-1 return on this investment through savings made possible when a worker responds to counseling and job performance improves.
But some who are active in the field say that the rapid growth of the programs has created potential problems. They point out that states do not require certification of counselors. A few organizations representing employee assistance counselors offer certification of individuals or programs, and counselors may have graduate training in social work, counseling, psychology or administrative skills. But no clearly prescribed curriculum for the new specialty is taught at universities.
''Those in employee assistance have confused rapid growth and acceptance in the workplace as signs of professionalism but they are really entrepreneurs, bureaucrats and counselors,'' said Dr. Paul Roman of the Institute for Behavorial Research at the University of Georgia, an authority on the programs.
He said he is especially dubious of programs run for companies by outside contractors. ''Outside contracting is very attractive at a time of hiring freezes, but when they are set up off-site and the staff is not very visible and may not even know much about E.A.P. skills, which actually happens a lot, how can the human resource manager of a company feel assured that the services his employees are receiving are adequate?''
Employee assistance programs evolved out of efforts in the public and private sectors to deal with occupational problems and absenteeism caused by alcoholism. Following the social upheavals of the 1960's and 1970's, company managers saw both the humane and economic wisdom in offering drug abuse programs and counseling for workers with emotional disturbances. With health insurance costs accelerating over the last decade, employers have found even more incentive to try to hold down costs by offering some kind of relatively inexpensive counseling.
People in the industry recognize that possible conflicts of interest can arise when counselors privy to an employee's secrets are on the employer's payroll.
''Obviously there are circumstances when a counselor learns that a client is an immediate threat to himself or others and a third party has to be notified,'' said Dan Smith, director of employee assistance programs for McDonnell Douglas. The aerospace company is laying off 14,000 to 17,000 workers this year and has seen a sharp rise in activity at its employee assistance program.
It is probably natural for workers to wonder whether the problems they reveal to company counselors are leaked back to their bosses and used against them. Experts say that as companies have responded to pressure from the Federal Government to create drug-free workplaces, suspicions have increased.
 
Maintaining Independence
But Dr. William D. Weitzel, a psychiatrist at the University of Kentucky who has studied the programs for the American Psychiatric Association, said that breaches in confidentiality are rare and more a consequence of unprofessionalism than malice. The American Civil Liberties Union and the American Psychological Association agree with that view.
Some counselors are leery that their independence could be threatened as rising health-care costs tempt companies to try to hold down the number of employees referred to expensive outside programs specializing in mental illness or chemical dependency. To get a tighter grip on their assistance programs, some companies have brought in consultants, or ''gatekeepers,'' to take over the job of employee referrals and to reduce the in-patient options. ''Whether intentional or not, E.A.P. counselors were referring workers and their dependents to the more expensive in-patient facilities where the hotel costs of housing and feeding a patient are more than treatment costs,'' said Lawrence Hicks, president of a consulting firm in Glenview, Ill., that helps companies trim health-care costs. ''Some studies show out-care programs may produce better results,'' he said.
But supporters of the assistance programs say that it is to the counselors' credit when they recognize that treating a problem requires more expertise than exists within the walls of the company.
''The best E.A.P.'s are the greatest thing that ever happened to corporate America and the human beings who work for them,'' said Dr. Gary VandenBos, a psychotherapist and consultant in Washington who has helped companies set up assistance programs. ''The worst ones are utter disasters and nothing but a waste of money.''

HEADLINE: The True Cost of Energy;
Pay It: For Security, the Economy and the Air

 BODY:
Saddam Hussein's plunder of Kuwait only dramatizes something Americans have long known from the bottom of their gas tanks: Oil dependency breeds vulnerability.
One way or another, the Iraq crisis will end. But the vulnerability won't - unless America creates a national energy policy. That's no sanctimonious abstraction; it's a practical need. A sound energy policy would encourage domestic suppliers, insulate the economy against foreign manipulation, protect the environment and raise revenue. Congress could do it all in a stroke, by increasing energy taxes. 
President Bush has followed the Reagan energy policy: reliance on deregulated markets to guide consumers and producers, and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to offset supply disruptions. These are sensible principles. Deregulation has raised energy prices and cut use. And the reserve has warded off panic buying.
Yet the Reagan-Bush hands-off approach is not enough. Americans account for 2 percent of the world's population but consume an astounding 25 percent of the world's oil. Much of this consumption is wasted because low market prices take insufficient account of real costs.
One is national security. Every extra barrel consumed makes the U.S. that much more vulnerable to oil cartel cutbacks. The price Americans pay for imported oil covers none of the likely costs of future supply interruptions brought on by such dependence. Likewise, energy use fouls air and water and contributes to global warming. Yet consumers pay for none of this damage.
 
The Best Way to Pay
For all these reasons, consumers aren't paying the full costs of energy. The most effective way to do that is higher energy taxes. They would right the balance - and also avoid the need for a lot of micro-managing by Congress. Americans would switch to fuel-efficient cars without elaborate regulations; alternative fuels could become competitive without massive subsidies.
Congress would still have to decide which energy taxes to raise, and by how much. Each tax has a different regional and environmental consequence. Though there are few studies to guide the decisions, a tax that would add between 25 and 50 cents to the price of a gallon of gasoline would make a good start.
Debate over the pros and cons of various options must not overshadow the underlying principle: Americans are paying too little for energy.
 
Fill the Reserve
The Strategic Petroleum Reserve provides another pillar of energy policy. Large buffer stocks can offset temporary supply disruptions - and radically change oil exporters' calculations. These goals would be better served by expanding the reserve to 1 billion barrels from 600 million.
Its operating procedures also need revision. The reserve can be opened only by a Presidential declaration of an emergency. There are promising proposals to open it on an ongoing basis, subject to a fee that would allow Government to replace withdrawn supply at a profit. These proposals deserve serious review, before the next crisis.
 
Revive Nuclear Energy
It's a Federal responsibility also to promote new sources of energy. There is a relatively low-cost, non-polluting form of it, which gives France 70 percent of its electricity, Japan 30 percent but the U.S. only 18 percent: nuclear. One attractive option would be to join with our allies in designing a nuclear reactor so safe that all reasonable unease would be allayed.
The Iraq crisis has generated new oratory about energy independence. A tax that would take national security and the environment into account would mean only a moderate increase in the price of energy. But to achieve energy independence would require a draconian leap that would stifle the economy and cost millions of Americans their jobs. To press for energy independence for its own sake would be economically suicidal.
A wise energy policy must strike a balance between reduced dependence and an induced depression. The starting point is this proposition: Energy taxes must rise.

HEADLINE: Don't Measure Souter by the Size of His Town;
New Hampshire's Best

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Roy Brooks (Op-Ed, Aug. 1) suggests that among principal qualifications for the Supreme Court are (1) be married, (2) live in a city and (3) be known by name to Justice Thurgood Marshall.
Judge David H. Souter was not born where he now lives. He lived his first 11 years and at least 7 more years in college and law school in and about Boston. Boston, Harvard University and New Hampshire are not peopled exclusively by white, middle-class males. Southern New Hampshire has become a fast-growing extension of the greater Boston area, with its own share of urban problems. Moreover, our rural towns, such as Judge Souter's Weare, have more than their share of poor people. And within these small communities, middle-class, upper-class and poor people get to know and understand one another better than most city people do in their more economically segregated neighborhoods.
As a New Hampshire lawyer, I can assure you that any poll of our bar would produce virtual unanimity, among Republicans and Democrats, males and females, that for his human, as well as his intellectual qualities, Judge Souter is New Hampshire's best candidate for the Supreme Court position; and we are just proud enough to think our best is plenty good.

HEADLINE: Why Iraq Won't Make Israel Say 'Atom'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Why Israel May Show Its Nuclear Hand'' (Op-Ed, Aug. 6) by Yossi Melman, which concludes that Israel may soon publicly confirm its status as a nuclear weapons state, demonstrates the author's discomfort with Israel's policy of nuclear ambiguity. Periodic comments by Israeli politicians play a role in this policy.
For example, as early as December 1974, President Ephraim Katzir stated: ''It has always been our intention to provide the potential for nuclear weapons development. We now have that potential. We will defend this country with all means at hand. We have to develop more powerful and new arms to protect ourselves.'' 
This policy bestows many of the advantages of both open nuclear weapons possession and renunciation of nuclear arms, with few of the liabilities of either position. A public declaration that Israel possessed nuclear weapons would humiliate its Arab neighbors and further energize their interest in developing nuclear bombs.
Further, a public declaration would revitalize and help legitimize a Soviet role in the Middle East. In addition, it would outrage world opinion and increase Israel's isolation. Most important, Israel could jeopardize the substantial economic and military support that the United States has consistently provided.
Finally, if Israel believes it must shore up the credibility of its nuclear deterrent, there are a number of ways to do so without a public declaration. Another veiled statement by an Israeli official, or perhaps the granting of an interview with Mordechai Vanunu, the former nuclear technician who disclosed details of Israel's nuclear program to London's Sunday Times, would signal to Iraq the potentially devastating consequences of its aggression.
Short of an outright Iraqi attack on Israel that threatens the country's existence, however, there is little reason to expect that Iraq's recent brutality against Kuwait will force Israel into changing its policy of nuclear ambiguity.

The Invasion Vacation

BYLINE: By Anna Quindlen

 BODY:
We didn't want to take this vacation. It was the President's idea. I figured we should just call August on account of invasion, hunker down, and wait for the price of gasoline to reach the foie gras mark. The President would have none of this. ''The American people want to see life go on,'' he said.
This was not as easy as it sounded. As a patriotic gesture, we bought charcoal briquets and went to the middle of nowhere. The middle of nowhere was in the middle of a Middle East mania. News followed us to the outdoor art show and the Farmer's Market. 
The Village Grocery became Democracy Central. First thing in the morning, the bread delivery man, the milk delivery man and the man who runs the place would be clustered around the cash register, trashing King Hussein and tracking troop deployments. ''I think the President is right on the money,'' they said. This is the kind of place where the President is usually right on the money.
The gas station was raucous with gas-line lore, much of it macho and apocryphal. Testosterone filled the air. War will do that. You know the drill: ''Remember in '79 when you punched out that guy who tried to cut in line to put air in his tires, Phil?'' someone says. ''Hell,'' says Phil, ''I never punched him out. I ran over his foot. And it was '73.''
At the mall teen-agers in heavy-metal T-shirts sullenly absorbed current events. ''Saddam Hussein, man,'' they would say, if they could talk. ''He's toast.'' America has rallied round, and it is something to see. There's a local angle, no matter what the locality -American kids in khaki, folks like us held hostage and empty gas tanks. The story is writ large: friends, foes, a big bad guy with the sinister mustache of a James Bond villain. The Iraqis have replaced the Soviets in the evil empire role, much missed since we began playing ''I'm O.K., you're O.K.'' with the Russians. Polls show that Americans are more possessed by this story than by any in years.
People say it's hard to get away from it all because of the magic of cable television, fax machines, computer modems. But this time around it's democracy that's doing us in. Now that election campaigns bear more of a resemblance to MTV than to statesmanship, we've got two ways to reaffirm what this country stands for. One is the jury room, with its miraculous ability to turn 12 bumbling United States citizens into paragons of diplomacy, objectivity and thoughtfulness.
The other is crisis management. Iraq invades Kuwait and - Bingo! -all Americans become experts on the Middle East, dependence on foreign oil, and chemical warfare. It's one of the enduring strengths of this country that the average guy at the corner store believes he has some small influence, and some great responsibility.
''That Iraq fella is going to get what's coming to him,'' said the man waiting in the barbershop to get his short hair cut shorter. ''That's my prediction.''
There's something for everyone here. The word Vietnam, which keeps cropping up in discussions about troop strength and American involvement, speaks to the collective memory of one generation of Americans. The word Hitler, which has been used profligately in discussions of the Iraqi leader, speaks to another. (The public-opinion mavens who've been asking people how Hussein compares to Hitler should be prosecuted for carrying a loaded question.) The angle for kids: Saddam Hussein is Bart Simpson cubed. Bad attitude, dude.
Life goes on, but not on its usual track. Even the President couldn't keep up the illusion of normalcy. He vacates well, but he has to watch appearances. People still remember that he went hunting at the tail end of the Panama invasion.
He told the rest of us to go on with our lives, and then instead of staying put in Kennebunkport, with the phone in his golf cart and his cigarette boat, he took a short trip back to Washington. It was a Daddy vacation. A couple of days in a business suit, a couple of days in a vest with lots of little pockets and hooks and feathers all over it. Takes me back. This all takes me back. Gas shortages, double-digit inflation, trouble in the Middle East - these are the things that shaped my formative years. I thought someday we'd gather around the Weber kettle and pass them along to our children in stories and song. Now they're experiencing them firsthand. All they hear about is the Middle East, and Lyme disease. ''Are we having a war?'' one asked, and in the fashion of my times, I answered, ''Sort of.'' Then we toss a Frisbee around, and wait to hear the news from around the world at the roadside produce stand.

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
From Mirage To War

BYLINE: By A. M. Rosenthal

 BODY:
A country that emerges from one war without knowing why it came about prepares the way for another war - with the same enemy or his clones.
Now, while memories are fresh, is the best time to figure out why we find ourselves again facing one of the expansionist tyrants who are this country's natural enemies, why we are again so surprised by it all.
This is the historical starting point: Arab leaders and the West have treated the Middle East and its people as objects to fulfill their own power, ambitions and lusts.
The Arab leaders made sure to keep tribal or feudal systems and political or religious despotisms intact. That is how they prevent the Middle East from moving into a fresher world, which could challenge or discard them. 
While much of the world struggled for new political and economic ways, the Arab world has remained ruled entirely by hereditary, military or religious tyrannies and homemade economic monopolies.
With Western support nations like India and Japan moved to freedom from foreign colonialism or domestic imperialism. Elections were held from South Korea to Nicaragua. In the past year, the bells rang in Eastern Europe, bringing hope to all who yearned for freedom's grace.
But in the Middle East, the West looked on benignly as dynastic jailers kept their people in political cellars.
Why? For one reason: The West and the Middle Eastern rulers have floated in a pool of assumed common interest - oil.
National boundaries were usually drawn by Western colonial offices. The economic future of the area was decided by a combination of local rulers, Western ministries and oil companies.
Western ''experts'' said solemnly that Arabs and democracy did not mix - religion and tradition, you know.
Too many Western academic and government specialists, writers and journalists came to believe in a mythological Islamic world, a mirage of tolerance, brotherhood and chivalric rulers.
It was a fantasy world where strangers were fed roasted lamb, and never ever taken hostage. It satisfied the consciences and ambitions and sometimes scratched the erotic itches of foreigners who built their careers around the Middle East. (Reading list: the sensitive, rich books of Bernard Lewis, director of the Annenberg Research Institute of Philadelphia and Princeton University professor, including his latest, ''Race and Slavery in the Middle East.'') But it was a fantasy built on the contemptuous idea that Arabs could not aspire to or practice democracy.
The result of the confluence of Arab-Western oil interests and mythology - and later Moscow's arming of Arab dictators - is that not a single Middle Eastern ruler has been freely chosen by his people, not a one.
They rule by heredity of recent vintage, like the Saudis, by coup, like Saddam, by a no-opposition ''referendum,'' like President Mubarak of Egypt, or by imposition of the British colonial office, like King Hussein of Jordan.
Yesterday's history but it has become today's war. Arab rulers tried to protect themselves by making religious fanaticism or zealotry for the ''Arab nation'' the only political currencies in the Middle East. Torture and death are the price of talking about freedom.
The rulers stoked frenzied nationalism. It helped build Saddam as it did Assad of Syria, the terrorist paymaster who is now our 15-minute ally and one day will turn against us again.
And in Washington our specialists were so wrapped up in their Middle East fantasies that they refused to hear Saddam's threats against us until he stuck his gun in their ear.
The Arab nations are dangerous not because Arabs are born with knives in their mouths but because with our help, only dictators rule. Because they are unchosen, dictators are insecure. Insecure rulers with armies are dangerous by definition.
Time and again the U.S. has found itself at war with one of them; democracy and despotism threaten each other. When was the last time the U.S. found itself at war with a democracy?
But Arab nationalism is not inevitable or unstoppable. The Arab world has never had a chance to hear freedom-loving dissidents or an elected leader who might argue against hatred and Holy War.
We certainly cannot create Arab democracy. But we can support it if it ever begins to appear. Meanwhile, in decency to people who live under any dictatorship, we can throw away our tales of the Arabian nights.
If we do, we may even save ourselves from fighting another war, on the same battleground.

HEADLINE: A Kentucky Home Afloat

BYLINE: By Erik Sandberg-Diment; Erik Sandberg-Diment is a writer who lives in Connecticut.

 BODY:
The dense jungle filling the cove that surrounded our mooring was barely visible in the breaking dawn. An orchestra of birds wrapped their melody around the syncopation of an ancient percolator in the galley as I sat, feet propped on the bow rail, watching the mist lift from the landscape. There was no visible sign of civilization, recalling the shore of some remote Pacific Island until the brightening daybreak revealed the jungle to be tulip trees, sycamores, cedars and maples.
We were in fact lost somewhere on a lake in southern Kentucky. The previous afternoon we had rented a houseboat and set out to explore Lake Cumberland, a crystal-clear 63,000-acre manmade mountain lake almost unknown to anyone beyond the heartland of America. My wife and I and our two children were there (in June) simply because a fishing friend in Iowa had suggested the trip.
Inexperienced at houseboating - although the four of us had vacationed together on a canal boat in England - we had gone through the marina's five-minute ''skippers' training'' program: ''This is the way you choke the engine to start; use only our bathroom tissue in the marine toilet or it will clog and you'll have to pay for repairs; take the key out of the ignition if you use the swimming ladder in back; the emergency channel on the radio is 16, call us if you need help.'' 
Our instructor had then backed our houseboat out of its slip and maneuvered it past another 30 or so houseboats to the mouth of the marina. Turning the wheel over to us, he said, ''Good luck!
If you need to dock, just bring the boat this far, honk twice and we'll come pick you up.'' He stepped into his dinghy and roared back to shore.
''All right, you take the wheel,'' I said to Tanya, our 16-year-old daughter, ''and I'll try to figure out where we're going.''
This had proved easier said than done. Because of its steep shoreline, Lake Cumberland (which is about 80 miles south of Lexington) has almost no houses or other manmade landmarks along its edge. Since no geodetic or navigational charts were available where we rented the boat, our aides consisted of a complimentary Lake Cumberland map from the Regional Information Center, pretty but not very specific, and the slightly more detailed Westmorland fishermmen's version. Both showed the water as blue, the Cumberland foothills as green - equally green no matter what their height - and the few access roads to the lake in black or red. The fishermen's map also indicated submerged building sites, creek channels and cemeteries from the days before the Wolf Creek Dam was built, when the lake bottom had been an agricultural valley - none of these exactly navigational landmarks. Neither map gave any sense of scale for the first-timer on the relatively narrow, serpentine lake.
The one thing obvious from both maps was that Lake Cumberland has an incredibly jagged and serrated shoreline, which explains how a 100-mile-long lake can boast a 1,300-mile-long shore. I passed the maps around and we all agreed that we were in the middle of a big U the lake makes at the conflux of Lily, McFarland and Wolf Creeks - unless we were already much farther along, all the way to Difficulty Creek. Mercifully, no one at that point suggested we were up it without a paddle.
''We have to find a small cove to anchor in before it gets dark,'' I said, employing a navigational inaccuracy, since boats on Lake Cumberland don't come with anchors. The water is simply too deep for an anchor in most spots, often dropping 30 or more feet just 10 feet from shore and reaching soundings of hundreds of feet toward its middle.
Half an hour and a dozen coves later - all but one unoccupied - we finally pulled into a steep-sided valley that we all agreed was perfect and nosed our nameless houseboat, No. 8, up against a shore-bound log. We had two stern lines tied to firmly rooted trees at the approved 45-degree angle, the bow deck gas grill running hot and both kids frolicking in the aquamarine water all in the space of five minutes. Which is how I found myself the following morning fantasizing about Pacific islands while waiting for the mist to rise and the coffee to perk.
Eventually, the rest of the family joined me for breakfast on deck. After some shoreline exploration on foot, although extensive hiking is difficult because of the 45- to 90-degree ascent one must make along almost all of the banks - and some leisurely aquatic activity in water whose average summer surface temperature averages in the low 80's, we set off once more in search of a tiny cove.
Our journey was punctuated by ''There we are - no, that cove!'' and stabs at the map by everyone until Revell, our 10-year-old son, said, ''Hey, there's a launching ramp.''
''True. But it can't be,'' my wife, Susan, pointed out. ''There's absolutely nothing like that anywhere near where we are, according to this map.''
''Let's dock and see if we can find out where we are,'' Revell suggested.
Now I suppose I could comment here on my children's astute powers of observation. The launching ramp was deserted but for two battened-down small boats and an empty telephone booth. But I'll admit that what was really passing through my mind at the moment was that we were cruising along just fine, thank you. Why should I rock the boat? After all, I was getting the hang of maneuvering a 48-foot houseboat, but not yet taking comfort in the thought of actually docking.
At first, the idea of letting totally inexperienced people set off in such a large boat might seem total madness. But, as it so happens, Lake Cumberland is the perfect place for such neophyte ventures. Hugged tightly by the surrounding hills, the surface of the lake is unusually calm and wind free. The number of boats per acre is far less than one, rather than some multiple of 10 as is the case in so many East Coast lakes, so there's little danger of crunching encounters.
Then, too, the houseboats themselves are slow and stable craft. Venturing out on them may well be described as boating for those who get seasick. Except for an occasional rocking set off by the wake of a passing boat, these nautical quarters are as steady as a mountain cabin. With a modicum of care and caution, anyone can handle a houseboat on Lake Cumberland comfortably within a short period of time. (Ours, one of about 200 houseboats operated by a dozen marinas on the lake, had one sleeping cabin and a living space with cooking facilities and, off to one side, double bunks.) We continued up the lake, mooring in a small bay for lunch. Part of the pleasure is not the boating itself, but simply lolling around the deck while at rest.
It was the lolling around part that I had difficulty convincing the rest of the family about. Right after lunch Revell discovered a geode on shore. Tanya hopped over the rail and began searching for her own specimen along the rock-strewn coast, soon followed by Susan on a similar mission.
They weren't great geodes, mind you. The crystals growing in their hollow cavities appeared for the most part to be a poor grade of amethyst. Still, I couldn't be a stick-in-the-mud. I joined in, picking up the smooth round baseball-size sandstone rocks and cracking them open like walnuts against larger rocks. ''The lighter they are, the bigger the hollow.'' ''Look at the crystals in this one!''
Three hours later, we left what in our family was now known as Geode Bay. We headed back out to open water laden down with a cargo of geodes, a tire complete with rim that must have broken free from someone's dock and made an excellent boat bumper, and a ship now finally christened the M.V. Junkyard.
Our vessel's nickname and newly loaded deck notwithstanding, the litter and pollution besetting Lake Cumberland remains surprisingly slight. Two factors, however, could well combine to destroy this idyllic situation within the decade to come. First, boats on the lake are not currently required to have holding tanks. The marine toilets are equipped with macerators. Flush them, and everything in them is simply ground up and discharged into the water.
Secondly, there is a proposal by a local underwear manufacturing company to use the lake as a liquid dump. The plan is to pump industrial waste into the lake via pipeline, the idea being that this inland sea would be large enough to dilute and absorb the effluent without noticeable deterioration in water quality.
What a sad mistake that move would be, I thought as we cruised along the clear surface of what is still, below its now generous expanse, the Cumberland River. Daniel Boone had once canoed this very river as far as French Lick (now Nashville) on one of his long hunts.
That evening we again found a deserted spot to call our own for the night. We moored against a small island - there are not many on the lake, but the ones there are are lovely - about 20 times as long as our boat. Some 30 feet of sheer layered rock face rose above us, twisting stunted lone pines clinging precariously to it by the path ascending its ridge. Scaling its pinnacle was somehow like traversing a magnified bonsai garden.
At one end, the island descended to a flat ledge at water level. This outcropping was covered with large black and yellow butterflies. Tanya and Revell spent the dusk, between grilled hamburgers and a pile of grapes, mixing a sugar solution and feeding the butterflies. And so Butterfly Island was born in our memories.
Another night's mooring turned up fossils, and one afternoon was spent frolicking beneath a cascading waterfall at the headwaters of Indian Creek. As we traveled from mooring to mooring, Tanya and Revell, and even at times the grown-ups, took turns cooling off in the spray tossed up around them as they sat on a supersized inner tube towed behind the houseboat. Farther up the lake, the shoreline featured flatter areas permitting walking and exploring, though the rocks all over are sharp enough so that only the toughest of feet survive unscathed without shoes.
What at first had seemed as if it might be a very uniform, even monotonous lake was offering a new discovery every day, I reflected while stretched out on our upper deck. Lazing there as we explored various creeks and inlets was totally relaxing.
The steady hum and slight vibration of the engine made it feel as if one were on the deck of an ocean liner bound for an endless voyage -or maybe the African Queen. No, not the Queen, there weren't any leeches about. In fact, there weren't any real problems at all on Lake Cumberland. They'd been left behind in our week of bother-free houseboating.
 
CHARTING A COURSE FOR A LAKE TRIP
 
Planning
The best way to start planning for a Lake Cumberland houseboat trip is with a note or call to the Russell County Tourist Commission, Post Office Box 64, Russell Springs, Ky. 42642 (502-866-4333). You will be sent a map of the lake and brochures from the various marinas renting houseboats.
These brochures will require some careful perusing. What is one to make, for instance, of the description ''Sleeps up to 8, but no more than 10 please''? Follow-up calls to confirm prices, availability and what is included in the rental package will be needed. Some outfitters, for instance, include towels and bedding; others do not. Most rentals are for Monday through Friday afternoon; the weekend, including Friday evening and Monday morning, or a full week. The Monday through Friday rates are generally the most cost effective.
 
Boats and Rates
The boats range in size from a basic 48-footer, which may have an ice chest instead of a refrigerator and no hot water, to a deluxe 70-footer with V.C.R., microwave, full air-conditioning, wet bar and hot tub. We opted for the spartan model and thoroughly enjoyed it. The whole family agreed, after inspecting one of the luxury models, that it was more like a private motel than quarters befitting adventure.
Rates vary tremendously depending on time of year and duration of stay. They begin at just over $400 for four days on an economy houseboat and run up to $1,600 for the same period on a floating palace sleeping 10 in several private cabins during the height of the summer season. However, prices are sometimes flexible. This past June, for instance, business was fairly slow, and most of the docks were discounting their rentals. The $595 rental on our boat was reduced to $399 because of a special. Shop around. It pays.
When tallying up costs, be prepared to add another $25 or so a day for gasoline, which is normally not included in the rental. There are also liability waiver options to consider, as when renting a car. Many houseboat renters also take a small fishing boat ($50 a day), a ski boat (around $200 a day) and skis ($100 a day) or a personal watercraft ($150 a day) to add variety to their waterborne activities. We settled for towing a large inner tube.
 
Provisions
Food shopping can be done at stores near the lake - we went to a supermarket in Jamestown. The marinas usually sell some basic supplies. A final word for those wanting to sit on deck, preprandial cocktail in hand, watching the sunset. This part of the country is dry, alcoholically speaking. It will be strictly a bring-your-own party - unless you hook up with one of the local bootleggers, in which event a case of beer will run you $30 to $40 and the brand selection will tend to be on a you-take-what-you-get basis.E. S-D.

HEADLINE: Pregnant, Addicted - and Guilty?

BYLINE: By Jan Hoffman; Jan Hoffman, a staff writer for The Village Voice, will be a journalism fellow at Yale Law School this year.

 BODY:
Traveling West From Detroit about 200 miles along I-96, crack arrived in Muskegon County, Mich., late in September 1988. Or at least that's when the prosecutor Tony Tague first started noticing that a crime rampage was rocking this hard-scrabble, blue-collar county - the kind of siege that supposedly strikes only the nation's largest cities. With only 161,000 people scattered across 7 cities and 16 townships, Muskegon County, a scenic but tired factory area with an unemployment rate nearly double the national average, would appear to be scarcely worth the picking. ''The Detroit drug dealers told us that Muskegon is such a welfare town that it's guaranteed income for them when the checks come in,'' recalls Detective Sgt. Al Van Hemert, a ruddy veteran narcotics cop.
Muskegon's murders, break-ins and muggings began to rise dramatically. District judges were spending three days a week instead of one on drug cases, and the county jail became dangerously overcrowded. A special 72-CRACK phone line rang constantly. Tague, the 32-year-old son of a retired local police chief, conducted a high-profile antidrug crusade, but his office simply became overwhelmed. 
A year after crack hit the area, county social workers removed 27 children in just one month from crack-afflicted homes. Three of the children belonged to a 23-year-old black single mother named Kimberly Ann Hardy. Hardy came to the attention of the county's Department of Social Services because she was the first woman reported by Muskegon General Hospital to bear a child who tested positive for crack cocaine.
It was time, concluded Tony Tague, to send a message. Choosing a controversial new tactic already employed by prosecutors in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and Massachusetts, Tague ordered Kimberly Hardy arrested on the same charge prosecutors routinely use against drug dealers: delivering drugs in the amount of less than 50 grams, a felony in Michigan carrying a mandatory minimum jail term of one year and a maximum of 20 years.
To avoid becoming embroiled in debates over when the fetus becomes a person, the prosecutor contended that Hardy delivered crack to her son through her umbilical cord during the 90 seconds or so after the child had left the birth canal but before the cord was cut.
Almost from the outset, Tague maintained that his objective was not to send women to prison, but to protect children. As Sergeant Van Hemert says: ''We want to avoid becoming a Detroit or a New York. Our attitude is, 'Hey, let's stop it now!' It's a form of caring.''
Crack babies seem to be everywhere, and they will not go away. Cautionary images of shrieking infants, bug-eyed as if they are watching tape loops from hell, even march across public-service announcements during televised sports events. A frequently cited nationwide study claimed that last year, 375,000 children may have been affected by their mother's drug use during pregnancy. Strokes in utero and respiratory and neurological disorders are only a few of the most common problems plaguing these drastically underweight children.
Their suffering, to say nothing of the long-term social costs, is so staggering that people understandably want to turn on their perceived torturers: their mothers. ''If the mother wants to smoke crack and kill herself, I don't care,'' Sergeant Van Hemert says flatly. ''Let her die, but don't take that poor baby with her.'' In a 15-state survey by The Atlanta Constitution, 71 percent of the 1,500 people polled favored criminal penalties for pregnant women whose drug use injured their babies.
At their recent conventions, the National District Attorneys Association and the American Bar Association took up the national debate about law enforcement's increasingly aggressive role in penalizing these women: should the threat of criminal prosecution be used to drive them toward treatment? Michael Barber, the Sacramento attorney who was chairman of the A.B.A.'s family-law section this year, favors discretionary criminal sanctions, such as supervised probation, as well as ''threatened incarceration if, when she's pregnant, she's still taking drugs.'' Although many legal experts prefer that these cases remain in family courts, which can order treatment and removal of children but not jail sentences, Barber is dubious. ''Family courts don't provide the control factor in the mother that we need to prevent the repetition of this activity,'' he says.
In the last few years, more and more judges and lawmakers have come to view these mothers as criminals who victimize children, rather than as victims themselves. Since 1987, 19 states and the District of Columbia have instigated more than 50 criminal proceedings against mothers for drug abuse during their pregnancies, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, which has vigorously opposed these measures. (With the exception of a few cases, prosecutors have not gone after pregnant alcoholics. In many states, giving alcohol to a minor is only a misdemeanor.) Last summer, Jennifer Johnson of Florida became the first woman in the country to be convicted of making a drug delivery to her baby; she was sentenced to 14 years on probation. Most prosecutors concede that widespread prison terms for pregnant mothers are not feasible. But in May, a Kentucky woman who gave birth to three children during her 17-year addiction to pills and intravenous drugs was sentenced to five years in prison for criminal child abuse. In North Carolina a few months ago, a prosecutor charged an addicted mother whose newborn had a positive toxicology test with a more pernicious crime - assault with a deadly weapon.
''The war on drugs has degenerated into a war on women,'' says Alan S. Rapoport, Kim Hardy's attorney. ''And why is it that all these straight white men are telling pregnant women how they should act and feel?''
Feminists and civil libertarians argue that prosecuting women for what is in essence their conduct during pregnancy abrogates constitutional rights to privacy and turns pregnant users into second-class citizens, deprived of equal protection. They also invoke the ''slippery slope'' argument - if the line isn't drawn at drug abuse, will prosecutors go after pregnant women for drinking, smoking or even taking aspirin?
Prosecutors maintain that they are simply protecting children. But defense attorneys retort that law-enforcement officials are forcing a wedge between mother and child, making the relationship adversarial - ''fetal rights'' versus ''maternal rights.'' Their interests should instead be seen as joined, argued a recent Harvard Law Review article on state intervention during pregnancy. ''The harm to the fetus does not make the woman's addiction more criminal. Rather, it highlights the severity of her disease.''
But at least eight states now include drug exposure in utero in their definition of child abuse and neglect - and many more have legislation pending. Some states and many local jurisdictions require nothing but a positive drug test to remove an infant from a mother. Dr. Ira J. Chasnoff, who supplied an affidavit supporting Hardy, says that penalties against addicted mothers tend to fall much more heavily on poor minority women. As an example, Dr. Chasnoff, the founder and president of the National Association of Perinatal Addiction Research and Education, points to Florida's Pinellas County, where pregnant black users are nearly 10 times more likely to be reported for substance abuse than pregnant white users. Treatment programs for pregnant addicts are scarce enough, he warns; prosecutions only scare addicts away from seeking even basic prenatal care, for fear they'll be turned in.
Dr. Chasnoff doesn't have much regard for the legal theory that cocaine is passed through the umbilical cord just before it's clamped. ''Good ethics and good law have to be based on good science,'' he says, ''and we just don't have that kind of data.''
State courts have been divided over whether indicting pregnant addicts is within the scope of existing drug-delivery statutes. Michigan is now considering the question. On June 2, a few days before Hardy was to go on trial, the Michigan Court of Appeals, in a highly unusual move, elected to hear arguments about whether her case should be tried in the lower circuit court or be thrown out altogether. A decision will probably not be reached until early this fall. The outcome of the Hardy case, which is being eagerly awaited across the country by law-enforcement officials, civil libertarians and feminists, as well as health-care officials, may help determine whether the door to future prosecutions will be open or closed, But with the exception of Hardy herself, perhaps no one is awaiting the decision more eagerly than a 36-year-old attorney and single mother named Lynn Ellen Bremer. On July 18, Bremer, who is white, became the second woman in Muskegon County to be bound over for trial on charges of drug delivery to her infant.
Kim Hardy smoked crack the night before she gave birth to her son, Areanis, on Aug. 20, 1989, as she freely admitted to Sergeant Van Hemert. Lynn Bremer told him that 40 hours before her daughter, Brittany, was born on April 10 of this year, she snorted a gram of cocaine with some friends to celebrate her birthday.
The prosecution developed its case against each woman in similar fashion. It began with drug tests, performed during labor. Hardy's urine had been screened for drugs shortly after she showed up at Muskegon General. According to a policy adopted by many public hospitals, Hardy qualified as a ''high- risk pregnancy'' - she'd had no prenatal care and was six to eight weeks early. At Hackley Hospital, Bremer's own obstetrician ordered her tested because he had known about her cocaine addiction for nearly five months. Despite his threats to drop her as a patient if she didn't stop using, she had refused both residential and outpatient treatment.
But neither woman was asked to sign an informed consent for the screens on herself or her child - which defense attorneys across the country have turned into a key issue in many of these cases. Hardy's lawyers argued that the tests violated her rights to privacy and against self-incrimination. Meanwhile, the prosecution maintained that drug-testing constitutes sound medical practice and that permission could be considered to have been granted under the patient's general consent form. Bremer's daughter weighed 6 pounds and was apparently healthy. But Hardy's 5-pound son was jaundiced, constipated and could not keep down his formula; he had a small head and developed a mysterious infection. After the women were discharged, the hospitals kept the infants for observation, tested them for drugs and reported the positive results to the Department of Social Services. Both Hardy and Bremer were given 24 hours' notice to appear at emergency hearings to determine the temporary removal of their newborns. Although social workers later remarked that neither of Hardy's older children, then 4 years old and 11 months old, respectively, appeared neglected, because of the positive tests on the newborn and her admitted use, they too were immediately sent to foster care.
In despair over losing their children, Hardy and Bremer used drugs one more time. Then they entered 30-day residential treatment programs. While Tague took credit for this, both women asserted that their motive was to clean themselves up and get their children back. Tague announced to the news media that they would be arrested once their treatment had been completed.
Drug use, which both women admitted, is a rarely applied misdemeanor in Michigan that's punishable by probation - especially in a first-offense case. But because they were pregnant when they used drugs, they were charged instead with the felony of drug delivery. ''Arrest pregnant women for possession or use, the same thing you'd arrest a man for,'' says Lynn Paltrow of the A.C.L.U. ''But these women are being prosecuted for the crime of becoming pregnant while having an addiction problem.''
Tague has little patience for this line of thinking: ''It's easy for the defense attorneys to throw out academic arguments about why we should not be proceeding. Why aren't they concerned about the constitutional rights of the child to be born drug free?''
Judge Frederic Grimm Jr. of District Court, who had ordered Hardy to stand trial after preliminary hearings, took a narrow focus in his ruling. ''I feel sympathetic toward the defendant,'' he said recently, ''but her behavior is proscribed criminal behavior. And you don't excuse it by saying she's disadvantaged or a mother.''
Shortly after the birth of her second child, Nyeassa, in the fall of 1988, Kim Hardy had started smoking crack. A friend from New York had introduced her to the new drug. In Muskegon, crack comes in miniature Ziploc plastic bags and sells for an inflated $20 a rock. ''It was the 'in' thing to do in Muskegon Heights,'' says Hardy. ''I had no sense of the danger.'' Soon, she was snitching her boyfriend's household money and showing up at the low-rise projects in the Heights where young dealers clustered in the parking lots.
As she recounts her story, Hardy seems older than 23. She is blunt, with a no-nonsense gravity that occasionally makes way for a tart sense of humor. ''I am not a welfare mother,'' she says evenly. ''I am on assistance.'' She grew up in Newton, Miss., where her three children have been living in the foster care of her parents. Her father, an auto mechanic, and mother, an industrial seamstress, used to drive the family around the country during summer vacations, which only whetted Hardy's appetite to leave town as soon as possible.
In her senior year of high school, she became pregnant, the last of her circle to do so. Abortion was not an option. Her parents were Jehovah's Witnesses, and a child, she felt, ''was the one thing in the world that was mine. He was a part of me, my body.'' She managed to get her high-school diploma and four years ago moved with her son, Darius, to Muskegon, where she had relatives.
Muskegon is a rough place to make a fresh start, with thousands of Dutch, Polish and black workers laid off from auto-parts factories gone belly-up in recent years. She finally got a job on an assembly line at Stanco Metal Products. When she became pregnant with Nyeassa, the smell of burning oil exacerbated her nausea. She quit and went on assistance, intending to go back to work a few months after the baby was born.
Ronald Brown, her 35-year-old boyfriend, already had four children by a former wife when he met Kim. Those children, who had been exposed to drugs, alcohol and violence throughout their lives, were now scattered throughout foster-care homes and prison. One, according to the Department of Social Services, which has worked with Ronald and his family for 14 years, was born severely disabled because of the mother's drug abuse and alcoholism. Ronald himself has been in alcohol-treatment programs for years.
After the birth of Nyeassa, her daughter with Ronald, Hardy's menstrual cycle was irregular and, she recalls, it wasn't until March of last year that she realized she had probably become pregnant again - within months of delivering Nyeassa. But by then, Hardy was having a lot of domestic turmoil with Ronald. She also had a serious crack problem.
''I was in a lot of denial,'' she says now. ''I thought I could cure myself.''
Even if Hardy had been willing to consider it, residential treatment would have been almost impossible to obtain. Very few programs nationwide accept pregnant addicts, largely because of liability problems posed by high-risk pregnancies. Medicaid covers only 17 days of a typical 28-day treatment, which, given the high recidivism rate of crack users in recovery, is like ''spitting in the ocean,'' says Barbara A. Klingenmaier, the Muskegon County foster-care supervisor.
Soon after she learned shewas pregnant, Hardy, convinced she had to get away from her crowd of crack users as well as her crumbling relationship with Ronald, took the kids home to Mississippi for the duration of her pregnancy. But by moving, she lost all her welfare benefits, including Medicaid. Unable to pay for clinic visits, she had to go without prenatal care. In August, hoping to patch up things with Ronald, she returned to Muskegon to give birth. They were going to call the baby Areanis, a name they had heard on a Star Trek episode.
Even though Muskegon County is cooled by shore breezes from Lake Michigan, it can smell pretty bad in the summer, when sour fumes from the paper mill or the waste-treatment plant blow in the wrong direction. Kim Hardy had been feeling heavy and uncomfortable all that steamy day, Aug. 19. A couple of Ronald's friends showed up in the evening and woke her up, offering her crack. Maybe, she thought groggily, it would help her relax and go into labor. The baby was so far along that a couple of hits couldn't possibly hurt.
Two months ago, Tague's office sent a letter to the Department of Social Services. The letter was a strongly worded request that the agency comply with a Michigan law requiring it to notify the prosecutor whenever it found instances of child abuse. By Tague's definition, child abuse included ''substantial evidence of cocaine or alcohol abuse by a woman during pregnancy.'' Social-service workers would now be additionally compelled to report details of the woman's addiction, as well as whether her umbilical-cord fluid had been tested. (An issue in both the Hardy and Bremer cases has been the preservation of evidence: neither umbilical cord was tested, much less saved.) The letter underscores the difficult and compromising position of the social workers, who are expected to both aid and inform on their clients. In Muskegon County, an unusual amount of interdepartmental quid pro quo is essential, because the prosecutor handles not only criminal matters but all Department of Social Services juvenile court cases as well. Social workers have to feed the prosecutor; otherwise, the cases may fall to the back of his calender.
Vicki Birdsall, a social worker who investigated both Hardy and Bremer and alerted Sergeant Van Hemert, doesn't have misgivings about her role. She even believes that prosecution can be ''therapeutic.'' But she thinks that drug delivery is too narrow a charge, and instead favors a statutory broadening of criminal child abuse to include fetuses. ''One of my coke babies had retinal damage and seizures and to me that is just as severe as somebody waling on a kid,'' she says.
But Barbara Klingenmaier, the foster-care supervisor who helped place the Bremer and Hardy children, maintains that criminal prosecution of drug-addicted mothers undercuts their fragile self-esteem and can impede recovery. She says these cases should remain under the jurisdiction of juvenile court, which has the authority to punish the mother by ordering children removed. ''That is the impetus to change their behavior in most of our cases,'' she says.
Tony Tague seems impervious to criticism that he's crossed over the line. ''We have taken progressive steps in prosecution,'' he says, ''and as a result have been engaged in a lot of controversy. Traditional means are no longer able to address the kind of problems we're confronting. There's a real need for innovative methods.''
Tague, who trained in the Manhattan District Attorney's office, is emblematic of the ''Thirtysomething'' generation of prosecutors - tough, of course, but also politically astute and ambitious. In putting his own imprimatur on the war on drugs, Tague has become a bona fide Muskegon celebrity whose office passes out stickers and pins that say: ''Help Tony Tague Fight Drugs!''
Tague maintains that a major goal of the Bremer and Hardy prosecutions has been accomplished: the women entered treatment. Because of his campaign, he says, more and more women have become aware of the dangerous connection between drugs and pregnancy: ''When physicians make suggestions, it doesn't appear that's enough for them to seek treatment. The possibility of prosecution is a strong incentive.''
Sitting in her attorney's office, which, in the way of small communities, happens to be in the same building at the Muskegon mall where she and Kim Hardy's attorney practice, Lynn Bremer vehemently shakes her head. ''Tony Tague is telling women to get treatment and they won't be prosecuted. I'm a perfect example of someone who tried to reach out, and it's all coming back in my face.''
Adds her attorney, Norman Halbower: ''You're guilty of not getting a cure soon enough.''
Bremer, who is from a well-to-do local family and clerked for several Muskegon County circuit judges, finally confessed her two-year cocaine addiction to her obstetrician about four months into her pregnancy. She was estranged from her family and, despite the admonitions of her boyfriend, also a cocaine user, she felt that the doctor was the only person she could turn to. ''I knew I couldn't quit,'' she says, ''and I wanted somebody to keep a check on me.''
The doctor urged her to go into a residential treatment program, but Bremer, having recently joined a law firm, did not want to jeopardize her job. Then, too, Bremer's long work days pretty much ruled out the possibility of even a four-hour-a-week outpatient program. So, instead, she saw a drug counselor for a half-dozen sessions. She did manage to cut down her use, she says, but still flunked a number of urine tests administered by her obstetrician. One time, knowing she would not pass, she even brought someone else's specimen to his office.
''I tried, I really tried, but I couldn't do it,'' she says, in a whispery, halting voice. ''I moved out of my boyfriend's house to get away from it, and I'd go along for a while, and then some people would come over and . . . it just looked good.''
In addition to her criminal case, Bremer, like Hardy, still faces a juvenile court case for neglecting her infant daughter, Brittany, who has been placed temporarily in foster care. Meanwhile, she has volunteered for random drug tests and warily goes for counseling. ''I feel betrayed,'' Bremer says. ''Everyone I talked to about my drug problem has been subpoenaed.'' ''
Bremer, while awaiting trial, is back at work now, but it's particularly difficult to appear as an attorney when everyone in the courtroom knows she's also a defendant. She questions whether she can get an unbiased trial in a county where she's argued cases before all the judges.
These days Bremer is living apart from her boyfriend, Jeffrey Coon, a 32-year-old assembly-line worker, who is also in recovery. ''Although we're on good terms,'' she says, ''sometimes it burns me up because he's not charged with anything, and he was right there doing it all with me. I wish he would have to do some squirming, too.''
Bremer's spirits are low. ''I'm embarrassed and sad,'' she says. ''My reputation is gone, and I still don't have my daughter with me. This whole thing has turned making a baby into a tragic event.''
On the last Saturday in June, hours before Muskegon's gala annual parade, Hardy is talking cheerfully about how things are finally looking up. ''Life is a lot simpler now,'' she says with a laugh. ''It's a lot cheaper without drugs.'' Hardy's been clean since mid-October. Social workers describe her turnaround as ''extraordinary.'' In a few short weeks, her kids, who are reportedly in fine shape, will be returned to her after a 10-month absence. She sees a drug counselor, has made a new circle of friends and has just rented a modest three-bedroom house in a predominantly white neighborhood of Muskegon. That gives her pause, but at least it's far away from her old haunts. Besides, she is thankful that someone was willing to rent to her.
Since her case broke in the papers, she's become a public figure. She can't find a job, she says, because she is recognized as that drug mother. ''Some people look at me like I'm an infection,'' she says.
But this fall, she starts classes in Muskegon Community College's new chemical dependency program. Noting the lack of black female counselors, Hardy says she intends to get a master's degree and become a drug therapist.
In retrospect, although she doesn't believe that she should be facing the prospect of going to jail - to say nothing of being prosecuted in the first place - Hardy is actually grateful for what's happened to her: she's stopped smoking crack. ''Why is it that we have to make women criminals before we can get them drug treatment?'' asks Kary Moss of the A.C.L.U.
One of Hardy's attorneys, Alan Rapoport, has an answer to Moss's question. ''This crusade is not about getting women into treatment or protecting babies,'' he says acidly. ''It's about winning the war on drugs.''
Moss points out that in spite of Tony Tague's insistence that he is inspiring addicted mothers to get help, the real choice is not between prosecution and treatment, but between prosecution and virtually nothing. Most drug programs were set up to treat male heroin addicts and have no obstetrician on staff. A recent study by Dr. Wendy Chavkin of the Columbia University School of Public Health and Beth Israel Medical Center found that 87 percent of New York City's drug-abuse programs turned away pregnant crack addicts, even though the women were eligible for Medicaid. And the rare clinics that do admit them almost never have child-care facilities - a critical shortcoming for most mothers.
The effects of Tague's prosecutions are certainly being felt at the recovery-care unit at Muskegon General Hospital, which now has 11 beds for residential treatment and four for detoxification. Cheryl Gawkowski, a staff psychologist, reports that some pregnant addicts have sought help specifically because of their fear of going to jail, while others have avoided prenatal care altogether for exactly the same reason. ''I go back and forth on the issue,'' she admits.
Hardy's opinion doesn't waver at all. A pregnant addict should be encouraged as strongly as possible to enter treatment, she says, but not forced to go. ''She has to do it for herself,'' Hardy says. ''It's a disease - just like alcoholism - and women are not going to stop until they're ready.''
Only if the child is born testing positive for drugs, Hardy believes, should social services use their authority to intervene, removing the baby until the mother gets treatment. ''Prosecutors don't protect babies, child protective services workers do,'' she says.
She doesn't know how long her own case will be hanging over her head. ''It could take years. But for today, things are O.K., and I'm just looking forward to my kids coming home.''

HEADLINE: Cory Aquino's Downhill Slide

BYLINE: By Stanley Karnow; Stanley Karnow recently won the Pulitzer Prize for his book ''In Our Image: America's Empire in the Philippines.''

 BODY:
Corazon Cojuangco Aquino glides into the reception room, smartly dressed in a pastel peach suit. Smiling warmly, she radiates serenity and self-confidence as she chats about her family, her travels, the weather. I have known her for two decades, and she has always appeared to be extraordinarily poised, even under enormous stress - a trait she attributes to her fatalism. Now, however, her composure seems to mask a certain uneasiness. She recoils when I seek to steer the conversation toward the problems facing her presidency - as if an admission of troubles might be construed as a sign of weakness. But she is indeed beleaguered by daunting difficulties.
In July, an earthquake that devastated central Luzon, the most populous island in the archipelago, dramatized the inability of Aquino's Government to cope with a crisis. Not only was its relief effort sluggish, but she was further embarrassed when troops from Clark Air Base and the Subic Bay Naval Station - the two major American bases in the Philippines - arrived on the scene first, thus underlining her dependence on the United States. 
Aquino is haunted by dissident army groups, which have already tried six times to oust her. Not a week passes without fresh rumors of a new coup, and one may succeed before 1992, the year she has vowed to retire after her six-year term expires. Neither is she safe from assassination in a land where political violence is endemic. Never far from her mind is the memory of her husband, Senator Benigno (Ninoy) Aquino Jr., who was murdered at the Manila airport in August 1983 as he returned from exile in Boston to challenge Ferdinand E. Marcos, whose corrupt autocracy was crippling the country. She mobilized the opposition and staged a spectacular election campaign. After a military mutiny and prodding from Washington, Marcos and his wife, Imelda, fled to Honolulu in February 1986.
''Ninoy used to say that Marcos would leave so many problems behind that whoever followed him wouldn't last six months,'' Aquino has repeatedly recalled to me and others as an indirect way of emphasizing that she has not only defied that gloomy forecast but has made notable progress.
She regularly points out in public speeches that she has rebuilt the democratic institutions dismantled by Marcos and revived a measure of faith in the shattered economy. She proudly cites her record in servicing the country's $28 billion foreign debt, another consequence of Marcos's profligacy. She claims credit for the decline of the Communist insurgency, which grew to alarming proportions during Marcos's regime. She further asserts that ''people power'' - as she called her drive to unseat Marcos - kindled resistance to dictators elsewhere in Asia and even spread to Eastern Europe.
For all her achievements, however, Aquino has lost the luster she enjoyed after toppling Marcos, when the world exalted her as the devout housewife who had exorcised evil. Her approval ratings in the Philippines, once astronomic, have dropped to below 50 percent.
Yet her critics sound sorrowful rather than angry, disappointed rather than hostile. ''We like Cory personally, but nothing has changed,'' is a refrain I heard more and more in towns and villages. Though they hector her relentlessly, Manila's flamboyant politicians and newspaper columnists temper their derision with deference. A noted commentator, Luis Beltran, said a few months ago, ''She is sincere, moral and honest, but the presidency is obviously beyond her, beyond her capabilities, beyond her experience.''
President Bush is reported to be distressed by Aquino's lack of direction. ''We're committed to her, and we hope that she'll muddle through,'' says a senior State Department official, ''but she simply doesn't know how to govern. Moreover, as the Soviet threat recedes, American strategists no longer see the Philippines as crucial to the security of the United States and their concern for the destiny of that Southeast Asian country has diminished accordingly.''
Aware that her glow has dimmed, Aquino has explained that her victory over Marcos raised expectations of miracles that she could not conceivably fulfill. But she fuels such illusory aspirations by portraying herself as divinely guided - a belief she holds as a devout Roman Catholic. Her defeat of Marcos, she intoned not long ago, ''was indeed a miracle'' as well as ''a symbol of God's love and the task he set us to do.''
Similarly persuaded that her virtue will serve as an example, Aquino prefers to remain aloof from the political fray. But many Filipinos submit that rectitude does not work in a feudal society like the Philippines, where local bosses and their political surrogates must be cowed, coddled or plied with patronage.
Armando Doronila, the editor of The Manila Chronicle, imputes Aquino's ''clumsy and arthritic reflexes'' to her unwillingness to exercise power. ''Her vision of the presidency is that of a figurehead,'' he has written, contending that she operates on the theory that the political institutions she restored would ''create their own magic and dynamism.''
Conspicuously absent from her approach is an imaginative vision for the country. John J. Carroll, an American Jesuit who has lived in the Philippines for many years, says, ''She is not a conceptual thinker.''
Aquino recently formed a new movement, Kabisig, roughly meaning ''linked arms,'' whose purpose is to inspire citizens to jolt the stagnant legislature and bureaucracy out of their inertia - and revive her waning popularity should she run for re-election. The traditional politicians - ''tradpols'' as the Manila press calls them - dismiss the movement as an effort to blame them for Aquino's own inadequacies. And they can obstruct her further, as they have been doing for years, by rejecting her appointments and tying up bills in committee.
The present mood of the Philippines reminds me of the 1960's, when I covered the country as a correspondent in Asia. The disorder, drift and doubt of that period prompted many Filipinos to support Marcos's imposition of martial law in September 1972, and I suspect that numbers of them might now welcome another Marcos, perhaps in different guise. For despite their love of freedom, Filipinos respect an iron hand. Marcos, who understood this duality, skillfully gave them doses of both - at least before his regime slid into decay. Revisiting Manila recently, I was surprised by the expressions of nostalgia for Marcos, who died in Hawaii last fall, especially from his former foes. ''With all his faults, he was a strong leader,'' several said, evoking his best years, when he enforced discipline and improved the economy.
This yearning for decisive leadership currently benefits Aquino's estranged cousin, Eduardo (Danding) Cojuangco, a former Marcos insider who amassed a pile from various monopolies. A vigorous figure beneath his gentle exterior, he fled to Los Angeles when Marcos fell, and subsequently hired Chwat/Weigend Associates, a firm of Washington lobbyists, to teach him to act like a statesman.
Returning covertly to Manila after Marcos's death, Cojuangco began organizing for the 1992 election, either to sponsor a presidential candidate or to run himself. He has lured a large following, mainly by dispensing money. His chances of gaining power may be thin, but for a one-time Marcos crony to attract support at all reflects the growing frustration with Aquino.
Other contenders for the presidency include Vice President Salvadore H. Laurel, who broke with Aquino in 1987, and Senator Juan Ponce Enrile, her former Defense Secretary. The most popular among them, judging from opinion polls, is Gen. Fidel V. Ramos, a West Point graduate and Aquino's present Defense Secretary.
''Manila is a place to make a fortune,'' Cory Aquino has said, citing as proof new construction, flourishing corporations and a lively stock market. But the boom has been lopsided. Expensive condominiums tower over squatter shacks that lack electricity and running water, while the extravagant parties at the lavish homes of the wealthy seem to be taking place a million miles away from nearby slums. Fancy restaurants cater to clients who spend more on a meal than a peasant earns in a month. The levels of destitution are such that the servants of the affluent themselves employ servants.
The income gap is visible in statistics showing that the top fifth of the population receives half of the national income. In 1988, the World Bank reported that half of the population lived in ''absolute poverty,'' their income unable ''to satisfy basic needs.'' The poverty is most glaring in rural areas, home to more than half of the country's 60 million people.
To a large extent, the President herself personifies the contrasts and contradictions that characterize the Philippines. ''Cory would have made a tremendous moral impact if she had started out by giving Hacienda Luisita to the workers,'' says Raul Locsin, the editor of a Manila business journal, referring to her family's vast sugar plantation. Instead, Aquino's family has profited from a toothless agrarian reform law that permits landlords to keep their property by selling a minority share to the workers over a 30-year period - at prices set by the landlords.
So Hacienda Luisita is shielded against reform. Its contract cane-cutters are packed into barracks located not far from airier pens that house the thousands of fighting cocks bred by the President's brother, Jose (Peping) Cojuangco. The plantation also boasts a superb 18-hole golf course.
The Philippine Congress, whose election in 1987 Aquino hailed as a hallmark of democracy, is dominated by landed and business factions opposed to change. She has not introduced effective measures to streamline the snarled bureaucracy, whose underpaid employees are responsive only to bribes. Out of religious conviction, she has been slow to endorse birth-control programs aimed at curbing the soaring population. Aquino and her husband were victims of Marcos's despotism, but she has ignored human-rights violations by vigilante groups, whose creation she approved as a weapon to combat the Communists. Aquino's plans to privatize state-owned enterprises like the Manila Hotel and Philippine Airlines have crumbled, partly because the appointees who direct them have been battling to keep their jobs. Cool to ''unsolicited advice,'' as she puts it, Aquino often disregards or revamps her cabinet, which, in any case, has been chronically divided by rivalries.
Her personal probity is above reproach, but rampant corruption costs the Philippine treasury some $2.5 billion a year - or about a third of the national budget. Shortly before his death two years ago, Joaquin Roces, a distinguished newspaper publisher and one of her early backers, startled Aquino at a reception by openly accusing her of yielding to ''vested interests, relatives and friends.'' Stung, she told an interviewer soon afterward that she had warned her family against taking advantage of her position. ''Short of ordering them to hibernate or go into exile,'' she added, ''I don't know what else I can do.''
To stroll through some of Manila's downtown streets requires sidestepping uncollected garbage, and driving through the city's chronically congested traffic is a nightmare. The breakdown in basic public services, the political uncertainties and mounting violence as well as corruption and bureaucratic tangles, have unnerved foreign investors, with potentially grave repercussions on the economy. A planned $360 million petrochemical plant, to be built by a Taiwan group, has been shelved, as has an electrical-power project contemplated by two American companies, Cogentrix and Caltex Petroleum. Of the 388 multinational corporations that maintained offices in Manila in 1985, only 120 remain - and many of those are pondering a pullout. The Communists, badly split by internecine disputes, have resorted to terrorism in an effort to sustain their momentum. Within the last three years they have killed seven American servicemen stationed at Clark Air Base and Subic Bay. All 261 members of the Peace Corps, the third-largest contingent abroad, were withdrawn in June as Communist guerrillas abducted a volunteer on the island of Negros. The volunteer was released earlier this month, but Washington's unilateral withdrawal had shocked Aquino, who had sought to dispel the picture of a country in turmoil.
Nothing, however, has afflicted her more than dissension within her military establishment. The army, modeled on American lines during the period of United States colonial rule, before World War II, had scrupulously avoided politics - until Marcos imposed martial law. He co-opted his generals by giving them smuggling and other illicit privileges, which alienated younger officers who felt that favoritism and corruption were hobbling their fight against the Communists.
The disaffected officers created the Reform Armed Forces Movement, or R.A.M., under the auspices of Juan Ponce Enrile, who was then Marcos's Defense Minister but was turning against him. In February 1986, Enrile and Ramos, at the time Marcos's acting Chief of Staff, triggered the military mutiny that catapulted Aquino into office.
Recalling her husband's years in army jails during the Marcos years, Aquino at first distrusted the dissident soldiers and even denied her debt to them. But, recognizing their strength, she soon acceded to their demands. She retreated from promised social reforms, gave them greater latitude to fight the Communists and ignored their human-rights abuses.
Emboldened, the rebels launched a series of comic-opera coups designed to intimidate rather than overthrow Aquino. Each time, fearful of antagonizing them further, she punished them lightly - in one case ordering them to do 30 push-ups. In August 1987, however, dissident soldiers staged a serious, though abortive, uprising that left 53 dead.
Aquino seemed to be recovering from that attempt when, on Dec. 1, 1989, rebel troops again attacked. They were close to winning when President Bush, heeding her appeal for help, sent in two Phantom jets from Clark Air Base, 50 miles north of Manila, to protect Malacanang, the presidential palace, against the dissidents' planes. The American display of force initially deterred the rebels, who may have also been discouraged by a White House warning that all American aid would be cut off if they prevailed. Nevertheless, they fought on for nearly a week, and more than 100 Filipinos, most of them civilians, were killed before a truce was declared.
Even Aquino's most vocal critics were relieved when the coup failed, concluding that, for all her defects, she was preferable to a military junta. But the assault shook her badly. If crowds did not rush out to acclaim the rebels, neither did they pour into the streets to cheer Aquino. And her plea for American intervention predictably drew charges that, out of gratitude for her rescue, she would bow to American pressure to retain the bases in talks then due to start. Aquino has privately hinted that she favors renewing the leases on the bases, at least for a limited time. To deflect her nationalist critics, however, she will say publicly only that she is ''keeping my options open.''
The uprising also revealed a new dissident army faction: the Young Officers Union, or Y.O.U., composed mainly of majors and captains. More ideological than R.A.M., it has called for ''genuine national and social liberation'' - a slogan that has inspired conjecture that the group might join the Communists in a coalition.
Six weeks after the attempted coup, President Bush sent a special envoy to Manila on a mission that aggravated Aquino's woes at home and further impaired her image in Washington.
Bush's deputy national security adviser, Robert M. Gates, met alone with Aquino. After reaffirming America's support for her Government, Gates bluntly told her to ''get your house in order'' by regaining the allegiance of the army, checking corruption and bureaucratic red tape, and introducing urgent economic and social reforms. ''The most pressing problem is stability,'' he reportedly said. ''It's time to stop putting off the hard decisions.''
American officials recalled that Aquino had ''listened impassively'' to Gates. However, Filipinos close to her revealed that she was ''stunned'' by Bush's message, and doubly wounded when American officials, to intensify the pressure on her, leaked its details to the American press. She was even more rankled when Congress cut $96 million off a proposed $481 million assistance package to the Philippines as part of a global reduction in foreign aid.
Aquino retaliated in February by refusing to see Dick Cheney, the United States Defense Secretary, then due to arrive in Manila on a tour of Asia. Never before had a Philippine leader snubbed a high American official, and her gesture ignited protests in Washington, where it was read as a gambit to extract more aid for the bases.
Representative Patricia Schroeder, a Colorado Democrat who heads a House subcommittee on Military Installations and Facilities, accused Aquino of ''upping the ante.'' Toby Roth, a Wisconsin Republican and member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, asserted: ''Let them keep their bases. We do not want them, we do not need them. They are only an albatross around the necks of the American people.''
Bush was equally dismayed, but he admonished Aquino in his typically casual manner. ''Listen,'' he said in a newspaper interview, ''every time I talk to Dick Cheney I come away smarter. . . . So maybe you'd be like me, maybe you could learn from the man - or he could learn from you.''
Aquino's rebuff of Cheney boosted her stock in Manila, where newspapers blared headlines like ''Cory Gets Tough.'' But several Filipinos, her partisans among them, soon began to chide her for ''overreacting.'' While tweaking Uncle Sam's nose might be gratifying, several observed, American ''rent'' for the bases and other expenditures bring in about $1 billion a year. Aquino's former press secretary, the columnist Teodoro Benigno, wrote: ''We lose a lot in this refusal, because it is based on personal pique and not . . . on the national interest.''
Nevertheless, convinced that flexing her muscles would enhance her popularity, Aquino went after Enrile, her fiercest critic, now a senator. Late in February, she ordered his arrest for ''rebellion and murder'' in connection with the aborted December coup - the same charge she had denounced as ''politically motivated'' when Marcos had used it to jail her husband.
The episode was vintage Manila theater. Enrile sauntered into an air-conditioned ''cell'' equipped with a television set and telephones, spent a week being feted by relatives, friends and journalists, and sauntered out on bail of 100,000 pesos, or about $4,500. In June, the Philippine Supreme Court dropped the charge, ruling that it lacked substance.
Another Aquino initiative backfired in March when one of her generals was killed in northern Luzon while trying to seize Rodolfo Aguinaldo, a rebellious provincial governor, who escaped and is still at large.
Aquino was further embarrassed last month when a New York jury acquitted Imelda Marcos and her co-defendant, the Saudi Arabian expediter Adnan M. Khashoggi, of fraud and racketeering charges. Aquino had hoped that a conviction would confirm Marcos's culpability in looting the Philippines and, by implication, improve her own image.
Whatever her deficiencies, Corazon Aquino largely owes her predicament to the past, which has dealt the Philippines a bad hand.
Before the Spanish arrived in the 16th century, the archipelago lacked common bonds or a remote, divine emperor who symbolized central authority. The United States took over in 1898 and ruled until 1946. Hence Philippine history is essentially colonial history. A neat quip accurately sums it up: ''Three hundred years in a Catholic convent and a half-century in Hollywood.''
This heritage has inhibited Filipinos from forging a strong sense of their national identity, so that their society today is fragmented by family, clan and regional loyalties. Thus their unity lies chiefly in an allegiance to Christianity and the legal definition of Philippine citizenship.
Under Spain, the Philippine economy languished until the 19th century, when the industrial revolution in the West spurred a demand for such commodities as sugar, hemp and copra. Plantations grew, developing a class of big landlords - many of them Chinese immigrants married to Filipino women - whose dynasties dominate the Philippines today. Corazon Aquino's great-grandfather arrived from China in the 1890's, converted to Catholicism, prospered as a trader, and acquired the plantation still owned by his descendants. The Americans were benign imperialists compared with their European counterparts. Their dream was to turn the Filipinos into imitation Americans - ''our little brown brothers,'' as the first civilian governor, William Howard Taft, dubbed them. American teachers spread English, and facsimile political and judicial bodies were housed in Greek-style buildings copied from those of Washington. By 1907, the Filipinos had the first freely elected legislature in Asia. The United States Congress voted nine years later to grant them eventual independence, and from that point on the people virtually ruled themselves. During World War II, they fought alongside American troops against the Japanese.
But American officials failed to protect the peasantry against exploitation by big plantation owners. American manufacturers were allowed to export their products to the Philippines duty-free, in exchange for which Philippine commodities could enter the United States without tariffs. This classic colonial arrangement, besides stunting the growth of local industry, preserved the traditional landed oligarchy. The United States Congress imposed the same trade system after the Philippines became independent in 1946, when the country, shattered by World War II, desperately needed American aid. Filipinos were, and continue to be, captivated by American culture. They adopt American nicknames, American food and American sports. Yet their fundamental values remain largely unchanged. Suspicious of impersonal institutions, Filipinos function through a web of personal ties based on mutual obligations.
This is especially true in politics, where parties have customarily been cliques whose members seek office not to govern but to furnish jobs, public-works contracts and other favors to their families and friends, who in turn labor to elect them or to keep them in office. So lucrative are the spoils of power that Marcos spent nearly one-quarter of the national budget on his 1965 re-election campaign. Limited to two terms under the law, he scrapped the system, remained in office and went on pillaging without restraint.
The Philippines never became a ''showcase of democracy,'' as many Americans often claim. The most prominent Filipino politician during the American colonial era, Manuel Quezon, was an autocrat. The old dynasties that opposed Marcos were outraged less by his despotism than by his expropriation of their assets to reward his cronies. Neither was the martyred Ninoy Aquino an unalloyed champion of civil liberties. His models included Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore and the South Korean General Park Chung Hee, neither of whom would qualify as democrats.
Looking back, many political analysts argue that Corazon Aquino ought to have used her initial burst of popularity to push through drastic reforms rather than depend on the democratic process, which has, in effect, restored the reactionary oligarchy. But she felt that to resort to arbitrary rule would have violated her campaign pledges. Her occasional excursions into liberal oratory notwithstanding, she is also deeply conservative.
However the future unfolds for Aquino, the Philippines still resembles the portrait painted by her husband, Ninoy, in Foreign Affairs magazine in July 1968.
''Here is a land in which a few are spectacularly rich while the masses remain abjectly poor,'' he wrote, ''where freedom and its blessings are a reality for a minority and an illusion for the many. Here is a land consecrated to democracy but run by an entrenched plutocracy . . . dedicated to equality but mired in an archaic system of caste.'' Its government was ''almost bankrupt,'' its state agencies ''ridden by debts and honeycombed with graft,'' its economy ''in pathetic distress.'' Filipinos were ''depressed and dispirited . . . without purpose and without discipline . . . sapped of confidence, hope and will.'' But, he concluded, the fault was chiefly their own. ''They profess love of country, but love themselves - individually - more.''

THE SCREENING OF AMERICA
Movies and Values From ''Rocky'' to ''Rain Man.''
By Tom O'Brien.
219 pp. New York:
A Frederick Ungar Book/
Continuum. $21.95. 
Our movies have gone downhill. Our movie theaters have gone downhill. Television has hastened the decline. The studios have been taken over by huge corporations whose executives care only about the bottom line. Morality has fled through the exit door. Everything is worse (and it was never that good). These are the messages of the bracing six-essay anthology ''Seeing Through Movies,'' edited by Mark Crispin Miller, and Tom O'Brien's well-meaning but enervating ''Screening of America.''
In his introduction Mr. Miller, the head of the film study program at Johns Hopkins University, lays out the terrain of his book: the increasing commercialization of American movies in the 1980's as the result of structural changes in the business. The question his anthology poses and its contributors try to answer is: ''What about those movies? How has the new monopoly affected cinema?''
The essayists go at it from differing angles. Todd Gitlin analyzes ''how the movies have been affected and afflicted by television,'' how the medium of television itself has insidiously influenced movies - through faster cutting, for example, and the tendency toward serialization, not to mention through dwindling theater attendance, starting in the late 1940's. Douglas Gomery takes the tack of tracing the rise and fall not of movies but of movie theaters - from the palaces of the 1920's to today's suburban multiplexes - and concludes: ''Our cinematic interiors are subject to the same inhuman forces that have changed the movies.'' He also notes that by 1953 moviegoing had declined sharply even in places like Green Bay, Wis., where television had not yet made inroads, because of the postwar recession and suburbanization.
The next piece is a tour of duty of Vietnam War movies of the 1980's by Pat Aufderheide - and it does feel dutiful - followed by Peter Biskind's examination of the blockbuster mentality propagated by George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. Mr. Biskind convincingly demonstrates that while Mr. Lucas saw himself as an enemy of the studio system with his ''Star Wars'' movies (which sowed, in Mr. Lucas's eyes, 60's countercultural values), in fact they played right into the Reagan 80's: ''One vehicle for [the decline in values from the 60's to the 80's], however unwitting, were Lucas's and Spielberg's films. . . . The kids prevailed, but the ideals they stood for had been drained of content.''
The detractors of colorization get roughed up by Stuart Klawans in his provocative essay, while Mr. Miller himself concludes the book with its strongest piece, on the increasing commercialization of movies. At times Mr. Miller comes on a bit too much like a one-man neo-Marxist rating board. Whereas the Motion Picture Association of America relentlessly tabulates instances of frontal nudity and obscenity to arrive at a rating for a film, Mr. Miller just as relentlessly tabulates product endorsements and assigns his own X, R, PG and G ratings: ''Even before the opening credits are over [for ''Over the Top,'' starring Sylvester Stallone], the movie has already plugged Budweiser, Colgate shaving cream, and Michelin tires. . . . The movie also plugs not only Hilton Hotels, TWA, Nintendo, Leaseway Corp., Alpine car stereos - and Pepsi - but both Volvo and Toyota, both Nike and Adidas, as well as Valvoline, Duracell, Soloflex, and Alka-Seltzer.'' Mr. Miller does more than just list product names, however; he trenchantly analyzes the triumph of the false happy ending in the movies of the 1980's and what this means for our society: ''The epoch of revision, with its perfect comebacks, dancin' populations, kindly aliens, lovers marrying, athletes scoring, winners winning, has in fact reflected an intense and widespread fear of loss.'' By the time he is done, you stand convinced that the loss is not just the cinema's, but one of confidence in ourselves and in our culture.
''THE SCREENING OF AMERICA'' gets off instantly on the wrong foot. The preface by the author, who until recently was the film critic for Commonweal magazine, begins with this ominous disclaimer: ''This book is not intended for film critics, cineasts, or film historians. . . . The book is intended for the common reader.'' Tom O'Brien says he wants to ''encourage thinking about the social implications of movies,'' but you do not encourage thinking with sentences like: ''One of the most provocative American moviemakers concerned with value issues, John Sayles, can't quite solve the aesthetic problems his depth of vision entails.'' Mr. O'Brien writes that his book is ''for people who see movies for fun, escape, or enlightenment, and possibly more.'' But people who see movies for fun and escape aren't going to look twice at his book.

FAT YEARS AND LEAN
The American Economy Since Roosevelt.
By Bernard D. Nossiter.
271 pp. New York:
HarperCollins. $22.50.
Bernard D. Nossiter has written a breezy account of American economic policy making from the Depression to the present, with a special emphasis on the people who made the decisions, their intellectual and class perspective, and on the positions they took on the central recurring issue of economics: whether and how to fight unemployment. If Orson Welles's Martians were now to return, they might find ''Fat Years and Lean'' an accessible guide to economic policy in the time since their last appearance. 
But that, alas, is also the problem. Mr. Nossiter, the author of ''The Mythmakers: An Essay on Power and Wealth'' and other books, writes from the perspective of an American Keynesianism of the original mode. His world view recalls Alvin H. Hansen, the title of whose 1938 book ''Full Recovery or Stagnation?'' prefigures the main issue of this one. Mr. Nossiter's tale can be summarized: full employment reigned from the Eisenhower through the Johnson Administrations; then it fell prey to OPEC; then in the 1980's it was finally abandoned by Ronald Reagan. For a simple ailment he offers a simple cure: abolish the ''slack economy, one with a strong margin of unused plant and labor,'' and restore full employment. The Martians, having raided a late-30's bookstore of Hansen's book or of John Maynard Keynes's ''General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money'' (1936), would find it all quite familiar.
To be sure, though it is old and simple, Mr. Nossiter's Keynes-Hansen viewpoint has elements of enduring merit. It leads him to be a severe critic of supply siders (''country-club economics''), monetarists (''useless for policy'') and conventional conservatives like the former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker, whose ''error was so monumental that financial writers almost everywhere hail his wisdom.'' The author is almost as hard on Big Labor (''oblivious'') as on Mr. Reagan (class war as policy). Mr. Nossiter scorns the proconsuls of sound finance (he thinks that Ronald Reagan's deficits were too small, not too large) and sees the need for an incomes policy, in some form, to break the inflation-unemployment tradeoff. On these points, many of them controversial to say the least, the simplifications of the old Keynesianism retain a certain wisdom; indeed, they are usually preferable to those of more recently fashionable views.
Still, in other ways, the old liberal credos mislead, and can no longer serve. Most important, ''Fat Years and Lean'' does not account sensibly for the effect of expanding trade on the United States economy. Mr. Nossiter blames Mr. Reagan for rising protectionism, but seems not to have seen the explosion of manufactured imports that the high dollar and economic recovery together brought on after 1983, or the anti-inflationary purpose this served, or the crippling effects on previously healthy sectors of American industry. Nor does he see the international financial effects of Reaganomics - the debt crises in Latin America and Eastern Europe - that impede the recovery of advanced American exports, the most promising avenue for an industrial renaissance.
The pursuit of full employment in one country is a noble objective, but it can be achieved in the United States in only two ways. We could cut off imports, freeze capital flows, wages and prices, jack up demand and move, in effect, to a Keynesian war economy. This would be unattractive in a world where consumers rightly value a wide choice of products and where advanced industries must have global markets if they are to remain competitive in their technologies and costs. Alternatively, we can work to recapitalize the developing world, accept their imports and use the expansion of our advanced industries to catapult ourselves toward full employment and trade balance. You won't find a consideration of this choice in ''Fat Years and Lean.''
In tone, this book is rarely temperate, often angry, but usually so in a civilized way. There is one virulent exception. Mr. Nossiter charges that ''Reagan's high unemployment encouraged recruiting for the guerrilla war now practiced by blacks against whites in large cities, a physical, social, and psychological cost of some dimensions.'' This is - there is no nice way to put it - a racial slur, particularly shocking after the gang-killing of a young black man in New York's Bensonhurst so highlighted the continuing violence of some whites against blacks. Mr. Nossiter's sentiments on many points are decently liberal, but for this remark he should be ashamed.

THE BURNING SEASON
The Murder of Chico Mendes and the Fight for the Amazon Rain Forest.
By Andrew Revkin.

THE WORLD IS BURNING
By Alex Shoumatoff.

Little, Brown & Company. $19.95.
On the night of Dec. 22, 1988, in the small town of Xapuri in the remote Brazilian state of Acre, Francisco (Chico) Mendes Filho stepped out of his wooden-frame cottage and into the blast of a shotgun. Fleeing into the darkness, the killer undoubtedly believed that the union leader's murder would go the way of the murders of a thousand other Brazilians in land disputes in the 1980's - unpunished and largely forgotten. But to the dismay of ranchers determined to convert the western Amazon into cow pasture, that single shotgun blast has echoed around the world. 
During the scorching hot summer of 1988, Americans and Europeans started listening to scientists who warned that the burning and clearing of the Amazonian rain forest was contributing to a gradual warming of the earth known as the greenhouse effect. Other scientists said that a living pharmacy was going up in smoke before even 1 percent of the Amazon's plants had been studied.
In life, Mendes was a unionist who defended the rights of his fellow Amazonian rubber tappers to live in the forest and harvest rubber and nuts. In Acre, where 130 ranchers expelled an estimated 100,000 tappers from the forest, Mendes fought back, rallying families to stand in front of chain saws and bulldozers. In death, Mendes, an international eco-martyr, became the catalyst for popularizing the concept that the wealth of the Amazon resides in its profusion of plant and animal life, not in its thin, sandy soil.
''In leading this struggle to preserve the Amazon, Chico Mendes had made a lot of trouble for a lot of powerful people,'' Andrew Revkin writes in ''The Burning Season.'' ''He was to the ranchers of the Amazon what Cesar Chavez was to the citrus kings of California, what Lech Walesa was to the shipyard managers of Gdansk.''
''The Burning Season'' and ''The World Is Burning'' - both part biography and part biology - explore Mendes's life within the wider context of the destruction of the Amazon forest. Each book provides a readable examination of a complex issue bound to loom large in the 1990's. There is considerable overlap, of course, and only the specialist will want to read both volumes. Of the two, ''The Burning Season'' seems to be more thoroughly researched and more comprehensive. A nature writer by trade, Mr. Revkin demonstrates a solid grounding in the Amazon's ecology. Alex Shoumatoff has expanded ''The World Is Burning'' from a piece in Vanity Fair and a project on the greenhouse effect. Not displaying the stylistic virtuosity of some of his recent writing, Mr. Shoumatoff appears to have hurriedly welded together his book before the Mendes market cools.
But there is little indication that interest will lag in the amiable, unassuming man a Brazilian film maker recently described as the greatest Brazilian hero of this century. In May, the novelist Marcio Souza published ''O Empate Contra Chico Mendes,'' which is to provide the plot for a Warner Brothers movie. This month the cinematographer Chris Menges starts filming scenes of burning rain forest.
This reviewer's heart sank on reading that Mr. Revkin needed translations of 120 hours of interview tapes. But despite the handicap of not fully understanding what Brazilians were telling him face to face, he has written an admirable work. One particularly compelling chapter relates the little-known history of many rubber tappers: in 1942, as the Japanese blocked Allied access to British rubber plantations in Malaysia, the United States began sending thousands of Brazilians from the drought-stricken northeast part of that country to collect rubber in the Amazon.
Mr. Revkin's book benefits from his ability to turn a polished phrase. And insights into Mendes's early years and his projection onto the international stage flowed from the full cooperation given the author by Mendes's three closest allies: Adrian Cowell, a British film maker; Mary Helena Allegretti, a Brazilian environmentalist and the president of the Institute for Amazonian Studies; and Stephan Schwartzman, an American anthropologist who works for the Environmental Defense Fund. Mr. Revkin's original research also brings alive Mendes's mentor, Euclides Fernandes Tavora, a middle-class Communist who, in the 60's, was on the run from Brazil's military. Appearing one day at the Mendes family's forest clearing, Tavora introduced the illiterate young Chico to books, newspapers and union organizing.
While Mr. Revkin has culled the slightest wisp of the first person from his text, Mr. Shoumatoff crashes around in ''The World Is Burning'' like a third-world Hunter Thompson. His account winds confusingly through time, switching back and forth like an Amazon tributary. But Mr. Shoumatoff, a student of Brazilian society for the last 14 years and the author of three other books on Brazil, excels at explaining that country's culture. Citing its inoperancia, or tropical breakdown, he accurately describes the slaying of Mendes as a sloppy mix of commission and omission: ''The Amazon has a soporific effect. It's a big part of the inoperancia problem. . . . So many things conspire against your remaining on schedule and on the ball. It's a constant struggle just to maintain consciousness, to fight off tropical entropy, torpid, rachitic, stultified, paranoid paralysis. . . . Tasks like apprehending perpetrators, keeping them behind bars, gathering evidence, trying them and sending them up the river, become too daunting, more than anything you think you could possibly get together.''
But in the spirit of fairness, he notes the perception of some Brazilians that they are being asked to bottle up the Amazon's wealth to meet the demands of Americans and Europeans who long ago destroyed their own forests. Many Americans see the building of a road from Acre through Peru to the Pacific as the beginning of the end of the western Amazon. Many Acre residents see the road as a means out of economic stagnation and isolation.
Today, environmentalists, economists and government officials are struggling with the challenge of how to bring economic development and a higher standard of living to the Amazon's inhabitants without eliminating the region's forest cover. Tourism, mining and selective lumbering and produce harvesting may offer some answers.
In retrospect, Chico Mendes's death marked a turning point for Brazilian environmental policy. Responding to domestic and international outcries, the Brazilian Government suspended tax subsidies for ranching in the Amazon and established a string of rubber reserves in Acre. In July, Brazil's military, which has long viewed ecologists as security threats, promised to lend helicopters to help repress fires in the rain forest. And Brazilian climatologists now argue that deforestation of the Amazon would throw Brazil's weather out of whack, jeopardizing the nation's position as the world's second largest food exporter after the United States.
In June, the river town of Xapuri saw its first jury trial in years. On June 22, Darci and Oloci Alves da Silva, the half brothers who are suspects in the Mendes murder, were convicted and sentenced to 12 years in prison for shooting into a crowd of protesting rubber tappers in May 1988. Judicial officials say the Mendes murder trial could begin soon.
But the old ways die hard in Xapuri. On the day the da Silvas were convicted, Mendes's widow, Ilzamar, and his union successor, Osmarino Amancio Rodrigues, both received death threats. And on July 10, a priest who works with the rubber tappers was driving past the da Silvas' ranch when two shots rang out. The priest, Isaias Franca Maia, escaped with minor injuries.

HEADLINE: 'An American Looks at Britain'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Craig R. Whitney's review of my book ''An American Looks at Britain'' (July 15) ends by saying, ''The British, who usually find little merit in criticisms from mere foreigners, would do well to read his exhortations.''
While grateful to Mr. Whitney, the London bureau chief of The New York Times, I feel I must rise to the defense of the British. The whole impetus for my critical portrait of their society came from them. In 1987 The Economist asked me to do an outsider's survey of the country, the first in the magazine's 147-year history. As Anthony Burgess said in his review, ''The original survey that eventually grew into this book was commissioned by The Economist, a British publication renowned for accuracy in its figures and disinterestedness in its conclusions.''
So I think we can say the British not only welcome criticism from foreigners, in my case they actively sought it.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: The Old J.C. Penney Building;
New Name, New Owners, New Tenants, New Image

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Take a 26-year-old building that never had any architectural distinction and that was made even more anonymous by its identification for many years with a single, none-too-glamorous tenant, and put it on the Avenue of the Americas, where vacancy rates are among the highest in mid-Manhattan. It would seem to be a recipe for leasing disaster.
Yet the story of 1301 Avenue of the Americas, long known as the J. C. Penney Building and soon to be rechristened the Credit Lyonnais Building, is anything but one of disaster. A sunken plaza has been traded for three colossal bronze sculptures by Jim Dine that evoke the Venus de Milo. That has helped make the tower, between 52d and 53d Streets, a prominent presence on the avenue. And it now has a high-profile tenancy to match.
Coopers & Lybrand, the nationwide accounting and consulting concern, has taken 620,000 square feet; the law firm of Dewey, Ballantine, Bushby, Palmer & Wood has taken 341,000; Credit Lyonnais, the banking giant based in Paris, has taken 225,000; RJR Nabisco has taken 115,000 and Siemens, the Munich electronics concern, has taken 93,000. Rents are understood to be in the $40's and $50's a square foot. 
Tishman Speyer Properties of Manhattan and the Trammell Crow Company of Dallas bought the 46-story tower at auction in May 1988 for $353 million and began an ambitious renovation. The financing was provided by a consortium of pension funds, as equity partners; by a loan from the Sanwa Bank of Japan and by an unusual foreign bond offering. Since then, the developers have managed to lease slightly more than 1.4 million square feet, or about 78 percent of the space.
When the enormous retailing concern of J. C. Penney moved its headquarters to Plano, Tex., in 1988, it left behind an empty office tower and not much in the way of image.
''What people saw was a tired old building, a dinosaur,'' said Steven R. Wechsler, managing director of Tishman Speyer. ''It had a big, sunken hole, with a lot of people hanging out there. It had an entrance off the side. Its skin was a bad color.''
Clad in a blue porcelainized finish, the tower was designed by Shreve, Lamb & Harmon and developed by Percy and Harold D. Uris. Like so many buildings of its period, particularly those by the Uris brothers, it was long on bulk and short on esthetics.
''Effectively, we changed the whole image of the building,'' Mr. Wechsler said, ''by plugging up that hole, bringing everything up to grade, pulling the entrance out to Sixth Avenue, adding 2,000 square feet to the lobby and putting the sculptures out front.'' The architects for the renovation were the New York office of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill.
When it came time to deal with the facade, the new owners decided not to strip the building down to its skeleton and reface it. That might have added about $10 a square foot to the rents, something the market was not likely to bear. ''We were able to come up with a process to coat the building,'' Mr. Wechsler said. Its facade now has alternating bands of dark and light gray.
But, of course, it was not just a fresh skin color or a Jim Dine sculpture that drew tenants. ''For the big user, we had one of the few shows in town,'' Mr. Wechsler said. ''We thought that a lot of people would want to be in this location.''
Indeed, the New York branch of Credit Lyonnais and its sister company, C. L. Globalpartners Securities Corporation, are moving from 95 Wall Street, at Water Street, where they occupy approximately 115,000 square feet.
''An institution such as Credit Lyonnais, given its worldwide size and presence in the financial marketplace, should be located more toward the center of the city and have a very physical presence,'' said Walter N. Brenner, senior vice president of Credit Lyonnais and the deputy manager of operations in the United States.
Credit Lyonnais will initially have 500 employees in the building but may expand that to 750. Its lease runs 15 years, with two five-year extensions.
''Being on Sixth Avenue, which is known as 'Corporate Row,' is something that is a great attraction,'' Mr. Brenner said. ''Added to it is that our name would be displayed prominently on the building. When we look at our fellow tenant list, that only convinces us of the correctness of our choice.''
''We like Sixth Avenue,'' said George C. Tockstein, director of national administration for Coopers & Lybrand, whose headquarters are at No. 1251, the Exxon Building, between 49th and 50th Streets. ''We were the first tenants when 1251 went up and because our corporate headquarters are staying here, the proximity of 1301 was attractive.'' So too, he said, was the size of the floors, as large as 67,700 square feet.
Something else spurred leasing: a $600 million participating mortgage loan arranged by Eastdil Realty of Manhattan, a real-estate investment banking firm owned in part by the Nomura Group of Tokyo.
The loan was divided into two separate $300-million offerings made in Japan and Britain through a special-purpose corporation that was established to issue bonds. Proceeds from the sale of the bonds were used to make the loan.
One of the offerings, which attracted financial institutions, carried a fixed interest rate. The other carried a relatively low base interest rate, plus a contingent interest equal to a share of increases in the building's cash flow and in the property value. This offering attracted individuals and small corporations. ''To do a securitized deal on an untenanted building was a whole new concept,'' Mr. Wechsler said.
''The financing transaction was unique,'' said Steven A. Karpf, executive vice president of Eastdil, ''in that it was the first time that a U.S. real-estate owner was able to access the retail segment of the Japanese capital markets.
''When that transaction was completed, the leasing market realized that the owner was not going to be forced to make unreasonable deals with prospective tenants due to potentially high carrying costs in a relatively high-interest environment. Additionally, it demonstrated the confidence of the capital markets in the owners and the building.
''Those prospective tenants out there who were sitting on the fence realized that significant leasing concessions would not be available. Leasing activity seemed to accelerate immediately after closing.'' ''Our leasing went just like that,'' Mr. Wechsler said, snapping his fingers.
Notwithstanding the prominence of the Credit Lyonnais deal, it is unclear how many more European financial institutions will be involved in transactions of such magnitude.
''There's just not an unlimited supply of these big, foreign bank deals,'' said Maurice H. Solomon, vice chairman of the Julien J. Studley real-estate concern. ''They've made their moves and these leases are for 15, 20 years. In the immediate future, I don't see many giant moves by foreign banks.''
''It's a pleasant surprise to find anyone in an expansion move at this time,'' said Arthur M. Delmhorst, senior vice president for leasing at Landauer Associates. ''I'm trying to think of any other big leases with European financial institutions and I can't.''
''There has been concern as to which way capital will be going with the new economic community in 1992,'' Mr. Delmhorst said. ''I think there's been more of a flow of American business to Europe, trying to get set up over there in advance of that date, than European companies coming over here.''
But Mr. Brenner, of Credit Lyonnais, believes that ''our level of anticipated expansion is not unusual and should probably be on target with what we foresee in the industry.''
European financial institutions may remain active in leasing during the 1990's because they were not so heavily into development in the 1980's.
''Foreign banks have been somewhat fortunate in that we've been out of the real-estate business,'' Mr. Breener said, ''and haven't been hurt as dramatically as American banks.''

HEADLINE: Postings: 15-Story Facelift;
New Windows, Lobby on 33d

 BODY:
Most people familiar with the oddly shaped, ''winged'' structure that straddles the Penn Central Railroad tracks on West 33d Street and 10th Avenue know it as the home of Sky Rink, Manhattan's only public indoor ice-skating rink.
But the 15-story, 1.5 million-square-foot building, which stretches from 33d to 31st Streets, was built for light manufacturing and warehousing companies. It was completed in the late 1960's just as Manhattan's economic base was beginning to lose its brawn as rents became too high for many industrial tenants. Since it took over in 1977, the building's owner, John Hancock Properties of Boston, has signed on office tenants as warehousing and manufacturing companies left. Now the building is undergoing cosmetic surgery to make it even more appealing for office tenants. 
''The first wave of office tenants to come to the building were back-office space users,'' said Timothy Rodgers, senior vice president of John Hancock Properties. ''But we have been successful in attracting tenants like Citibank and Manufacturers Hanover Bank and we want to strengthen the building's front-office use.''
The facelift will include upgrading inside and outside. Der Scutt, the architect in charge of the transformation, said that although a new look was the goal of the renovation, he wanted to do it in a way that would respect the work of the original architects, Davis Brody & Associates.
The building's discolored concrete surface will be repaired and given a new coat of beige paint. New window frames and bronze-tinted windows will be installed. The new main entrance will have stainless steel doors and a canopy of bronze metal panels and colored ceramic tile. Two existing loading docks will be converted to retail space.
Inside, two small lobbies will be combined to make a large one. The new lobby will have marble floors and walls as well as new incandescent lighting. Floors in the building range from 42,000 to more than 100,000 square feet in size. With the departure of Baby Togs, a children's apparel distribution company, there is now approximately 325,200 square feet of space available of which 195,000 square feet is contiguous space on two floors. The asking price for this space is $21 a square foot.
Work on the building is expected to be completed by October.

HEADLINE: Lenders Feel New Pressures To Aid Poor Neighborhoods

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
Already squeezed by mounting defaults, lower earnings and a savings and loan debacle that has made them shy away from many development proposals, the nation's real estate lenders are now feeling pressure from another source - new Federal rules that require greater attention to the credit needs of minorities and low-income neighborhoods.
The rules, adopted last year, are part of the same law under which Congress budgeted $157 billion to close hundreds of ailing thrift institutions. Although the huge cost of the bailout - some experts say it will grow to $500 billion - has largely overshadowed the law's provisions for community development, they have not escaped the notice of bankers, who are coming under increasing scrutiny by bank regulators.
Under one key provision of the 1989 law, the Federal Reserve and other regulatory agencies began last month a review of the performance of lenders that will lead to public ratings based on the quality of their service to poor neighborhoods.
The impact seems certain to be strongest in New York City, the nation's center of finance. One reason is the large number of major lending institutions in the city. 
Another is the city's huge 10-year program to renovate, build and manage thousands of units of low- and moderate-income housing; dozens of community groups are seeking construction loans and other financial support under that program.
Bank executives are not eager to attribute their community spirit to the dictates of Federal law. But since the requirements were adopted by Congress the lenders have been making many unusual initiatives in low-income neighborhoods, and no one suggests the timing is purely coincidental.
Community development offices are being established, executives recruited from not-for-profit community groups and government agencies, and large pools of money set aside for community development projects.
''It comes at a curious time because all real estate loans are being looked at carefully, but banks are repositioning themselves to beef up community development,'' said Gary Hattem, vice president in charge of a newly established community development group at the Bankers Trust Company.
Among other new programs, Bankers Trust announced last Wednesday that it will make a $500,000 grant to housing groups in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx that manage buildings for the homeless. For Bankers Trust, the commitment is unusual because its more conventional lines of business have almost nothing to do with small-scale real estate lending, but instead encompass a wide range of commercial development, corporate financing and international business.
And by traditional standards, Mr. Hattem is an unusual presence in the starched-collar world of big-city banking. He was hired away in March from the not-for-profit St. Nicholas Neighborhood Preservation Corporation, where he spent 15 years as a community organizer in the blighted sections of the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn.
''The banks are clearly under pressure,'' said Paul Grogan, president of the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, an organization that arranges private and public financing for low-income housing around the country. ''They are actually competing to lend in poor neighborhoods.''
Behind the flurry of activity is the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, a 1,000-page law widely referred to by its acronym Firrea (pronounced Fye-REE-ah).
Although its principal impetus was the savings and loan crisis, Congress included the community development provisions after hearing persistent reports of redlining and of inadequate banking services for poor people.
The most potent of the new rules, according to bank executives, is designed to strengthen an existing law, the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which was meant to end discriminatory lending and bank services. The 13-year-old law empowered community groups or local officials to challenge, and in some cases block, bank mergers, the opening of new branches and other ventures by lending institutions that require regulatory approval.
If they have evidence that a lender provides poor or discriminatory service in its own community, the local groups can mount Community Reinvestment Act challenges at regulatory hearings.
The act also created new responsibilities for the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and other regulators. Each was to review the performance of the lenders it supervised, giving them ratings similar to a student's ''A'' to ''F'' grades. The ratings were not disclosed to the public.
What was private under the Community Reinvestment Act will be public under Firrea. Although the regulators conduct their reviews infrequently - at intervals of three to five years for many lenders - the new law requires the results of all future reviews to be made available to community groups, local government officials or anyone else seeking to apply pressure on lenders.
Even if they do not face legal challenges, lenders that receive poor ratings could suffer serious damage to their corporate prestige.
''Banks take a lot of pride in their public standing, and they want their ratings to reflect that,'' said Mr. Hattem of Bankers Trust.
Other provisions of Firrea, aimed more directly at the beleaguered savings and loan industry, are designed to push them into low-income housing projects.
One requires the nation's 12 Federal Home Loan Banks - Federal lending institutions that provide financing to savings and loans - to put a percentage of their net income each year into a pool of money used to offer below-market-rate loans.
The banks have already set aside $78 million from their 1990 profits, and the amount is expected to grow to at least $100 million a year by 1995.
Low-income housing projects across the nation were selected in July for the the first round of loans under the program. In New York, the recipients include groups that are building 186 homes in the South Bronx, rehabilitating a rental apartment building in Albany and working on other forms of low- and moderate-income housing.
Another Firrea rule applies to the Resolution Trust Corporation, the new Federal agency set up to dispose of assets seized from insolvent thrift institutions. The corporation must offer low-income housing groups the opportunity to buy any home it seizes with an appraised value under $67,500 and is authorized by Congress to offer the groups low-interest financing.
But experts say the provision of Firrea that are having the broadest impact on lenders - and could make the biggest long-term difference in lending patterns - is the new rating system, which went into effect this summer. Although industry anaylsts are skeptical, bankers in some cities say they are approaching the new rules with something close to evangelical zeal.
''I like to compare what is going on at banks to churches doing their community outreach,'' said Gary Jewel, vice president and counsel for the First American National Bank of Memphis. He added that the challenge to banks now is not only in making more loans in low-income areas, but also in finding acceptable projects and customers.
''We've got to find developers and contractors that are honest and reputable,'' he said. ''It doesn't mean lowering our standards, just working harder.''
The motivation of lenders is not entirely dictated by Firrea. After the heady development boom of the 80's, which left many counting their defaults and loan losses, some maintain that working with nonprofit groups in low-income neighborhoods now looks like good business.
''These loans can be harder to make, but they are easier to live with,'' said Hugh Loftus, director of community reinvestment for the Security Pacific Bank in Los Angeles, which announced last month it would commit $2.4 billion in loans over the next 10 years to projects or businesses in low- and moderate-income areas, with the bulk going to not-for-profit housing groups.
He added that the bank considers working with not-for-profit groups attractive because most are also receiving financing from several other sources, including government agencies. ''That tends to make these very secure transactions,'' Mr. Loftus said.
In the New York area, there are many examples of new community development initiatives since Firrea was enacted.
In a major program, the Chase Manhattan bank this year established a new subsidiary, the Chase Community Development Corporation, and said it would commit $200 million over the next five years to affordable-housing programs and other development projects in poor neighborhoods.
''The quality of the deals is very good, but by normal banking standards these just are not considered traditional types of lending,'' said Mark Willis, an urban economist and president of the Chase subsidiary and a former deputy commissioner of New York City's Department of Housing Preservation and Development.
So far, the Chase subsidiary's initiatives have ranged from large to off-beat. It has invested heavily in the projects sponsored by the Local Initiative Support Corporation and has established a mortgage loan program for low- and moderate-income buyers, who need only a 5 percent down payment.
For its West Indian customers, it has set up the ''Su-Su Account'' - a form of Christmas Club savings program under which immigrants from the West Indies, whose culture dictates that they save money collectively, can use money deposited by several people for down payments on real estate.
Foreign banks, whose United States operations are subject to the same rating procedure as domestically owned lenders, have begun to commit money to low-income housing.
In one example, Neighborhood Housing Services, a New York City not-for-profit group, said in July that IJB Schroder Bank and Trust Company, a Japanese concern, had committed $500,000 in loans for its low- and moderate-income housing programs.
Executives at smaller banks in rural communities say that meeting the new requirements of Firrea will require, more than anything else, an increase in record keeping. Because few of the rural lenders serve communities where the lines dividing ethnic neighborhoods or poor and affluent areas are clear, the law is prompting bankers to meet with representatives of the poor to plan lending programs and to keep painstaking records of their lending.
''Most of the bankers I talk to say we are already in compliance,'' said Robert Moyer, president of the Wilber National Bank in Oneonta, N.Y., an upstate city in a rural setting. ''But what is required under Firrea is very specific records on what you have done.''
Lawmakers and political analysts say that one of the influences on Congress when it adopted the new community development provisions was a series of reports on discriminatory lending policies in several large cities.
''What we found was clearly a matter of insufficient enforcement'' of laws banning discrimination under the Community Reinvestment Act, said Charles Finn, director of the banking and community economic development project at the University of Minnesota, which, since 1988, has conducted detailed studies of mortgage lending practices in Atlanta, Detroit and Boston.
The studies, submitted to Congress when it deliberated Firrea, found many examples of unequal lending in white and black neighborhoods. In Atlanta, for example, Mr. Finn said he looked at lending patterns in white and black neighborhoods that had the same income levels, and found that residents of the black neighborhoods were five times less likely to have their application for a home loan approved.
Because of Firrea, and the resulting initiatives by lenders to set up new community development projects, ''there is clearly a formula being constructed on how to conform to the Community Reinvestment Act,'' he said. Nonetheless, he added that he has adopted a ''wait-and-see attitude.''
''The big decisions that you take to the board of directors have been made,'' he said, ''but whether that reaches down to the day-to-day decisions of loan committees remains to be seen.''

HEADLINE: Teaneck Journal;
After Night of Violence, Storekeepers Are Determined to Stay

BYLINE: By ALBERT J. PARISI

DATELINE: TEANECK

 BODY:
IF he closes his eyes and allows his mind to wander, John Callas says, he can still hear sheets of glass breaking and crashing to the floor. But more vividly, he remembers the shouts of anger mixed with frustration and fear.
''What happened that night I still have a tough time understanding,'' said Mr. Callas, the owner of the Mediterranean Gourmet Deli on Teaneck Road, ''and though it made me scared, it made me think that people have to be more tolerant of each other, no matter what the circumstances.''
On April 10, a teen-ager was shot and killed by a local police officer who said he suspected that the youth was armed. The following evening, a candlelight vigil in front of police headquarters, on the corner of Teaneck Road and Cedar Lane, turned into a skirmish between local residents, out-of-towners and the police. Before it was over, half a dozen police cruisers were destroyed, and the glass storefronts of some 20 businesses along Teaneck Road had been smashed. Some stores were looted. A dozen people were injured, including youths, police officers and journalists covering the situation. 
''I saw the crowds moving and there was anger in their eyes and then something came crashing through my window,'' Mr. Callas said. ''We called the police and they told us to just leave, to get out, but I wasn't about to abandon what it took me years to build up.''
The passage of four months has led many store owners to reassess their damage, both material and emotional. Many, like Mr. Callas, say the incident has done little to change the way they feel about the community.
''Emotions got out of hand and people got out of hand,'' he said, ''but since that day, people have worked together to make things better. Sometimes good things come out of the bad.''
Tensions were renewed recently when a state grand jury in Trenton chose not to indict Gary Spath, the Teaneck police officer who had shot the youth, Phillip C. Pannell. The State Attorney General has said that a discrepancy in the county Medical Examiner's autopsy report warrants a second grand jury's being convened to re-examine the case.
Echoing the sentiments of many shopkeepers who suffered losses that night, Mr. Callas, who lives in nearby Bogota, said he felt that much of the damage was caused by youths from outside this middle-class Bergen County community of 40,000.
''I get a lot of kids from the high school who come in here all the time, and that night I didn't recognize any faces,'' he said, adding that after the night of violence, a group of local youths came in and apologized for the damage, insisting that outsiders were responsible.
''That took a lot of guts for them to come in here and tell their side, I have to say that,'' said Mr. Callas, who estimated the damage to his store at $12,000.
Jerry Mrkulic, a Bronx resident who owns Jerry's Pizza on the corner of Teaneck Road and Forest Avenue, had to close his business for three days because of the damage and looting. But now, he said, it's ''business as usual.''
''This neighborhood is my second home,'' he said, ''and nothing is ever going to change that. I get along with the people here, I know them they know me and I've never had any trouble.'' Mr. Mrkulic has been doing business in town for three years.
''The night they broke in, there were faces I did not know for the most part,'' he said. ''Had it been people that I knew, it would have hurt me all the more.''
 
'They Told Me to Calm Down'
That night, many shopkeepers said, they were enraged that the police did not respond immediately to their calls for help, but, looking back on the degree of police restraint shown during the incident, many now say that they cannot fault the police.
''When I called the police, they told me to calm down and if I had to, to abandon my place until the crowd left,'' Mr. Mrkulic said. ''I told them, 'How can I leave, the people are crazy out there and what if somebody comes in here to kill me or I hurt somebody in protecting my store?' '' Later, he said, his bitterness turned to empathy. ''I think the cops did the best they could,'' said Mr. Mrkulic, whose damage was assessed at $8,000.
The merchant who operates Martinson's Cleaners on Teaneck Road said, ''Things are back to normal, they are calm and my customers come back.''
''This is a good town and the people are good,'' said the merchant, who identified himself only as Kim. ''I feel bad at what happened, but there has been no trouble before or since. This is a kindly, loving town, and I think this is how it will stay.'' He said a half-dozen large plate-glass windows cost $7,000 to replace.
Most business losses were covered by insurance policies, shopkeepers said.
''What happened, well, it happened but people tend to forget and life goes on as usual, but they never really forget because it's always in the back of their minds,'' said Wilmoth Brooks, manager of the Carvel Ice Cream store on Teaneck Road. ''We were hit and we were boarded up but remained open, and for a couple of weeks it was the talk of nearly everyone who came in here.
''But once the glass was replaced and things looked like normal, the subject changed to other things.'' said Mr. Brooks, who lives in the Bronx.
The store, he added, was broken into twice more within a week after the incident, with damage estimated at $8,000.
Perhaps hardest hit that night was Jeanette Barhydt's Teaneck Road shop, the Film Lab Outlet. In addition to the shattering of windows, there was theft of film stock, video camcorders and rental films and extensive damage of film-processing equipment.
''I lost about $35,000, and that's not including losses of having to be closed for five days,'' said Mrs. Barhydt, who lives in Dumont.
 
Effects of Economy Cited
For some five weeks after the clash, business dropped off dramatically at many stores. Some attribute this to economic problems unrelated to the incident, but others say that lingering memories have had their effect.
''My business is down 25 percent, but I think that such a thing can be said for everyone anywhere because of the economy,'' said Mr. Callas, who says his evening trade particularly still suffers.
One Teaneck Road store manager, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said business had dropped off so much that she might be forced to close. ''Most of my regulars are shopping elsewhere because they're afraid of what happened and that it may happen again,'' she said. ''People who don't know Teaneck think of the Teaneck they saw on the evening news, and they don't want to see anything else. We've got the label, and the label is not easily discarded.''
On the other hand, Mr. Callas, who invested some $200,000 to expand his business a year and a half ago, talks of the help that local people offered.
''After my windows were busted in,'' he said, ''I started getting phone calls from my regular customers that night, asking me if they could come down to help, whether to clean up or just guard the store. People care, and if we all work together to see things through, Teaneck will come through this just fine.''

HEADLINE: Recycling Measure: A Pleasant Surprise

 BODY:
I recently returned to New Jersey after an absence of about 10 years. It won't come as a surprise to anyone that I was met with utter amazement every time I told people where I was going, and that I was doing it by choice. ''But why New Jersey? It is so dirty,'' was the general message.
I was proud of our state when I arrived and learned that there was a mandatory recycling measure, and further delighted when I learned from ''Recycling: New Report, New Debate'' (July 15) that participation is much higher than expected.
Senator William Gormley, however, has missed the point of the issue when he expressed doubts about recycling because of the cost. Sure, we should find the most economical way to recycle. Go ahead and put a surcharge on the sale of tires. The point is that recycling and other methods of safe waste disposal are vital to the future of the state.
Let New Jersey pursue recycling and research on other methods of safe waste disposal regardless of the cost. New Jersey has the opportunity to set an example as being the state most committed to cleaning up our environment and redeem our reputation as being filthy in the eyes of the country.

HEADLINE: Reappraising the Appraisal Industry

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
''THE party is over,'' said Eugene Albert, a real estate appraiser. ''The binging of the 1980's is finished.'' Mr. Albert was discussing the excesses that characterized the 1980's real estate market and led to a recent law requiring state certification of real estate appraisers.
Mr. Albert, who has been an appraiser for 40 years, heads the Albert & Sterling Appraisal Company, with offices in Tarrytown and Manhattan.
''Many of the bad loans made by the banks in the S.&L. disaster were sanctioned by unscrupulous or untrained appraisers,'' he said. ''Even some bank lending officers here in the county, in their frenzy to make loans, would call my office and say, 'I want an X dollar value of this property, can you give it to me?' Our firm lost business because we wouldn't cooperate, but there were appraisers that did. And that's why state certification is important. It will prevent shoddy appraisal practices.'' 
 
Support From Savings Banks
The New York League of Savings Institutions, a trade group based in Scarsdale and representing 63 savings and loan associations and 20 savings banks statewide, also supports the law. Speaking for the league, its president, Paul A. Schosberg, said that legislation was necessary to promote accuracy and integrity in real estate appraisals and ''to protect lenders and borrowers from inept or fraudulent appraisal practices.''
Mr. Schosberg noted that the Financial Institutions Reform and Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 required states to set up systems for licensing and certifying real estate appraisers. ''New York's real estate industry is such a vital part of our economy that we should be in the vanguard of reform to insure its integrity,'' he added.
The state certification program,signed into law in May, was a response to the mandate by the Federal Government, Mr. Albert said.
''In essence the Fed said to the states, 'Either you have certification programs signed into law by July 1, or we will do it for you,' and that threat encouraged 39 states to pass legislation.''
But many New York appraisers, Mr. Albert pointed out, wanted stricter rules, higher licensing fees and higher exam fees than the bill provided. Licensing fees are now $200 and exam fees are $50.
''What happened,'' Mr. Albert said, ''was that real estate groups lobbied like mad to retain the right of their members to make appraisals'' even though uncertified.
Those who win certification, which is based on training, experience and the examination, are to be licensed by a new state appraisal board.
 
Appraisals Can Still Be Made
Mr. Albert said, however, that ''licensing will not put unlicensed real estate brokers out of the appraisal business.''
''As long as they don't call themselves certified licensed appraisers, real estate brokers can offer appraisals to clients as a way of drumming up business,'' he said. ''And there's still nothing in the new law to prevent them from making appraisals of houses right on the spot. So it's still a buyer-beware situation.
''But I suspect that in order to protect themselves, banks and trust department heads and lawyers will now only use the services of certified appraisers. And I think certified appraisers will still get business from reputable realtors who want accurate appraisals for buyers or sellers.''
P. Gilbert Mercurio, the executive vice president of the 3,900-member Westchester County Board of Realtors said the licensing law would ultimately help the consumer.
 
'They'll Demand More'
''People will quickly become aware of the high standards required for licensing, and they'll demand more from the appraisers they deal with,'' Mr. Mercurio said.
''Although I understand Mr. Alpert's reaction,'' Mr. Mercurio said, ''he's a respected appraiser, long active in Westchester, and I know he is disappointed that the bill doesn't have stricter licensing standards. But on the other hand, legislation did not automatically grandfather real estate agents or brokers who have been doing appraisals to become certified.
''And given the short time frame that the Legislature had to work in, and the urgency of this bill, quick action was understandable.''
Fredric Streb, president of the Westchester County Society of Real Estate Appraisers, a professional group, agreed with Mr. Mercurio.
 
'They'll Want Only the Certified'
''Once the public realizes that appraisers are now licensed, they'll want to deal only with those who are certified,'' said Mr. Streb, who is also a principal in John Streb & Son, a three-generation firm of realtors with offices in Dobbs Ferry, Tarrytown and Ardsley.
''We're an old-time real estate firm,'' Mr. Streb said, ''and if my son, who just joined the company, wants to make appraisals, I believe he'll have to take courses and study for the exam. That's how the field will be in the future.
''As for myself, I think I'm very well advised to take the exam, too. But I know, right now, a lot of realtors are saying that they're trying to get along without it as long as they can. But banks will demand certification, and eventually unlicensed appraisers will be phased out.''
The Westchester County Society of Real Estate Appraisers, Mr. Streb said, was formed more than 40 years ago as a way to upgrade the professionalism of appraisers.
''Back in 1947, when our organization was formed,'' he said, ''appraisers didn't have to have any formal training. There were very few guidelines for them. We established our own strict standards for those in the profession. Membership in the association was conferred only after a review of qualifications, education andexperience was made by a peer group. Our organization has been working for state licensing for years, and we're very pleased that it's finally happened.''
Licensed or unlicensed, local appraisers are in for hard times, those in the field predict.
 
60 to 70 Appraisals a Week
''We're making only 65 to 70 appraisals a week, which is about half the number of appraisals we handled during the 80's,'' Mr. Albert said. ''Activity in the real estate market in Westchester is almost at an all-time low. Sales are worse than they were in the 1975-1976 period and I think they're heading even lower.
Mr. Albert compared the 1980's to the Roaring Twenties, saying: ''Prices were sky-high, and the banks literally ran after customers, offering all kinds of credit. They were helped by appraisers and what happened was they ended up making lousy loans. The abuses weren't so widespread in New York, but in the Southern and Western states things were very bad.''
Mr. Albert, who is 65, entered Pace University Law School when he was 58.
''I went to law school for four years at night,'' he said, ''not because I wanted to practice law, but I believed a knowledge of the law would give me a clearer picture, when I was making appraisals, of every possible situation - such as in matrimonial disputes,when real estate inevitably comes up for grabs. And knowing the law has been useful in making Internal Revenue Service appraisals and in working with trust departments.''
 
Working Alone or in Big Offices
The trend today for appraisers, he said, is either to work by themselves, or to manage large offices. ''Those are the only two ways, if you want to make a living,'' he said, ''because appraisals require an awful lot of time-consuming, laborious detail work.''
A typical residential appraisal, he said, would be a house in Scarsdale his firm did recently. It ''took two days and the cost is comparatively modest, $275 to $300,'' he said. ''In our Westchester office we have 15 appraisers on staff and six in Manhattan and they are able to handle 10 to 12 jobs at a given time, which they do by gathering a lot of the essential data on several properties at once.''
Some of the procedures used to make an appraisal, Mr. Albert said, involved detailed property and neighborhood inspections that included surveying schools, recreational facilities and transportation availability.
''There are also trips to the town hall to compare prices of similar properties recently sold; title searches, and inspections of Federal flood-control maps,'' Mr. Albert said. ''It's a complex process. There's more involved than most people realize.''

HEADLINE: Fears That Haunt a Scrubbed America

BYLINE: By DAVID LEAVITT; David Leavitt is the author of two novels, ''The Lost Language of Cranes'' and ''Equal Affections.'' His second collection of stories, ''A Place I've Never Been,'' will be published next month by Viking.

 BODY:
Put yourself, for a moment, inside the mind of Jesse Helms. Imagine a scrubbed, manicured neighborhood, a pocket of decency in the heart of our sinful land. The music is by Wayne Newton, the paintings are by Norman Rockwell, and sex takes place only between married men and women in beds at night.
Then one day a church-reared boy or girl goes to a museum and sees a Robert Mapplethorpe photograph; or goes to a library and checks out a novel by Rita Mae Brown (neither action likely to be undertaken innocently). What does Jesse Helms think happens? Does the photograph or book emit something between a magic fragrance and a sales pitch, luring this high-minded but fallible child into the back alleyways of decadence and sin? The ''artist,'' in this story, is really nothing more than a street-corner beckoner, a wolf in smock and painters' pants, a wolf with a camera or a pen. What he or she creates, under the guise of art, is a ''promotion'' for sexual deviance, a tool for the ''recruitment'' of the young. 
While the scenario I've just described may sound paranoid, even ludicrous, its dissemination has become the primary weapon in the current attack on the National Endowment for the Arts, an attack that, in fact, has little to do with the arts at all, and everything to do with the extreme right wing's determination to terrorize an already ambivalent American population by manipulating its entrenched fears of anything foreign, unfamiliar or explicitly sexual. People can argue as long as they want about the definitions of obscenity and art; in doing so, they become hopelessly sidetracked, trapped in a struggle to resolve unanswerable questions that neatly distracts them from the real crisis at hand, the way a computer can be distracted indefinitely by being asked to calculate the value of pi.
From Robert Mapplethorpe to Holly Hughes, the message is ringing out loud and clear. Gay and lesbian artists who deal frankly with sexuality are being singled out and refused grant money they were awarded by peer panels, as part of a conscious attempt to censor, humiliate and discourage all artists whose work challenges the right wing's rigid notions of ''correct'' sexual behavior. The N.E.A. is simply another target in an effort to legislate sexual demeanor that also encompasses attacks on abortion rights and on laws that protect homosexuals from violence and discrimination.
Consider the language of the infamous clause this year's National Endowment recipients were forced to sign: It binds the artist to guarantee that he or she will not use the grant money for works that include ''depictions of sadomasochism, homoeroticism, the sexual exploitation of children, or individuals engaged in sex acts, and which, when taken as a whole, do not have serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific merit.''
 
'Homoeroticism' In Bad Company
 Is it only because I'm gay that when I read that sentence, the word ''homoeroticism '' leaps out at me? Or is it because there is nowhere in the clause a reference to ''heteroeroticism,'' only to the portrayal of ''individuals engaged in sex acts,'' which is of course an entirely different matter? ''Sadomasochism'' and ''the sexual exploitation of children'' can of course be both heterosexual and homosexual, and in any case represent just the sort of vague, fear-mongering terminology the right wing adores. Totally nonsexual photographs of nude children, taken with their parents' approval, have been appropriated by the F.B.I. under the latter heading; who's to say that one of Il Bronzino's cupids - portrayed, in the 16th century, as eroticized, chubby little boys - would not be as well?
By situating the word ''homoeroticism'' next to a taboo extreme of sexual behavior few would be willing to argue in favor of, the authors of the clause make their position glaringly clear: while only selective or extreme heterosexual content is to be forbidden, all homosexual content is to be forbidden. Once again, the fear that children may be molested, abused or lured to ''deviant'' life styles is being exploited as a tool to strong-arm Americans into approving the Moral Majority's effort to control artistic expression.
Behind this language - though unspoken - is the right wing's perpetual insistence that gay men and lesbians try to ''recruit'' young people to homosexuality by disseminating art and writing that ''promotes'' the homosexual life style. Of course, to any gay person who, as a frightened and confused teenager, searched desperately for books or films or television shows that offered even a mention of homosexual experience to latch on to, the idea of gay ''recruitment'' is laughable. It is also profoundly insulting.
 
Artists as Outsiders
 Tennessee Williams, Michelangelo, W. H. Auden, Gertrude Stein -I hardly need to repeat history's long and illustrious list of gay and lesbian writers and artists. If a lot of gay people have felt the urge to produce art over time, it's probably only because our early-perceived status as outsiders in a largely heterosexual world forced us to call into question those assumptions about sexual identity that our straight brothers and sisters could simply take for granted.
Female in a world of men, Jewish in a world of gentiles, black in a world of whites: it's the same difference. It's rare to find an artist who, as a child, wasn't in some way treated as a member of some minority and therefore felt the need to refract the complications of his or her world through the prism of that ''different'' self; to offer untroubled people a troubling perspective; to reveal the strangeness of the ordinary and the ordinariness of the strange.
What distinguishes gay and lesbian artists is that their ''difference'' is located in the realm of sexuality; the assumptions they question are assumptions about sexuality; and therefore the work they create, in a culture that is both sex-phobic and homophobic, becomes particularly susceptible to the charge that it is ''obscene,'' or dangerous for young people. This last notion is especially distressing; while homoerotic art may have the power to awaken subconscious homosexual feelings in individuals who already harbor them, the suggestion that it can brainwash or corrupt chaste minds is almost medievally superstitious.
History offers some scary examples of what happens when a government tries to control a culture. Consider Hitler's now infamous 1937 ''Degenerate Art'' show, in which the works of such painters as Max Beckmann, Marc Chagall and Henri Matisse were jammed chaotically onto the walls of a Munich museum, along with hand-scribbled labels denouncing the artists and implying their links to ''unfit'' members of German society.
I attended a re-creation of that exhibit in Berlin last year; in the next room was another re-creation, of the ''Great Exhibition of German Art'' Hitler had set up as a contrast to the ''Degenerate Art'' show. Here gargantuan sculpted Aryan torsos thrust their muscled arms into the sky, while in paintings happy blond families frolicked on farms. Photographs from the opening of the exhibit show a rare smiling Hitler. A failed watercolorist, he apparently considered the show something of a high point in his career: what was the appropriation of political power in comparison, after all, to the appropriation of culture, not to mention the redemption of his ambition - thwarted by teachers who said he had no talent - to be a painter?
Now, five decades later, when history has redeemed the work of the ''degenerate artists,'' it is frightening to see Robert Mapplethorpe's photographs being appropriated by Cincinnati sheriffs and put on trial; or to see videotapes of the performance artist David Wojnarowicz being incorporated into videos used by right-wing pressure groups to demonstrate N.E.A.-sponsored decadence and obscenity; or to try to imagine the kind of ''art'' a Jesse Helms-run N.E.A. might choose to give its money to.
 
The Side Effects Of Cultural Control
 The National Endowment crisis, however - so far, at least - is not about banning art; it is about denying artists money. And what are the consequences of that going to be? Initially, at least, refusing grant money to these artists will probably result in a sudden wave of interest in their work. In England, the notorious Clause 28, which allows the Government to censor art that ''promotes'' homosexuality, prompted a surge of enthusiasm for gay literature, theater and film. Alan Hollinghurst's brilliant novel ''The Swimming Pool Library'' became a best seller, as did works by such gay American writers as Edmund White and Armistead Maupin; the BBC had a major hit with its four-hour television version of Jeannette Winterson's lesbian novel ''Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit.''
Here in America, meanwhile, where banning has always been a perverse form of publicity (consider Henry Miller), the brouhaha over the Mapplethorpe show in Cincinnati drew huge crowds to that show. And Karen Finley, the performance artist, is much better-known now than she was a month ago, though hardly for the reasons she might wish. Ms. Finley was the only heterosexual among the four performance artists whose grants were retracted.
Such a reaction, however, will probably be only temporary. Soon enough the really terrible side-effects of cultural control will start to manifest themselves. There may be a mass exodus of artists out of America to Europe, where state support of the arts is already much stronger, and where a booming economy has made it possible for governments to welcome foreign artists and writers as well.
Last year I spent five months in Barcelona as a guest of the Catalan Government. During my stay in Barcelona I could hardly keep count of the number of exhibitions (many of them Government-sponsored) of work by American artists and photographers, some quite avant-garde, not to mention the extraordinary publicity those exhibitions received. Jennie Livingston, a film maker who received money a few years ago from the National Endowment to work on ''Paris Is Burning,'' a documentary about the gay culture of Harlem, ended up finishing the film with the help not of the N.E.A., but the BBC. If Europe continues to pick up the slack, the attack on the N.E.A. could result in the depletion of yet another precious American resource: our artists.
The most devastating effect of a Helms-controlled National Endowment, however, is one we won't see until a few years from now, when the furor has died down: the effect on the young novelist who cannot quit his job in order to devote a year to finishing his first novel, and therefore doesn't finish it; or on the young painter who cannot afford supplies, and therefore doesn't paint; or on the young film maker who, fearful of the strictures imposed on her by an N.E.A. run by the Republican Senator from North Carolina, censors her own creative impulses to satisfy such an organization's dubious morality.
I had my N.E.A. grant in 1985, in another time, before the infamous Mapplethorpe exhibition at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, before the addition of that notorious clause, before people's grants started being withheld. That year a friend sent me a clipping from the editorial page of The Manchester (N.H.) Union Leader, a vehement attack on the National Endowment that questioned the Government's right to spend taxpayers' money to support artists or writers whose work those taxpayers might find offensive or obscene. To my surprise, it was me who was offered up as an example in the article; do the American people really want their hard-earned dollars going to an author of ''paeans to homosexual love,'' the newspaper asked.
I remember laughing uncomfortably at that phrase, joking that if anything, my stories were paeans to the lack of love - homosexual or heterosexual. Apparently for The Union Leader, any piece of fiction with a gay character in it was necessarily a ''paean.'' Thus, I dismissed the editorial as right-wing nonsense, and went on to finish a novel the financing of which, in the current atmosphere, would certainly have been questioned, and most probably retracted.
 
Art Slowed But Not Stopped
 These days I think a lot about that editorial, and when I do, I wince at my own failure to recognize what it foreboded. Perhaps those of us who depended on the National Endowment, regularly or sporadically, got too comfortable, too complacent, cozying up as we did to a Government that handed out the money and never asked questions. In a chastening editorial in Outweek magazine, the novelist Sarah Schulman has suggested that the current crisis simply puts those few white, upper-middle-class gay and lesbian artists to whom the N.E.A. previously gave its seal of approval in the same position as the vast majority of artists who because of their race or class were never able to benefit from the N.E.A. reward system in the first place.
If the example of Hitler's ''degenerate art'' show teaches us anything, it is that while art can be slowed, it cannot be stopped. But the attack on the National Endowment is not simply about art, just as the ''degenerate art'' show was not simply about art; it is about trying to eradicate or at least suppress anything in American culture that challenges a fundamentalist Christian vision of family happiness that in its portrayal seems eerily similar to Hitler's artists' vision of Aryan farm life. Traditionally the head of state gives the opening address at the annual International AIDS Conference, no matter what country that conference takes place in; George Bush's decision this year to attend a Jesse Helms fund-raiser instead cannot be considered a coincidence.
Fear of change, fear of difference, fear of cultural erosion: all these fears of the extreme right mask, in fact, a deeper fear, a fear of the underground sexual desires every individual harbors (look at Jimmy Swaggart!) and for which homosexuals have traditionally been made into a catch-all symbol.
To say that gay men and lesbians are everywhere is only to say that sexuality is everywhere, that there are no rules other than the ones that we impose. Even in houses where Jesse Helms's picture hangs over the fireplace there are children who will grow up to be gay or lesbian, and some of them may become our greatest artists and writers. The influences that would supposedly seep into and corrupt the healthy American family landscape are in fact an integral part of that landscape already. What the N.E.A.'s opponents really seem to be fighting is the difference in themselves.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
FOREIGNERS TRAPPED TILL U.S. LEAVES REGION, IRAQI WARNS; SAYS KUWAIT IS 'ARAB ISSUE'

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Aug. 19

 BODY:
President Saddam Hussein of Iraq said tonight that he would free foreigners being held hostage in Iraq and Kuwait in exchange for a complete military and political pullout by the United States from the Persian Gulf region.
The Iraqi proposal came as diplomats said that some Western citizens were being moved to potential military targets to serve as human shields.
Leaving no doubt that the foreigners would be shields against bombing, Mr. Hussein said ''their presence, along with Iraqi families, at vital targets may prevent military aggression.''
 
Demands a Written U.S. Pledge
The trapped foreigners, more than 10,000, including about 3,000 Americans, could leave, Mr. Hussein said in a message broadcast over Baghdad television, if President Bush gave an unequivocal, written pledge to pull military forces out of the gulf, lifted the economic blockade imposed after the takeover of Kuwait and promised not to attack.
The Iraqi leader said that Mr. Bush's promise should be backed by a United Nations Security Council guarantee that the American forces would withdraw from Saudi Arabia and the gulf on a fixed timetable, as fast as they had been deployed. 
''Averting death and starvation resulting from American policy against Iraq, by preventing some citizens from traveling, is a gain for humanity as a whole,'' Mr. Hussein said in an effort to justify his refusal to let the foreigners leave. Discounted by U.S. He offered no response to international calls for the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait, terming it an ''Arab issue.''
Aboard the plane carrying Mr. Bush from his vacation home in Maine to Washington, the President's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, dismissed the Hussein statement.
''This one doesn't have much relationship to our objective,'' Mr. Fitzwater said. ''It contains no new relevant proposals and makes no reference to the United Nations and Arab League calls for them to leave Kuwait.''
In Middle East waters, American warships continued to shadow two Iraqi oil tankers while the Administration tried to gain United Nations approval for military action to enforce the international embargo.
On Saturday night, the United Nations Security Council demanded that Iraq free all detained foreigners and gave an implicit warning of military action if they were not freed.
The White House had also been terse on Saturday in response to the Iraqi threat to use hostages as human shields and limit their food. The Iraqi statements were said to be ''totally unacceptable.''
Both today and on Saturday, Mr. Bush declined to respond personally to Mr. Hussein.
In a ''goodwill gesture'' announced moments after the Iraqi leader's statement, Baghdad said that some Westerners from five countries that had not sent troops to join the forces in the gulf - Austria, Finland, Portugal, Sweden and Switzerland - would be allowed to leave.
It was not immediately clear how many of the estimated 570 citizens of the five countries would be freed.
President Hussein made no mention of withdrawing Iraqi troops occupying Kuwait, as has been demanded by Mr. Bush and the United Nations Security Council.
''Arabs would treat this as an Arab issue,'' Mr. Hussein said.
This was not an offer to pull out, particularly since he cited territory disputed in the Western Sahara between Morocco and Polisario guerrillas, and Syria's occupation of much of Lebanon, ''and other issues.'' #9,000 Ordered to Hotels What the Iraqi President described as a call for ''an in-depth dialogue'' came on a day that began with the Iraqi authorities in Kuwait ordering the 9,000 or so Western nationals there to report to three luxury hotels.
''Anyone who does not comply with this call,'' the announcement said, ''they and their governments bear full responsibility for any evil consequences resulting from acts against them by hostile powers.''
Iraqi officials, in a series of announcements on Saturday, said the Western, Japanese and Australian nationals forbidden to leave Iraq and Kuwait - estimated to total nearly 13,000 - would be interned at strategic military and industrial targets in the hope of warding off bombing attacks.
CBS News reported from Baghdad tonight that 35 Americans had taken refuge in American diplomatic quarters there after ''it became obvious that Iraqi authorities intended to round them up and send them out as hostages and human shields at possible U.S. bombing sites.''
The television report quoted an an American Embassy official as saying: ''We're not going to allow our people to be simply herded up like sheep and made to go places against their will without trying to help.''
Referring to the report, the State Department said, ''We can't confirm it and, therefore, we are not commenting.''
 
French, Too, Are Seized
The Iraqi ambassador to France told British television: ''I know for sure that some of your foreign nationals have already been distributed at the strategic sites and industrial sites in Iraq.''
The British Foreign office said that it had been informed by the Iraqi authorities that people who reported to the hotels in Kuwait would be ''transferred to key installations.''
''Those who do not report to the hotels will be rounded up and taken direct to the sites,'' the Foreign Office said the Iraqi officials had told them. This information was in a bulletin read over the BBC's hourly foreign news shortwave broadcasts.
The Foreign Office said that about 40 Britons had been moved out of their hotels in Kuwait to ''unknown destinations.''
British officials added they had reports that British citizens were being held at checkpoints in Kuwait City and that some foreigners had already been moved to strategic sites.
''In addition to British citizens, French, West Germans and Americans have been affected,'' the Foreign Office said.
The French Foreign Ministry protested to Iraq during the day that 26 French citizens had been taken from hotels in Baghdad and that one had been seized in Kuwait. French Navy ships in the gulf were given orders today to use force to carry out the United Nations economic embargo against Iraq.
 
'Keep a Low Profile'
The British Foreign Office told its nationals in Kuwait to stay indoors and ''keep a low profile.''
''We advise any whom the Iraqi authorities attempt to detain or move forcibly not to offer any resistance,'' the Foreign Office added.
In Washington, a State Department spokesman said: ''We've told the Iraqis in the past that we would not order our citizens to comply with such an order. We wouldn't order them around and we don't want the Iraqis to order them around either.
The Iraqi leader warned in his televised message, billed as an address to the families of the trapped foreigners, that ''many of our children and your children will be orphaned if war breaks out and many of our women and your women will become widows. Many of our men and your men will die.''
The later announcement of the ''good-will'' release of the limited number of foreigners, made by the Speaker of Parliament, Saadi Mahdi Saleh, appeared to suggest an effort to weaken the international economic embargo being imposed on Iraq and swap hostages for goods.
More foreigners might be released, Mr. Saleh said, if their countries did not impose ''sanctions on the import of food, medicine and other goods to Iraq.''
The vast majority of foreign workers in Kuwait and Iraq are Arabs - more than a million Egyptians alone - and other third-world nationals, particularly from the Indian subcontinent and the Philippines.
There has been no real attempt to hold these workers - indeed one announcement specifically exempted ''Egyptian brothers'' - and they have been streaming across the Saudi and Jordanian borders, about 100,000 so far, as tired, frightened, sweaty refugees.
More than 13,000 jammed the Jordanian border crossing today. Most had worked at menial jobs, struggling to build a stake for the future and now had lost everything.
The order in Kuwait this morning to report to the Hyatt Regency, Le Meridien and International Hotels specified ''Western foreigners and Australians.'' The largest groups in Kuwait, according to the latest estimates, were roughly 4,000 from Britain, 2,500 Americans, 552 Canadians, followed by substantial numbers of West Germans, French, Italians, Greeks, Swedes, Spaniards and a smattering of nearly all European nations.
Japanese citizens, who reportedly number about 278 in Kuwait and 230 in Iraq have been told they cannot leave.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
How Vulnerable Is Iraq?

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
Short of food and dependent on imports for everything from auto parts to chicken parts, Iraq's economy is widely assumed to be exceptionally vulnerable to a trade embargo. If the United States and its allies are prepared to stand up to Baghdad's threats over the weekend to cut off food to foreigners in Iraq - an indication that the embargo is indeed causing worry - the effects of the sanctions are likely to take hold quickly.
But experts are wary of predicting quick results from the economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations, even if they can be meticulously enforced.
For while Iraq is a warrior state that has grown accustomed to living well on foreign loans and the proceeds of oil exports, its capacity to adapt to shortages depends as much on psychological factors as on nuts-and-bolts economics. 
 
A Well-Endowed Economy
Few economies are so naturally well endowed as Iraq's. Along with the second-largest oil reserves in the Middle East, after Saudi Arabia's, Iraq is blessed with adequate water and a climate that can sustain a substantial base of agriculture. Its population of 18 million is large enough to provide a market for domestically made industrial goods - but not so large as to crowd the available land.
Since 1970, the Baath Party rulers have heavily invested in roads, irrigation canals and telecommunications. Foreign contractors, mostly Soviet and European, have built plants to make steel, chemicals, cement, electrical equipment, tractors, plastics, textiles, phosphate-based fertilizers, even cigarettes.
The WEFA Group, an economic consulting firm in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., says all this effort has left Iraq with an output of about $2,500 a person, not much below that of South Korea or Portugal. But the raw numbers mask Iraq's failure to create a diversified, economy capable of meeting the needs of domestic consumers or competing with industrial exports in foreign markets.
An obvious reason for Iraq's lagging economic development is President Saddam Hussein's enormous, well-equipped army, which has first claim on resources. Dorothea el-Mallakh, director of the International Research Center on Energy and Economic Development at the University of Colorado, says the army employs roughly one able-bodied man in four. Perhaps more important, it is a route of rapid social mobility and thus attracts the best and brightest.
 
Just One Export Crop
Heavy industry, until 1988 entirely state owned, grew artificially in a hothouse of direct subsidies and low-cost access to imported parts and materials. Agriculture, buffeted by Government policies that have alternately encouraged and discouraged private farming, has only recently shown signs of vitality.
It should not be surprising, then, that more than 90 percent of Iraq's export revenues and almost half of its national income derive from oil.
Dates are the only crop with a surplus that can be exported. The proclaimed goal of self-sufficiency has remained far out of reach, because Iraqi agriculture is not especially productive, in part because Government food subsidies that were used to buy the support of the urban majority have encouraged rapid growth of consumption.
The United States Agriculture Department calculates that Iraq must import about 60 percent of its food in good harvest years, about 70 percent in bad.
 
Chronic Dependence on Imports
Shipments of food, roughly one-quarter of all imports, cost Iraq $2 billion to $3 billion a year. Almost everything manufactured, from tires to tank shells, comes from abroad, too. Iraq even imports services and has brought in more than a million foreign workers, mostly Egyptians, Palestinians and Pakistanis, who send home about $1 billion a year.
Chronic dependence on imports, a pattern established during the eight-year war of attrition with Iran, which ended with a cease-fire in 1988, has led some outsiders to conclude that a trade embargo could quickly force President Hussein to his knees. Sharif Ghalib, director of Middle East affairs at the Institute for International Finance in Washington, said recent developments had only increased this perception of vulnerability.
A poor grain harvest led Iraq to dip into its grain reserves last year. The reserves were not replenished with imports - most likely, Mr. Ghalib suggests, because Iraq was trying to trim its outlays of foreign currencies.
 
Low Grain Stockpiles
That moderation reflected both the sagging price of oil and a postwar reduction in aid from the Persian Gulf oil states - including Kuwait. As a result, according to Agriculture Department estimates, Iraq had only a two-month supply of wheat, a three-month supply of rice and a two-week supply of corn when it invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
Kiren Chaudhry, a political scientist at the University of California at Berkeley, said she believed a fiscal crisis was a primary motive for President Hussein's blunt demands for billions of dollars in protection money from Persian Gulf oil kingdoms, and for the subsequent invasion of Kuwait.
An economic deregulation program, begun late in 1988, tried to stimulate growth and tame the Iraqis' appetite for imports. But the initial effect was to raise food prices, which accelerated the existing inflation rate of 40 percent and sharply reduced urban consumption.
 
Lower Living Standards
Food price controls were subsequently reimposed, and the prices of consumer goods sold by state enterprises were rolled back. But without protection money from gulf countries to supplement oil revenues, living standards remain far below the level that prevailed at the peak of the fighting with Iran.
Now, with an almost empty larder, an overdrawn bank account (the $3 billion to $4 billion Iraq brought back from Kuwait last week will not make much difference for a Government that owes foreign creditors some $70 billion) and a population reeling from austerity, President Hussein might be thought easy prey to the embargo.
But few experts are ready to predict his speedy fall. Paul Jureidini, a vice president of Abbott Associates, a consulting firm in Washington, said Iraq has the internal resources to sustain a living standard far above the level endured for years by, say, the Soviet people during World War II. It is self-sufficient in energy, of course, and transportation and electricity production are thus secure until a lack of spare parts begins to bite.
 
Deflecting Frustration
In the short run, the Hussein regime's staying power turns on its well-oiled machinery for holding the military in line, and ultimately on the public's acceptance of hardship. Ms. Chaudhry, the political scientist, said President Hussein had done well at deflecting frustration over his failure to deliver a promised ''peace dividend'' after the war with Iran ended.
He was successful, she noted, in blaming profiteering merchants for inflated food prices. And she said she expected he would be equally successful in blaming the United States for the current shortages.
A year or two or five from now, the United Nations embargo would surely drive Iraq to a change in policy or a shift in leadership. By the same token, a long siege would surely weaken the resolve of the shaky international coalition trying to defang President Hussein.
The embargo is thus a short-term contest, one in which the United States and its allies appear to hold the best cards, but the winner is far from clear.

HEADLINE: WELFARE ON RISE, REFLECTING SLUMP IN ECONOMY OF U.S.

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 19

 BODY:
In a further sign of weakness in the nation's economy, the number of people receiving food stamps and welfare benefits has jumped sharply this year. At least 44 states have reported increases in enrollment, some ranging up to 50 percent.
''Participation in the food stamp program has grown dramatically in the past 12 months,'' mirroring increases in the welfare caseload, said a report just submitted to Congress by the Agriculture Department, which administers the food stamp program.
Though some factors unrelated to the economy are cited as contributing to the increases, the food stamp rolls are considered a barometer of the nation's economic climate. They often signal economic difficulty in advance of the jobless rate because employed workers may qualify for food stamps when they experience a reduction in wages or working hours. 
The number of people on the food stamp rolls rose by 1.3 million from May 1989 to May 1990, when it topped 20 million for the first time since 1985. The Agriculture Department report said the increase in food stamp recipients was ''strongly correlated'' with growth of the main Federal-state welfare program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children.
 
Burden on Governments
The increase in applications is costing the states and the Federal Government billions of dollars. The Federal Government pays more than half the cost of the A.F.D.C. program and most of the cost of the food stamps. State governments also contribute to the programs and adminster them under Federal rules.
New Hampshire reports a 38 percent increase in welfare recipients and a 54 percent increase in food stamp recipients from June 1989 to June 1990. Thomas E. Pryor, the state official who supervises both programs, said in an interview that the increase resulted mainly from a slowdown in the New Hampshire economy, including defense-related industries. ''In many cases,'' he said, ''people have gone from working full time to working part time and have experienced a big decrease in income.''
In the last 12 months, food stamp rolls have increased 16 percent in Texas, 19 percent in Florida, 26 percent in Nevada, 12 percent each in Georgia and Massachusetts, 7 percent each in New York State and California and 21 percent in Connecticut.
Welfare rolls are up 15 percent in Texas, 14 percent in Florida, 15 percent in Nevada, 12 percent in Georgia, 9 percent in Massachusetts, 10 percent in California and 16 percent in Connecticut, state officials said.
''It's hard for people to believe these numbers,'' said Aldona Vaitkus of the State Department of Economic Security in Arizona, where the number of welfare recipients has increased 19 percent in the last year and the number of food stamp recipients is up 22 percent.
 
Faster Than Expected
The food stamp rolls have grown much faster than the Bush Administration expected. Assuming there would be 18.1 million people on the rolls, President Bush originally requested $13.3 billion for food stamps in the current fiscal year. Congress appropriated $14.8 billion. That proved inadequate, and Congress provided $1.2 billion extra in May.
The House has passed an appropriation bill that would provide $18.1 billion for food stamps in the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. The measure is pending in the Senate. Troubled by such increases, Congress directed the Agriculture Department to investigate the causes.
The department report said that ''44 states and the District of Columbia experienced a growth in participation'' in the food stamp program over the last year, while the nation's unemployment rate was relatively stable. But it said, ''Many states are showing signs of economic slowdown that are not reflected in national economic indicators.''
Michigan officials have the most unusual explanation for an increase in welfare caseload: a state ban on Medicaid-financed abortions. F. Charles Peller, a spokesman for the state's Department of Social Services, said the ban had apparently contributed to an increase in births to women with low incomes.
''About a year after the abortion ban took effect in December 1988, we saw a startling increase in the number of A.F.D.C. recipients, which is up 40,000 in the last six months, to a total of 670,000,'' he said.
 
New York Trend Reversed
New York reported a decrease in welfare recipients each year from 1985 to 1989, partly because of a strong economy and partly because of the state's success in preparing welfare mothers for jobs in private industry. But the state reported an increase of slightly more than 1 percent from June 1989 to June of this year, and state officials say the economic slowdown was a factor.
Federal and state officials list several other factors as contributing to the increase in welfare and food stamp rolls. Congress has made numerous incremental expansions of Medicaid, the Federal-state health program for low-income families. As a result, more women come into contact with the welfare system. When pregnant women and new mothers apply for Medicaid, state and local government employees, using computers, routinely check to see if they are eligible for other benefits like food stamps and welfare.
Some states, like Texas, are aggressively trying to make social welfare benefits and services more accessible, with simplified application forms and ''one-stop shopping'' for various services at a single site. Bush Administration officials have enthusiastically promoted this idea.
Jennifer A. Lange, chief of the Florida welfare program, said, ''We are finding people who might not otherwise have applied for A.F.D.C., but who are eligible for it.'' Claudia Langguth, Deputy Commissioner of Human Services in Texas, said her state had reduced its food stamp application form to 2 pages, from 18.
 
Effect of Aliens Discounted
Federal officials say some of the increase in food stamp rolls may be linked to the immigration law under which thousands of illegal aliens have gained legal status since 1987. Immigrant farm workers who gain legal status are allowed to receive food stamps.
But Mrs. Langguth of Texas said, ''We cannot find any impact because of the legalization of aliens.'' She said many aliens were reluctant to apply for welfare and food stamps, even after gaining legal status, because they tended to distrust the government.
Children born to illegal aliens in this country are United States citizens, fully eligible for public assistance. In Florida, Ms. Lange said, ''social workers tell us they are seeing an increase in the number of pregnant women who come to this country from Central America'' so their children will be born here.
Catherine A. Bertini, Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for Food and Consumer Services, said fraud was not a factor in the recent growth of food stamp rolls. ''The rolls are not up because of ineligible people getting benefits,'' she said in an interview.
The Agriculture Department report said, ''It is possible that social attitudes toward persons receiving government assistance have changed, and that people have become more willing to apply for food stamps.''
Mrs. Langguth endorsed that view. ''For the working poor,'' she said, ''there is definitely less of a stigma attached to use of food stamps, partly because so many people here had no other options when the economy took a downturn in the mid-1980's.''

HEADLINE: New York Real-Estate Slide Hits Biggest Developers

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
Some of New York's wealthiest and best-known developers, squeezed by the region's economic retrenchment and a dearth of young, high-salaried tenants, have missed monthly mortgage payments on large apartment complexes and, in at least one case, defaulted on a $100 million mortgage.
The difficulties encountered by some of the region's most prominent master builders - including the LeFrak and Milstein families - have startled many of their colleagues and others who follow the industry.
''You have a lot of major builders who are in trouble,'' said Richard L. Higgins, Commissioner of the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal. ''The ripple effect to the development community, the banking community, is not healthy to the economy in general. New York City is real estate. When real estate is in bad shape, that has a tremendous effect on the whole metropolitan area.'' 
 
Widespread Distress in Industry
The financial setbacks are not likely to pose a threat to existing tenants, nor do they suggest that any of the city's established real-estate empires is about to collapse. But the problems at a number of large apartment complexes indicate that the economic slump has begun to strain even the most experienced and resourceful developers.
Real-estate executives and government regulators said the difficulties of such prominent developers reflected widespread distress in the industry, and were likely to contribute to the pace of the general economic decline.
Milstein Properties - a family-owned business that is among the city's largest developers, with more than 10,000 apartments as well as a hotel and a bank - defaulted last month on its mortgage for the Normandie Court, a large rental complex with four towers occupying a full block bounded by East 95th and 96th Streets, and Second and Third Avenues.
The $100 million mortgage was turned over on Aug. 9 to its insurer, the Federal Housing Administration, which has begun negotiations with the owners over reorganizing the debt.
The huge Newport complex in Jersey City, owned by a consortium headed by Samuel J. LeFrak, who is also among New York's largest housing developers, has experienced financial difficulties with its apartment houses, said Alfred A. DelliBovi, Under Secretary of the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Newport has not defaulted on its $150 million mortgage, but it is being monitored by the Federal Housing Administration, which insured the mortgage, Mr. DelliBovi said.
 
Other Rental Buildings Watched
''If the wealthiest people in the industry, the Milsteins and the LeFraks, can't make these work, with all their expertise and construction abilities, I despair for rental housing,'' said Arthur William Zeckendorf, vice president of the Zeckendorf Company.
Two other new rental apartment buildings in Manhattan are also being watched by Federal officials because of concern over their financial viability, Mr. DelliBovi said: the Windsor Court, two high-rise towers that occupy the block bounded by East 31st and 32d Streets, and Third and Lexington Avenues, and the Ritz Plaza, a high-rise at 235 West 48th Street. Both carry Federal mortgage insurance.
The Milsteins also own Windsor Court. They missed mortgage payments twice this spring, but are now up to date on their obligations, said James M. Yasser, senior vice president of Milstein Properties. Jason D. Carter is the owner of the Ritz Plaza.
The disclosure of financial setbacks at those projects follows widespread publicity over the revising of Donald J. Trump's debt, and an acknowledgement by Glick Development Affiliates, another prominent real-estate firm, that it had not paid monthly mortgage payments since last November on a new high-rise condominium apartment tower, the Horizon, at 415 East 37th Street.
 
Fewer Young High Spenders
The owners revealed the missed payments in financial statements filed in June with the State Attorney General's office, which oversees cooperatives and condominiums. Jeffrey Glick said on Thursday that the Chase Manhattan Bank had agreed to reorganize the building's financing.
''There is great concern,'' said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, the trade group. ''I would say that everybody has got some trouble, that's how widespread it is. They have trouble either because apartments are not selling or because rental space is not renting.''
Complexes like Normandie Court and Newport, high-rent apartments not in the most fashionable neighborhoods, have been particularly vulnerable, real-estate executives said, because they depend primarily on young, affluent and reasonably adventurous New Yorkers. The retrenchment on Wall Street has led to fewer young executives able to pay $2,500 a month for a two-bedroom apartment.
Whether owners maintain control of troubled buildings will depend largely on the patience of those holding the mortgages, from banks and insurance companies to the Federal Government, and on whether they see any financial opportunities in foreclosing on the properties and trying to sell them in a slumping market.
Many lenders appear willing to be flexible, said Mr. Higgins, the state housing commissioner. ''I don't know a lot of mortgagors who want to manage and operate real estate, especially in this market,'' he said.
Some real-estate professionals say that while certain segments of New York's market are clearly suffering -particularly cooperative or condominium sales and the conversions of existing rental housing to co-ops - the luxury rental housing market has not entirely lost its vitality.
''Demand has remained fairly strong, because people have stopped buying apartments,'' said Andrew J. Singer, a mortgage broker. It is cheaper to rent a luxury apartment than to buy one, Mr. Singer said, and it requires no down payment.
 
Normandie Court's Problems
Federal officials have begun discussing possibly reorganizing the debt at Normandie Court. The mortgage on which Milstein Properties defaulted last month was financed by the State Housing Finance Agency. It covers three of the four 34-story towers, and 1,100 of the complex's 1,500 apartments.
The 11 percent mortgage was negotiated in 1984, when rates were higher than they were in later years, said Mr. Yasser, the Milstein executive. He said the relatively costly financing was one reason for the problems at the Normandie Court, which he said had had operating losses totaling $20 million in the four years since it opened.
The fourth building, also financed through the state, has a separate, variable-rate mortgage and as a result has not been running a deficit, he said.
Twenty percent of the apartments at Normandie Court are set aside for moderate- and middle-income New Yorkers, with the rest renting at market rates. That was one reason it qualified for the below-market state financing. Mr. Yasser said Normandie Court, like other apartment buildings in the program, which is called 80-20, was at a particular disadvantage in the highly competitive luxury rental market because of the lower rental income.
 
Rents Are Flat or Falling
He said the complex also had problems common to high-end rental housing. Turnover is way up, demand has dropped and thus rents are flat or falling. Normandie Court is at 97 percent occupancy, Mr. Yasser said; yet it is losing money because rents are lower than were projected when the project was underwritten and the mortgage interest rate is high.
Mr. DelliBovi, the Federal housing department Under Secretary, made it clear that he hoped the negotiations with the Milsteins to reorganize the complex's financing would succeed, in part because it is economically integrated, with a proportion of moderate- and middle-income tenants.
The LeFraks' 1,500 rental apartments in four towers at Newport, the huge complex of apartments, office buildings and stores in Jersey City, have a similar proportion of moderate- and middle-income tenants. Both Mr. LeFrak and his son, Richard, are out of the country, said officials of their organization, who declined to comment on the financial difficulties at Newport.
Neither the LeFraks nor the owners of the two other New York apartment complexes that are being monitored by the Federal housing agency have defaulted on their mortgages, but many real-estate officials said they would not rule out the possibility.
''We're watching them because we have the insurance,'' Mr. DelliBovi said. ''There are problems with all four of them related to the real-estate market in New York. You can trace the problems of each of these buildings back to that day in October 1987 when Wall Street crashed.''

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Oil, Saddam Hussein and the Re-emergence of America as the Superpower

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 19

 BODY:
The obituaries were a bit premature.
There is still one superpower in the world, and it is the United States. More than any other country in the world, its interests, its exposure and its reach are global, as the events of the last two weeks have demonstrated so vividly.
Washington is not the backwater that it seemed to some when the action was all in the streets of Prague or at the Berlin wall.
But as the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, has reveled in reminding everyone this summer weekend, the costs of maintaining such status can be enormous, and not only in terms of national treasure. The lives of thousands of civilian hostages have been put at risk in the Middle East, to say nothing of those of tens of thousands of soldiers, sailors and airmen. Even then, it is not clear that United States arms and diplomacy will achieve President Bush's goals. 
There are inescapable limits on what even superpowers can accomplish, and if they overreach, or fail, doubt and irresolution often follow.
 
U.S. Dependence on Imported Oil
Other harsh realities are easy to forget in the heat of the moment. The dispatch of American military power to the Middle East was made more urgent because the United States has allowed itself to become heavily dependent on foreign oil. The show of force was useful, furthermore, precisely because some people had begun to doubt American will in the post-cold war era.
Still, even in a hot, humid month when much of Washington is on vacation, there is a rush of excitement in the air here. In news bureaus and Pentagon offices, dining rooms and lobbyists' hangouts, the fever is back - the heavy speculation, the avid gossip, the gung-ho, here's-where-it's-happening spirit, that marks the city when it grapples with great events.
''These days, conversations are huddled,'' said Stan Bromley, the manager of the Four Seasons Hotel, where King Hussein of Jordan stayed. ''People are leaning closer together. It's serious business.''
Only a month ago, after the summit conferences in London and in Houston, after President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany concluded a deal that the White House knew nothing of, it seemed clear that some of the power the United States has wielded in the postwar era was slipping away. The soon-to-be-united Germany and a stunningly wealthy Japan went their own ways on important questions, with Mr. Bush, making a virtue of a necessity, graciously wishing them well.
In a world suddenly escaped from the shadow of nuclear confrontation between East and West, economic strength was king, diplomats and politicians said, and that made it harder for the United States, militarily strong but struggling with fiscal problems, to exercise political leadership.
 
No One, Universal Power
The crisis in the Persian Gulf has demonstrated that all of that is valid, but only to a limited extent, only in some places on some issues.
''It is most certainly true,'' said Representative Lee H. Hamilton, Democrat of Indiana, a leading spokesman for his party on foreign policy issues, ''that there has been a remarkable diffusion of power in the world. No one is the unchallenged boss everywhere, on everything, and no one is likely to hold that position, as we did after the war, very soon again.
''But when action is needed against an aggressor, only the United States has the wherewithal to respond.''
So it is the United States, not Germany or Japan, that has drawn the line in the sand against an Iraqi attack on Saudi Arabia, with its huge oil reserves that Germany and Japan need more, in fact, than the United States does.
''The realities are back in the forefront,'' a senior European diplomat said. ''The realities are American power and leadership. As the world is now constructed, there is often absolutely no substitute for them.''
Economic power counts for more where no one is challenging the status quo, where the political order is legitimate and longstanding, as in much of Europe and, to a slightly lesser degree, in East Asia. That is decidedly not the case in the Middle East.
 
Where U.S. Is Still Central
''There are a lot of different chessboards now,'' said Michael Mandelbaum of the Council on Foreign Relations and Johns Hopkins University. ''On some of them, like aid to the Soviet Union and Central Europe, we aren't the main player. But on this one, in the struggle for Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, we're supremely important.''
Because oil is the indispensable element for modern industrial civilization, at least for the immediate future, and because 40 percent of it is in the Persian Gulf region, the instability there - as opposed, for example, to the instability in Africa - is deemed worthy of military intervention, as a last resort, by decision-makers in dozens of world capitals.
But in Europe, where each country has different geopolitical, economic and constitutional concerns, institutions are slow to decide, and some, like NATO, are designed to act effectively in only one set of circumstances - an attack within Europe - and not in others.
This time, Germany is hamstrung, constrained by law but even more by the past. Even a suggestion by Mr. Kohl last week that he might send minesweepers to the Persian Gulf produced a political uproar, with a clash between the Chancellor and his Foreign Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, and a debate as to whether German troops should ever engage in armed conflicts again, even as peacekeepers.
Japan was so perplexed in the early days of the crisis that Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu had to cancel a long-planned trip to the region because he did not know what to say if asked how Japan proposed to help. Now, after tremendous soul-searching, he is considering sending nonmilitary support personnel to assist American and other military forces - a bold step for Japan, unmatched since World War II, but still something of a token gesture.
 
Thatcher's Decisiveness
The major exception is Britain, able to act fast because it has a unitary Government, with no junior coalition partners, and headed by an extraordinarily decisive woman, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who has fought to keep the British-American special relationship alive as others dismissed it as moribund. The old imperial tradition in the zone east of Suez makes things easier for the British, too.
Only the Soviet Union has a military establishment in the same league as that of the United States.
Had the current emergency arisen a decade ago, it would have provided a prime opportunity for Soviet intervention, but Moscow is so preoccupied now with internal questions as to seem uninterested. Mr. Gorbachev is seeking instead to play a peacekeeping role through the United Nations, hoping to gain credibility with some Arab leaders, but he is in no position to move thousands of troops long distances almost overnight.
So the field is clear for Washington this time, at least as long as Mr. Bush can keep the country behind him. There are a few warning lights flashing; like other members of Congress who have been back in their districts this week, Mr. Hamilton reports that his constituents are ambivalent, ''taking a certain pride in our superpower status, but more and more questioning the cost of that unique position, in terms of taxes and of families separated.''
In the longer term, Washington faces a major task in defining exactly where the spheres of vital interest to the United States lie, and building a broad public consensus behind that set of priorities. Failing that, said Robert D. Hormats of Goldman Sachs, formerly a high-ranking official at the State and Treasury Departments, ''we'll be unable to sustain public support when the crises come, we'll have to pull back and we'll lose credibility.''

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
U.S. Consults U.N. on Use of Force As Navy Shadows 2 Iraqi Tankers

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 19

 BODY:
With American warships shadowing two loaded Iraqi oil tankers in Middle East waters, the Bush Administration began a round of urgent diplomacy today in hopes of winning United Nations approval of its use of military power to enforce the international embargo on trade with Iraq, Administration officials said.
But a senior official said the United States was prepared to order the Navy to halt the two tankers in any case, even if it did not succeed in the diplomatic effort.
The two tankers, both outward bound from the Persian Gulf and evidently loaded with Iraqi oil, defied a series of warning shots fired across their bows by American warships on Saturday, the first shots fired by American military forces in the Persian Gulf crisis.
The senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the United States wanted to avoid renewing the friction that developed in the United Nations last week when President Bush acted unilaterally to impose a blockade against Iraq and Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. But the official said, ''It's not question of if we are going to stop these tankers. It's a question of when.'' 
 
Resolution Being Prepared
Officials from the delegations of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council held at least two meetings today to discuss a resolution that would authorize the use of military power to enforce the worldwide embargo on trade with Iraq that was imposed after the Iraqis' Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
The United States, which has only a few days before the first of the ships reaches its intended port, is hoping to arrange a Security Council meeting as early as Monday, officials said. Administration officials said Washington has asked Britain to introduce a draft resolution, which the five permament Council members were considering today.
United States Navy ships, part of an international flotilla that is seeking to block the export of Iraqi oil and maritime trade bound for Iraq, were monitoring several other vessels that were believed bound for Iraq with food and other supplies, officials said.
Pentagon officials today said the Navy had stopped a Cypriot freighter traveling under the Sudanese flag from entering the Red Sea port of Aqaba, Jordan, to pick up 550 Sudanese citizens who were trying to leave the area.
Although a senior official said the action ''certainly appeared to be odd under the circumstances,'' other officials said the freighter was carrying a load of chrome and steel bound for Iraq and planned to unload that cargo before picking up the refugees. That would have had the effect of breaching the embargo, the officials said.
Mr. Bush brushed aside questions about the military developments in the Persian Gulf as he flew home tonight from his vacation home in Kennebunkport, Me., to meet with national security advisers at a White House dinner.
He plans to address a gathering of the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Baltimore on Monday and attend Republican Party campaign fund-raisers in Maryland and Rhode Island before returning to Maine. Although this is the second time Mr. Bush has returned to Washington to meet with his aides since he left for vacation on Aug. 10, the White House has tried hard to present the image of business as usual.
Mr. Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, dismissed a statement by President Saddam Hussein of Iraq in which he said he would allow Americans and Britons trapped in Iraq and Kuwait to go free if the United States withdrew its forces from Saudi Arabia and lifted the trade embargo.
''This one doesn't have much relationship to our objective,'' he said. ''It contains no new relevant proposals and makes no reference to the United Nations and Arab League calls for them to leave Kuwait.''
 
The Unspoken Word: Hostages
The Administration has been trying to dampen anxiety about the trapped Americans, and Mr. Fitzwater today said Washington still does not regard the approximately 3,500 Americans trapped in Iraq and Kuwait as hostages.
Although the United States representative to the United Nations, Thomas R. Pickering, did say on Saturday that Iraq ''is going to hold all foreigners hostage,'' Mr. Fitzwater said today, ''They are in the same boat as thousands of others. We would not use that word.''
Mr. Fitzwater, noting that the two Iraqi tankers are ''several days out of port,'' said, ''We intend to enforce the sanctions. But we want to give them every opportunity to turn around and change course.''
But other officials said the United States does not expect the two ships -the Khanaqin and the Baba Gurgur -to stop. An Administration official said one of the ships is headed to Yemen. The other's destination was not known. The Khanaqin was sailing in the Gulf of Oman today, while the Baba Gurgur was farther behind. It was reported this afternoon to be just leaving the Persian Gulf, which is separated from the Gulf of Oman by the Strait of Hormuz. Disagreement at U.N. Representatives of the five permament members of the United Nations Security Council - the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union and China - met in the morning to to discuss the British proposed resolution, which would put teeth, including an authorization to use military force, into the trade embargo against Iraq.
The initial meeting failed to resolve the issue, a United States official said, and the political counselors of the five nations met tonight to continue the negotiations.
''These have been informal meetings that we hope would lead to a resolution that the permanent five could support at a Security Council meeting, hopefully on Monday, to strengthen the provisions for the enforcement of the embargo,'' one official said. He added, ''That would include military force.''
But the American official said none of the five has yet requested a meeting of the Security Council, hoping to work out their differences over the resolution before doing so.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF: U.S. CONSULTS U.N. ON USE OF FORCE AS NAVY SHADOWS 2 IRAQI TANKERS;
Cheney With the Admirals

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANAMA, Bahrain, Aug. 19

 BODY:
With tension running high in the Persian Gulf region after Iraqi ships ignored American warning shots, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney met here today with the commanders of the United States' naval blockade of Iraq.
After arriving here on a four-day visit to American forces and Arab leaders in the region, the Defense Secretary went immediately to the La Salle, the command ship for American vessels in the Persian Gulf, for a briefing on the Persian Gulf situation by Adm. William Fogarty, the head of the Navy's fleet in the gulf, and Adm. Henry Mauz, who commands all American naval forces in the Middle East. 
Mr. Cheney left the aircraft carrier Eisenhower in the Red Sea this morning and flew to an air base in eastern Saudi Arabia, where he greeted American troops.
The crisis in the gulf deepened on Saturday when the Navy frigate Reid fired six warning shots toward an Iraqi oil tanker, the Khanaqin, in the Gulf of the Oman and the frigate Bradley fired three shots toward a second Iraqi tanker, the Baba Gurgur, in the Persian Gulf. Neither vessel stopped, posing a challenge to Mr. Bush's policy to interdict oil and other material going to and from Iraq.
 
Movement of Ships
The Reid is continuing to shadow the Khanaqin as it moves slowly toward the Arabian Sea. The Bradley is tracking the Baba Gurgur as it moves south in the Persian Gulf. Neither ship is very close to its intended destination so it is not imperative to take immediate action to prevent the delivery of the tankers' cargoes, American officials said.
American officials said that the Heng Chun Hai, a Chinese vessel headed out of the Persian Gulf with fertilizer from Iraq, was boarded by the American cruiser England on Saturday and ordered to return to its port of origin. It is currently at anchor in the gulf, officials said. This is the first report of a ship being boarded as part of the Iraqi blockade.
Meanwhile, there were reports that an Iraqi freighter, the Zein al-Qaws, believed to be carrying food, has eluded the American blockade and arrived at Aqaba, Jordan.
Asked about this on the ABC News program ''This Week,'' Mr. Cheney avoided a direct answer.
''Jordan is not a nation that has been sanctioned by the United Nations,'' he said, ''so traffic into and out of the gulf is not automatically prohibited. Traffic that we can identify as going through Jordan to be trans-shipped through Jordan to Iraq would in fact be subject to the sanctions.''
American officials said that news reports that a ferry for Sudanese refugees from Iraq and Kuwait had been turned away from the Gulf of Aqaba appeared to be a reference to a Cypriot vessel. American officials said on Saturday that the Cypriot vessel was turned away because it appeared to be carrying chemicals destined for Iraq.
 
Instructions for Boarding Teams
Reporters traveling with Mr. Cheney were told that boarding teams have been organized on Navy ships in the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea.
A lieutenant on the cruiser Ticonderoga said that he headed a 13-man boarding team armed with .45-caliber revolvers, shotguns, an automatic rifle and a grenade launcher. The boarding team also has protective gear for use against chemical weapons.
After boarding, the teams are instructed to present yellow plastic cards bearing instructions written in French, Arabic and English warning crew members on the vessel being boarded to ''remain calm'' and to ''avoid confrontation.''
'' Do not interfere with U.S. forces; If fighting starts in your area, drop to the deck with your hands outstretched and remain silent. Follow all instructions,'' the card states.
''You will be taken to a safe place. Report all injuries, so we may treat you, and cooperate, and no harm will come to you,'' the card adds.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Jordan Asserts U.S. Stopped Refugee Rescue Ship

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Aug. 19

 BODY:
Jordan charged today that an American warship in the Red Sea turned back a ship en route to the port of Aqaba to pick up refugees from Kuwait.
Jordan, which has been under pressure from the United States to join other nations in enforcing trade sanctions against Iraq, reacted indignantly to the incident and took the unusual step of summoning Roger Harrison, the United States Ambassador, to the Foreign Ministry and issuing a formal protest.
''Jordan expressed its concern over this move,'' a senior Government official said, ''because this ship had no intention of either moving goods to Iraq or doing anything except the humanitarian task of moving Sudanese nationals.''
In a separate statement, the Government said: ''The action foiled Jordan's efforts in extending humanitarian services for all foreigners crossing into Jordan from Iraq.'' 
 
U.S. Regrets Reported
Jordan said in the statement that Mr. Harrison confirmed the incident and ''expressed his Government's regrets.''
But Patrick Theros, the American Ambassador's deputy, would only say through a spokesman, ''We do not comment on diplomatic exchanges between Jordan and the United States.'' [The Associated Press reported that the Pentagon confirmed that the Scott, a destroyer, had intercepted a Cypriot ferry flying the flag of Sudan as it tried to enter Aqaba.] Jordan identified the vessel as the 12,000-ton Sudanese freighter Dongola and said it had been confronted on Saturday night. The Dongola was carrying a load of cars for Jordan, a Government official said, and was scheduled to board 800 Sudanese, who had been working in Kuwait before the Iraqi invasion on Aug. 2. The refugees, the Government said, were to be taken back to the Sudan. [The A.P. quoted Sudanese officials in Khartoum as saying the Sudan planned to lodge a protest in Washington. They also said the Dongola had been carrying 200 tons of cargo, mainly steel.] Talks Are Under Way As the shipping incident was made public, thousands of Arab and Asian refugees from Kuwait and Iraq were flooding across the Iraq-Jordan border, and Jordanian officials said talks were under way between the two nations to slow arrivals in Jordan at least temporarily.
''The border facilities are overloaded,'' an official said, ''and tens of thousands of people are in Aqaba waiting for ships to take them home.''
Jordanian officials estimated that more than 150,000 refugees, including about 200 Westerners, have crossed into Jordan since Kuwait was invaded and American troops began landing in Saudi Arabia to confront Iraq. About 40,000 have arrived in the last four days as the threat of war has grown.
Some of the refugees have been leaving Amman on international airline flights. But many Egyptian and Sudanese laborers with modest incomes have taken cross-country buses to Aqaba, Jordan's only outlet to the sea, with plans to catch inexpensive ferries and boats home.
''There is a very terrible situation in Aqaba,'' a Jordanian official said. ''These people cannot be absorbed. There are not enough services, not enough hotel rooms. Some people are sleeping outside.''
 
Economic Effect Cited
In resisting implementation of sanctions, Jordan argues that cutting off trade with Iraq, its biggest trading partner, would deprive the already troubled Jordanian economy of more than $1 billion a year. Iraq also supplies 90 percent of Jordan's oil.
But Jordan also has strong bonds with Iraq. The Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein, has become a close friend of King Hussein of Jordan. The Iraqi leader is cheered at rallies at which the American flag is burned, and newspaper columnists have praised him for standing up for Arab dignity against foreign powers.
The sanctions were one of the key issues in talks between President Bush and King Hussein in their meeting Thursday in Kennebunkport, Me. Mr. Bush said afterward that he was encouraged that Jordan would be joining in the boycott of Iraq. But the King told reporters in Maine that Jordan's position had not been altered.
In what is widely seen by Westerners here as another delaying tactic, a delegation of Jordanian officials is meeting with United Nations officials in New York on Monday ''to discuss details'' of the measures, which have already been put into effect by all other countries in the region.
 
Reduction in Ships to Aqaba
Even without Jordanian action, the United Nations call for sanctions and the American armada have persuaded many ship owners to stop carrying cargo bound for Iraq.
''There has been a tremendous slowdown in the number of ships coming to Aqaba,'' a senior Jordanian official said tonight.
Jordan has been arguing recently that it is inhumane to follow the United States in denying food shipments to Iraq and may violate the United Nations charter.
Today an organization called the General Union of Voluntary Societies placed an advertisement taking up the lower third of the front page of the daily Jordan Times under the heading, ''Milk For the Children of Iraq.'' Half a dozen Government offices were listed as places where contributions could be made.
 
France to Join Embargo
PARIS, Aug. 19 (Special to The New York Times) - France moved closer today to the position adopted by the United States and Britain on the Iraqi crisis when it ordered its naval forces in the Persian Gulf to apply the trade embargo against Iraq ''with firmness.''
French officials refused to say whether French warships were now permitted to use force in cases where ships heading to or from Iraq refuse to stop and be searched. But a Foreign Ministry statement said that to be effective, the United Nations embargo implied ''measures of verification, control and constraint.''
At the United Nations last week, France criticized moves by the United States and Britain to establish a naval blockade of Iraq, arguing that only the Security Council could authorize such an action.
Meanwhile, the French Foreign Ministry confirmed today that 27 French nationals - one in Kuwait and 26 in Baghdad - were among Western civilians who were apparently moved to strategic military or civilian locations inside Iraq on Thursday.

HEADLINE: From State Pricing to Stoop Labor, Soviet System Dooms a Bumper Crop

SERIES: SOVIET FOOD CRISIS: HARVEST OF WASTE - SECOND OF TWO ARTICLES.

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Aug. 19

 BODY:
When the first reports from the Soviet grain belt reached Moscow early this summer, it seemed that fate had at last chosen to take pity on the famished economy of Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
Wheat had burst from the soil of Russia, the Ukraine, Byelorussia and Kazakhstan in such profusion that some Government optimists began to speculate about the country becoming self-sufficient in food for the first time in decades.
But Moscow's hope has soured into anxiety, and the anxiety to near despair, as the feckless Soviet agriculture system fumbles the process of putting nature's bounty onto dinner tables across the nation.
In a desperate attempt to prevent the crop from spoiling on the ground, 100,000 troops have been mobilized, factory workers and students exhorted to the fields, states of emergency decreed in many farm districts, directives issued, new incentives enacted -apparently to little avail.
 
Barren Grocery Stores
By mid-August, halfway through the harvest season, the Government reported that the grain was being cut at only three-fourths the rate of last year. The lag in the vegetable harvest was visible in the barren state grocery stores and in astronomical fruit and vegetable prices in farmers' markets. 
Soviet officials say the country's farmers have grown enough this year to exceed the record 237-million-ton harvest of 1978, but there is increasing anxiety that the final total, measured by shipments to market, will fall short of that potential.
The preliminary estimates of the grain wasted from what one Soviet writer called ''this catastrophically rich harvest'' was 40 million tons -roughly equal to the amount of grain the Soviet Union will import this year with its desperately scarce reserves of foreign money.
''This year God gave us a good harvest, and we are unable to gather it!'' wailed Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, his voice verging on hysteria during a televised emergency meeting of his Council of Ministers early this month.
''If we fail, then what purpose are we serving, those of us sitting here and the local authorities?'' asked the Prime Minister, whose position as Mr. Gorbachev's head of government is already precarious.
One failure of farming Communist-style is a communal approach to owning and working the land, an approach that has stifled initiative. Another failure, exposed by this summer's embarrassment of riches, is a command-driven food industry that assures that even when nature does provide, much of its bounty will be spilled on the way from field to consumer.
The losses the Soviets tolerate in normal years - about 15 percent of the grain and 30 percent of the vegetables - ''would be considered disastrous'' in the United States or Canada, said one Western agricultural specialist here.
Moreover, in this time of social disintegration, the built-in weaknesses of the system have been further aggravated by ethnic unrest, the breakdown of discipline and the disruption of old economic arrangements. A system based on commands, the Soviet food industry is learning this summer, only works so long as people obey.
The Soviet food industry leaks at each stage in the trip from collective farm to state-run market, but about half of losses occur on the farm itself, , a result of inadequate machinery and manpower, officials say.
 
Stranded Machinery
The overall slowdown of the Soviet economy has left harvesting combines stranded this year for lack of batteries, spare parts and fuel.
According to Vladlen V. Nikitin, chairman of the State Commission on Foodstuffs, one-fifth of the serviceable harvesters have no drivers - a result of the mass exodus that yearly takes a million people from the impoverished countryside to the slightly less impoverished cities.
The harvest usually depends on crash teams of extra hands mobilized from factories, schools and military bases. In effect, part of the industrial sector takes a holiday so that machinists, bookkeepers and doctors can do stoop labor on the state's farms. This has always been casual labor in the most literal sense of the word. A reporter who dropped in unannounced one morning at the barracks of temporary workers at a grain elevator near Kaluga, in central Russia, found the crew all giggling drunk on watery beer, half an hour before their shift began.
 
Low Enthusiasm
This year the enthusiasm for the harvest campaign is lower than ever. The rubles paid for stoop labor do not buy much any more, and the Communist Party network responsible for mustering the seasonal work force has lost much of its authority.
Vegetable farms, which are especially dependent on seasonal guest workers, report that helpers are showing up at only one-fifth the usual rate.
Once the crop is out of the ground, most of it is to be delivered to the Government in fulfillment of state contracts, for distribution to the bakeries and feedlots and state-run grocery stores.
But another new hitch is that farms are increasingly reluctant to surrender their goods.
One reason is the quirky state-run price system. A collective farmer near Kaluga gave the following example:
The state price on grain last year was so low that the farm lost money on every ton. The state price on milk, however, produced a big profit. The logical conclusion: neglect the state and keep the grain to feed the cows.
 
Bartering for Scarcities
Many farms have simply ignored their contracts and kept the grain either to feed livestock for local consumption, or to barter directly with other regions for such scarcities as building materials, which rubles cannot buy.
At the Chapayev Collective Farm in the village of Vasyurinskaya, near Krasnodar in southern Russia, the management has created a trading subsidiary. The subsidiary takes the farm's surplus and also buys up food from the private garden plots in the area to ship to the far north and far east in exchange for timber, steel and pipe.
''We offer the population fairly high prices so that they do not take their produce to the market but sell it to our trading cooperative,'' explained Grigory P. Onishchuk, the deputy director of the farm.
The farm is also building its own sausage plant and bakery and contemplating a cannery as alternatives to the state.
Some economists welcome this as a healthy sign that farmers are becoming more entrepreneurial. But it also means serious hardship for regions of the country with little to swap, for low-income pensioners who can only afford to shop in state-priced grocery stores, and for industries like poultry and pork that tend to depend heavily on feed requisitioned by the center.
 
Payment in Dollars
To combat local hoarding, the Government announced last year that it would pay farmers for part of their grain in dollars, giving them access to foreign goods. The program has faltered so far because farmers said the dollar prices were too stingy, and because the Government made it extremely difficult to spend the money.
Prospects for an increase in the barter economy are also undercut by the fact that most Soviet farms do not have their own storage sites, relying instead on state grain silos that fill quickly in a bumper year.
Once a farm has gathered its crop and decided to turn it over to the state, the next problem is getting it there.
Few farms have enough trucks to manage a big harvest, and this year there have been numerous reports of harvested grain lying in the fields, rotting in the rain.
In an effort to deliver the crop, farmers assemble mismatched caravans of dump trucks, flatbeds, army trucks and whatever other vehicles can be found.
 
Overloaded Trucks
''The trucks are old, with big cracks in the container,'' said Vladimir B. Khutaryants, director of a grain elevator in Krasnodar. ''The smaller the trucks, the more runs they make every day, the more losses we have. That's not even to speak of the carelessness of the drivers. They are paid by the ton delivered, so they are interested in loading the truck to the brim.''
The next stage of the process, deliveries from the elevators to mills and feedlots, has suffered from a severe shortage of railroad cars, resulting from strikes by nationalists in Azerbaijan and Georgia. Freight cars have also been diverted to coal regions in response to demands by striking miners. Processing is the next choke point. ''It's overwhelming, their ability to grow,'' marvelled Richard Bosio, a Modesto, Calif., businessman scouting potential investments this summer in the Krasnodar area. ''And then it gets to the processing, and it stops there and rots in the truck.''
 
Stuck in the 1930's
The canneries, breweries and slaughterhouses, he said, were all stuck in the 1930's, still heavily dependent on manual processes and not designed to grow.
''Their canning and bottling plants do maybe 3,000 a day,'' he said. ''We do that in minutes. In the United States we're always ahead of our yield. The capacity to grow is a given. Not in Russia.''
Mr. Bosio said the system has so many bottlenecks that the problem must be solved gradually. Installing state-of-the-art equipment at one stage would just mean more produce to clog the next stage. To give a farmer a mechanized tomato picker, for example, without building storage sheds and installing new canning equipment, would just add to the pile of rotting tomatoes.
''There is a lot of used equipment in world,'' he said. ''I kind of think they should be thinking in those terms. The question is, do we bring these people into the 70's? Or do we bring them up to the 21st century and boggle their minds?''

Aiding the Poor Receives Its Reward

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS OJOS, N.M.,

 BODY:
One morning a few weeks ago Maria Varela received a telephone call informing her that after a lifetime of working with the poor, she suddenly had become rich.
It was a surprise notification from the MacArthur Foundation in Chicago that she had received a $305,000 grant. She was told that the money was for her personal use so she could continue her efforts with the corporation she had started to create profitable businesses for the sheep herders, weavers and housewives of the impoverished Chama Valley in northern New Mexico.
''At first I thought it was a hoax,'' Ms. Varela said, ''and so I didn't tell anybody about it. Then I started feeling like a tremendous burden had been taken off my shoulders. My line of work does not exactly pay very well, and it doesn't provide any retirement benefits.'' 
She is to receive the money over five years in quarterly checks. Ms. Varela, along with her husband, who is a construction worker, and their 11-year-old daughter lives in a trailer without running water. She said the first check went to pay bills and the second may as well.
The MacArthur Fellowships, as the grants are known, are distributed every year to support the work of individuals in fields as diverse as medical research and poetry.
In the case of Ms. Varela, 50 years old, the money was a reward for a career of social activism that began in the 1960's when concern for the poor was popular and that has continued through times when such commitment has been less fashionable.
The very practical side of her convictions became apparent in a visit to the enterprises created by Ganados del Valle, Spanish for ''livestock of the valley,'' the economic development corporation she helped create in 1983.
She sounded like a foreman when she discussed floorboards with workers carrying out the renovation of a 1890's building that is to become a general store.
She sounded like an accountant when she detailed the savings gleaned from a solar-powered wool drier.
Walking through the showroom of Tierra Wools, a spinning and weaving cooperative that produces and sells high-quality yarns, clothing and rugs, she sounded like an entrepreneur, talking about the $250,000 in yearly sales and the commercial loan negotiated this year after six years of dependence on money from foundation grants.
Later, recalling the early training she received from the Young Christian Students, a Roman Catholic organization active in social causes, she said, ''I learned then that it is not enough to pray over an injustice or protest it or research it to death, but that you have to take concrete action to solve it.''
For five years during the mid-1960's she worked in the South as an organizer for the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, a civil rights organization. That experience, she said, taught her that ''helping poor people achieve self-reliance is much more important than getting them government money or the advice of experts.''
Some 20 years ago she found her way to this green mountain valley about 100 miles north of Santa Fe where Hispanic families make a meager living on small plots.
A steady flow of foundation grants to finance Ms. Varela's projects seems to support her belief that the projects may serve as a model for other communities. Ms. Varela is convinced she can best influence larger issues by directly affecting just a few dozen lives.
''I feel most productive,'' she said, ''when I think of the people who were so shy and passive and poorly educated when they started here and who are now accomplished weavers or managers.''
She realizes that such an individualized process is slow. ''You have to stick with it for two generations at least to really change a culture,'' she said. ''That's why we have a children's program to start training our future work force and leaders.''
Since she received the MacArthur grant, Ms. Varela worries less about her own future because she expects to put away half the money as a sort of pension.
''I am going to be a community organizer for as long as I can,'' she said, ''then I am going to go retire, preferably somewhere warm by the sea.''

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Seeking Seats, Republicans Find Ally in Rights Act

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 19

 BODY:
Are Republicans using the civil rights laws to undercut the Democratic Party?
The Democrats say there is no other way to describe the clever, and ironic, politics in which the Republican Party and the Bush Administration have on several occasions aligned themselves with black and Hispanic groups seeking to expand voting rights.
Even Republicans concede the irony in their newly aggressive interest in insuring enforcement of the Voting Rights Act, which was strengthened in 1982 over the strenuous objections of the Reagan Administration.
So why the turnabout to help black and Hispanic voters, who are among the most loyal Democrats?
''I don't think the position of the Republican National Committee on voting rights is necessarily motivated by a completely altruistic feeling toward minorities,'' said Frank Parker of the Lawyers Committee on Civil Rights. 
Some minority members would agree, but are reluctant to turn down help.
 
Master Plan Is Denied
Republicans insist they are not working from the master plan that Democrats perceive, but they acknowledge that doing right by racial minorities also means doing well for Republicans.
What they have come to realize is that in crucial circumstances - from the drawing of new Congressional districts to the debate over primary runoffs, actions that strengthen black or Hispanic power often have the independent consequence of weakening the Democratic Party.
''I think the Administration and the national committee see in the Voting Rights Act a very powerful tool in terms of advancing the Republican cause,'' said a Republican Representative who insisted on anonymity.
 
Examples of Alliances
Here are two examples of why the politics of voting rights has brought together Republicans and traditionally Democratic advocates of increased minority voting strength.
First, voting rights groups are seeking in next year's redistricting to create more constituencies that are heavily minority, thus increasing the likelihood that a minority member would be elected. Republicans realize that such moves would remove minority voters from other districts, where they have been helping to elect white Democrats.
''It makes it a lot easier to elect a white, suburban Republican if he doesn't have any blacks in his district,'' said Charles Schroder, executive director of the Georgia Democratic Party. So the net result could be more black representatives and more Republican representatives.
Second, the elimination of primary runoffs when no candidate gets a majority of the primary vote could help more minority members win Democratic nominations. Republicans believe they would then have a better chance to win the general election, as some whites abandon the minority Democratic candidate.
 
Help With Redistricting
The Republican Party has offered to help minority groups who want to challenge redistricting plans. The plans are drawn up by state legislatures, which are, most often, controlled by Democrats. Among the help that the Republicans are offering is a powerful computer program that allows private groups to draw their own redistricting maps for presentation to the legislatures or courts. Republicans place the value of the computer software at $360,000, although Democrats say $200,000.
The Justice Department also announced that it planned to scrutinize redistricting plans around the country, not just in states where it is required by law, to make sure the plans do not dilute minority voting strength.
The new Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, John R. Dunne, says the Justice Department has become more aggressive in actions under the Voting Rights Act. For instance, last week the department for the first time took a position against primary runoffs. Mr. Dunne filed a brief in support of a challenge to the Georgia law that requires a runoff when no candidate wins a majority in a primary election.
 
Offer of Help in Alabama
In Alabama, Hank Sanders, a Democratic State Senator who is black, said he had been approached by a Republican colleague who wanted to join him in a fight against that state's runoff system. ''I asked him how that would be in the interest of the Republican Party,'' Senator Sanders recalled. ''He indicated it would open things up, having Democratic candidates who are not consensus candidates.''
Mr. Dunne was asked whether his department's more aggresive pursuit of voting rights cases dovetailed with the Republicans' interests.
''I'd like to think it's more coincidental,'' he said. ''I can't believe that any partisan Democrat is going to say, 'Hey, Dunne, don't vigorously enforce the civil rights laws.' ''
If a byproduct of his actions is to beneifit the Republican Party, Mr. Dunne added, that is fine. ''But this is too sensitive a position to let partisan considerations control decisions,'' he said.
 
A Problem for Blacks
Many blacks see a dilemma in this, since they are being asked to team up with an Administration that is sending mixed signals on civil rights.
The same Administration that is offering support on voting rights is threatening to veto the Civil Rights Act of 1990, claiming it would promote racial quotas in business.
''There is always a suspicion because the Reagan Administration had such a terrible record on minority voting rights, and some of the people involved in the new Republican initiative participated in the lack of voting rights enforcement,'' Mr. Parker said. ''But at the same time the civil rights community has had such a paucity of resources that when the Republicans come along and say, 'We'll give you a reapportionment software package with no strings attached,' they're not going to turn it down because of political ideology.''
Why should they? many in the civil rights movement ask. After all, over the years they have worked with Democrats who did not seem to have their interests in mind.
''If I finally decide an idea is a good idea, then I'll take my help from where it comes,'' Senator Sanders said in a telephone interview from Selma, Ala. ''But there's no doubt in my mind that Republicans have decided it's also in their best interest from a political point of view and are pursuing it on that basis.''
But blacks also face a second, and more fundamental, problem. While their representation in elective office still falls short of their numbers in the population, blacks are a crucial constituency in the Democratic Party, and many Democrats warn that if the increase in black representatives ends up decreasing the number of Democrats in Congress, then the interests of blacks nationwide could be hurt.
 
The Question of Influence
Eddie Williams, president of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a research organization, questioned whether heavily black districts might produce more black officials but less overall influence. ''Are you better off with one district which is guaranteed or with significant influence in four districts?'' he asked.
Republicans have been giving speeches about how the Democrats have not done right by blacks.
Benjamin Ginsberg, counsel to the Republican National Committee, repeatedly cites figures. In the 11 states of the Confederacy, he tells black groups, blacks are 17.4 percent of the voting age population. There are 116 members of Congress from those states, and 4 are black.
''It is no accident that all branches of the legislatures and the governorships were controlled by Democrats during the last redistricting,'' Mr. Ginsberg adds.
Democrats concede that more districts capable of electing blacks need to be created. But they warn voting rights groups against walking away from old friends.
Mr. Schroder, in a telephone interview from Atlanta, said the effort to overturn Georgia's law on runoffs was an ''unholy alliance'' between the American Civil Liberties Union, left-leaning factions among blacks and the Republicans.
''If you crawl in bed with those folks, it's like selling your soul and selling out the progess of the past, and really the progress of the future,'' he said.

HEADLINE: 100 Groups Form Coalition to Help Blacks

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 19

 BODY:
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and a diverse group of more than 100 other organizations have formed a coalition to battle social ills among blacks.
The group, the National Association of Black Organizations, grew out of the meeting, which was assembled by the N.A.A.C.P. The meeting, held here over three days, concluded Saturday. 
Coalition members, which include groups as varied as the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives and the Progressive National Baptist Convention, will focus their efforts on problems like teen-age pregnancy and school dropouts.
The executive director of the N.A.A.C.P., Benjamin L. Hooks, said the coalition was intended to enhance the ''continuing struggle of African Americans to gain a fair share of the American Dream.''
The organization's plans call for a communications network to share information, development of a brain trust to research and make recommendations on social and economic concerns affecting blacks and development of strategies to strengthen support for black institutions.
''What we have accomplished here is but a beginning,'' Mr. Hooks said. ''It marks the start of a new approach, where the visible payoff is farther down the road.''
He said the N.A.A.C.P. did not intend to turn from its historical focus, traditionally legislation and litigation. But he said the 81-year-old group realized the need for black organizations to address problems facing blacks.
''We as black people are stepping up to the bat and saying we are taking responsibility for our own destiny,'' Mr. Hooks said.
He said the coalition's nine-member executive committee would meet in two weeks to work out further details.

HEADLINE: Keeping the Nations United

 BODY:
Concerted international action: It is essential to secure the safety of the thousands of foreigners trapped in Kuwait and Iraq. It is essential to resolve the Iraq-Kuwait crisis with minimum violence. It is essential to keep Saddam Hussein from obscuring his own aggression with continued fabrications about the nature of American intervention. 
And it is essential to realize a more profound possibility. How well the world cooperates now can set a bold pattern of peacekeeping for the post-cold war world.
Such concerted action starts with the newly united United Nations. Once-empty mechanisms and procedures daily take on life. Cooperation can best be discussed and coordinated through the U.N., which for virtually the first time in its history is functioning as it was designed to.
Yesterday, the Security Council passed a tough resolution on Iraq's manipulative threats toward foreign nationals. Scores of nations have now reported on the effectiveness of U.S. sanctions to date. A three-nation subcommittee of the Security Council began to weigh the need for further steps.
This week in a historic step, the council is convening a meeting of the long-neglected panel designed to coordinate U.N. collective security operations.
There are many contributions that particular nations can make. On the military side, the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France, West Germany, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and Belgium have now sent ships. Three Islamic countries, Egypt, Morocco and Bangladesh, have joined the United States in sending ground troops to defend Saudi Arabia against Saddam Hussein's massed armies; two more, Syria and Pakistan, are poised to follow. But most of these individual contingents operate under separate command authority. Further Security Council action is needed to constitute them into a true international force. In the event of such action, the Soviet Union has also declared its willingness to contribute troops. Japan and West Germany, stronger economically than militarily, can help pay for military deployments. Washington now estimates that it will spend a billion dollars-plus just this month, even without a shooting war. Tokyo, Bonn and others can also contribute by giving financial assistance to countries like Turkey and Jordan that could otherwise become indirect victims of the embargo against Iraq. Oil-producing countries can make a critical contribution, notably to the poor third world, by following the lead of Saudi Arabia and pumping extra oil to replace lost Iraqi and Kuwaiti output. Arms and technology exporting countries could further tighten controls against transfers militarily useful to Iraq. The Soviet Union, China and other arms producers like Brazil and Argentina need to join in tight restrictions on exporting missile technology. And West Germany needs to press its belated crackdown on exporters of chemical weapons plants.
The United States acted hastily last week when it moved unilaterally to block naval traffic to Iraq. A few days' delay matters little in enforcing economic sanctions, which work slowly and cumulatively. As officials now seem to realize, there was certainly no good reason to forfeit consensus.
The wider that global consensus, the better the chance of enforcing the peace without resorting to war - now and in future crises.

HEADLINE: Proposal to Execute Drug Kingpins Appeals Strictly to Fear

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato's letter defending his amendment to the omnibus crime bill (July 31) is a chilling document from an elected official in a democratic country.
Even if the death penalty for ''drug kingpins'' were taken seriously, as it should not be, few people are ever convicted of at least three major Federal drug crimes. Most drug convictions are for ''five and dime'' street deals made by young unemployed individuals supporting their own habits or needing a quick income source. Our legal system makes a second felony conviction difficult to obtain and uphold. This is a protection for all citizens, given the record of drug trials both past and present.
Ten to 13 years of appeals, retrials and motions cost money: prison space, prosecutorial costs, defense costs and court costs. Does Senator D'Amato assign a dollar value to these? We have a staggering Federal deficit for which the proposed solutions are reductions in Medicare, Medicaid and food supplements for women and children.
Considering the time required for legal appeals, will there be a backlog in death rows, requiring more cell space? Will there be proposals for death camp construction?
I do not want drug kingpins dead; I want them poor. The Senator's proposal increases the risks, scarcity and prices for the commodity, not the demand.
Tax-free cash will pour into the villas-yachts-and-private-plane life style, as few are caught. More violence can be expected to protect high profits. The ''targets'' of the proposals might very well applaud them.
One must surely question the grandstanding that exploits fear into frenzy. This is the road to totalitarianism.

Saddam's Last Roundup

BYLINE: By William Safire

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The question is no longer ''will there be war?'' between the world and Iraq, but ''what is the best strategy to win the war already begun with the least loss of life?''
The conflicting choices now before Mr. Bush are not secret: two different strategies have been laid out in public by former national security advisers Zbigniew Brzezinski and Henry Kissinger.
Our object should be ''to squeeze but not strangle Iraq,'' says the author of the Carter Doctrine. Zbig holds that we should defend Western access to oil, but not seek to roll back the conquest of Kuwait - to rely on international cooperation to negotiate a compromise with Saddam rather than try to defeat him. 
Henry differs. Our goal should be the removal of Saddam as a threat to the world's economic lifeline, says the author of the Nixon Doctrine. A settlement leaving Saddam with growing military might would be ''only an interlude between aggressions,'' writes Dr. Kissinger; he urges ''a surgical and progressive destruction of Iraq's military assets'' before the world's will dissipates.
I believe the Brzezinski ''squeeze option'' was destroyed in the past few days by the Iraqi decision to hold Western nationals as hostages. Saddam's promised starvation of Western children would squeeze us, not him, to negotiate ''peace in our time.''
But if Mr. Bush moves quickly, we can counter the Iraqi threat to use our nationals as human shields at military installations. He need not be the third consecutive U.S. President to be humbled by kidnappers.
Saddam has already told Westerners trapped in Kuwait to assemble at three hotels to be saved from a threat he will soon cook up. Mr. Bush - with Mrs. Thatcher and as many other leaders as he can induce to join him -should announce that any ''roundup'' or harassment of up to 10,000 non-Communist Western nationals taken in the capture of Kuwait would be considered an act of war triggering potent military retaliation.
Such fair warning has been delayed, I presume, to permit a buildup of our forces in Saudi Arabia. But action is now urgent; we can do little at the moment for the two-score Americans already condemned to target duty in Iraq, but we can use a credible threat to protect thousands of others in Kuwait who - once rounded up for designation as human shields - may be doomed.
Suppose President Bush goes on the air quickly to tell the putative hostages in Kuwait to evade capture as long as they can and to urge loyal Kuwaitis to hide them; and suppose he adds that any attempt at a ''roundup'' will be answered by bombers taking out all Iraqi strategic sites.
In that circumstance, let us consider the options open to Saddam:
Option One: He could ignore the threat and order his troops to hunt down the foreigners, or promise death to any who do not surrender at a given time.
Option Two: Saddam could let the foreign nationals leave as evidence of his desire for peace.
Option Three: He could neither round them up nor let them out; he can say defiantly he will take them prisoner whenever he decides to, but not yet.
He is likely to select the first: to order his army to arrest, alive, every non-Kuwaiti in Kuwait.
The U.S., with whatever supporting cover it can get from the U.N., would then carry out its solemn commitment. We would bomb every key warmaking center in Iraq - nuclear, poison-gas and missile-production installations first - including the tanks assembling on the Saudi border.
In this way, the shooting war would begin as a direct result of Saddam's grab for hostages. His hostage ''roundup'' would pull our trigger; kidnapping on top of invasion would call down the ensuing destruction. The world, and Iraqis, would know why the first nuclear-preventive war was being carried home to its source.
What if he outsmarted us, choosing options two or three? That would prolong the crisis, which is in his interest, but would save the lives of thousands of trapped innocents - not our central purpose, but no small thing.
By waging a decisive, conventional World War 2 1/2, we avert a nuclear World War III. Our national interest is not primarily to protect an oil supply, or to save our way of life from depression, or to make the world safe for sheiks, or even to assert the noble principle of collective resistance to aggression.
What makes an interest ''vital'' is its centrality to life and death. The world interest in bringing down Saddam Hussein is to insure that the means of mass destruction never fall into the hands of a mass murderer.

HEADLINE: It's Kickoff Time For a New Game

SERIES: College Football In Transition; First of a series.

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN

 BODY:
FACED with legal challenges, shifting alliances and a deteriorating relationship with the National Football League, college football is beginning the most significant season in its 122-year history.
Sweeping winds of change that passed as rumors five years ago have begun to erode conference ties, scatter advertisers' dollars and even sow seeds of a movement for players' rights. They have also presented coaches, athletic directors and players with a challenging mandate: Be successful and raise revenue, but stay within the constraints of an increasingly complex body of rules.
 
'Decade of Change'
''I've never seen a season begin with so many issues,'' said Roy Kramer, the commissioner of the Southeastern Conference. ''Recruiting, financial aid, distribution of revenue, conferences. There's been talk for a long time about changes, but I think we're all convinced that the 1990's will be the decade of change.'' 
College coaches, who have seen salaries and pressures escalate, are caught in the throes of change that will force many to alter the way they have operated for years.
''The status quo is gone,'' said Joe Paterno, who is beginning his 25th year as the Penn State coach. ''The N.F.L. is expanding into college football. Our presidents are demanding reforms and cutbacks. Yet we have to make money for 27 other sports from gate receipts and other revenues; the presidents have no place to get it from except us.
''So coaches are now asking, 'How do I make more money and do it legitimately without exploiting the guys?' That's the dilemma; that's why you're seeing so many changes. The world turns and things change. You better change with them or be left behind.''
 
A Blitz of Problems
As Tennessee and Colorado prepare to kick off Sunday in the season's first game, the problems confronting college football, like an all-out blitz, seem to be coming from every direction.
* Relationship with the pros: The once-cozy arrangement between the National Collegiate Athletic Association and the N.F.L. has become combative as the two enterprises vie for a shrinking advertising dollar and fight a tug of war over star college players eager to test the pro market.
* Conference realignment: Traditonal rivalries are ending as schools and conferences enter into hastily arranged marriages of economic convenience. Earlier this month, Arkansas jumped from the Southwest Conference to the Southeastern after determining it would be enriched by the move. That came a few months after Penn State eschewed its traditional independent status to join the Big Ten, where it is expected to begin football competition by 1995.
* Television negotiations: Notre Dame changed the ground rules earlier this year when it went outside the College Football Association, which it helped form, and independently forged its own deal with NBC for an estimated $30 million over five years. This prompted conferences and other independents to look for ways to best enhance their own TV revenue and forgo a more collective approach.
* Advertising: TV advertisers are reassessing the free-spending practices of the 1970's and early 80's, when they poured millions of dollars into college football.
* Players' rights: Players won the right this year to apply for the N.F.L. draft as underclassmen. Encouraged by this progress and surrounded by million-dollar deals, they are using the courts to challenge N.C.A.A. and N.F.L. rules that restrict their ability to test their marketability. Last week, a former Notre Dame player, Braxston Banks, lost his suit against the N.C.A.A. and Notre Dame to have a final year of eligibility restored. Banks forfeited that year when he declared for April's N.F.L. draft. He was one of 20 undergraduates not selected.
Banks said he wanted to draw attention to the N.C.A.A.'s eligibility rules, which he believes are unclear and unfair. ''We want to insure that those who follow will have a better chance and a clearer understanding of what is going on around them and won't have to go through the same thing I've had to endure,'' he said.
 
New Realities, New Problems
Like players, coaches have been forced to deal with new realities and not all of them like it.
''They want to cut back and eliminate and have time restrictions,'' said John Jenkins, the first-year coach at Houston. ''You just wonder whether it's going to come to a head where our school and some of the other major colleges step back and just say: 'Hey, enough of this. We're getting out of the N.C.A.A. How do you like that?' ''
Houston has problems symptomatic of those that prompted Arkansas to leave the Southwest Conference after having generated a fourth of the conference's revenue. Despite having Andre Ware, the Heisman Trophy winner, last season, Houston was not a big gate attraction. The Cougars averaged 28,449 fans per home game. The average attendance last season in the S.W.C. was 37,541, compared with a conference-record 65,445 in the S.E.C, where 6 teams ranked in the top 12 nationally in attendance. ''We've run through the N.C.A.A. record book as if it were a track meet, and yet as far as sellout crowds and what not, it hasn't happened,'' Jenkins said. ''You need to look at the fact (a) we're in a pro town, and (b) the televison. An individual can sit home and watch five or six games without even getting out of his chair, where back in the 1960's and 70's people were driving 100 miles to a ball game, to go see a game.''
Critics point out that college football created the current glut of televised games and that the glut is partly responsible for the downward turn of attendance.
The N.C.A.A. negotiated its first television football package, worth $1.1 million, in 1952, but a restrictive policy limited exposure. In 1982, Oklahoma and Georgia successfully sued the N.C.A.A. on behalf of the C.F.A. and earned the right for all schools to negotiate their own television deals. The Big Ten and Pacific-10 remained outside the C.F.A. and made their own deals. In 1984, the Supreme Court upheld the lower court decision. College football began to fill the airwaves, and attendance for Division I-A has declined ever since. It fell to 41,970 per game last season after reaching a high of 43,689 in 1982.
While few coaches feel that leaving the N.C.A.A. is necessary - or practical - an increasing number of them agree that change is necessary to make the game more attractive and stop further fragmentation.
''We compete now with the N.F.L., the N.B.A. and the N.C.A.A. basketball championships,'' Paterno said. ''Each of those has done a great job of promoting itself, and they've done it with playoffs; they've spiced up their games. We have not. We've relied on bowls to spice up the ends of our season.'' Paterno said that when he began his college coaching career in 1950 many of the N.F.L. owners had deep roots in the college game. ''They had a feel for the college game,'' Paterno recalled. ''Now owning a team is a $140 million investment. We have to find a way to regenerate interest in our game and we're naive if we think the N.F.L. is going to be less of a problem.''
 
Changing Alignments
Penn State sparked widespread talk of shifts in December when it accepted the Big Ten's invitation for membership.
What many find curious about the move is that the overtures to Penn State came from Big Ten presidents at a time when the N.C.A.A. Presidents Commission was calling for more controls over athletic programs and a constricting of big-time athletics. Some coaches complained that Penn State's move, and the subsequent shift by Arkansas, sent the wrong message.
''I'm getting mixed signals,'' said Grant Teaff, the Baylor coach. ''Administrators, faculty representatives, tell us we have to reign in athletes, cut back the number of scholarships and coaching staff. No athletic dorms, no spring practice.
''Then they expand, reach out in the name of finance to bring in this team or that team as part of a league to get a larger share of televison money. It seems as if they want to go in two separate directions.'' But some presidents defended the additions. ''I felt they have an excellent university, which is very similar to most of the other Big Ten institutions in terms of excellent academic programs and variety,'' said Dr. Morton Weir, the chancellor at the University of Illinois. ''It's our kind of institution.
''I didn't think of this as the beginning of a chain reaction. I don't think any of us did.''
 
Wiser Players Seek Fair Share
One clear direction is that the modern-day college football player at most big-time programs is no longer the naive teen-ager oblivious to the huge amount of money his university is making or to six-figure contracts the coach is signing. Banks said that while football and basketball teams at large schools support other programs, football and basketball players lack the freedom of athletes in tennis and golf to compete against professionals without losing eligibility. Baseball and hockey players can enter pro drafts in their respective sports without forfeiting eligibility.
''I think these colleges are afraid that if these so-called star players were to have the freedom to test their marketability openly, the schools would lose a lot of money because they would lose a lot of the key players and a lot of the hype that goes with having key players,'' Banks said.
Richard D. Schultz, the N.C.A.A.'s executive director, has said that he favors removing restrictions on football players to allow underclassmen to put their names in drafts without losing eligibility. But legislation on that issue has not been introduced. Players testing the pro market is just one of the areas that has strained the relationship between the college and pro games. The promise of playing professionally is a magnet that often attracts outstanding players to a particular college program. But with pressure to graduate players, athletic officials have openly begun to point their fingers at pro scouts.
''Our concern was that they take people out of school during their last semester and that prevents them from graduating,'' said Chuck Neinas, the executive director of the College Football Association.
''They're telling young men that they have to visit 16 different professional clubs and then they conduct minicamps during final exam period, So obviously they don't have a chance to graduate. We're suggesting in very strong terms that the N.F.L. should underwrite the educational expense of those underclassmen who do come out early, whether they're drafted or whether they're free agents.''
But the N.F.L., apparently weary of the quasi-minor league function college football performs, has come upwith a plan that may succeed where years of N.C.A.A. reform have failed: getting college football out of the minor league business.
The N.F.L. is underwriting the World League of American Football with the idea that it will serve as a minor league.
Some college administrators secretly welcome a minor league that would finally get their schools out of sports-entertainment business.
''I would be not at all unhappy,'' said Weir, the Illinois chancellor.
''If someone told me tomorrow,'' he said, ''that all around the country we're going to give up major network coverage of football and basketball, and that the billion-dollar contract is going away, I'd say, 'We'll adjust to that.' I believe that the money is creating a problem. We've got to do something about it.''
 
Greener Pastures For Fighting Irish
Two months after Penn State was invited into the Big Ten, Notre Dame struck its own deal with NBC, leaving the 63 other C.F.A. members with a less lucrative ABC package.
Notre Dame's move left C.F.A. members stunned at first, then angered, finally frightened. The Irish had gobbled up an entire network for $7.6 million per year with NBC which will offer live national coverage of all home games beginning in 1991.
''Notre Dame didn't think of itself as a catalyst, or anything like that,'' said the Rev. E. William Beauchamp, the Notre Dame executive vice president.
''We did not look at what we were doing as starting the wave, or realigment. We had the need for academic scholarships that is a major effort of fund raising, this was a good time to do that.''
The Federal Trade Commission, meanwhile, has been investigating whether ABC-TV's agreements with the C.F.A., the Pac-10 and the Big Ten violate Federal antitrust regulations. The two contracts - one with the C.F.A. and another with the Pac-10 and Big Ten - give that network rights to 84 of the 106 Division I-A teams.
For all of the talk of reform and cutbacks, actions suggest that universities who can afford it are building up for an offensive that may last several years. ''Everybody is building indoor practice facilities for football, and bigger sports complexes,'' said Dr. Arnold Weber, the president of Northwestern University. ''We just did that here,'' he said. ''We've resisted the indoor practice facility, but we're building a major aquatics and sports center. So it's absurd to think that things are being contracted.''

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Television;
ABC Thrives on Its Edge in News

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

 BODY:
An extraordinary thing happened on television this month: the networks' evening newscasts received higher ratings than the average prime-time entertainment show.
Viewers wanted news of the crisis in the Persian Gulf. And more of them wanted their news from ABC than from any other network.
ABC's evening newscast rose 20 percent in the ratings during the week after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Its late-night news program ''Nightline'' jumped 30 percent. 
CBS and NBC also received sharply higher ratings for their news programs, and CNN had its highest-rated week ever. But ABC's upper hand in ratings was matched by an edge in the coverage. Symbolized by Ted Koppel's coup last week in being the first American journalist to report on the crisis from Baghdad, ABC's advantage was conceded even by executives at other news organizations. ''ABC definitely deserves credit for being three laps ahead of everybody else,'' one NBC News executive said.
 
Consistent Ratings Leader
ABC's evening newscast is now established as the consistent ratings leader, having won the competition for 31 consecutive weeks.
''The gulf coverage has absolutely solidified ABC's edge, which really began to emerge as long as three years ago,'' said Robert Karl Manoff, director of the Center for War, Peace and the News Media at New York University. ''By now, there is really no question that they are the leader.''
Still, CBS scored its own coup. Its anchor, Dan Rather, also went to Baghdad last week and provided extensive coverage.
For ABC, however, the ascension of its news division could have long-term economic benefits if viewers' perception continues to grow that ABC is ahead in its news coverage.
''The image of superiority that a news department develops can spread out for months and months,'' said John S. Reidy, a media analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. ''That usually equates to higher sustained ratings, which is, of course, the real benefit.''
Developing that image has a high price. ABC News said it had spend more than $2 million on its gulf coverage by the end of last week. Those costs come at a time when its parent company, Capital Cities/ABC Inc., has been predicting a possible downturn in profits because of weaker summer ratings, soft advertising sales for its stations and a loss of about $20 million on the baseball package for ESPN, its cable channel.
But the news division may be able to make up more than its share of the extra costs, using the increased ratings to secure higher advertising revenues. Bruce Heim, a vice president at the Bozell advertising agency, noted that the surge in news ratings occurred at the very end of a network advertising-sales cycle, with a new cycle due to begin next month. ''With these numbers late in August, ABC will almost surely be able to exceed its ratings guarantees to advertisers,'' Mr. Heim said.
He added that the network would probably be able to increase its ad rates for its news programs.
The network newscasts moved ahead of prime time in the second week of August. The overall rating average for news was 28.8, compared with 28.1 for prime time. And ABC came out ahead with a news ratings of 10.6. One ratings point equals 921,000 homes with television.
The ratings week that ended Aug. 12 was only the second week in recent history in which the network newscasts attracted bigger ratings than the average prime-time program. The other time this occurred was during the 1988 Republican convention. But viewers then did not have much choice; most entertainment shows were pre-empted.
The competition to place a reporter in Baghdad was a microcosm of the news rivalry. ABC was a day ahead of CBS. Mr. Koppel arrived in Baghdad on Tuesday, and the next day he interviewed the Foreign Minister of Iraq, Tariq Iziz. He also talked with Americans being detained at a hotel, which upset Iraqi officials. By Thursday, the Iraqi Government asked Mr. Koppel to leave Baghdad.
Mr. Rather, meanwhile, almost single-handedly tried to counter ABC's advantage, going to great lengths to report the gulf story from the Middle East. He succeeded in getting into Baghdad on Wednesday, and also had an interview with the Foreign Minister later in the week. As of yesterday, he was still reporting from Baghdad.
But he was second on the scene, and CBS News is now perceived by some people in the industry to be second to ABC News.
NBC News was unable to get anybody into Iraq and was behind ABC in getting a correspondent into Saudi Arabia. Tom Brokaw of NBC arrived in Saudi Arabia one day after Sam Donaldson of ABC.
NBC executives have argued for months that based on the overall quality of its coverage, NBC should not be considered the third-ranked news division, even though it has the lowest newscast ratings and fewest number of news programs on the air. In trailing on the gulf story, that argument lost some credibility.
CNN, which has scored numerous triumphs in breaking news over the last several years, had to acknowledge that both ABC and CBS had the edge in Baghdad as its own attempts to get into Iraq were stymied.
''They did real good,'' said a CNN vice president, Ed Turner.
The change in leadership of network news has never been widely accepted in the television industry, even beyond CBS, largely because ABC has been fighting two entrenched images: CBS's historic superiority in news and ABC News as a newcomer of somewhat questionable pedigree.
For years after he became president of ABC News in 1977, Roone Arledge was criticized for bringing showmanship to news coverage. What he indisputably brought were shows; ABC News added more news programs on which to build identifible anchors and correspondents.
Indeed, one longstanding criticism of ABC News - that the division has been built on high-priced news ''stars'' to the detriment of the basics of good journalism - has been directly contradicted by ABC's success in covering the gulf crisis.
ABC executives noted that Mr. Koppel and Mr. Rather were able to get into Baghdad precisely because they are such high-profile figures.
''People ask about why it's important for an anchor to be at the scene of a story,'' Mr. Arledge said. ''But if you're Ted Koppel dealing with the Foreign Minister of Iran, it does make a difference.''
He added, ''A Ted Koppel gives you more entree than a beat reporter.''
Mr. Arledge said ABC held a built-in advantage over CBS and NBC in that it essentially had two main anchors - Peter Jennings, the evening news anchor, and Mr. Koppel - as well other high-profile names, including Mr. Donaldson, Barbara Walters and Diane Sawyer.
Joanna Bistany, a vice president of ABC News, said Mr. Arledge's strategy of building prominent anchors -even at million-dollar salaries - had been ''validated'' by their use in the gulf coverage.
But ultimately, it is the advertisers who will decide whether the strategy is cost effective.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Iraq Crisis Gives Fed New Woes

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The dominant figure in the credit markets these days does not sit in the Federal Reserve's ornate office at the corner of Constitution Avenue and 20th Street in Washington, but in the Iraqi presidential palace in Baghdad.
As a consequence, the short-term course of interest rates will be determined more by international politics than by domestic economics, analysts say. ''The market will be detached from economic fundamentals for as long as the politics are as wacko as they are,'' one government bond trader said last week.
The shift is likely to be acutely felt tomorrow, when the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, gathers with fellow members of the Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee to set monetary policy and assess the state of the economy. 
 
Unable to Take Action
In the opinion of most credit market analysts, the members of the Fed group have much to discuss, but at least temporarily are prevented from taking action by President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
Given the weak state of the economy, it seems clear that if there were no crisis in the Middle East the Fed would pay less attention to the stubbornly high rate of inflation and move to ease monetary policy quickly.
But the possibility that the full inflationary effect of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has not yet been seen preys on credit market participants, who fear that oil prices will move well above the $28.63-a-barrel level reached on Friday.
Fears of inflation and of war have helped push bond yields close to 9 percent since late July, and could raise them higher if the Fed decides to move soon to ease short-term rates, analysts said, effectively negating any benefits that an easing of monetary policy might bring.
 
'No Feel' for Reaction
Underlying every policy move by the Fed ''is an expectation that market interest rates outside of their control will move in conjunction with their movement,'' said David H. Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International. ''This time, Fed governors cannot have a fair level of confidence that that will happen. And if you have no feel for what the reaction will be, there is no reason to make the move.''
Most analysts agree that eventually the Fed will move to ease policy. But given the highly unsettled market, the central bank will probably choose a highly propitious moment to show its hand.
''The Fed needs the right kind of background to do it,'' said William N. Griggs, a managing director at Griggs & Santow Inc., a financial consulting firm. ''If you ease policy in this environment, where the bond market is collapsing and the dollar is sliding, the reaction will be bad. But something like a weak employment report for August might allow them to do it in a credible way.''
The August employment report, the next important announcement on the economy, is expected to be released on Sept. 7.
 
Eventual Move Expected
Despite the inflation threat, the recent sharp upward spike in oil prices and interest rates has raised the odds of a recession and will force the Fed to move eventually, analysts said. ''The Fed is in a tough situation, but they can't afford to stop what they are doing and combat psychological and political events,'' said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Bank. ''They have to help this economy. That is their job.''
Another forecasting group last week joined the list of those who now expect a recession. In their weekly ''Comments on Credit,'' analysts at Salomon Brothers offered a revised forecast that projects three quarters of negative growth beginning in the fourth quarter of 1990.
''Forecasting recessions over the past eight years has been a losing game,'' Richard B. Berner, a Salomon economist, wrote in the weekly commentary. But, he added, ''the shock of higher oil prices seems likely to be the final straw that tips the U.S. economy into recession.''
 
Modest Revival Forecast
From the fourth quarter of 1990 through the second quarter of 1991, Salomon now expects the gross national product to contract at a 1 percent annual rate and then revive ''modestly'' in the second half of next year.
While the economic outlook seems decidedly bullish for bonds, and current yields are at highly attractive levels, some money managers said that for the time being they intended to remain on the sidelines.
''With as much skittishness as there is in the market, I think bond yields will go as high as 9 1/8 percent,'' said Roberta Olsen, a portfolio manager at the Banc One Asset Management Corporation in Columbus, Ohio. ''That should be the high point unless something unknown happens in the Iraqi situation. And at those levels we see value in bonds.''
Late last week, the Treasury's benchmark 8 3/4 percent bonds were offered at a price to yield 8.93 percent.
Developments in the Middle East and on world petroleum and foreign exchange markets seem likely to dominate trading activity in the fixed-income markets again this week. The economic calendar is light, and will be highlighted on Friday by the release of a revised set of second-quarter growth figures.
Most analysts expect that the numbers will show upward revisions in personal consumption expenditures and net exports. As a consequence, analysts are projecting that the Commerce Department will raise second-quarter growth to 1.5 percent, on an inflation-adjusted basis, up modestly from the preliminary estimate of 1.2 percent.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL REPORT;
Renewed Call For Chinese Stock Market

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING

 BODY:
After two difficult years of stop-and-go progress, a group of ambitious economic experts has taken another small step toward developing a centralized securities market in China.
The Stock Exchange Executive Council, whose staff is largely young and Western trained, has just completed a white paper that includes a list of specific measures the Government could take to transform a loosely organized collection of securities dealers into a true market system.
If the proposals are accepted, the centralized exchange could be running before year-end. The stock exchange would be the second in a socialist country, after Hungary, and could begin another wave of reform for China's planned economy. 
 
A Lively Debate
How top Government officials will react to the proposals is uncertain, although the debate over the introduction of a securities exchange system has been relatively open and lively in recent months, with many articles in the Government-controlled press advocating the system. Some people here regard that as a moderately positive sign, given that such talk was throttled by political hard-liners after the crushing of the democracy movement last year.
''Any proposal being made now is being entertained,'' said Wang Poming, vice president of the organizing body, the Stock Exchange Executive Council. ''You're hearing some really bold things. We're becoming more optimistic.''
Gao Xiqing, the American-trained general counsel for the executive council, an independent research group, added: ''To some extent, in this area the debate is over the pace of reform, not whether or not it will take place.''
In the eyes of many Western and Chinese economists, the creation of a viable securities market would have the potential for radically altering the way financing is done in China, now handled through a Government monopoly on credit. Ultimately, it could be the start of major changes in the creaking state-controlled economy itself, introducing more efficient ways of allocating capital to businesses and, in turn, forcing businesses to become more efficient.
 
A Place for Savings
It would give individuals an alternative to banks as a place for their savings. This is important, since the level of savings has soared over the last year, in response to the Government's tightening of credit to battle inflation.
But Government banks have not found productive uses for all this money, according to articles in the Chinese press. Investing in a stock market would present greater risks for investors but would also offer them the potential of greater returns.
Around China, interest in establishing a market appears to be keen. A competition has already developed between Shanghai and Shenzhen, the special economic zone bordering Hong Kong, over which will be the first to open a full-fledged exchange. That has lent the idea some additional momentum.
 
White Paper
The white paper, which took nine months to complete, was produced at the request of the People's Bank of China, China's central bank, and the Ministry of Finance. It is the first comprehensive report on China's securities markets, describing the history of these markets and the nascent systems that have developed in recent years. It also suggests a series of steps to broaden the process, including:
* Completing the development of a computerized trading system, known as the Securities Trading Automated Quotation System, or STAQS, which would centralize the fragmented trading structures. Mr. Wang said he hoped this would be on line by the fall.
* Helping the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges open and create regulatory and trading mechanisms.
* Training staff members of securities companies how to trade, process those trades and keep records. Plans have already been made for establishing a training center in Shanghai later this year.
* Changing the system for selling government bonds - the principal security traded on the nascent markets in China - from an allocation system to underwriting by syndicates of securities companies. This would make the market more sensitive to supply- and-demand considerations and increase its liquidity.
 
New Sources of Financing
A centralized stock market would also diversify the sources of financing for corporations. Now, capital is effectively allocated by the Government.
A market would permit more efficient companies to draw capital from individuals and other institutions by issuing securities. It would also give efficient enterprises a means of expanding by acquiring other businesses.
A market also would give the Government a means of building private ownership of state-owned enterprises. That is not being discussed publicly at this point, but state-owned enterprises have become a budgetary albatross for the Government, recording huge losses every year. Selling all or part of them could force the companies to improve their operations and cut unnecessary layers of fat.
''We have an expression,'' said Mr. Wang, referring to a Chinese proverb. ''If you pull one hair, the whole body jumps.'' The point, he said, was that the introduction of private ownership would lead to a chain of events that have the potential for sharply improving the efficiency of Chinese industry.
 
Concept Is Not New
The concept of creating a securities market here is not entirely new. Two big steps were taken in 1986, the heady days when economic reform was being pushed vigorously. Small markets were opened in Shenyang, the capital of Liaoning Province in northeast China, and Shanghai. Then, in April 1988, the Government permitted open trading in its bonds.
The trading, however, has been regional and inefficient. The securities executive council found that the same security is often priced differently in different cities.
One speculator in Shanghai - referred to by the press as ''Millionaire Yang'' - became notorious for discovering price discrepancies and flying into cities where prices were too low. He would buy bonds at one price, fly back to Shanghai and sell the bonds for a tidy profit at a higher price. The Government has tried to squelch such arbitrage by placing limits on investors.
The Securities Exchange Executive Council hopes its proposals will eliminate such bugs in the system, while creating a smooth-running mechanism for pushing China further down the road of market reform.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Novelty in Leipzig: A Paper With No Party Line

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LEIPZIG, East Germany

 BODY:
This is the time to be an entrepreneur in Eastern Europe, in newspaper publishing as in any other business. But at East Germany's largest independent weekly, youth and steady nerves are the most important assets.
Jan Peter, the 21-year-old chief editor and co-founder of Leipziger Andere Zeitung, has plenty of both, but at the moment, not enough ads.
''In the beginning, it was much easier,'' he said, recalling how he and his team of journalism students, writers and members of the New Forum democracy movement put out the first issue on Feb. 1, thanks largely to a $12,500 advertisement by the West German Kommerzbank. 
 
Western Competition
''Only a few weeks later, the West German newspapers began moving in,'' Mr. Peter said. ''We figured we had six to seven weeks to get well enough established with readers here so that we wouldn't disappear once the West German papers came in, and we made it. But I think it'd take 20 million marks, not just 20,000, to start a newspaper now.''
The weekly is commonly known as DAZ, an abbreviation for Die Leipziger Andere Zeitung, which translates roughly as ''The Other Newspaper in Leipzig.'' It has a press run of 40,000 in a city of about half a million people, and its staff says every issue sells out at one mark, or 63 cents, a copy. The dozen or so editors work full time, seven days a week.
What makes DAZ unusual is that Mr. Peter insists that he wants it to be independent of all political movements. Though Americans take such journals for granted, most readers in Europe assume that their publications are identified with some political party or ideology.
Mr. Peter's shoestring operation faces stiff competition - not only from established Leipzig daily newspapers formerly tied to the Communist Party and other parties, which have now been bought by West German media concerns, but also from the giant West German daily tabloids Bild Zeitung and Express, which now circulate freely in the East.
 
A Struggling Economy
With the East German economy still struggling with the transition from Communism, this means trouble for an enterprise that depends on advertising revenues. The big state-run businesses in Leipzig are all cutting costs and shedding staff, and a recent issue of DAZ had just one paid quarter-page advertisement, for a motor show sponsored by Renault.
Despite this, the spirit is lively and the mood optimistic in the newspaper's offices, in a cobblestone street of slowly crumbling buildings.
DAZ is serious but light-hearted, and intentionally provocative. One issue in July, for example, featured a front-page article critical of the maneuvering by East German political parties to seek the best vote count for themselves in the all-German elections planned for Dec. 2.
Another article in that issue examined the anti-Communist credentials of one of the most conservative politicians, Hansjoachim Walther, and noted sarcastically that they consisted of one anti-government conversation in the privacy of his home in 1953, when he was 13 years old.
 
'We Wanted to Be Independent'
Mr. Peter, a conscientious objector who once worked in a Leipzig hospital, became involved in the New Forum movement as opposition to East Germany's Communist government built up last year. He was one of five people who put out the movement's newsletter.
''After the Communist leadership fell, it became clear that to put out a real newspaper we couldn't stay within New Forum,'' Mr. Peter said. ''We wanted to be independent, so in December we founded Forum Press as a separate organization, with the intention of printing books and magazines as well as a newspaper.''
Mr. Peter, Peter Frabel, who runs the business side, and Holger Ahrens, the picture editor, invested their savings in the business and made DAZ a corporation in which Mr. Peter owns 40 percent of the shares.
A lanky young man whose speech never slows below rat-a-tat-tat speed, Mr. Peter is clearly driven by his ambition to create an East German newspaper that will resemble nothing else in its approach to the news.
 
Government Permission Needed
''It wasn't clear until the day before the first issue that we'd actually be able to put it out,'' he recalled. ''We had to get official permission to publish from the Media Ministry in Berlin, go up there and get it and then take it back here to Leipzig and show it to the printers before they would agree to publish it.''
The printing presses belong to the competition, the formerly Communist daily Leipziger Volkszeitung; they are the only ones in town.
Wearing a wrinkled lavender Russian student shirt and a pair of green chinos, the young editor did not look like a businessman who expected to get rich anytime soon.
''Because of the bank ad, the first issue was tremendously profitable,'' he said. ''We used the profits to buy Atari computers to do the layout on. At the moment, we're just about covering costs, no more.''
 
Newspaper to Expand
He said DAZ would expand in September to 24 pages from 16, adding more articles to supplement the cultural calendar, movie reviews, historical and political essays and news reports the paper publishes.
''We need more international advertising, maybe from British and American companies that want to do business here,'' Mr. Peter said. ''And we're looking abroad for seed money from foundations or individuals interested in helping build up a really original, independent kind of new journalism here.''

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf;
BUSH VOWS NOT TO BE COWED BY THE TAKING OF 'HOSTAGES'; IRAQ SHIFTS THEM TO TARGETS

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KENNEBUNKPORT, Me., Aug. 20

 BODY:
As Iraq began moving Americans and other foreigners to military and industrial installations, President Bush declared for the first time today that those trapped in Iraq are indeed hostages. He vowed that ''America will not be intimidated'' by Iraq's efforts to use them as shields against attack.
Government statements from Washington, Paris and London indicated that Iraq had moved at least 203 citizens of those countries, including 12 Americans seized from the Hyatt, International and Hilton hotels in Kuwait.
But it was not known how many more foreigners trapped by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait were being used as what Mr. Bush called ''pawns'' in the war of nerves between President Saddam Hussein of Iraq and the Arab-Western alliance ranged against him. #2,500 Americans in Kuwait There are about 2,500 Americans in Kuwait and 530 in Iraq, including 35 who had been in Iraqi hotels and are believed to have been moved elsewhere by the Iraqi authorities, the State Department says. 
''The foreign guests of Iraq have indeed been hosted in various vital and military installations,'' a spokesman for the Iraqi Parliament told the official Iraqi News Agency today, in a dispatch monitored in Washington and relayed to the President's vacation White House here. The Iraqi announcement gave no numbers on the captives.
Iraq reiterated its demand that foreign countries close their embassies in Kuwait by Friday, warning that diplomats there would lose their protected status and become vulnerable to arrest along with other foreigners. #9 Nations Refuse But Mr. Bush and officials of at least nine other nations - Austria, Britain, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Spain, Sweden, the Soviet Union and West Germany - rejected the demand. Mr. Bush called the threat ''unacceptable,'' but did not say what the United States would do if Iraq moved against the diplomats.
Sharpening his denunciation of Iraq in a speech in Baltimore to the annual convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Mr. Bush warned that he was holding Mr. Hussein responsible for the safety of the trapped Americans.
After two days of withholding comment on the Gulf crisis, Mr. Bush denounced the invasion of Kuwait as ''ruthless,'' and said a country that used ''citizens as pawns'' would face the world's scorn and condemnation. He said he had a message for Iraqi leaders: ''Release all foreigners now. Give them the right to come and go as they wish.''
But as two United Nations officials headed to Baghdad to press for the foreigners' release, Mr. Bush did not back his oratory with any explicit threat of retaliation.
The United States, still working to deploy its full military force in Saudi Arabia, continued to put off taking any military action against the most immediate Iraqi targets, two oil tankers that American warships have been shadowing for two days in the waters around the Arabian Peninsula.
 
Hope of U.N. Action
Washington was still hoping for United Nations approval to force the tankers to stop before they reach their ports this week. But the United Nations Security Council took no decisive action today on a British proposal to put military teeth into the economic sanctions it imposed on Iraq after the invasion of Kuwait Aug. 2.
The United States Navy continued to allow ships with cargos bound for Iraq to enter the Jordanian port of Aqaba on the Red Sea.
In permitting that hole in their economic net around Iraq to remain open, Mr. Bush and his advisers seemed reluctant to take any action that might cause domestic turmoil for King Hussein of Jordan, who has been torn between his avowed allegiance to the nations arrayed against Baghdad and the threat that could be posed by troops in neighboring Iraq.
 
Bush Returns to Maine
Mr. Bush returned to his vacation home in Kennebunkport today after the speech in Baltimore and a fund-raising event in Rhode Island. He brushed off concerns that his continued vacation in Maine and his political swing in the midst of an international crisis were unseemly. ''Life goes on,'' Mr. Bush told a Republican audience in North Kingstown, R.I.
In Baltimore, he delivered a speech replete with patriotic themes and references to American military prowess in past wars. He relied heavily on quotations from historic figures like Theodore Roosevelt and George Washington, offering little in the way of soaring language of his own to rally public support for what he said would be remembered as one of the most important military operations of the 20th century.
Mr. Bush let his voice rise and his fist pound his lecturn as he denounced Presiident Hussein's efforts to use the foreigners trapped in Iraq and Kuwait as a shield against military attack. ''I want there to be no misunderstanding,'' he said. ''I will hold the Government of Iraq responsible for the safety and well-being of American citizens being held against their will.''
Reports from the Middle East have said that Iraq was planning to move some of the thousands of foreigners trapped in Iraq and Kuwait to military and industrial installations in the hope of making a military attack too costly for the United States and other countries.
 
No More Euphemisms
Mr. Bush pointedly dropped the euphemisms his Administration had been using - ''inconvenienced people'' for example - to describe the more than 3,000 Americans trapped in Iraq and Kuwait. The President had been choosing his words carefully to avert the kind of hostage standoff that has so tightly hobbled American action in the Middle East in the past.
''We've been reluctant to use the term 'hostage,' '' Mr. Bush said. ''But when Saddam Hussein specifically offers to trade the freedom of those citizens of many nations he holds against their will in return for concessions, there can be little doubt that whatever these innocent people are called, they are in fact hostages.''
On Sunday, Mr. Hussein said he would let the hostages go if the United States withdrew its military force from Saudi Arabia and lifted the economic embargo. Mr. Bush is hoping the trade sanctions will force the Iraqis to withdraw from Kuwait by cutting off oil sales and imports of food, ammunition, spare parts and others supplies.
Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, on the trip from Baltimore to Kennebunkport, he said Mr. Hussein's conditions were ''totally unsatisfactory to most countries in the world.''
''We must not delude ourselves,'' Mr. Bush said in Baltimore. ''Iraq's invasion was more than a military attack on tiny Kuwait. It was a ruthless assault on the very essence of international order and civilized ideals. And now, in a further offense against all norms of international behavior, Iraq has imposed restrictions on innocent civilians from many countries. This is unacceptable.''
 
Predicts 'Hard Choices'
Warning that the military deployment to the Persian Gulf would be lengthy and would require ''American planning, patience and, yes, personal sacrifice,'' he said: ''The outcome is not yet decided. Hard choices remain. But of this we are certain: American will not be intimidated. When some ask, where does America stand, our answer is, America stands where it always has, against aggression, against those who would use force to replace the rule of law.''
In the speech to the political fund-raiser in a country club in North Kingstown, the President said: ''It was not with passionate haste, but really with a heavy heart that I had to commit our troops to Saudi Arabia. I took this action not out of some national hunger for conflict, but out of the moral responsibility, shared by so many committed nations around the world, to protect our world from fundamental evil.''
He sought to borrow the religious arguments that Mr. Hussein has evoked in his oratorical attacks on the United States and Saudi Arabia. Addressing Iraqi leaders, Mr. Bush said: ''In moving foreign citizens against their will, you are violating the norms of your own religion. You are going against the age-old Arab tradition of showing kindness and hospitality to visitors.''
He insisted later that he was not deliberately intensifying his attacks on Mr. Hussein by referring to the Americans as hostages for the first time. But he said that he and his advisers had met Sunday night to discuss the issue and that he decided this morning that the conditions the Iraqi leader was setting for their release merited the use of the emotionally charged word.
 
'Definition of Hostages'
''There's a recognition of the fact that now demands are being made for the release of people, and I think that is the definition of hostages,'' he told reporters aboard Air Force One.
In his speech in Baltimore, Mr. Bush made a point of praising the extraordinary Soviet-American cooperation that Administration officials have credited with doing much to smooth the path to forging the international alliance against Mr. Hussein.
He said that by condeming the Iraqi invasion, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev ''has shown, if anyone doubted it, that nations which joined to fight aggression in World War II can work together to stop the aggressors of today.''
In Moscow, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze appealed today to the visiting Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister, Saddoun Hammadi, to free the foreigners in his country and in Kuwait. The official press agency Tass said he had ''expressed satisfaction'' to Mr. Hammadi that Soviet citizens were being allowed to leave Iraq and Kuwait and asked for ''a similar decision in relation to citizens of other states.''
Mr. Bush, who has often sought to compare Mr. Hussein to Hitler, evoked the World War II theme several times in his speech today. ''Half a century ago, the world had a chance to stop a ruthless aggressor and missed it,'' he said. ''I pledge to you: We will not make that mistake again.''
He ended his speech with a partisan attack on Democrats in Congress, with whom he remains locked in a dispute over efforts to cut the Federal budget deficit. Although Congress has been in recess during the current crisis, Mr. Bush suggested that lawmakers had not yet realized that the threat of war in the Middle East would make it difficult to make deep cuts in the fiscal 1991 budget, and that careful planning would be needed for future years so the United States can meet such military challenges.
''Make no mistake,'' he said. ''To prevent aggression, to keep America militarily prepared, I will oppose the defense budget slashers who are out of tune with what America needs to keep freedom secure and safe.''
The President has adamantly refused to cancel his vacation out of fear of appearing to be imprisoned in the White House, as Jimmy Carter seemed to be during the Iranian hostage crisis.
Upon returning to Kennebunkport, he threw himself back into his vacation schedule, roaring off into the Atlantic Ocean aboard his speedboat, Fidelity.

HEADLINE: Export Restrictions Fail to Halt Spread Of Supercomputers

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
The growing ease with which it is possible to design and build supercomputers is making it increasingly difficult for the United States and Japan to keep the powerful machines from proliferating. That raises the possibility that more nations may be able to use supercomputers to design advanced weapons systems.
In recent years companies and state-financed development efforts in Britain, Germany, France, Sweden, Bulgaria, India and Brazil have been able to build machines at least as fast as their American and Japanese counterparts in some ways, although they are not yet believed to have the sophisticated software needed to take advantage of the advanced hardware.
In many cases, these computer builders rely on off-the-shelf microprocessor chips widely available in the United States and elsewhere. Not powerful enough to come under the strictures on technology exports, the chips can be strung together to achieve supercomputer-level performance. 
''It used to be that the U.S. was the storehouse for all technology,'' said Michael C. Sekora, a former official of the Defense Intelligence Agency. ''Now advanced technologies are ending up in third world countries. It's no longer simple to control.''
Supercomputers, capable of performing hundreds of millions of mathematical operations a second, are used to solve the most complex scientific and engineering problems. Since Japan entered the market in 1984, the United States and Japan have controlled the market for supercomputers and have been able to restrict the machines by establishing export controls. The machines have been sold, under strict conditions on their use, to some nations, but they have not been exported to Eastern Europe and only in rare instances to the developing world.
A secret agreement between the United States and Japan was negotiated in 1984 to limit supercomputer sales. The two countries plan to hold discussions in Hawaii next month on a variety of topics, including a re-examination of the 1984 agreement, an Energy Department official said. Government officials said new agreements with countries gaining supercomputer competency would be sought.
The agreement has blocked the sale of supercomputers to Israel, largely because Israel has refused to sign the nuclear nonproliferation treaty.
 
Restraints Are Ebbing
But restraints are ebbing because of the increasing power of fingernail-size microprocessor chips that can be easily linked to work in tandem in computers called parallel processors, greatly multiplying their speed.
Such components are now readily available at electronics parts outlets in the United States and are also manufactured in other countries. They are beginning to appear in personal computers and are virtually impossible to control, Commerce Department officials say.
''The genie is out of the bottle,'' said Paul Freedenberg, a specialist on trade and technology who had been an export control official under the Reagan administration. ''There was enormous leverage used by the U.S. to control supercomputer technology over the last decade. That is not going to be exercised by European countries because they don't feel the risk.''
The winding down of the cold war has added fuel to a debate within the United States Government over whether the curbs on technology exports remain valid and whether the restrictions should be shifted from the traditional East-West axis to North-South lines, with a focus on keeping the equipment from Libya, Iraq and much of the third world.
 
'Disconcerting and Bewildering'
''It's a recent phenomenon, and it's a bit disconcerting and bewildering for those of us who have to run the regulatory regime,'' said Dennis E. Kloske, Under Secretary of Commerce for export administration. ''It raises all kinds of questions if we are no longer the sole provider of fire.''
Some arms control experts and weapons specialists dispute whether supercomputers are vital tools for designing advanced weapons systems.
Jack Worlton, a researcher at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, noted that the first thermonuclear weapon was designed in the early 1950's with a computer no more powerful than a modest personal computer widely in use today.
But some arms control experts said technology curbs were useful, making it more difficult for nations without nuclear weapons to develop them.
''I don't think anyone wants Iraq to have a supercomputer,'' said Gary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control, which tracks the spread of nuclear weapons to developing countries. ''We ought to maintain the controls until it is obvious that they have been superseded by developments.''
 
When Hardware Is Widespread
Mr. Milhollin and Mr. Kloske agreed that if supercomputer hardware became so widespread that it could no longer be controlled, governments seeking to control the spread of advanced weapons should focus on the software the powerful machines would need to perform complex weapons-development tasks.
Mr. Worlton was pessimistic about the possibility of controlling software. ''The actual weapons codes are classified,'' he said. ''But they are composed of such components as hydrodynamics, neutron transport and thermodynamics programs. All these things are easily available. I don't think there is any way to control that kind of software.''
In addition to the concerns about weapons proliferation, some computer industry executives say the United States' restraints on supercomputer makers could damage the industry, which relies on exports for 45 percent to 55 percent of its sales.
''You don't want to penalize innovation in the marketplace,'' said Debra Waggoner, senior manager for trade policy at the American Electronics Association. ''Right now the control system penalizes the first to market.'' 66 Million Calculations a Second Among the relatively powerful chips that are popular with computer makers abroad is the Intel Corporation's i860 microprocessor, introduced two years ago. The first version of the chip is capable of performing 66 million mathematical operations a second.
Later this year, Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., is planning to introduce a faster version of the i860 that will reach speeds above 100 million math operations a second.
Under United States export regulations, any machine capable of processing more than 100 million mathematical operations a second is considered to be a supercomputer. Computers that have processing speeds above 150 million operations a second may be sold only under a special security plan that requires the buyer and the buyer's government to restrict access to the building that houses the computer and requires detailed audits of the programs run on the machine.
 
A British Manufacturer
The manufacture of high-speed microprocessors is not restricted to the United States and Japan. Inmos Ltd., a British semiconductor maker, offers a microprocessor chip known as the Transputer that is designed specially to be connected in large arrays. A single version of the current model reaches speeds of five million math operations a second, and a model the company is expected to announce shortly will reportedly exceed 100 million operations a second.
A number of United States and foreign companies are now designing high-performance computers that chain together dozens or even hundreds of the i860 and Transputer chips, reaching speeds that compete with the fastest supercomputers made.
Meiko Ltd., the most successful British maker of parallel supercomputers, has now hooked more than 600 Transputer and Intel chips together in a computer capable of processing more than four billion math operations a second. The machine is currently operating at Edinburgh University.
Supercomputer technology is also no longer limited to Western nations. Last year, Bulgaria began shipping a computer known as an array processor that has a peak speed of 576 million math operations a second. And T. J. Rogers, the president of Cypress Semiconductor Inc., a Silicon Valley chip maker, recently returned from a trip to the Soviet Union, where he said he had visited a computer center with a working supercomputer capable of performing more than a billion math operations a second.
The United States companies that make supercomputers include the Cray Research Corporation, based in Minneapolis, the Thinking Machines Corporation of Cambridge, Mass., and the International Business Machines Corporation.

Where Horatio Alger Heroes Want to Pack It Up

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Aug. 20

 BODY:
For Yolanda and Alfredo Di Sanso, their 10 years as business owners have been a losing struggle against political instability, runaway inflation, recession and government economic policies that were protectionist one day and free-trade the next.
So they are ready to pack it in and emigrate from Argentina, a one-time promised land.
All they ask is to be able to put their proven entrepreneurial skills to work in a growing country where business does not come to a halt before each change of government and every new president does not mean new rules for the game.
''This has me demoralized,'' said Mr. Di Sanso, 47 years old. ''We've faced a crisis on and off for 10 years.'' 
The Di Sansos are middle-class Argentines, people who built their house with their own hands and their business from scratch.
 
More Think of Leaving
Their kind of Argentines - people who work in small businesses and low-paid professionals - increasingly think of leaving a country that once gave them more opportunity than any other Latin American country could offer.
Conversations with many such people indicate that slowly, over months, they are seeking out connections abroad - in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia - that could turn into jobs. Their dissatisfaction and declining faith in Argentina do not translate into an avalanche of people at the foreign consulates seeking visas. Instead, they are reflected in the regular departures of small numbers of professional staff members from such places as hospitals, universities and research institutes.
For the very poor and uneducated, living in growing numbers in the shantytowns that ring Buenos Aires and other major cities, emigration is not much of an option. The neighboring countries offer no opportunities for them, and this is too far from the United States to consider illegal immigration by land.
''There's a lot of frustration floating in the air here,'' said Dr. Oscar S. Ledesma at a hospital in the provincial city of Santiago del Estero. ''Any doctor or researcher young enough to start over somewhere else is thinking about leaving.''
 
'Argentine State Is Finished'
Dr. Elsa Segura, who directs a specialized institute in Buenos Aires that belongs to the Ministry of Health, said two biologists and one medical doctor, out of a professional staff of 34, had left the institute in the last eight months to work in the United States. Two others left for private organizations in Argentina.
''The Argentine state is finished,'' she said, referring to the Government's inability to continue adequate financing of education, medical care and scientific research. Professionals on her staff are generally earning less than $400 a month.
The Government of President Carlos Saul Menem, which inherited a collapsed economy, immense debts and a bureaucracy unable to collect taxes or control expenditures when it took power last year, has promised to turn the economy around and join the world trend toward free markets and open trade. Officials have said they hope that selling off money-losing state companies and attracting foreign investment will eventually revive the economy.
But for the Di Sansos and their three children, the rosier future is too far off and too uncertain. They want to emigrate to the United States and complete the Horatio Alger dream that Alfredo has had since his youth.
 
Start as an Errand Boy
For a while, Mr. Di Sanso's dream seemed to be going along pretty well in Argentina. He started his working life as an errand boy for an advertising agency and rose through the ranks.
''I always read those stories from the United States about the boys who began at the bottom and ended up owning the company and thought I could do the same,'' he said.
So he and Mrs. Di Sanso, who is 43, started their own company to design and produce display materials used by stores to sell name-brand products - such things as bright banners to string in supermarkets advertising Coca-Cola or temporary racks to sit on the floor or counters of pharmacies and stores to hold and display cosmetics, razors, cold cream and lingerie.
They typically designed a sample to show a company and then went into production when they had a contract. In one case, he had to invent the machine to produce the display materials, usually made of cardboard or lightweight synthetic materials.
 
Happy Working Day and Night
''It was the happiest time of my life,'' he said. ''Sometimes I worked from 6 A.M. to 10 P.M. and on weekends.''
A labor strike almost crippled their first big product introduction, Mrs. Di Sanso recalled, but the whole family worked day and night to finish the supplies on schedule.
But almost before they were successful, the orders began to fall off. At first, he said, any 10 proposals requested by manufacturers would result in 9 orders for their company. Then it declined steadily to about 4 contracts for every 10. Now, he said, it is a scramble to get one paid order for every 10 proposals he prepares.
The Di Sansos do not have their bags packed yet, but they are trying to find some assurance of similar work in the United States and to sell their machinery and home here. He says they are qualifying for an immigrant visa under the United States visa lottery, talthough they do not have it in hand.
The lottery, called the Berman lottery after Representative Howard L. Berman, a California Democrat who was the chief sponsor of the legislation, was set up by the Immigration and Naturalization Service to increase immigration prospects for people from countries such as Argentina that have supplied few immigrants to the United States. Consular officials here said about 500 immigrant visas would go to qualifying Argentines under the lottery.
''We are in very bad shape,'' Mr. Di Sanso said. ''The factory is not operating most of the time. I have a desperate, permanent search for orders. We have no chance to grow, and what I want is to grow.''

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf;
At U.S. Request, Security Council Holds Preliminary Talks on Crisis

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Tuesday, Aug. 21

 BODY:
The Security Council gathered informally Monday night for preliminary discussion of American proposals for enforcing the trade embargo against Iraq, diplomats said early today. The talks adjourned without a formal meeting.
Ambassador Crispen Tickell of Britain said there no longer was any urgeny in voting on the resolution, Reuters reported. The United States sought endorsement of sanctions for military action it might take while American vessels shadowed two Iraqi tankers in waters near the gulf. 
One tanker was said to be headed for Yemen and was scheduled to discharge oil there later today. But in the consultations that began on Monday night, Yemen said it would respect the economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations, indicating that the tanker would not be allowed to unload its cargo.
 
Use of 'Minimum Force'
The diplomats said the United States, one of the council's five permanent members, presented three papers with proposed language for a Council resolution on the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait. The third version included language that would call on all member states that have deployed naval forces in the gulf to use ''minimum force'' to ''insure strict enforcement'' of the economic embargo, they said.
Diplomats said that a paragraph in the third version of the American proposal said that the Security Council ''calls with immediate effect upon all member states which are deploying maritime forces to the area to use such minimum force as may be necessary under the authority of the Security Council to verify the cargoes and destinations of all inward and outward maritime shipping and to insure strict enforcement'' of related measures under the trade embargo against Iraq.
The representative of Cuba, which currently holds one of the 10 rotating seats on the Council, Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, repeatedly denounced the American proposal for a resolution, which he described as illegal and unnecessary.
The Yemen diplomat, Abdallah al Ashtal, told reporters that his country would implement the trade embargo on Iraq. He did not say how his country would accomplish this.
The consultations, which were urgently requested on Monday by the United States, came as a surprise to many of the Council's 15 members.
 
Unexpected Meeting
When the representatives of the Council's five permanent members met earlier Monday to discuss the terms of such a resolution, Sir Crispin Tickell, Britain's representative, had said, ''We are working on something, but we are not going to do anything else today.''

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf;
U.S. Citizens Being Moved Just Some of Those at Risk

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 20

 BODY:
The 47 Americans in Iraq and occupied Kuwait who have been picked up and transferred to unknown locations are among a far larger group of foreigners, numbering in the hundreds, taken from hotels and residences and apparently placed in strategic military and industrial installations.
A total of 123 British citizens, the largest number of any nationality so far, were detained in Kuwait over the weekend. A British Foreign Office spokesman in London said 48 were relocated into two civilian buildings in Kuwait, which he declined to identify, while the rest had been stationed in unknown areas.
Some Britons and Americans have taken refuge in their respective embassies in Kuwait. 
 
British Aide Is Exercised
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Government has promised to join the United States in enforcing the blockade against Iraq with naval power. The British Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, today strongly protested Iraq's roundup of foreigners. ''We have taken every opportunity over the weekend, in public and private, to point out to the Iraqis that this behavior is illegal and repulsive,'' he said at a news conference in London.
Mr. Hurd also said that Britain would not comply with Iraq's demand that all embassies in Kuwait be closed by Aug. 24. ''We are not accepting that instruction,'' he said. Britain will try to keep officials in Kuwait as long as possible in order to keep in touch with its citizens there and give what help they can, he said, adding, ''I say as long as possible. I don't know how long that will be.'' A total of 4,500 British citizens are trapped in Iraq and occupied Kuwait.
Announcing that six more French nationals were taken from a hotel in Kuwait on Sunday, Paris today rejected Baghdad's demand that it close its embassy in Kuwait and dismissed President Saddam Hussein's offer to release foreign hostages in exchange for a lifting of the trade embargo. Yesterday, the French Government disclosed that 27 of its citizens - 26 in Iraq and one in Kuwait - had been taken to undisclosed locations by Iraqi authorities last Thursday. A total of 560 French citizens - 290 in Iraq and 270 in Kuwait - are now trapped.
 
Many Arabs Getting Out
More than a million foreigners are in the two countries, although thousands of people, mostly Egyptians and other Arabs, have been managing to cross the Iraqi and Kuwaiti borders every day.
While other Western countries, including Denmark, Italy and West Germany, have said that they would not obey Iraq's order to close their embassies in Kuwait, third-world countries and Japan have generally been more cautious in their responses.
In a sign of the difficulty that Japanese foreign policy officials are having over how to respond to the Persian Gulf crisis, a Foreign Ministry official today said it would take a week or more to decide on how to support the military embargo against Iraq. Last week, the Foreign Ministry had indicated that Japan would send nonmilitary personnel soon.
A Japanese official said there was concern that a more active role by Japan could threaten the safety of its 500 citizens currently in Kuwait and Iraq.
 
Caution in Manila
The Philippines, which has 93,000 citizens in Iraq and Kuwait, has hesitated to allow the use of American military bases there in Operation Desert Shield, the American operation intended to protect Saudi Arabia. Manila has also sought partial exemption from the sanctions mandated by the United Nations. In part, Philippine officials say, this is to get food to Filipinos unable to leave the two countries.
More than 150,000 Indian citizens remain in Iraq and Kuwait, Inder Kumar Gujral, India's Foreign Minister, visited Baghdad on Sunday and is planning to travel to Kuwait. The Indian Government would not discuss what Mr. Gujral said in Baghdad. His mission is said to be the freeing of Indians.
President Hussein has offered to release citizens from nations that do not take sides in the conflict, such as the estimated 1,300 citizens from Indonesia, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Finland and Portugal.
Hundreds of Soviet citizens have also been freed in recent days, for which the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, thanked a visiting Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister in Moscow today.
 
Moscow Keeping Options Open
Mr. Shevardnadze also said after the meeting that parts of the conditional offer by President Hussein to release trapped Westerners deserved attention and that Soviet experts were considering it.
''We are studying all the details and parts of the Iraqi President's speech,'' Mr. Shevardnadze told the Soviet press agency Tass after three hours of talks with Deputy Prime Minister Saadun Hammadi of Iraq. ''Later, we shall respond in an appropriate manner.''
On Sunday, President Hussein offered to free Westerners held in Iraq if foreign countries withdrew their forces from the Persian Gulf and abandoned economic sanctions adopted against Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait.
Mr. Shevardnadze described his talks with Mr. Hammadi, held at Iraq's request, as useful and necessary.

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf;
Libya Denounces Iraq's Decision to Take Westerners as Hostages

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRIPOLI, Libya, Aug. 20

 BODY:
The Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, today condemned Iraq's decision to make hostages of Westerners in Iraq and Kuwait and said that he would dispatch Libyan troops to the Persian Gulf if the United Nations requested them as part of a blockade against Iraq.
''I am against bargaining using civilians, workers or hostages; this is a fixed position,'' Colonel Qaddafi told reporters gathered under a marquee at a military barracks in Tripoli.
The reporters were brought here for the day aboard Libyan planes dispatched by Colonel Qaddafi to several points in the Middle East and Europe, suggesting that the 47-year-old Libyan leader has been frustrated in not being able to make his voice heard in the crisis over Iraq's occupation of Kuwait. 
About 70 reporters flew in from Paris, Cairo, Malta and Tunis, and were taken by bus to the Bab-Alazaizia barracks, one of the Libyan targets attacked by United States warplanes on April 15, 1986, in retaliation for terrorist attacks that the United States accused Libya of supporting. .
 
No Alignment Indicated
Seated under a green-and-white striped marquee about 100 yards from the shattered shell of the house that he had been using at the time of the American attack, Colonel Qaddafi appeared at pains not to align himself too clearly with either side in the gulf crisis. While criticizing the United States, Britain and other allied nations for dispatching forces to the area and halting shipments bound for Iraq without a formal United Nations vote in favor of a blockade, he renewed his criticism of Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.
''I'm not here trying to defend Iraq's occupation of Kuwait by means of force, because that is something condemned by the Arab League charter,'' he said in remarks in Arabic that were translated into English.
The vigor with which Colonel Qaddafi once attacked the United States appeared muted, and his positions on the current crisis appeared intended to present him as a peacemaker.
 
'Colonial Ambitions' Cited
That seemed particularly evident in his remarks about the moves made by President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to make hostages of Americans and other Westerners. In answer to an American reporter's question, Colonel Qaddafi said that he had tried to telephone Mr. Hussein in recent days, but that the calls had not gone through because ''the United States and its allies'' had jammed the telephone lines. ''I tried, but I failed,'' he said, switching briefly to English.
When asked what he would tell Mr. Hussein if he got through, Colonel Qaddafi replied: ''Should there be direct contact with Iraq, surely I should talk to Saddam, but there is no contact. I've already said I'm against using civilians in such cases.''
Iraq, he said, had ''put the matter on a golden platter,'' for the United States and its Western allies, which he said had long harbored ''colonial ambitions'' in the Middle East, while the United States' dispatch of troops to the area had ''given Iraq justification'' for its actions.
 
Peace Plan Failed
The Libyan leader said the United States' actions were ''a clear violation'' of the United Nations Charter because military action in support of the economic sanctions voted by the Security Council would be legitimate only if the Council followed up with a new resolution under Article 42 of the Charter, giving United Nations sanction to a blockade. While he did not say directly that Libya would support an Article 42 resolution, Colonel Qaddafi implied that it would when he said that Libya, if requested by the Security Council, would provide troops for a United Nations force.
At an earlier stage of the crisis, Libya and the Palestine Liberation Organization put forward a peace plan, under which Iraq would have been expected to withdraw from Kuwait in return for which Kuwait would have ceded two strategic islands in the Gulf to Baghdad and have paid Iraq large sums to settle an oil dispute between the two nations. Diplomats here said the plan also provided for elelctions under Arab supervision for a new Kuwait Government.
The plan died when an Arab summit meeting convened in Cairo by President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt voted 12 to 3 to condemn the Iraqi invasion and to dispatch a joint Arab military force to Saudi Arabia. Libya joined the P.L.O. and Jordan in voting against.
Before reporters left the heavily defended barracks, officials gave them a tour of the shattered house nearby, in which an adopted daughter of the Libyan leader died during the bombing attack. The house has been preserved as a dusty museum, and the closest that the visit came to the old anti-American sentiment was in painted signs lying in the courtyard, one of which read, ''America Go to Hell!'' Inside was a display of wreckage from a downed F-111 fighter used in the raid, including the shattered flying helmet of one of the two crewmen who died.

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf;
Few From Left or Right Protest Bush's Big Stick

BYLINE: By ANDREW H. MALCOLM

 BODY:
So far, the critics of American military involvement in Saudi Arabia have been few and relatively soft-spoken, pending further developments in the confrontation with Iraq, notably its duration.
Only a few people and a handful of peace and anti-nuclear groups have voiced firm opposition. ''We were quick, too quick, to move to a military solution,'' said Nick Carter, executive director of SANE/Freeze, one of the largest peace groups, claiming 150,000 members.
Ramsey Clark, the former Attorney General who has long been a critic of American military interventions, also opposed the military moves. ''I think it's a serious mistake for the United States to place its military in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf,'' he said. ''We can't police the world.'' 
But over the last few days, even as military transport planes continued to lift off United States runways bound for Saudi Arabia, few American politicians, officials or commentators were sharply critical of President Bush's decision. And polls showed broad support among the public.
 
Conservatives Worried
Some of the strongest reservations come from conservatives who question the President's tactics or whether he should make such a large military commitment to aiding the royal families of Kuwait or Saudi Arabia.
Patrick J. Buchanan, the syndicated columnist who was Ronald Reagan's director of communications, said Mr. Bush had acted brilliantly in diplomatic terms, but added, ''I'm concerned with the extent of rhetorical commitment he's making.'' In his column on Saturday, he wrote of Mr. Bush's statement comparing Iraq to Nazi Germany. ''By using the Hitler analogy, Bush is virtually ruling out any negotiated settlement,'' he wrote.
And Charles Oliver, assistant editor of Reason, a monthly libertarian magazine, expressed little fondness for the Kuwaiti leader displaced by the Iraqi invasion. ''I don't see the point of intervening because the emir may be a nicer thug than Saddam Hussein,'' he said.
Many Democrats said they backed American involvement in the gulf but thought more effort should be made to enlist the support of other nations.
 
Getting Caught Alone
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, said he was worried that the United States seemed to be paying less and less attention to operating under the umbrella of the United Nations. At first, he noted, President Bush referred to the United Nations Charter and international law in responding to Saudi Arabia's request for help against an Iraqi invasion.
Then came the naval blockade of Iraqi ports. ''And for reasons I can't understand we haven't wanted to get U.N. sanction,'' the Senator said. ''Something has faltered.'' He added, ''The Americans would be mad to be caught alone.''
Coretta Scott King said the danger faced by Americans stranded in Kuwait and Iraq would be reduced by a stronger commitment to United Nations sanctions. ''With this commitment, a little patience and restraint could go a long way to resolving this crisis without endangering the lives of American hostages and soldiers,'' said Mrs. King, the widow of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Even many people once vocal in their opposition to United States military involvement overseas, whether in Vietnam or Grenada, expressed at least general support for Administration actions, while speculating that criticism would quickly mount if the confrontation became a long stalemate.
 
Defense, Not Offense
The Rev. William Sloane Coffin Jr., the former Yale University chaplain who rose to national prominence as an organizer of Vietnam War protests, said he supported the President's troop decision, as long as the force remained defensive and multilateral. ''Deterrence, yes,'' he said. ''Intervention, no.'' Deterrence, he went on, was bolstering Saudi Arabia; intervention was trying to push Iraqi troops from Kuwait.
''The world is still a dangerous and savage place,'' Mr. Coffin added, ''and we need actions to contain it. But they need to be the proper kind of actions.''
George S. McGovern, the Democratic candidate for President in 1972 who had opposed the Vietnam War, said, ''I support President Bush's decision to take a stand in Saudi Arabia.'' The former South Dakota Senator, who now travels on the international lecture circuit and owns a hotel in Stratford, Conn., added: ''I hope we keep the diplomatic option open. No really important problem facing the U.S. today would be resolved by war in the Middle East.''
Walter F. Mondale, the former Vice President who headed the Democratic Presidential ticket in 1984, said he also ''basically supports'' United States actions so far but thinks the Administration should use the United Nations more energetically.
 
Spin Into Recession
''The more isolated Saddam Hussein becomes,'' Mr. Mondale said, ''and the more this becomes a world effort and not just a Western effort, the better.''
The Rev. Jesse Jackson endorsed the troop deployments but warned, ''The longer we stay there, sand has a way of sinking.''
He said the United States created considerable Middle Eastern animosity with its selective involvement, stepping in to deter an invasion of Saudi Arabia's oilfields while remaining silent about Israeli occupations of Lebanon and the West Bank.
''Our interests should be higher than just energy,'' he said. ''They should be humanity and self-determination as well.''
The Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, condemned Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. But he said the situation should have been an excellent opportunity to support the United Nations ''rather than mobilizing armed forces and considering hasty, impetuous military action.''
Dr. Lowery also cited petroleum as the driving force behind the confrontation. ''I do not think that we ought to be on the brink of war over the issue of oil,'' he said. ''And that's what this is about, not the rights of Kuwaitis.''
In a recent New York Times Poll, 76 percent of Americans approved of the trade embargo against Iraq, and 66 percent approved of sending troops to Saudi Arabia. But 40 percent said the Administration was too quick to send in the military and only 48 percent felt the Government had tried hard enough to reach a diplomatic solution. The telephone poll of 670 people was conducted Aug. 9 and 10 and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
Deborah Huber, a 21-year-old housewife in Wichita, Kan., was among those in the poll with doubts. ''This is really hitting home for us,'' she said in a subsequent interview. ''My husband's brother, David, is being shipped over on the 24th this month. It's a very personal issue. We would disapprove no matter what country was involved. It's their war.''
Dennis Morganbesser, a 35-year-old New York City sanitation worker, said the troop deployment actually worsened the situation. ''By sending troops over,'' he said, ''it's like it's being blown out of proportion. They're a bunch of fanatics over there.''
He added, ''We should stay in the back and then move in, not go to the forefront right away like we always seem to do.''
