HEADLINE: German Church Crisis

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "German Churches, Ever Giving, Ask to Receive" (news article, Jan. 6): The financial crisis of the German churches was foreseen 50 years ago by Protestant leaders like my father, Werner Schmauch, who left the Silesian Church in 1950 in protest of the territorial church system your article describes. 
 The financial dependency on state-collected taxes was too comfortable for the hierarchy, so no effort was made to change the system to one of voluntarism and active church membership. It is interesting to note that the East German churches made tentative steps in this direction under the pressure of circumstances, but in the process of unification they were forced to adopt the anachronistic West German system.
It is a pity that the situation had to deteriorate in order to reveal the absurdity of a system that should never have been invented in the first place.

HEADLINE: Classical Musicians Team Up With Actors In the AIDS Battle

BYLINE: By ANTHONY TOMMASINI 

 BODY:
Some say that given the fluidity of today's economy and the pace of technological change, people should no longer cling to the idea of having one job for life.
If this is so, Charles Hamlen could be a poster person for such adaptability. He began his working life as a French teacher, but kept busy on the side as a pianist, primarily accompanying professional singers. Then he moved into artist management, founding his own company, which later merged with I.M.G. Artists, a leader in the field. In those days he worked in a well-appointed office on Madison Avenue and handled clients like James Galway, Yevgeny Kissin and Itzhak Perlman. 
 But for the last five years, Mr. Hamlen has been the executive director of Classical Action: Performing Arts Against AIDS, a nonprofit organization that draws upon the donated talents of performers, mostly classical musicians, to raise money for AIDS services. Now Mr. Hamlen operates out of a bare-bones Manhattan loft on West 45th Street and administers a staff of three, including himself. And at 54, he sees how everything was leading to his current work.
In the mid-1980's, while his management business was thriving, the AIDS crisis was spreading. On New Year's Eve in 1988, he lost his lover to AIDS. As numerous friends got sick, he ministered to them, which in those days mostly meant providing support as they faced death.
"I remember thinking then that, as well as I do artist management, others do it as well and better," Mr. Hamlen said recently. "But I was the only one who could be there for my friends. How this might connect to my professional life in music I didn't see at first." But, in a sense, Mr. Hamlen added, his life has been about networking, not backslapping and swapping favors, but listening to people, sensing needs and remembering.
His gift for reaching out has been critical to the success of Classical Action. The organization has distributed more than $2 million to AIDS services groups nationally, like God's Love We Deliver, which provides meals for homebound people with AIDS in New York; the Hospice of Pasadena, in California; the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, and the Starfish Foundation for Children With AIDS, which is based in New Jersey.
Additional results of Mr. Hamlen's networking will be clear tomorrow night, when Classical Action marks its fifth anniversary with a benefit concert at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, which is co-sponsor of the event and is donating the use of its Majestic Theater. Among the participants will be the soprano Dawn Upshaw, the violinist Joshua Bell, the pianist Fred Hersch, the dancer-choreographer Bill T. Jones, the bassist Edgar Meyer, the pianist Ursula Oppens, the clarinetist David Shifrin, the Orion String Quartet and Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo.
But the benefit will also acknowledge a new partnership. In October, Classical Action merged administratively with Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS, the highly visible nonprofit group that emanated from the theater and that has distributed, in 10 years, some $25 million to more than 100 AIDS services and agencies. This, too, is a result of networking, for, since its founding, Classical Action has been situated on the same floor of the Actors' Equity building as Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS.
These two scrappy AIDS organizations have recognized, as many fund-raising agencies in other fields have not, that there is more to be gained from cooperating than from competing. Tom Viola, a founding director of Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS, suggests that comparable organizations are sadly reluctant to pool resources in similar ways.
"This merger is not about treading on each other's turf," Mr. Viola said in a recent interview. "While we don't operate in the same artistic neighborhoods, we can get much more bang out of our efforts by sharing administrative costs. Neither organization has to lose its identity or control. But we can get more of the money we raise to the people we raise it for if we are not paying two rents, two phone bills, two bookkeeping salaries."
Mr. Hamlen agrees. "It frees me to contact artists and put projects together," he said, "which is what I do far better than payroll and taxes." The corporate sponsors of each organization have been enthusiastic about the merger, he said. "They tell us we are demonstrating leadership, cutting back on infrastructure and maximizing staff."
Mr. Viola's organization had prior experience with a merger. Its two branches were founded separately. Broadway Cares was primarily set up by a collective of theater producers. Equity Fights AIDS emanated from the Actors' Equity Association. They joined together in 1988. "Many of the service organizations we fund are today facing the same issues we did," Mr. Viola said. "And if they don't begin to cooperate, some of them are going to close down."
Indeed, when Mr. Hamlen started Classical Action, his model was Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS. The perception persists that the classical music field was slower to respond in an organized way than other arts and professions. But Mr. Bell suggested in a telephone interview that the lag among classical musicians had only to do with the initial absence of a leader.
"Everyone I knew felt strongly about this issue," Mr. Bell said. "So many people in our field have been stricken. It has affected us all, in a deeper sense. If classical musicians didn't organize themselves at first, it was probably because we were waiting for someone like Charlie to come along and spearhead the effort. He organized and set up everything. He makes it easy for me to help. All I have to do is show up and play."
Mr. Bell remains devoted to Mr. Hamlen, who was his first manager. "Charlie heard me play my debut with the Philadelphia Orchestra at 14, and we started talking," he said. "At that time, he had his own company. Going with him instead of a bigger agency was the best career decision I ever made. He so sincerely loves music. He is one of the rare people in this profession everybody likes. That's why he has been successful with Classical Action."
Mr. Hamlen's ease with people came about in steady, careful stages during his earlier years. Born in Schenectady, N.Y., he attended Harvard, where he majored in French, and studied piano. He also played in the cello section of the college orchestra, along with his demon pianist friend, Ms. Oppens, who also played cello for fun. After graduation, while teaching French at a private school in New Hampshire, Mr. Hamlen started a chamber music series. At the suggestion of some friends, he considered going into management.
In retrospect, Mr. Hamlen says that his bold decision to shake up his life at 34, move to New York City with no money to speak of, and begin a new career was an outgrowth of confronting himself. Having previously been married, he now understood that he was gay.
"I was still uncomfortable about it," he said. "But I subliminally had accepted it already. I knew that New York would help me figure it out."
When his friends started dying, Mr. Hamlen felt compelled to respond with more than just personal care. There had already been occasional AIDS benefit concerts called Music for Life, presented by classical musicians. He thought that this work should be continuing, and national.
"I remember grappling with the possibility of changing my life and taking this on," he said. "One moment you think, what a great thing; the next you think, you are out of your mind?"
What emboldened him was the reactions of many clients when he told them he would be leaving. "The first person I talked with was Andre Watts," Mr. Hamlen recalled. "Andre said, 'Charlie, I've wanted to be involved for a long time, but no one asked me.' The same happened with James Galway. The first words out of his mouth were, 'What can I do to help?' "
Since then, many people have helped: Emanuel Ax, Yo-Yo Ma, Thomas Hampson, Leonard Slatkin, Mark Morris, Cecilia Bartoli, Van Cliburn, Carol Wincenc, Jean-Yves Thibaudet, Michael Tilson Thomas and dozens of others.
Ms. Upshaw, a friend of Mr. Hamlen, was stunned by his decision. "I was very moved by his courage," she said recently. "Nothing in my lifetime has been quite as devastating in the way AIDS has been. It was like dealing with a plague for my generation. And I was outraged at the reaction of those who saw AIDS as some sort of justified punishment for people involved with the same sex."
Ms. Upshaw said she felt that if Mr. Hamlen could change his life so drastically in order to help, then all artists should do the same. "But Charlie has done it for us," she said. "So now we all have a way to give, through his organization. Like everyone else, I'm the one who is grateful."
At the benefit, Ms. Upshaw will sing Rodgers and Hart songs. Mr. Bell will play solo works by Fritz Kreisler, but will probably also perform duos with his friend Edgar Meyer, the bassist, fun pieces Mr. Meyer wrote for them to play together.
There is no reason, Mr. Hamlen said, that a concert benefiting AIDS service agencies need be joyless and grim. A certain degree of high spirits should be assured by the presence of Nathan Lane and Madeline Kahn as co-hosts.
This is exactly the kind of cooperation between people from different artistic neighborhoods that Mr. Hamlen sees as one good result of the merger with Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS.
"On our own, Classical Action could never have reached out to such stars of the theater world," Mr. Hamlen said. "But now this kind of collaboration will just keep happening."
Given past experience, however, Mr. Hamlen is prepared for more unexpected turns, should they come.
 
An Anniversary And a Benefit
Classical Action: Performing Arts Against AIDS celebrates its fifth anniversary and its merger with Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS with a benefit concert tomorrow at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Majestic Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene.
The event will feature a duet by the violinist Joshua Bell and the bassist Edgar Meyer and the world premiere of a piece by the dancer-choreographer Bill T. Jones, performed with the Orion String Quartet. There will also be performances by the clarinetist David Shifrin, the pianists Fred Hersch and Ursula Oppens, the soprano Dawn Upshaw and Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo. Nathan Lane and Madeline Kahn will be the hosts.
The concert begins at 8:30 P.M. Tickets are $100 for the concert only, $250 including a preconcert reception at 7 P.M., and $500 including the reception and a postconcert Champagne toast with the performers, and can be purchased by calling Classical Action at (212) 997-7717.
On April 13, Classical Action will present "Fred Hersch and Friends: The Duo Concert" at Town Hall, 123 West 43d Street, Manhattan. Mr. Hersch, the jazz pianist and composer, will perform with the saxophonist Joe Lovano, the vibraphonist Gary Burton, the pianist Kenny Barron and the singer Andy Bey.

HEADLINE: Putting the Surplus, if Any, to Work

BYLINE: By Robert D. Reischauer 

 BODY:
The Federal budget picture is suddenly not the grim splotch of red that it once was. The Congressional Budget Office said this week that the budget "is likely to be essentially balanced for the next 10 years if current policies remain unchanged" and that surpluses should start piling up soon.
So rosy is the picture that Democrats and Republicans have already begun suggesting ways to spend the money. Some envision new Government programs. Others see tax cuts. Here, some leading experts offer their recommendations: 
 Robert D. Reischauer, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and former director of the Congressional Budget Office.
 The budget surpluses projected for the next decade are an illusion. They occur only because the budget includes the surpluses in Social Security. Apart from Social Security, tax payments will still fall tens of billions of dollars short of covering the full costs of providing Government services.
Debates over how to spend these surpluses should be shelved until the Government's revenue and spending -- excluding Social Security -- are in balance and Social Security's long-term fiscal position has been bolstered.
Until then, we should husband the surpluses, not spend them.
Surpluses will increase the nation's capital stock, boost worker productivity and expand the economic pie. That larger economy, in turn, will ease the burden when the baby boomers begin to draw their Social Security and Medicare benefits.
 Furthermore, the projected surpluses are both small and uncertain. They rest on economic and political assumptions that, while reasonable, are by no means certain. A recession of average depth and duration could transform a balanced budget into one with a $100 billion to $150 billion deficit.
And policy makers may not have the political will to cut discretionary spending as the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 requires. Most cuts would have to come out of civilian programs now that the Pentagon has been cut by more than one-third.

HEADLINE: Jack F. Grimm, 72, Is Dead; A Seeker of Oil and Legends

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Jack F. Grimm, a flamboyant West Texas wildcatter who found his share of oil in Texas and Oklahoma but had less luck searching for Sasquatch in the Pacific Northwest, the Abominable Snowman in Nepal, the Loch Ness Monster in Scotland, Noah's Ark in Turkey and the Titanic in the North Atlantic, died on Tuesday at a hospital near his home in Abilene, Tex. He was 72 and had insisted to the end that he really had discovered the ark and had been the first to find the Titanic.
His family said the cause of death was cancer. 
 To suggest that Mr. Grimm was a perpetual seeker would hardly do justice to a man who was so inspired by his grandfather's tales of buried treasure that at the age of 11 he blew up a creek bed near his home in Wagoner, Okla.
Never mind that the blast, using dynamite the youngster had bought at the local hardware store, turned up nothing but a few arrowheads, some lead bullets and an old frying pan.
"That was it," he said years later. "That was all it took to hook my imagination."
His imagination was fired even further a few years later when Mr. Grimm, who served as a demolition expert in the Marines in the Pacific in World War II, hitchhiked to Houston to visit a Navy buddy and discovered that the friend he knew as Bunker was the son of the billionaire oil wildcatter H. L. Hunt.
Mr. Grimm, who was studying oil geology at Oklahoma University, was so impressed by the Hunt wealth that after graduation he turned down offers to work for major oil companies and struck out on his own, but only after he had married a fellow geology student and spent his honeymoon panning for gold in California.
Getting rich seemed easy at first. The first well he drilled struck oil in Oklahoma, but when he moved to West Texas, his luck changed. After 25 straight dry holes, he was so poor that his telephone service was turned off, a major blow to a man who spent so much time on the phone that he once said he planned to have one installed in his coffin.
With two young children to support, Mr. Grimm was on the verge of taking a job, but with his wife's blessing, he tried one more deal. The well came in, and he had phone service from then on.
Mr. Grimm's more quixotic searches began in 1970, when he read about a planned expedition to find the remains of Noah's Ark on Mount Ararat and signed on for what turned out to be the first of three expeditions to Turkey. Although by most accounts the efforts failed to turn up fragments of the biblical ark, Mr. Grimm, who returned with a hand-carved oaken timber dug out of the frozen peak and always carried a hunk of it in his briefcase, maintained otherwise.
As he put it a few years ago, "This is the ark; that's my story, and I'm going to stick to it."
The ark expedition brought Mr. Grimm to the attention of other seekers, and during the 1970's he helped finance other quests, always, he proudly maintained, as business deals, never as a hobby.
Although he put up some of his own money, Mr. Grimm, a master salesman, raised most of the money from other investors, including his old buddy, Nelson Bunker Hunt, who proved such an easy touch that when Mr. Grimm was presented with a proposal that even he found outlandish he would placate the promoter by giving him Mr. Hunt's private phone number.
By far his most ambitious quest began in 1979 when he was approached by Michael Harris, a Florida film maker who had made documentaries of searches for Spanish treasure in the Caribbean and wanted to find the Titanic. Mr. Grimm all but took over the project, raising several million dollars, arranging for reputable scientists to accompany the expedition with advanced sonar equipment and even hiring the William Morris agency to promote what became three expeditions to the North Atlantic.
Although the scientists acknowledged that the expeditions produced invaluable data about the configuration of the ocean floor, Mr. Grimm alone maintained that they had actually found the Titanic.
Whether or not a grainy undersea photograph taken in 1981 was a picture of the Titanic's anchor, as Mr. Grimm, who helped write a 1982 book, "Beyond Reach: The Search for the Titanic," maintained it was, after a 1985 French-American expedition led by Robert Ballard found the full remains of the sunken ship, Mr. Grimm's claims were swept aside by the courts.
The expeditions and the vagaries of the Texas economy took their toll on Mr. Grimm's business, but after a brush with bankruptcy he had made something of comeback, though not enough, perhaps, to satisfy a man who once described his life as "a continuous search for the unknown."
His survivors include his wife Jackie; two children, Theda Carpenter of Buffalo Gap, Tex., and George, of Brisbane, Australia; three brothers, four grandchildren and a great-grandchild.

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Stay Tame, With 1.2% Drop Last Year

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8

 BODY:
Producer prices fell two-tenths of 1 percent in December and 1.2 percent in the full year, the largest annual decrease in a decade, the Government said today.
The report on prices at the wholesale level was issued on the same day that the nation's major retailers reported that sales in December were relatively strong, although much of that strength was concentrated in a few days toward the end of the month. The sales gains indicated that economic growth remained healthy without pushing prices up. 
 "I was thinking today it couldn't get much better than this, but it may," said Gary Thayer, an economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis. "The consumer is going to benefit from the low interest rates we're getting. It's a pretty good environment -- low inflation and steady growth."
Even lower borrowing costs could be on the way. A Federal Reserve governor, Laurence H. Meyer, said today in a speech that the Fed might decide to lower interest rates if the Asian economic crisis caused the American economy to slow more than currently expected.
Last year's decline in producer prices followed a 2.8 percent increase in 1996. The decrease was the largest since a 2.3 percent drop in 1986, when oil prices were falling sharply, and the first since prices dipped one-tenth of 1 percent in 1991. Prices rose during only three months last year.
The core rate, which excludes producer prices for energy and food, rose one-tenth of 1 percent last year, the smallest annual gain on record and below 1996's increase of six-tenths of 1 percent. In December, the core rate fell one-tenth of 1 percent.
A separate report today showed that the number of workers applying for first-time state unemployment benefits rose last week by 20,000, to a seasonally adjusted 334,000. That was the second consecutive weekly increase.
The four-week average for new jobless claims rose to 318,250 last week from 313,250 the previous week, a sign job growth may lose some momentum this year.
As for the inflation outlook, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, raised the issue of falling prices -- or deflation -- in a recent speech. "Inflation has become so low that policy makers need to consider at what point effective price stability has been reached," Mr. Greenspan said. "Indeed, some observers have begun to question whether deflation is now a possibility."
However, Mr. Meyer, the Fed governor, appeared to express a different view today. Asked whether he saw a potential for deflation in 1998, he said that by not mentioning the subject in his speech, he "gave deflation its appropriate attention." He was speaking to the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: COMMODITIES;
Spot Gold Price Is Under $280 Briefly in London and New York

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
For the first time in more than 18 years, the spot price of gold dropped below $280 an ounce in both London and New York yesterday as the fear of sales by central banks and low inflation continued to undermine the outlook for this precious metal.
Despite a record for the amount of gold used in fabrication in 1997, the spot price of gold plunged almost 24 percent last year and has continued its fall this year. 
 A report showing tame inflation in the United States as well as comments on central bank sales pushed gold lower yesterday. The spot price fell to $278.45 an ounce, before it rebounded to finish at $281.05, just 20 cents above the 18 1/2-year low reached Tuesday. On the Comex Division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, February gold dropped to $279 before closing at an 18-year low of $281.80.
Adding to the gloom was a year-end report from Gold Fields Mineral Services Ltd. of London, that highlighted the central bank sales in 1997 and indicated that they could continue early this year.
"I can't see any reason why central bank selling won't continue," Philip Klapwijk, the senior metals analyst at Gold Fields, said yesterday in an interview.
The report also noted how much gold's role as a haven in times of financial distress had diminished, being replaced in the case of Asia's turmoil by the United States dollar and the American bond market.
But Mr. Klapwijk suggested that the formation of a new European central bank as Europe shifts to a single currency next year could halt such sales for a while, bringing some stability to the price of gold.
"You can make a case for the central bank weight on the gold market becoming less, maybe in the second half of the year," he said.
He said that there may be more sales to get under the wire, but once the countries eligible for the single currency are chosen and the central bank begins to be established, individual European central banks may feel they have to hold off on any further sales until the new central bank establishes much gold it wants to hold in reserve.
At that point, Mr. Klapwijk said, the new central bank may decide to set a policy that would make it clear to investors how much gold could be sold by old central banks and when the sales would be.

HEADLINE: Putting the Surplus, if Any, to Work

BYLINE: By Laura D'Andrea Tyson 

 BODY:
The Federal budget picture is suddenly not the grim splotch of red that it once was. The Congressional Budget Office said this week that the budget "is likely to be essentially balanced for the next 10 years if current policies remain unchanged" and that surpluses should start piling up soon.
So rosy is the picture that Democrats and Republicans have already begun suggesting ways to spend the money. Some envision new Government programs. Others see tax cuts. Here, some leading experts offer their recommendations: 
 Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a professor of economics and business at the University of California, Berkeley, and chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers during the first Clinton Administration.
I would advise against using projected surpluses to finance either additional spending or tax cuts for several reasons. First, the surpluses are very small, and relatively minor changes in underlying economic conditions could cause them to disappear altogether.
Second, with the economy enjoying high levels of employment and price stability, there is no macroeconomic reason for changing the Government's net fiscal stance at this time.
Why not save any small surpluses that may develop over the next few years in a rainy-day fund for use when the economy hits a rough patch? Wouldn't it be sensible for the Government to put aside some resources to finance a temporary increase in unemployment compensation, job training and welfare payments in the event of a recession?
Third, we have a long-term financing problem for Social Security and Medicare. Why not use some of the surpluses now to build up the assets of the Social Security trust fund and to secure adequate financing for Medicare?
Instead of frittering away the surpluses we don't even have yet, let's savor the nation's hard-earned victory on the deficit and spend some time thinking seriously about the long-term future.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Says Brokerage Firm Engaged in 'Yield Burning'

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The Securities and Exchange Commission said yesterday that it had accused Rauscher Pierce Refsnes, a large regional brokerage firm, and a former employee, of defrauding investors and the State of Arizona in a 1992 municipal finance deal.
The case against Rauscher -- a major participant in municipal finance -- is notable because it is the first time the S.E.C. has brought a securities fraud complaint against a brokerage firm for a municipal bond practice that has come to be called "yield burning." 
 For several years, Federal regulators have been looking into allegations that brokerage firms, big and small, illegally overcharged state and local governments in the early 1990's by selling them Treasury bonds at artificially high prices to make a hefty profit.
When interest rates fall, state and local agencies often refinance old debt by issuing new municipal bonds. The proceeds are placed in an escrow account, which by Federal law is usually stocked with Treasury bonds. Firms handling the account typically buy the Treasuries.
But in marking up the prices of Treasuries sold to the state and local governments, some firms, investigators say, thereby lowered, or burned down, the yield -- which moves in the opposite direction of the price -- so that the yield appeared to conform with Federal regulations.
In doing so, those firms may have jeopardized the tax-exempt status of many municipalities and also pocketed hundreds of millions of dollars that the local governments would have otherwise forwarded to the Federal Government.
Officials at Rauscher, now part of the Dain Rauscher Corporation of Minneapolis -- strongly deny any wrongdoing, arguing that their activities were entirely proper and that Arizona officials had reviewed the case in 1993 and determined that nothing wrong took place. Dain Rauscher changed its name from Interra Financial Inc. earlier this month.
Yesterday, a spokesman for the Department of Administration in Arizona would say only that the agency was cooperating with the S.E.C. and the Internal Revenue Service, which is conducting its own investigation.
According to the S.E.C., Rauscher Pierce and its lead investment banker on the deal, James R. Feltham, defrauded Arizona in a $129 million debt refinancing deal by charging Arizona "above market prices" for Treasury securities in 1992.
"This case illustrates how a firm like Rauscher can take advantage of its position to enrich itself," said Paul Gerlach, an associate director at the S.E.C., which is seeking to recover the losses and impose penalities on the firm. "They put tax-exempt bonds at risk."
In serving as both a financial adviser and an investment adviser, S.E.C. officials said the firm also had an obligation to inform the agency that it would make a $700,000 profit on the deal and that Mr. Feltham would earn more than $115,000 in compensation for his work, about a third of his annual salary in 1992.
Rauscher issued a copy of a pair of 1993 letters yesterday from the Arizona agency and its bond counsel, Squire, Sanders & Dempsey in Phoenix, stating that the 1992 transaction had been reviewed. The agency, which may have been under investigation at the time by the I.R.S., said that the prices were found by bond counsel to be "reasonable and appropriate."
There is some evidence, however, that at the time, state officials were trying to prove they were not overcharged because if they had been, the I.R.S. might have held the state responsible and ordered the agency to repay the money lost to Rauscher or risk having the tax-exempt status of the 1992 bonds revoked.
Through his lawyer, Mr. Feltham, who no longer works for Rauscher, denied any wrongdoing in the 1992 deal, saying that Rauscher officials were aware of his actions at the time, and that he was being made a "fall guy" by the Government.

HEADLINE: Putting the Surplus, if Any, to Work

BYLINE: By Robert B. Reich 

 BODY:
The Federal budget picture is suddenly not the grim splotch of red that it once was. The Congressional Budget Office said this week that the budget "is likely to be essentially balanced for the next 10 years if current policies remain unchanged" and that surpluses should start piling up soon.
So rosy is the picture that Democrats and Republicans have already begun suggesting ways to spend the money. Some envision new Government programs. Others see tax cuts. Here, some leading experts offer their recommendations: 
 Robert B. Reich, professor of social and economic policy at Brandeis and Secretary of Labor in the first Clinton Administration.
In the likely event that the Federal budget begins to show surpluses, let's give the largesse to Americans who have not shared in the huge surge of wealth in recent years. (Note to readers who now mutter to themselves, "Ah, they've allotted this one to the liberal who wants to spend it all on big government." Indulge me a moment more before your eyes wander.)
We can help them gain ground without relying on a large bureaucracy, and do so in ways that give them more power over their lives. Herewith, four apple pies in the sky.
First, boost the Earned Income Tax Credit. This tax credit is a reverse income tax, originally conceived by conservative economists and celebrated by no less than Ronald Reagan. It works reasonably well, but it's still too small.
Lift the maximum benefit so that a very poor working family with two or more children receives $6,000 a year. (They get around $3,500 now.) Phase out the credit only gradually as incomes rise, so it doesn't vanish completely until a family reaches the median income (now about $50,000 for a family of four).
Next, subsidize the wages of lower-income workers who have lost jobs and whose new jobs pay less. Set the subsidy at half the difference, and make it available for a year. This will ease the pain of job transitions. Call it "re-employment insurance." It's better than an unemployment check.
Then do something big for poor kids who are getting a lousy education. Add $2,000 a year to what the states and locales are already spending on each child of a lower-income family. (If you're intent on vouchers and school choice, just add $2,000 to the value of vouchers for lower-income families.)
Finally, give every child who finishes high school, and who is from a family whose income is below 120 percent of the median, a "grubstake" of $25,000 upon graduation. The money has to be used for further education or it must be invested in stocks or bonds for at least four years. Here, the nation gets a twofer: We encourage completion of high school, and we create a new cohort of capitalists.
That's a start. Give me more money and I'll find more uses.

HEADLINE: Consumers Trimmed Debt in November

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8

 BODY:
Consumer borrowing unexpectedly declined in November, the first drop in more than four years, the Federal Reserve said today.
Borrowing fell by $4.2 billion, to $1.231 trillion. In October, consumer credit rose a revised $11.4 billion. 
 All major categories of borrowing registered declines during November. Credit card borrowing fell $1.8 billion, auto loans decreased $1.3 billion and other types of personal loans declined $1.1 billion.
November's decline indicated that consumers had become more cautious in their spending. Indeed, retail sales early in the Christmas season, which begins after Thanksgiving, were considered weak. Christmas spending gathered strength toward the end of December, however.
"Consumers are beginning to cut back on their new borrowing and pay back some of their existing debt with the improvement in employment and earnings," said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Barnett Banks Inc. in Jacksonville, Fla.
At the same time, Ms. Reaser said, "we are seeing some substitution of home equity loans for credit card and other installment debt." Loans backed by real estate are not part of the Fed data.

Bonds Up 5th Time in 6 Sessions As Foreign Money Seeks Refuge

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices rose yesterday for the fifth time in six sessions, in a rally driven largely by foreign investors seeking refuge from the turmoil of Asian markets. The rally advanced after a Federal Reserve official suggested that the Asian crisis could lead to lower United States interest rates.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 14/32, to 105 13/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, dropped to 5.75 percent, from 5.78 percent on Wednesday. But some traders suggested that the gains were limited ahead of today's release of the December employment report. 
 Still, the report is expected to confirm the market's view of slower growth and restrained inflation.
Bill Gamba, senior vice president and manager of bond trading at Cowen & Company, said the Treasury market opened strong after sharp overnight declines on Asian markets, leading to a flight to quality into Treasury securities.
"Coupled with that, we had excellent economic data today," Mr. Gamba said.
The Labor Department said yesterday that producer prices fell two-tenths of 1 percent in December and 1.2 percent in the full year.
"And perhaps what was most important about the inflation numbers were that the core and intermediate goods, which are still in the manufacturing pipeline, have shown significant declines," Mr. Gamba said.
Comments by Laurence H. Meyer, a Fed governor, helped further the rally. He told the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington that "a much larger spillover from the Asian crisis could encourage an easing" in interest rates by the central bank.
Mr. Meyer's comments were made at the end of speech in which he suggested two possible near-term economic outcomes, one leading to an easing and another to a tightening.
In other activity, the Treasury sold $8 billion of 10-year Treasury inflation-protected securities, called TIPS. The securities came with an interest rate of 3.73 percent, much better than expected. But with inflation remaining tame, retail demand was low.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new 10-year inflation- indexed securities:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

High Price	99.130	High Yield	3.730%	Low Yield	3.580%	Median Yield	3.699%	Accepted at low price	73%	Total applied for	$23,956,451	Accepted	$8,408,613	Noncompetitive	$37,711	Interest set at	3 5/8	
The 10-year inflation notes mature on Jan. 15, 2008.

Uncertainty Over Earnings Batters Stocks for Third Day

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Uncertainty about the prospects for earnings growth of American companies touched off another wave of selling across Wall Street yesterday, pushing stocks lower for the third day in a row.
From Alcoa to Seagate Technology, a steady diet of news about anticipated earnings shortfalls and disappointments is beginning to take a deeper toll on the stock market, analysts and investors say. 
 While the market has endured volatile swings recently, what is different this time, analysts say, is that investors' sentiments are beginning to gravitate toward bearishness, making rebounds less likely.
"For the first time in a number of years we are raising some cash," said Richard I. Sichel, chief investment officer at Investment Counselors of Bryn Mawr, an investment management firm in Conshohocken, Pa.
Concerns about Asia's financial crisis and a belief that analysts' earnings forecasts for American companies with exposure there are too high has made the firm more defensive, he said. As a result, it is increasing cash positions in most portfolios from 5 percent to 15 percent by selling stocks that have seen strong gains in sectors like energy, technology, health care and consumer goods.
"I don't know one portfolio manager who hasn't been bitten by the Asian flu, or blindsided by a bad earnings report," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Corporation.
"When that occurs, the stock has a very sharp drop. It's very disheartening. It tends to make you gun-shy. If there's any hint there will be an earnings disappointment, you try to stay clear. Nobody has the sense of urgency" about needing to buy stocks, Mr. Johnson said.
Such lack of enthusiasm about stocks comes during a month when stocks have generally risen, aided by heavy flows of cash into equity mutual funds. In fact, the last time the Dow Jones industrial average ended lower during the month was in January 1990.
"In a seasonally strong period, we're not seeing any real commitments being made," said Michael W. Clark, a managing director and head of United States equity trading at Credit Suisse First Boston.
"We're seeing institutional selling and people playing defensive games around the perimeter," he said, by selectively buying a few stocks they consider cheap.
Investor skittishness could continue for the next few months, he said.
"It really has to do with this story that's just blossoming in the Pacific Rim," Mr. Clark added. "They say we need a broader sample of fourth-quarter earnings reports, but there will be the same uncertainty for the next set of earnings" for the first quarter.
Yesterday, the Dow average closed down 99.65 points, or 1.26 percent, at 7,802.62. This week, the blue-chip indicator has fallen 162.42 points, erasing more than half of last week's 285-point gain. Two weeks into the new year, the index is 105 points lower.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 7.96 points, to 956.04.
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index suffered less, slipping just 6.16 points, to 1,555.54. The Russell index of 2,000 smaller-company stocks also took a lighter hit, slipping 4.08 points, to 425.71.
Although small-company stocks fell less sharply than larger-company issues yesterday, few analysts believe that performance marks the beginning of a small-cap rally, or January effect.
"When the market's down this heavily, you would really expect the small caps to do much better," said Lawrence G. McMillan, president of the McMillan Analysis Corporation, a Morristown, N.J., investment firm that specializes in futures and options strategies.
Small-company stocks historically have done better in the first five trading days of the year, even when the broader market is declining, which is why the phenomenon is known as the January effect. That has not happened this year.
Instead, technology and smaller- company shares did better yesterday because some investors were looking for bargains. But that trend may not continue, Credit Suisse First Boston's Mr. Clark said. "If you're nervous about the market it's sort of a safe place to put your money -- in something that's already taken the pain," he said of technology shares. "You can argue that you're buying value."

HEADLINE: Strong Finish to Christmas Season Cheers Retailers

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
In a remarkable turnaround from a weak season, American retailers reported strong December sales yesterday, aided in huge part by shopping that occurred after Christmas.
The Goldman, Sachs & Company same-store sales index, which compares the results of stores that have been open at least a year, reported that retail sales were up 4.4 percent in December, compared with a meager 2.9 percent gain in December 1996 and well above the 3 percent gains most retail experts were forecasting. 
 But underscoring the profound shift in the way America shops, those strong showings were due almost entirely to the 48 hours before Christmas and the week after Christmas.
"Christmas arrived for us between 4 and 5 P.M. on the 23d of December," said Robert Burton, director of investor relations for the Kmart Corporation. "The last two weeks made the month happen." The discount retailer said that thanks to the week after Christmas, sales in Kmart stores open at least one year rose 2.9 percent for the season.
They were not alone. Interviews with more than a dozen retail executives and analysts made it clear that for the most part, the Christmas selling season that began the day after Thanksgiving was a disappointment -- until it ended with a brawny finale as December came to a close. "Santa came late and stayed for after Christmas," said Richard N. Baum, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs.
The Dollar General Corporation, for example, a discount chain, said that holiday sales gains for the first and second weeks of the selling season were 3.6 percent and 4.1 percent, respectively; for the fourth week, same-store sales leaped 19.8 percent.
More surprisingly, the after-Christmas period, which started on Friday, Dec. 26, when much of the country had the day off, essentially bailed many retailers out of an otherwise miserable performance.
"The week after Christmas was really what pulled us up to a positive number," said Elaine Crowley, the vice president for finance for the Bombay Company, a seller of home decor and furniture items.
Indeed, on the Friday after Christmas shoppers raced to the stores in search of half-price wrapping paper and tree ornaments, to redeem gift certificates and to spend their cash gifts on toys.
In Houston, local television news crews parked themselves in front of the Galleria mall, reporting with glee about the parking lot Santas who guided the glut of cars into spaces and the shoppers who swarmed in for marked-down sling-back shoes, ties and bread makers.
"The first couple of weeks of December found us below plan," said Jan Drummond, a Sears, Roebuck & Company spokeswoman. But the few days before the holiday and the final week of the month pushed the chain's gains to a healthy 4.5 percent, against a difficult comparison of 9.5 percent gains the previous year.
The last-minute shopping habits of consumers had merchants ripping their hair out for the better part of the season. "We are all optimists," said Michael Goldstein, chief executive of Toys "R" Us Inc. "So you say, 'It is coming at the end.' But we were all nervous."
Mr. Goldstein said his managers were unhinged by weak sales early in the season, and were relieved by the strong showings in the final two weeks that led to the company's gain of 5 percent, a big improvement over last year's flat sales.
"We can't figure it out," Mr. Goldstein said. But children who got money for the holiday may have hit the stores the week after Christmas and Hanukkah, which this year ran from Dec. 23 through Dec. 30, increasing sales for that period.
In the last few years, time-deprived consumers have pushed their holiday buying closer and closer to Christmas Day, playing chicken with retailers on potential markdowns and leaving the dreaded trip to the mall for the last minute. People have also leaned toward nontraditional gifts such as travel, services and gift certificates for things as odd as drivers education classes or reflexology, leaving general merchandise retailers scrambling for sales.
Most significant, though is shoppers' insistence on value, which means they will give gift certificates or cash so that after-holiday sales can be taken advantage of, or buy gifts for the following season the week after Christmas to get the bargain. The American Express Company said sales of its gift checks -- essentially nicely wrapped gifts of cash -- rose 17 percent this season, compared with last year.
"Christmas doesn't mean buying gifts for Christmas anymore," Jeffrey M. Feiner, an analyst at Lehman Brothers Inc., said. "Retailers can still have a good December now because the month is weighted with the week after."
Many trends that marked the retail business all of last year were evident in holiday sales patterns.
Discounters, which offer everything from apparel to coffee makers, were one example. The Dayton Hudson Corporation's Target division posted 6.4 percent gains, while Family Dollar Stores Inc. said its sales rose 7.9 percent. Off-price apparel retailers had a similar Christmas story to tell, and one that reflected their strong 1997. Ross Stores Inc. and the TJX Companies both said their sales rose 7 percent.
Department stores, whose results have been inconsistent for the last year, remained so last month.
While the luxury players had a great season -- Harcourt General Inc.'s Neiman Marcus unit gained 8.8 percent and Saks Holdings Inc. saw a 6.1 percent rise -- those in the middle mostly suffered. Dillard Department Stores Inc.'s sales rose only 2 percent, and Federated Department Stores Inc. squeaked in with a 1 percent gain, which was particularly weak considering last year's sales were flat. The J. C. Penney Company saw its sales fall 2.3 percent.
And the women's specialty stores continued their run of ho-hum merchandise and sales to match. The Ann Taylor Stores Corporation said sales fell 10.1 percent, and Talbots Inc. fell 11 percent. Limited Inc. enjoyed a 7 percent gain, but that was a result of the stellar performance of its Intimate Brands unit and huge price promotions in its women's apparel stores.
Intimate Brands, which runs Victoria's Secret and Bath and Body Works, offers the kinds of things that women like to get and give, and the unit's success underscores the fact that the old retail standbys like sweaters and scarves no longer cut it with many shoppers.
It was also clear that the retailers with the very best showings had one strong week after another, even though the last two weeks of the month were the best for them as well. Dollar General proved this, as did Gap Stores Inc., which posted a 10 percent sales gain. "We did a better job of being in stock on key items this year," Larry Shushan, a company spokesman, said. "I think we also had improved merchandise this year, especially on the men's side."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
South Koreans Appear to Get Debt Extension

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
The world's leading banks have tentatively agreed to extend payment on as much as $28 billion in short-term loans to South Korea that come due on March 31, a crucial precursor to easing the country's financial crisis.
All banks have committed to one-month extensions, or rollovers. This follows an extension agreed to last week on loans that came due at the end of December. 
 Many parties to yesterday's negotiations, including major American banks, have agreed to 90-day rollovers. Bankers who attended the meeting said international banks that have yet to commit formally to a 90-day rollover are expected to do so soon.
The negotiations on the loans have been slowed by disagreements among the banks on how to proceed and continue to be overshadowed by escalating financial problems ravaging Southeast Asia. But bankers who went into yesterday's negotiations at the New York headquarters of Citicorp nervous about potential fissures in the international banking coalition said they were now optimistic that all of the banks would soon be on board for 90 days.
Once the 90-day rollovers appear to be firmly in place, South Korea can take the more important step of repackaging its short-term loans as long-term debt and thus ease the credit shortage that is strangling the local economy.
But American commercial banks have yet to marshal the support they will need from Wall Street for a refinancing proposal that they presented in preliminary form to the South Korean Government last week, opening the possibility that the Government may find alternative proposals more attractive. Some Wall Street investment banks interested in helping American commercial banks float a huge South Korean bond offering are concerned about Japanese commitment to the plan. Japanese banks are said by other bankers to be hesitant to commit to the proposal until the South Korean position on a repackaging becomes clearer.
While it was hoped that the South Koreans, who were present at yesterday's meeting, would be sending a delegation back to the United States next week to discuss refinancing options, the Koreans now plan to wait until Jan. 19 to return here.
The South Korean Government, which has hired Goldman, Sachs & Company, Salomon Smith Barney Inc. and E. Gerald Corrigan, a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as financial advisers, also recently retained Mark Walker, a highly regarded New York lawyer who is a leading expert in debt restructurings.
American banks are proposing a $25 billion to $30 billion bond offering guaranteed by the South Korean Government, of which $10 billion would be used to replenish the country's foreign-exchange reserves and the remainder would replace short-term loans. The proposal is much larger than what the banks were considering only a week ago. Other options are being discussed by South Korea with its financial advisers. Goldman and Salomon have been considered potential rivals of American commercial bankers to lead any South Korean repackaging effort -- and to snare a lion's share of the big fees that will accompany it.
"Early on, I think there were suggestions that it was the investment bankers versus the commercial bankers competing for business in South Korea, but I think both sides have great interest in helping the South Koreans recover as quickly as possible," one American investment banker said. "Commercial banks have to be kept in the game."
There is still concern that a huge bond offering by South Korea could be a tough sell -- whoever leads it.
"People are wary of exposure to Asia right now and the more caveats and complexities that are associated with this, the less likely it is to go down well with investors," said John Davitte, an emerging-market bond analyst in London with the financial advisory firm I.D.E.A. "The size of this will be daunting and it's a matter of whether the appetite for Korean paper will be that strong."
A failed bond offering would have potentially disastrous repercussions in that could affect all of Southeast Asia, as well as Japan, South Korea's single largest creditor.
Indeed, representatives from Citicorp, J. P. Morgan & Company, the Chase Manhattan Corporation, Goldman, Sachs and the Bankers Trust New York Corporation will be having lunch today at the Essex House hotel with the Japanese Vice Finance Minister for International Affairs, Eisuke Sakakibara, to discuss the possibility that the Japanese Government will supplement recent moves to stimulate its staggering economy.
The International Monetary Fund, which released an additional $2 billion payment to South Korea yesterday as part of its $57 billion rescue package for the country, briefed attendees at the Citicorp meeting about South Korea's financial position. The I.M.F. declined to comment.

GRAPHIC: Charts: "The Debt Picture"
International banks are trying to extend repayment, or "roll over," short-term loans so the loans can be repackaged as longer-term debt to ease South Korea's cash crunch. About $35 billion to $40 billion in total short-term foreign currency loans owed by South Korea's banks and corporations comes due before March 31. Only South Korean bank debt is a candidate for blanket rollovers. Corporate debt other than bank debt will be decided on a case by case basis. The South Korean Government has no external short-term debt.
 
"PAYMENTS DUE"
Approximate short-term debt rolled over in Dec. 1997 due before March 31: $6 billion
Other short-term debt due before Jan. 31: $12.2 billion
Due Feb. 28: $5.1 billion
Due March 31: $4.3 billion
Minimum short-term debt due and/or to be refinanced by March 31: $25.6 billion to $27.6 billion

"PAYMENT PROPOSALS"
U.S. Commercial Banks As much as $30 billion would be raised by selling new long-term bonds to replace short-term debt and replenish foreign reserves. Bonds would pay a much higher interest rate and be guaranteed by the South Korean Government.
To replenish reserves: $10 billion
To repay short-term loans: $20 billion
South Korean Government Considering other options, including raising $35 billion through a government-backed bond issue to replace short-term loans and a new loan from foreign banks to fortify reserves.

HEADLINE: Where Business Rules;
Forging Global Regulations That Put Industry First

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH 

 BODY:
The gilded Palais des Nations in Geneva is a perfect setting for the elite group of industry executives and government regulators who regularly meet there to establish worldwide auto safety regulations for the next century. A sign marked "Private" prevented anyone not part of the official 90-member delegation from entering the last gathering held in November.
As they decide public safety issues from emission standards to safety belts that will affect drivers and passengers around the world, the Geneva negotiators do not have to adhere to many of the rules requiring openness to the public and interest groups that govern similar proceedings in the United States. 
 In the interest of breaking down trade barriers, negotiations like these are trying to harmonize or create common regulations for products to be sold around the world. The auto negotiations in Geneva are on the cutting edge of this new regulatory world, where government agreements on everything from drug testing procedures to food safety standards are driven largely by the business interests most affected.
At the dawn of this new worldwide regulatory machinery, it is premature to predict its impact. But corporate executives are generally ecstatic, consumer advocates are increasingly critical and many regulators from the United States have mixed feelings. This reflects the tension that can sometimes arise between the expansion of trade and the retention of high standards for safety and health.
Barely noticed outside a small circle, the international rule making has sparked an underground debate over who gets to write the rules. Already, one of its creators is worried about the shape it is taking.
"This is about sovereignty, multinational corporations, the new post-cold-war world, global standards and international harmonization," said Mickey Kantor, chief trade negotiator and Commerce Secretary for President Clinton during his first term. "These are very important issues. But it is like they are being dealt with in a closet somewhere and no one's watching."
The final automobile standards agreement is expected by March but few consumer advocates will have had a say. There were 62 government regulators and 26 industry representatives who took part in the Geneva auto committee last November, under United Nations rules, but only one consumer representative from London and one auto club member from France.
Many American regulatory operations -- from those designed to prevent unsanitary meatpacking plants and adulterated drugs at the turn of the century to those put in place in the 1960's in response to unsafe cars -- were created to address social concerns and before global trade was so important. Now some of these rules are seen as impediments that can block markets and cause inefficiency.
Paula Stern, the chairwoman of the United States International Trade Commission under Presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, is one of the architects of what she calls "entrepreneurial diplomacy." Paid these days by corporations as a trade consultant, Ms. Stern applauds the role of businesses in what she sees as a valuable effort to streamline international regulation while maintaining public protection as worldwide trade expands. She said it was possible to "adapt the necessary goals of protecting health in a way that is also the most efficient and the most streamlined and that will make the U.S. economy the most competitive."
But since the regulation and standard setting is increasingly taking place in less open or accessible international forums, like the United Nations committee in Geneva, safety advocates worry that their concerns will be slighted. Already, David Snyder, an assistant counsel with the American Insurance Association, has criticized the "closed door" nature of the road to Geneva.
The United States wants to open up the process, but does not always get its way in international standard-setting forums. Last year, for example, Codex Alimentarius, a Rome-based group that sets global food safety standards, rejected United States efforts to cut in half the acceptable levels of lead in mineral water and to require dairy products to be pasteurized.
International business diplomacy was jump-started in 1995 with the creation of the World Trade Organization, which calls for single standards and shared regulatory systems across borders in the name of reducing barriers to trade.
Members of the W.T.O., like the United States, can theoretically retain their own higher standards, but those standards would be harder to defend before its international panels against a charge by another country that they represent a barrier to imports, according to trade experts. There are few legal precedents.
More and more standards are likely to be set in such global forums. The same week as the Geneva meeting, 70 corporate leaders from the United States and Europe gathered at the Excelsior Hotel in Rome. They drafted plans for streamlined government regulation of many industries, like chemicals and agribusiness, and acted at the behest of their respective governments. The group, the Trans Atlantic Business Dialogue, was conceived in December 1994 by Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown. In November 1995, six months before his death in a plane crash, Mr. Brown attended the group's first meeting, in Spain.
"We should put the business 'horse' before the government 'cart,' " he told the group. The business leaders recommended that their governments create common regulations, a plan adopted by President Clinton and European leaders at the end of 1995. The industrialists also called for common auto safety regulations through a United Nations committee -- the same committee that met last November in Geneva.
But the emphasis on business first bothers negotiators like Ricardo Martinez, the United States auto safety czar, who was at both the Geneva and Rome meetings. Dr. Martinez, the head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in Washington, thinks global regulation can be helpful to both industry and consumers. But he is concerned that the Trans Atlantic Business Dialogue and American car makers put too much emphasis on knocking down trade barriers rather than raising safety standards.
"I have great concerns that the perspective is not broad enough to respect the real issues of safety and health," he said in a recent interview in Rome. "The dialogue so far has been very much one way."
Dr. Martinez, 42, took office in 1994 with an unusual background for a regulator. Before he joined the highway safety agency, he was an emergency-care physician who attended to the victims of motor vehicle accidents -- the leading cause of death for Americans under the age of 44.
From the outset, Dr. Martinez had concerns about a lack of openness. In April 1996, he attended an industry conference in Washington where auto executives asked governments in Europe and the United States to follow their detailed road map to common international regulations.
That conference was not open to the public, either. Dr. Martinez, who was invited to attend, told the group he was sympathetic to their goals, provided there was no degradation of safety and more public involvement.
Over the next few months the highway safety agency and car executives listened to consumer and safety advocates. The agency held a public hearing, but by then an accord for Geneva was already drafted.
Safety advocates, used to playing a significant role in Federal rule making, complained of being left out of the early planning.
"Only when the train was well down the track were the groups brought into the process," said Mr. Snyder, a safety advocate who works with a group of American insurers. By contrast, consumer groups and ordinary Americans weigh in loudly on a variety of safety issues in the United States, both at public hearings and through the public comment periods that are mandated before any new regulation is approved.
Mr. Snyder cites the recent dispute over air bag safety for children as a vivid example of the critical role advocacy groups play in shaping regulations: The public comment period lasted most of last year.
In response, the car makers say that promotion of trade by governments can improve, not lower, safety standards.
It is not easy to combine European and American standards: Europe has higher standards in some areas and lower in others. American car makers certify their own products, while governments perform that job in Europe. European regulators say the United States is asking for too much control over the process. And they complain that Washington, while pushing for more openness, is leading the charge to intimately involve Detroit in the process. French officials "don't accept that businessmen can sit down and set policy," one European regulator said.
Dr. Martinez flew to Geneva last November carrying Washington's Draft Agreement Concerning the Establishing of Global Technical Regulations for Vehicles, Engines and Components, which called for the achievement of "high levels of safety" as well as the reduction of "technical barriers to international trade." It had been revised to address some but not all of the concerns of safety advocates.
For some, its twin goals of safety and trade can conflict. Mr. Snyder, the insurance lawyer, criticized the agreement for not calling for the "highest attainable levels of safety," a point Dr. Martinez called "constructive."
But Ms. Stern, a member of President Clinton's Advisory Committee on Trade Policy and Negotiations, sees no inherent conflict.
Indeed, she questioned the role played by consumer advocates in the United States. In Congressional testimony last September, she cited various "obstacles" to regulatory reform, including "strong grass-roots citizens organizations and their Congressional champions" who achieved legislation that "give ample time for comment, input and representation by any interested party but also have the effect of retarding or even blocking regulatory change."
By moving some rule making to an international setting, Ms. Stern added, corporations on both sides of the Atlantic "have become a chorus to their individual governments so the governments can't run and hide and use many of the excuses governments typically resort to."
In fact, business is not just the chorus, but often in a starring role.
In December 1996, as President Clinton and European Union leaders announced a deal to begin recognizing each other's regulatory systems in several product areas, he thanked "the Trans Atlantic Business Dialogue for their leadership in achieving these agreements."
Then Mr. Clinton responded to a question about the agreement by turning to Dana Mead, the chairman of Tenneco and the co-chair of the dialogue. Mr. Mead, not the President, answered the question.

Since the World Trade Organization was created three years ago, the decades-long effort to expand global trade has shifted from a focus on tariffs to efforts to reduce other types of trade barriers. Consequently, international standards-setting forums -- many of which originated before the W.T.O. -- have taken on a growing importance. But a lot of these groups, mostly consisting of business and government interests, do not have to respond to public comments and have restrictive elegibility requirements for outsiders. Here are some of the issues these global rule makers are dealing with.
 
MOTOR VEHICLES
Standards for energy efficiency, pollution controls, and safety, including brakes, tires and seat belts, are on the table.
 
FOOD SAFETY
Acceptable levels of food additives, lead content in mineral water and pasturization of dairy products are just a few of the hundreds of standards being set by one group.
 
ACCOUNTING
Proper ways to account for derivatives and other financial instruments are being discussed as part of a larger effort to standardize global accounting principles.
 
DRUG APPROVAL
Procedures for conducting drug trials and reporting the results are under review.
 
FINANCIAL SERVICES
Setting minimum standards for how much capital banks must hold in reserve to reduce the risk of a global financial panic is a central element in a broader review of banking regulation.

HEADLINE: Guardian Insurance's Plan Adds to Downtown Rebirth

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
After scouring Manhattan for nearly two years, the Guardian Life Insurance Company of America signed a letter of intent yesterday to move its headquarters and 1,500 employees to 7 Hanover Square in lower Manhattan from Union Square.
If the deal is completed, it would be the first time that Guardian, founded just before the Civil War, has moved outside the Union Square neighborhood. It would also be the largest corporate relocation in at least a decade to lower Manhattan, the beleaguered office district that has staged a remarkable comeback in the last year. 
 Despite the improving economy and relatively cheap rents downtown, the Giuliani administration has agreed to provide the insurance company with a package of tax breaks worth roughly $10 million, according to real estate executives and a city official involved in the negotiations. Although the company's search has focused on Manhattan, Guardian, like many large corporations, had threatened to move to the suburbs.
"This would be in many ways the most important relocation downtown because of the combination of size and the prestige of the company," said Carl Weisbrod, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York. "I'm delighted about the prospects of them moving here."
Peter Hutchings, chief financial officer of Guardian, declined comment, as did the landlord at 7 Hanover Square, the Milstein Organization. Real estate executives familiar with the deal said that Guardian initially would lease 450,000 square feet at 7 Hanover and gradually expand to take over the entire 880,000-square-foot building over the next 10 years.
"Guardian's a great company," Charles Millard, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said in confirming the deal. "This will be great for the continued revitalization of downtown Manhattan."
Founded in 1860 as the Germania Life Insurance Company, the company changed its name to Guardian to avoid marketing problems during World War I. In 1911, the insurance company had built its current headquarters, a Renaissance Revival building at 201 Park Avenue South, just opposite the old Tammany Hall on the corner of 17th Street. The company later added an adjacent annex on 17th Street. Real estate sources said the Guardian, which also leases space in several nearby buildings, is expected to sell its Union Square properties.
Guardian's decision to move downtown follows in the path of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, which recently sold its midtown building and leased 461,000 square feet at 1 World Trade Center. In turn, the vacancy rate in office buildings downtown has fallen to 17.6 percent, from a devastating 25.1 percent in 1995.
Budget watchdogs, as well as some politicians, say that the Giuliani administration should now end its policy of granting tax breaks to large corporations looking for office space. In 1995, the city instituted a series of property tax breaks and zoning changes designed to revive lower Manhattan. Since then, the Giuliani administration has provided additional tax incentives to 12 corporations located downtown that totaled more than $158 million.
"Even in a boom, there's no end to corporate welfare," said Councilwoman Ronnie Eldridge.
In any event, Guardian's pending deal at 7 Hanover Square would bring to an end a game of musical chairs, real estate style, that has come to characterize corporate relocations in Manhattan.
Reliance Insurance, which had been negotiating for months to lease the same space at 7 Hanover Square, was left without a chair yesterday. Just last month, Guardian had scuttled talks to relocate to a far more luxurious site in a proposed new tower called Rockefeller Plaza West, according to two sources involved in the negotiations.
Guardian's decision to go downtown was a disappointment for the Rockefeller Center Development Corporation, which owns the parking lot on Seventh Avenue and 50th Street where it has long wanted to build the new office tower. The company began talks with Guardian last fall, after negotiations foundered with another potential tenant, Bear Stearns & Company.
In late November, Rockefeller executives expected to strike a deal with Guardian and began negotiating to buy unused development rights from the Shubert Organization, which owns the Winter Garden Theater across the street.
City officials intervened, however, suggesting that the Giuliani administration would not provide tax breaks for Guardian and the project unless the Rockefeller company built a musical theater in the tower with the Shuberts, according to people on all sides of the negotiations.
Neither the developer nor the insurance company were very interested in the idea, executives say, because it would have increased the cost of the building and taken longer to build. Guardian eventually broke off talks in December and focused its efforts on 7 Hanover, where the company is expected to have its name emblazoned on the building.
Mr. Millard of the Economic Development Corporation declined comment on those negotiations.
With vacancy rates falling sharply in midtown, Rockefeller executives expect to land an anchor tenant soon.
"Interest in Rockefeller Plaza West is extremely strong, with a number of major corporations looking at the project," said Vincent Silvestri, a spokesman for the Rockefeller Center Development Corporation. "We fully expect to make an announcement this year."

HEADLINE: New Data Suggest Universe Will Expand Forever

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8

 BODY:
Examining the distant light from stars that exploded before the Sun was born, astronomers have determined that the universe has apparently been expanding at a slow, steady rate since the beginning and is destined to expand forever.
The findings, if supported by further observations, suggest the answer to the fundamental question about the fate of the universe: Will it go on expanding, as it has since its creation in a theorized Big Bang? Or will the gravity of its mass eventually bring the universe to a halt, or possibly cause its collapse in a Big Crunch? 
 The new research also means that the universe could be as much as 15 billion years old, thus resolving a paradox posed by earlier findings that suggested an age for the universe that was younger than many of its constituent stars. But some theories about the early universe may have to be reconsidered.
In a remarkable display of agreement for the contentious field of cosmology, two teams of astronomers today reported observations of a certain class of exploding stars, or supernovas, showing that galaxies and other objects about halfway back in cosmic time were receding at velocities comparable to those of objects in more recent epochs. The results were announced at a meeting here of the American Astronomical Society.
"All the indications from our observations of supernovas spanning a large range of distances are that we live in a universe that will expand forever," said the leader of one team, Dr. Saul Perlmutter of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. "Apparently there isn't enough mass in the universe for its gravity to slow the expansion, which started with the Big Bang, to a halt."
Dr. Peter Garnavich of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass., a leader of the other team, said the low deceleration of the expansion rate means that the universe is much older, about 15 billion years old, than had been calculated by some astronomers, whose estimates had ranged as low as 8 billion years. If the universe was not expanding at a faster rate earlier, then it has taken longer for it to reach its present size.
When the astronomers speak of matter in their calculations, they include everything -- ordinary matter that is seen or has not yet been detected, as well as the dark matter that is thought to include exotic particles, the existence of which has only been theorized. Recent research indicates that the mass of such matter is no more than 20 percent to 30 percent of what is considered the critical density needed to hold the expanding universe in check.
In an independent study of the expansion rates of 14 distant radio galaxies, Dr. Ruth A. Daly, a Princeton University astronomer, said "our results are basically almost identical" to those of the Berkeley and Harvard-Smithsonian supernova observations. "We are 95 percent confident that the universe is going to expand forever," Dr. Daly said.
Remarking on the close agreement of the different studies, Dr. Neta A. Bahcall, a Princeton astrophysicist, said this reinforced confidence that the conclusions are correct, or else everyone has overlooked some hidden flaw.
None of the astronomers at a news conference could think of any reasons for skepticism. But they cautioned that many more supernovas would need to be observed in detail before the issue could be resolved and a more precise value placed on estimates of the universe's deceleration.
"The field is moving very quickly," Dr. Perlmutter said at the news conference. He had just returned from the Keck Observatory in Hawaii with more data. By the beginning of the new millennium, he predicted, the extent to which the universe has decelerated, if at all, should be known.
The findings were not entirely unexpected. For more than a year, astronomers have been reluctantly coming to the realization that the universe is lightweight; it has a low mass density. The higher the density, the greater would be the deceleration of the expanding universe. But preliminary studies of distant objects like supernovas had begun to show little, if any deceleration.
The supernovas being studied belong to a class known as Type Ia. Their intrinsic brightness can be determined by how quickly each supernova fades away, making them reliable distance milestones for clocking any deceleration, compared with the expansion velocities of supernovas in more recent times.
Because the light of these supernovas fades in a month or so, astronomers must act quickly to make their measurements. They are using telescopes in Chile, the Canary Islands, Hawaii and Arizona, as well as the Hubble Space Telescope. The Hubble is called upon to study the most distant supernovas, some as far as seven billion light-years away, that are difficult to measure accurately from the ground.
The research confronts theorists with new challenges. A low-density universe does not readily conform to what is known as the inflationary model of the Big Bang theory. According to this model, in its first moments the universe underwent an extremely rapid expansion, then settled down to a more stately pace as it cooled off and gathered matter into stars and galaxies.
One prediction of the inflation model is that the universe should have a critical density. That would be just the right amount of mass to keep it from collapsing of its own weight or expanding into vanishing infinity. At the critical density, expressed as omega-equals-one, the universe would be in a state of equilibrium between collapse and eternal expansion.
If, as it now seems, the universe falls considerably short of critical density, theorists have already begun to add to their equations something called the cosmological constant. This is a kind of theoretical antigravity force -- an energy in the vacuum of space that attenuates the effects of mass gravity. In the absence of sufficient mass -- if omega is less than one -- this force could slow down cosmic expansion to allow for a bigger, older universe.
Like most astronomers who observe the heavens, Dr. Daly said it was now up to particle physicists and cosmologists to "figure out a way to have a cosmological constant, if you want to preserve inflation" as a keystone of their theories explaining the origin and evolution of the universe. Some theorists are already pondering ways that the inflation model could still be compatible with a low-density universe.
"I never underestimate the power of a theorist to come up with a new model," Dr. Perlmutter said.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
Queens Hotel Converted To Complex for Elderly

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
The Midway Hotel, built to accommodate visitors to the New York World's Fair of 1964-65, is a fixture along the Horace Harding Expressway in Queens. Now it is nearing the end of a transformation to rental housing for the elderly.
The $6 million conversion of the hotel, between 108th and Waldron Streets, where Corona abuts Forest Hills, highlights a growing demand for specialized housing for the elderly, whose ranks in New York City, as in the rest of the nation, are increasing. 
 When it reopens on Jan. 18 as the Senior Quarters at Forest Hills, the site will have 150 studio to two-room apartments with hotel-like arrangements. Tenants will receive three kosher meals a day and housekeeping services, as well as help with dressing and taking medication.
Monthly rents range from $1,600 a person for shared accommodations to $3,500 for a private two-room suite. Twenty units, at $3,850 a month, will be reserved for tenants with Alzheimer's disease and related memory disorders.
Senior Quarters is being developed by the AVR Realty Corporation of Yonkers and the Kapson Senior Quarters Corporation of Woodbury, N.Y., which owns or operates 27 such complexes, also known as assisted-living communities, mostly in metropolitan regions.
Forest Hills is the first site in New York City for Kapson, which has three others scheduled to open in the next year, including a 143-unit building in nearby Kew Gardens.
The partners are leasing the seven-story building and two two-story wings around a courtyard in Forest Hills for 99 years from the Alon family of Queens, which owns local hotels. The payments are $1 million a year.
The president of Kapson, Evan A. Kaplan, said the site is accessible from major highways, including the Long Island Expressway, and is in a residential neighborhood, not far from shopping.
The 1990 Census found about 1.26 million people 60 and older in the city, including 385,772, or 30.2 percent, in Queens, the highest concentration in the five boroughs. Of the citywide total, 102,554 were 85 and older.
The City Department for the Aging projects that that segment of the population, the fastest growing, will increase to 164,000 by 2010.
For the frail but healthy elderly, assisted-living residences are a relatively new but growing alternative to nursing homes. Their development has lagged in the city because of high land costs and tight regulations.
That situation is beginning to change. The city has about 12 assisted-living complexes in development. By separating the housing operations from the health services, companies have found that they can avoid the need for state licenses or special permits to establish such projects.
That was the case for Senior Quarters at Forest Hills, among the first luxury complexes in Queens to offer such housing. "It fills a niche for those people who need some support and are no longer able to live alone," the administrator, Fred M. Stock, said.
Mr. Stock said he expected renters to be in their late 70's to mid-80's, with annual incomes of $25,600 to $50,000.
City Councilwoman Helen M. Marshall, whose district includes Corona and Forest Hills, said that the complex would "provide another option that will be good for a certain number of seniors." For many tenants, Ms. Marshall said, the decision is based on economics.
Rose Rothschild, district manager of Community Board 4, which guides growth in the area, added that reaction had been favorable. "It will be a plus for the community," Ms. Rothschild said, "because we have a lot of seniors who need services."
The conversion, which began in June, includes new mechanical systems and elevators, as well as refurbished hallways and landscaping. The common areas have been renovated into a library, a beauty salon, a computer room and an arts-and-crafts center. Two former restaurants will be dining halls.
Apartments, which tenants can rent fully furnished, range from 260 square feet for a studio to 500 square feet for a two-room apartment. That unit has an $800-a-month charge for an additional person.
A Kapson affiliate plans to provide personal-care assistance at extra cost. For aid in grooming, bathing and in taking medication, the charge will be $325 a month. For dressing help, the charge will be $395 monthly.
Since leasing began last summer deposits have been taken on 30 units, according to Mr. Stock.

Fear of Chaos in Indonesia Gives Asia Markets a Jolt
Indonesia's stock market and currency suffered their worst one-day losses ever in a panicky selloff that unnerved investors elsewhere in Asia and reverberated beyond. The selling resulted from fear of economic collapse and political turmoil in the world's fourth-largest country following warnings from Washington that International Monetary Fund aid may be cut off. 
 White House aides said President Clinton called President Suharto of Indonesia to insist that the country put in place commitments to reform its economy. Mr. Clinton also told Mr. Suharto that he would dispatch top Administration officials, including Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, to Jakarta in the next several days. Page A1.

MARKETS TUMBLE AND RUMORS SWEEP INDONESIA CAPITAL

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, Friday, Jan. 9

 BODY:
Fears of economic collapse and political turmoil shook Indonesia Thursday, with the currency and the stock market suffering their worst one-day losses, and with a wave of panic buying that emptied grocery shelves and forced some shops to close early.
The panic was set off by worries that the International Monetary Fund might cut off a nearly $40 billion assistance package after the introduction Tuesday of an Indonesian budget that failed to address many of the nation's urgent needs. 
 These worries also aroused fears of political instability and social unrest in Indonesia, the world's fourth-most-populous country. The military, which recently said it stood ready to quell any violence, issued a statement pleading for calm.
Fear about Indonesia's future was the catalyst for panicky selloffs in other Southeast Asian markets Thursday and again today, helping reinforce a gloomy uncertainty that has prevailed in the region since economic crisis was touched off last summer.
In a reflection of Washington's growing concern, President Clinton called President Suharto of Indonesia Thursday night to insist in a 20-minute phone conversation that his country put in place commitments to reform its economy, according to White House officials. They said Mr. Clinton also told Mr. Suharto he would dispatch a delegation of top Administration officials to the region in the next several days, led by Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary. Page D2.
The same message is likely to be reinforced through the monetary fund, which said Thursday evening that its two top officials, Michel Camdessus and Stanley Fischer, would travel to Jakarta next week. The I.M.F. would "like to accelerate the program and strengthen it," Mr. Fischer said on CNN, "because a lot of people believe the Indonesian Government isn't really committed to the program."
At this point, however, it is unclear what the I.M.F. can do. Many investors are steering clear of Indonesia. "This isn't like South Korea," a senior official of an international organization in Washington said Thursday night. "There is no emergency package up anyone's sleeve."
The unraveling in Indonesia, with many economists predicting a severe recession this year, has become the severest challenge to Mr. Suharto's 32-year rule. News reports and people reached by telephone in Jakarta Thursday said the capital was filled with rumors that the 76-year-old President was ill or that the military was planning to seize power, adding to the sense of panic. Longstanding murmurs that he ought to step down gained in volume.
The rumors were taken seriously, in part because Indonesia has never had a peaceful transition of power since independence in the late 40's.
Mr. Suharto, who is due to be endorsed for a seventh five-year term in March by a mostly handpicked Parliament, came to power in 1965 after quelling an attempted leftist coup. As many as half a million people died in the bloodshed that followed.
A former general, President Suharto has maintained close ties with the military. He has suppressed dissent and kept firm control of all major decisions. He has at the same time based his political legitimacy on a record of economic growth and constantly rising living standards. This record has been seriously damaged for the first time by the economic damage to Indonesia now.
The nation's currency, the rupiah, fell steeply Thursday, touching a record low of 10,550 to the dollar. The rupiah has lost roughly half its value since 1998 began and fallen 75 percent since July, when currencies began dropping to lows in several Asian nations.
Indonesia's stock market also tumbled Thursday, falling at one point by 19 percent but partly rebounding for a 12 percent loss, to the weakest level in four years. In early trading today, Indonesian stocks rose slightly and the rupiah bounced back to 8,000 to the dollar, but trading was volatile and unpredictable.
The extraordinary drop in the value of the rupiah raised a wide range of fears. Without a recovery, the weak currency could demolish the economic assumptions that underlie the I.M.F. rescue package, undermining hopes that the country's slide can be halted.
The rupiah's drop has steeply increased the cost of repaying Indonesia's huge commercial and Government debts. More than half of those are due this year.
It has sharply increased the prices of imports, raising concern that Indonesia will not be able to provide citizens with basic commodities including some food items. This touched off further fears that prices might rise rapidly, or that food rationing might be imposed for the first time in decades. And all of this raised concerns that Mr. Suharto's Government was helpless and that instability and violence could erupt.
The country's unemployment, now at 4.4 million, is predicted to rise by 2 million this year, presenting the possibility of further unrest.
The reaction in the streets Thursday took the form of a surge of panic buying unlike anything seen in Indonesia for decades. "People are afraid that the rupiah is going to keep falling and falling, and that by next week they won't be able to buy anything," an Indonesian businessman said.
"People just went on a buying binge," he said. "Everything from rice and noodles and cooking oil, to batteries and shaving cream and detergent, to television sets and music systems."
A bulk-sales store in the business district of Jakarta called Price Mart was virtually emptied of goods. A huge chain store in east Jakarta called Macro ran out of most of its wares and closed at 4 P.M.
In response, the armed forces issued a statement calling for calm.
"It is easy to say it, but have faith that the Government is trying its best to handle the crisis," said Lieut. Gen. Yunus Yosfiah, head of the military's social and political affairs office.
But the long-term fears of both economic and political crisis could not be so easily allayed.
The economic transformation Mr. Suharto has brought to his 200 million compatriots has muted complaints that include widespread corruption, Government abuses, curtailment of citizens' rights and a widening gap between rich and poor.
Political opposition has been neutralized. Outspoken opponents and journalists have been jailed. Riots have been crushed by force.
Despite increasing pressure for change, Mr. Suharto has been widely expected to choose to stay in office this March. But he is old and infirm, and his refusal to designate a successor has created growing unease over the country's future leadership and prospects for stability.
With control of the economy in question, questions about Mr. Suharto's legitimacy are rising more strongly than ever.
The Thursday tumult was touched off by reported remarks of United States officials, who complained that the new Indonesian budget was inadequate and that the I.M.F. might cut off aid if urgent steps were not taken to tighten the economy.
Both the I.M.F. and foreign analysts and investors had been waiting for the budget announcement to gauge the Government's seriousness in tackling its growing problems.
The budget, which included none of the hoped-for austerity measures, was widely viewed as unrealistically optimistic. Analysts were disappointed that it did not appear to create the budget surplus the I.M.F. has demanded as a key condition for continued aid.
Despite widespread predictions of a recession, it envisions a growth rate of 4 percent this year, and rather than cutting spending, increases it by 24 percent.
It predicts just 9 percent inflation, a figure that economists say is impossibly low, and it is based on an exchange rate of 4,000 rupiah to the dollar, whicha forecast that now seems painfully unrealistic.

Clinton Phones Suharto, Insisting on Commitment to I.M.F. Plan

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8

 BODY:
In a measure of Washington's growing concern that the Asian crisis is worsening, President Clinton called President Suharto of Indonesia tonight to insist that his country put in place commitments to overhaul its economy, White House officials said.
Aides to Mr. Clinton gave few details of the 20-minute conversation, which took place shortly after 9 P.M., when Mr. Clinton was aboard Air Force One en route to Texas. But a senior Administration official said that "the President made it quite clear that the I.M.F. program has to be followed." That International Monetary Fund program calls for a series of politically painful measures, and threatens the multi-billion dollar business empire owned by Mr. Suharto's family and close friends. 
 The White House would not say how Mr. Suharto responded to Mr. Clinton's comments. In recent days, however, officials in the Administration and the International Monetary Fund said they did not know whether the Indonesian leader had a clear understanding of how close his country's economy was to the precipice. In Jakarta on Friday, the Government said Mr. Suharto appreciated Mr. Clinton's call and that he remained committed to the I.M.F. program.
Mr. Clinton also told Mr. Suharto, officials said, that he was sending a delegation of top officials led by Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, to the region in the next several days. He will be accompanied, they said, by State Department officials and members of the National Security Council. Defense Secretary William S. Cohen will also be stopping in Indonesia next week, on a previously scheduled mission.
"They will be there to discuss our views and the President's views and to hear back," the Administration official said.
In a statement released by the White House tonight, the President's press secretary, Michael McCurry, said the call was made because "the United States has significant national security and economic interests in a stable and prosperous Asia Pacific."
Mr. Clinton's call to President Suharto was the second time in six weeks that Mr. Clinton has directly intervened with a foreign leader in an effort to contain the Asian crisis.
On Thanksgiving, Mr. Clinton called President Kim Young Sam of South Korea to deliver the message that Korean banks were on the brink of default -- and that Mr. Kim had to move swiftly to calm the markets and restore confidence in his Government.
The call, kept secret at the time, ultimately led to a series of new commitments by South Korea, and an agreement among the United States and its allies to provide speedier financial aid to help the country meet a crushing load of short-term debt.
To be sure, the Korean situation is fundamentally different from Indonesia's.
South Korea is home to 37,000 American troops, so Washington has a strategic rationale to prevent its financial collapse.
But the Adminstration is clearly worried that with no clear successor to the ailing Mr. Suharto, who is 76, the financial crisis in Indonesia could accelerate a power struggle. Any such maneuvering would almost certainly involve the powerful Indonesian military.
"People are worried about another 1965," one senior Administration official said today, a reference to the coup and ethnic violence that cost an estimated half-million lives when Mr. Suharto took power.

Senate Passes Bill On Rent-to-Own Stores

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
The State Senate approved legislation yesterday that proponents said would prevent businesses that rent household goods and electronic equipment from taking advantage of consumers.
Opponents said the bill would legitimize usury by allowing the so-called rent-to-own industry to charge consumers who wind up buying the items interest rates that can run up to 100 percent. 
 The Assembly is scheduled to vote on the bill on Monday.
The measure would apply to businesses that let customers apply rental costs and fees to the purchase of the products at the end of the rental periods. The state has 56 such businesses, mostly in low-income areas.
The bill would require written agreements for rent-to-own transactions. The agreements and the information with the product would have to inform the customer about comparable retail prices and the total cost of the product. Brad Denison, vice president of Thorn Americas Inc., which operates 17 rent-to-own stores in New Jersey under the name of Rent-a-Center, said the bill would bring New Jersey in line with 45 other states that have similar laws.
But the president of the Consumer League of New Jersey, Neil Fogarty, noted that the stores would not be required to disclose the total amount of interest.

Newark Airport Record: A Million Tons of Cargo

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
The volume of cargo passing through Newark International Airport exceeded one million tons for the first time last year, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said yesterday.
The estimate was 1.05 million tons, up from 976,000 in 1996, a spokesman for the agency, Bill Cahill, said. He attributed the increase to the marketing of the airport, a strong economy and the increased use of services like Federal Express and United Parcel Service. 
 The volume at Kennedy International Airport was a record 1.7 million tons, an increase of 40,000 tons over 1996, he added.

HEADLINE: HOUSE OF GRAFT: Tracing the Bhutto Millions -- A special report.;
Bhutto Clan Leaves Trail of Corruption

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS; Jeff Gerth in Washington and Elizabeth G. Olson in Geneva contributed reporting for these articles.

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan

 BODY:
A decade after she led this impoverished nation from military rule to democracy, Benazir Bhutto is at the heart of a widening corruption inquiry that Pakistani investigators say has traced more than $100 million to foreign bank accounts and properties controlled by Ms. Bhutto's family.
Starting from a cache of Bhutto family documents bought for $1 million from a shadowy intermediary, the investigators have detailed a pattern of secret payments by foreign companies that sought favors during Ms. Bhutto's two terms as Prime Minister. 
 The documents leave uncertain the degree of involvement by Ms. Bhutto, a Harvard graduate whose rise to power in 1988 made her the first woman to lead a Muslim country. But they trace the pervasive role of her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, who turned his marriage to Ms. Bhutto into a source of virtually unchallengeable power.
In 1995, a leading French military contractor, Dassault Aviation, agreed to pay Mr. Zardari and a Pakistani partner $200 million for a $4 billion jet fighter deal that fell apart only when Ms. Bhutto's Government was dismissed. In another deal, a leading Swiss company hired to curb customs fraud in Pakistan paid millions of dollars between 1994 and 1996 to offshore companies controlled by Mr. Zardari and Ms. Bhutto's widowed mother, Nusrat.
In the largest single payment investigators have discovered, a gold bullion dealer in the Middle East was shown to have deposited at least $10 million into an account controlled by Mr. Zardari after the Bhutto Government gave him a monopoly on gold imports that sustained Pakistan's jewelry industry. The money was deposited into a Citibank account in the United Arab Emirate of Dubai, one of several Citibank accounts for companies owned by Mr. Zardari.
Together, the documents provided an extraordinarily detailed look at high-level corruption in Pakistan, a nation so poor that perhaps 70 percent of its 130 million people are illiterate, and millions have no proper shelter, no schools, no hospitals, not even safe drinking water. During Ms. Bhutto's five years in power, the economy became so enfeebled that she spent much of her time negotiating new foreign loans to stave off default on $62 billion in public debt.
A worldwide search for properties secretly bought by the Bhutto family is still in its early stages. But the inquiry has already found that Mr. Zardari went on a shopping spree in the mid-1990's, purchasing among other things a $4 million, 355-acre estate south of London. In 1994 and 1995, he used a Swiss bank account and an American Express card to buy jewelry worth $660,000 -- including $246,000 at Cartier Inc. and Bulgari Corp. in Beverly Hills, Calif., in barely a month.
In separate interviews in Karachi, Ms. Bhutto, 44, and Mr. Zardari, 42, declined to address specific questions about the Pakistani inquiry, which they dismissed as a political vendetta by Ms. Bhutto's successor as Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif. In Karachi Central Prison, where he has been held for 14 months on charges of murdering Ms. Bhutto's brother, Mr. Zardari described the corruption allegations as part of a "meaningless game." But he offered no challenge to the authenticity of the documents tracing some of his most lucrative deals.
Ms. Bhutto originally kindled wild enthusiasms in Pakistan with her populist politics, then suffered a heavy loss of support as the corruption allegations gained credence. In an interview at her fortresslike home set back from Karachi's Arabian Sea beachfront, she was by turns tearful and defiant. "Most of those documents are fabricated," she said, "and the stories that have been spun around them are absolutely wrong."
But she refused to discuss any of the specific deals outlined in the documents, and did not explain how her husband had paid for his property and jewelry. Lamenting what she described as "the irreparable damage done to my standing in the world" by the corruption inquiry, she said her family had inherited wealth, although not on the scale implied by tales of huge bank deposits and luxury properties overseas.
"I mean, what is poor and what is rich?" Ms. Bhutto asked. "If you mean, am I rich by European standards, do I have a billion dollars, or even a hundred million dollars, even half that, no, I do not. But if you mean that I'm ordinary rich, yes, my father had three children studying at Harvard as undergraduates at the same time. But this wealth never meant anything to my brothers or me."
 
The Student
Privileged Learning, Populist Platitudes
Ms. Bhutto, a student at Harvard and Oxford for six years in the 1970's, has always presented herself as a tribune of the dispossessed. In a Harvard commencement speech in 1989, she said that "avaricious politicans" had looted developing countries and left them without the means to tackle their social problems. Since she was ousted as Prime Minister during her second term, on Nov. 5, 1996, on charges that included gross corruption, she has been the leader of Pakistan's main opposition group, the Pakistan People's Party.
Some details of the allegations against Ms. Bhutto and Mr. Zardari appeared in European and American newspapers last fall, after Pakistani investigators began releasing some of the Bhutto family documents. But a much fuller picture emerged when several thick binders full of documents were made available to The New York Times over a period of several days in October. The Times's own investigation, lasting three months, extended from Pakistan to the Middle East, Europe and the United States, and included interviews with many of the central figures named by the Pakistani investigators.
Officials leading the inquiry in Pakistan say that the $100 million they have identified so far is only a small part of a windfall from corrupt activities. They maintain that an inquiry begun in Islamabad just after Ms. Bhutto's dismissal in 1996 found evidence that her family and associates generated more than $1.5 billion in illicit profits through kickbacks in virtually every sphere of government activity -- from rice deals, to the sell-off of state land, even rake-offs from state welfare schemes.
The Pakistani officials say their key break came last summer, when an informer offered to sell documents that appeared to have been taken from the Geneva office of Jens Schlegelmilch, whom Ms. Bhutto described as the family's attorney in Europe for more than 20 years, and as a close personal friend. Pakistani investigators have confirmed that the original asking price for the documents was $10 million. Eventually the seller traveled to London and concluded the deal for $1 million in cash.
The identity of the seller remains a mystery. Mr. Schlegelmilch, 55, developed his relationship with the Bhutto family through links between his Iranian-born wife and Ms. Bhutto's mother, who was also born in Iran. In a series of telephone interviews, he declined to say anything about Mr. Zardari and Ms. Bhutto, other than that he had not sold the documents. "It wouldn't be worth selling out for $1 million," he said.
The documents included: statements for several accounts in Switzerland, including the Citibank accounts in Dubai and Geneva; letters from executives promising payoffs, with details of the percentage payments to be made; memorandums detailing meetings at which these "commissions" and "remunerations" were agreed on, and certificates incorporating the offshore companies used as fronts in the deals, many registered in the British Virgin Islands.
The documents also revealed the crucial role played by Western institutions. Apart from the companies that made payoffs, and the network of banks that handled the money -- which included Barclay's Bank and Union Bank of Switzerland as well as Citibank -- the arrangements made by the Bhutto family for their wealth relied on Western property companies, Western lawyers and a network of Western friends.
As striking as some of the payoff deals was the clinical way in which top Western executives concluded them. The documents showed painstaking negotiations over the payoffs, followed by secret contracts. In one case, involving Dassault, the contract specified elaborate arrangements intended to hide the proposed payoff for the fighter plane deal, and to prevent it from triggering French corruption laws.
Because Pakistan's efforts to uncover the deals have been handled in recent months by close aides of Prime Minister Sharif, who has alternated with Ms. Bhutto at the head of four civilian Governments in Pakistan since the end of military rule 10 years ago, the investigation has been deeply politicized. Last week, the Sharif aides forwarded 12 corruption cases cases against Ms. Bhutto, Mr. Zardari and Nusrat Bhutto, 68, to the country's "accountability commission," headed by a retired judge, who has the power to approve formal indictments.
Apart from bolstering Mr. Sharif's power by exposing Ms. Bhutto, Mr. Sharif's aides hope to protect him against the possibility that she will one day return to office and turn the tables on him. Mr. Sharif, who is 48, battled for years during Ms. Bhutto's tenure to stay out of jail on a range of corruption charges, including allegations that he took millions of dollars in unsecured loans from state-owned banks for his family's steel empire, then defaulted.
 
The Heritage
Landowning Class Accustomed to Rule
The Bhuttos are among a few hundred so-called feudal families, mostly large landowners, that have dominated politics and business in Pakistan since its creation in 1947.
Ms. Bhutto's father was an Oxford-educated landowner who became Pakistan's Prime Minister in the 1970's, only to be ousted and jailed in 1977 when his military chief, Gen. Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, mounted a coup. Mr. Bhutto was hanged two years later, after he refused General Zia's offer of clemency for a murder conviction that many Pakistanis regarded as politically tainted.
Benazir Bhutto, the eldest of four children, spent the next decade under house arrest, in jail or in self-imposed exile, campaigning against General Zia's military regime.
In 1987 she married Mr. Zardari, little known then for anything but a passion for polo. It was an arranged union, with Ms. Bhutto's mother picking the groom. Many Pakistanis were startled by the social and financial differences. By the Bhuttos' standards, Mr. Zardari's family was of modest means, with limited holdings and a rundown movie theater in Karachi. Mr. Zardari's only experience of higher education was a stint at a commercial college in London.
In part the match was intended to protect Ms. Bhutto's political career by countering conservative Muslims' grumbling about her unmarried status. Barely eight months later, in 1988, General Zia was killed in a mysterious plane crash, which opened the way for Ms. Bhutto to win a narrow election victory.
Years later, many Pakistanis still speak of the mesmeric effect she had at that moment, as the daughter who had avenged her father and the politician who had restored democracy. But euphoria faded fast. Within months, newspapers were headlining allegations of dubious deals. In the bazaars, traders soon dubbed Mr. Zardari "Mr. 10 Percent."
Twenty months after she took office, Ms. Bhutto was dismissed by Pakistan's President on grounds of corruption and misrule. But the Sharif Government that succeeded Ms. Bhutto was unable to secure any convictions against her or her husband before Mr. Sharif, in turn, was ousted from office, also for corruption and misrule.
Mostly, Pakistanis gave Ms. Bhutto the benefit of the doubt after her first term, saying she might not have known what Mr. Zardari was doing. She was further aided by public suspicion of Mr. Sharif's motives. A taciturn man who got his start in politics as a protege of General Zia, Mr. Sharif has left little doubt of his chagrin at having been overshadowed by Ms. Bhutto.
Part of his discomfort stemmed from her success in fostering a favorable image for herself in the United States, as a staunch foe of Muslim fundamentalism, a relentless campaigner for the rights of the poor and -- a point she stressed in her Harvard speech in 1989 -- an opponent of leaders who use their power for personal gain, then "leave the cupboard bare."
When she took office as Prime Minister again, after a victory in 1993, Ms. Bhutto struck many of her friends as a changed person, obsessed with her dismissal in 1990, high-handed to the point of arrogance, and contemptuous of the liberal principles she had placed at the center of her politics in the 1980's. "She no longer made the distinction between the Bhuttos and Pakistan," said Hussain Haqqani, Ms. Bhutto's former press secretary. "In her mind, she was Pakistan, so she could do as she pleased."
Ms. Bhutto's twin posts, as Prime Minister and Finance Minister, gave her virtually free rein. Mr. Zardari became her alter ego, riding roughshod over the bureaucracy although he had no formal economic powers until Ms. Bhutto appointed him Investment Minister, reporting only to herself, in July 1996. They maintained an imperial lifestyle in the new Prime Minister's residence in Islamabad, a $50 million mansion set on 110 acres on an Islamabad hilltop.
Within weeks of moving in, Mr. Zardari ordered 11.5 acres of protected woodland on an adjoining hilltop to be bulldozed for a polo field, an exercise track, stabling for 40 polo ponies, quarters for grooms and a parking lot for spectators. When a senior Government official, Mohammed Mehdi, objected to paying for the project with $1.3 million diverted from a budget for parks and other public amenities, Mr. Zardari "categorically told me that he does not appreciate his orders to be examined and questioned by any authority," according to an affidavit filed with the Pakistani investigators by Mr. Mehdi. A few months later, with the work in progress, Mr. Zardari had Mr. Mehdi dismissed.
The investigators say that Mr. Zardari and associates he brought into the Government, some of them old school friends, began reviewing state programs for opportunities to make money. It was these broader activities, the investigators assert, more than the relatively small number of foreign deals revealed in the documents taken from the Swiss lawyer, that netted the largest sums for the Bhutto family.
Among the transactions Mr. Zardari exploited, according to these officials: defense contracts; power plant projects; the privatization of state-owned industries; the awarding of broadcast licenses; the granting of an export monopoly for the country's huge rice harvest; the purchase of planes for Pakistan International Airlines; the assignment of textile export quotas; the granting of oil and gas permits; authorizations to build sugar mills, and the sale of government lands.
The officials have said that Ms. Bhutto and Mr. Zardari took pains to avoid creating a documentary record of their role in hundreds of deals. How this was done was explained by Najam Sethi, a former Bhutto loyalist who became the editor of Pakistan's most popular political weekly, Friday Times, then was drafted to help oversee a corruption inquiry undertaken by the caretaker Government that ruled for three months after Ms. Bhutto's dismissal in 1996.
Mr. Sethi said Ms. Bhutto and Mr. Zardari adopted a system under which they assigned favors by writing orders on yellow Post-It notes and attaching them to official files. After the deals were completed, Mr. Sethi said, the notes were removed, destroying all trace of involvement.
When Mr. Sharif won a landslide election victory earlier this year, the corruption inquiry appeared, again, to fizzle. But a few days before the election, the caretakers hired Jules Kroll Associates, a New York investigative agency, to look for evidence of corruption abroad. The Kroll investigators put out feelers in Europe; Mr. Sharif's aides said it was one of these that produced the offer to sell the Bhutto family documents, and that they took over from Kroll Associates and completed the deal.
 
The Negotiations
Flight and Crash Of a Dassault Deal
Potentially the most lucrative deal uncovered by the documents involved the effort by Dassault Aviation, the French military contractor, to sell Pakistan 32 Mirage 2000-5 fighter planes. These were to replace two squadrons of American-made F-16's whose purchase was blocked when the Bush Administration determined in 1990 that Pakistan was covertly developing nuclear weapons.
In April 1995, Dassault found itself in arm's-length negotiations with Mr. Zardari and Amer Lodhi, a Paris-based lawyer and banker who had lived for years in the United States, working among other things as an executive of the now-defunct Bank of Commerce and Credit International. Mr. Lodhi's sister, Maleeha, a former Pakistan newspaper editor, became Ms. Bhutto's Ambassador to the United States in 1994.
Mr. Schlegelmilch, the Geneva lawyer, wrote a memo for his files describing his talks at Dassault's headquarters on the Champs-Elysees in Paris. According to the memo, the company's executives offered a "remuneration" of 5 percent to Marleton Business S.A., an offshore company controlled by Mr. Zardari. The memo indicated that in addition to Dassault, the payoff would be made by two companies involved in the manufacture of the Mirages: Snecma, an engine manufacturer, and Thomson-CSF, a maker of aviation electronics.
The documents offered intriguing insights into the anxieties that the deal aroused. In a letter faxed to Geneva, the Dassault executives -- Jean-Claude Carrayrou, Dassault's director of legal affairs, and Pierre Chouzenoux, the international sales manager -- wrote that "for reasons of confidentiality," there would be only one copy of the contract guaranteeing the payoff. It would be kept at Dassault's Paris office, available to Mr. Schlegelmilch only during working hours.
The deal reached with Mr. Schlegelmilch reflected concerns about French corruption laws, which forbid bribery of French officials but permit payoffs to foreign officials, and even make the payoffs tax-deductible in France. The Swiss and the French have resisted American pressures to sign a worldwide treaty that would hold all businesses to the ethical standards of American law, which sets criminal penalties for bribing foreign officials.
"It is agreed that no part of the above-mentioned remuneration will be transferred to a French citizen, or to any company directly or indirectly controlled by French individuals or companies, or to any beneficiary of a resident or nonresident bank account in France," one of the Dassault documents reads.
Negotiations on the Mirage contract were within weeks of completion when Ms. Bhutto was dismissed by another Pakistani President in 1996. They have bogged down since, partly because Pakistan has run out of money to buy the planes, and partly because the Pakistan Army, still politically powerful a decade after the end of military rule, waited until Ms. Bhutto was removed to weigh in against the purchase.
A Dassault spokesman, Jean-Pierre Robillard, said Mr. Carrayrou, the legal affairs director, had retired. Two weeks after he was sent a summary of the documents, Mr. Robillard said that the company had decided to make no comment.
 
The Profits
Scams at Both Ends Of Customs System
One deal that appears to have made a handsome profit for Mr. Zardari involved Pakistan's effort to increase its customs revenues. Since fewer than one in every 100 Pakistanis pays income tax, customs revenues represent the state's largest revenue source. But for decades the system has been corrupted, with businesses underinvoicing imports, or paying bribes, to escape duties.
In the 1980's Pakistan came under pressure from the International Monetary Fund to increase government revenues and to cut a runaway budget deficit. During Ms. Bhutto's first term, Pakistan entrusted preshipment "verification" of all major imports to two Swiss companies with blue-ribbon reputations, Societe Generale de Surveillance S.A. and a subsidiary, Cotecna Inspection S.A. But the documents suggest that this stab at improving Pakistan's fiscal soundness was quickly turned to generating profits for the Bhutto family's accounts.
In 1994, executives of the two Swiss companies wrote promising to pay "commissions" totaling 9 percent to three offshore companies controlled by Mr. Zardari and Nusrat Bhutto. A Cotecna letter in June 1994 was direct: "Should we receive, within six months of today, a contract for inspection and price verification of goods imported into Pakistan," it read, "we will pay you 6 percent of the total amount invoiced and paid to the Government of Pakistan for such a contract and during the whole duration of that contract and its renewal."
Similar letters, dated March and June 1994, were sent by Societe Generale de Surveillance promising "consultancy fees" of 6 percent and 3 percent to two other offshore companies controlled by the Bhutto family. According to Pakistani investigators, the two Swiss companies inspected more than $15.4 billion in imports into Pakistan from January 1995 to March 1997, making more than $131 million. The investigators estimated that the Bhutto family companies made $11.8 million from the deals, at least a third of which showed up in banking documents taken from the Swiss lawyer.
For Societe Generale de Surveillance, with 35,000 employees and more than $2 billion a year in earnings, the relationship with the Bhutto family has been painful. In addition to doing customs inspections, the company awards certificates of technical quality. In effect, its business is integrity.
In an interview in Geneva, Elisabeth Salina Amorini, president of Societe Generale, said the Pakistan contracts had been the subject of an internal company inquiry. But Ms. Salina Amorini, a 42-year-old lawyer, said the company had reorganized its government contracts division under a new executive and had sold Cotecna, acquired in 1994, back to the family that had previously owned it. The internal inquiry, she told reporters in Geneva last month, had shown "a number of inadequacies which enabled certain irregularities to take place."
Ms. Salina Amorini said in the interview that a study of Societe Generale's dealings with Pakistan had uncovered a $650 million shortfall in customs revenues that the Bhutto Government was supposed to have collected over a 21-month period in 1995 and 1996. She said the company had reported the shortfall to Washington-based officials of the monetary fund and the World Bank, which monitor customs revenues to check Pakistan's compliance with conditions set for emergency loans. The conditions are meant to help the country avoid default on its foreign debt.
Officials at the two financial institutions are investigating the Swiss company's report to determine whether the customs system was corrupted at both ends -- from commissions paid to Bhutto family companies on the preshipment inspection contracts and, later, in illicit payments by Pakistani importers seeking to avoid the customs duties that the Swiss companies had determined they owed.
 
The Gold Connection
Granting a License, Reaping a Profit
Pakistan's Arabian Sea coast, stretching from Karachi to the border with Iran, has long been a gold smugglers' haven. Until the beginning of Ms. Bhutto's second term, the trade, running into hundreds of millions of dollars a year, was unregulated, with slivers of gold called biscuits, and larger weights in bullion, carried on planes and boats that travel between the Persian Gulf and the largely unguarded Pakistani coast.
Shortly after Ms. Bhutto returned as Prime Minister in 1993, a Pakistani bullion trader in Dubai, Abdul Razzak Yaqub, proposed a deal: in return for a license to import gold, Mr. Razzak would help the Government regularize the trade.
In January 1994, weeks after Ms. Bhutto began her second term, Mr. Schlegelmilch established a British Virgin Island company known as Capricorn Trading, S.A., with Mr. Zardari as its principal owner. Nine months later, on Oct. 5, 1994, an account was opened at the Dubai offices of Citibank in the name of Capricorn Trading. The same day, a Citibank deposit slip for the account shows a deposit of $5 million by Mr. Razzak's company, ARY Traders. Two weeks later, another Citibank deposit slip showed that ARY had paid a further $5 million.
In November 1994, Pakistan's Commerce Ministry wrote to Mr. Razzak informing him that he had been granted a license that made him, for at least the next two years, Pakistan's sole authorized gold importer. In an interview in his office in Dubai, Mr. Razzak acknowedged that he had used the license to import more than $500 million in gold into Pakistan, and that he had traveled to Islamabad several times to meet with Ms. Bhutto and Mr. Zardari. But he denied that there had been any secret deal. "I have not paid a single cent to Zardari," he said.
Mr. Razzak offered an unusual explanation for the Citibank documents that showed his company paying the $10 million to Mr. Zardari, suggesting that someone in Pakistan who wished to destroy his reputation had contrived to have his company wrongly identified as the depositor of the money. "Somebody in the bank has cooperated with my enemies to make false documents," he said.
 
The Documentation
Erasing the Proofs Of Secret Power
The Pakistani investigation of Ms. Bhutto's two terms in office has tied a range of overseas properties to her husband and other family members. Among these are Rockwood, a 355-acre estate south of London, and a $2.5 million country manor in Normandy. The listed owners of the manor, which is known as the House of the White Queen, are Hakim and Zarrin Zardari.
Other properties that Pakistani investigators have linked to members of the Bhutto family include a string of luxury apartments in London. Pakistan has asked the United States Justice Department to investigate still more bank accounts and properties, including a country club and a polo ranch in Palm Beach County, Florida, said to be worth about $4 million, that were bought by associates of Mr. Zardari in the mid-1990's.
The Pakistani request to Washington, made in December, also sought help in checking allegations that some of Mr. Zardari's wealth may have come from Pakistani drug traffickers paying for protection. In the past decade, Pakistan and its neighbor Afghanistan have become the world's largest source of heroin, shipping 250 tons of it every year to Europe and the United States.
The purchase of overseas properties by well-connected members of the elite in a developing country is hardly a new phenomenon. But the disclosures about Ms. Bhutto's family have underscored a trend that international financial officials have long found troubling: the willingness of the monetary fund and the World Bank to prop up economies like Pakistan's that have been bled dry by corruption.
A former high-ranking official of the World Bank in Islamabad who requested anonymity acknowledged that both institutions were all too willing to make additional loans on the vague promise that corruption would be reined in. "We made a mantra out of the phrase 'good governance,' " the official said, "as though we intended to try and stamp the corruption out. But the truth is that we turned a blind eye."
In the years Ms. Bhutto was in office, Pakistan received billions of dollars in new loans, mostly to enable it to pay interest on its debt. By 1996, interest on the accumulated public debt, including $32 billion in foreign loans, was absorbing nearly 70 percent of state revenues. With Pakistan's defense costs absorbing the remaining 30 percent, scarcely anything was left for the social programs that Ms. Bhutto had promised.
While the Times inquiry confirmed some of the allegations made by the Pakistani investigators, other matters remained unresolved. For example, none of the documents for the foreign bank accounts or offshore companies uncovered thus far bear Ms. Bhutto's name, nor do any of the letters promising payoffs make any mention of her.
The only document that refers to Ms. Bhutto is a handwritten ledger for an account at the Union Bank of Switzerland in Geneva. In Mr. Schlegelmilch's handwriting, the ledger contains the notation "50% AAZ 50 % BB." This account showed deposits of $1.8 million for one 90-day period in 1994 and received at least $860,000 in payments by the two Swiss customs-inspection companies.
Some of Ms. Bhutto's friends say she cannot fairly be held accountable for her husband's questionable deals, since she was too busy as Prime Minister to know of them. Others say Ms. Bhutto, having lost her father and both of her brothers in tragic circumstances, became overdependent emotionally on Mr. Zardari.
Her younger brother, Shahnawaz, died of poisoning in Cannes, France, in 1985 after a dispute that Murtaza Bhutto, her older brother, linked to arguments over family assets stashed in Switzerland. Murtaza Bhutto was killed in September 1986 after a long-running power struggle with his sister and her husband. Mr. Zardari has been charged with masterminding the second murder, but he and Ms. Bhutto say he was framed.
Officials say Mr. Zardari made no attempt to disguise his activities from his wife, holding meetings on some of his deals in the Prime Minister's residence, and invoking his wife's authority when ordering officials to override regulations meant to prevent graft in the assignment of contracts.
Furthermore, several senior officials in Ms. Bhutto's Governments said they had met with repeated rebuffs when they tried to warn her about Mr. Zardari. One senior minister said that when he had raised the issue, "She said, 'How dare you talk to me like that?' and stalked out."
Nor has Ms. Bhutto made any effort to distance herself from Mr. Zardari. In the Karachi interview, she said her husband's deals had been made only for Pakistan's benefit. "He's a very generous person," she said. "His weakness, and his strength, is that he's always trying to help people."

The Jobless Rate Rises in Germany

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Jan. 9

 BODY:
Germany's jobless rate unexpectedly rose to a postwar high of 11.9 percent in December, casting doubt on the pace of the country's economic recovery.
Unemployment rose for a ninth consecutive month, fueled by layoffs in eastern Germany's construction industry. The jobless rate climbed from 11.8 percent in November, the Bundesbank said. Analysts had predicted the rate would be unchanged. 
Jobless rolls rose 20,000, to 4.55 million, the Federal Labor Office said, more than the expected gain of 5,000.
Germany's inability to put people to work is in contrast to the United States, which also reported on employment today. The United States unemployment rate for December was only 4.7 percent.
In western Germany, unemployment rose by 4,000 instead of falling by 3,000, as analysts had expected. In the west, "the likely pace of improvement in early 1998 is under pressure," Klaus Baader, an economist at Lehman Brothers in London, said. Unemployment in eastern Germany rose by 16,000.

HEADLINE: 370,000 Jobs Added to Rolls In December

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Riding a strong economy, the nation's employers added 370,000 new jobs to their payrolls last month -- far beyond expectations -- and at year's end, employment reached record levels, the Labor Department reported yesterday.
Not since the Government began to compile employment numbers, starting in 1948, has such a large percentage of Americans worked: 64.1 percent in December, having reached 64 percent for the first time in November, up from 63.2 percent in 1996. Immigrants, students, men and women over 55, and younger women are swelling payrolls, drawn to jobs at a moment when they are relatively easy to get -- and because people need money. Many new workers are single mothers or second earners in a family. 
 "The American labor supply is not bottomless," said Richard Freeman, a Harvard labor economist, "but it is very flexible, and particularly at a time when families need more income."
The rapid job growth, totaling 3.2 million for the year, coupled with the low unemployment rate, only 4.9 percent on average for all of 1997 -- the lowest level since 1973 -- should be raising cries on Wall Street of rising inflation from too much economic growth. But the reaction yesterday was just the opposite. Interest rates, which usually go up on fears of inflation, fell instead, along with stock prices, as the Asian crisis overshadowed the employment report.
"This is really a case of a strong domestic economy versus the drag from Asia," said William Dudley, chief domestic economist for Goldman, Sachs & Company. "But the markets for the moment seem exclusively focused on the drag from Asia."
Others argued that while the economy is strong now, it seems likely to slow by summer, and that will show in the employment figures. "The focus is shifting to the damage that Asia can do to the economy this year and next," said David M. Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a Wall Street bond house.
Total employment rose to 123.88 million in December from 120.67 million last January, with one-third of the growth coming in the last three months. November alone produced 412,000 new jobs, the high for the year. The unemployment rate, which started 1997 at 5.3 percent, finished at 4.7 percent, up one-tenth of a percentage point in December from November's level.
A similar fall in the unemployment rate in the late 1980's, to a little more than 5 percent, produced a noticeable rise in wages, and many economists argued that employers, faced with labor shortages, bid up wages. This time wages have also risen, but only mildly, although the unemployment rate is even lower. The average hourly wage for production workers rose only 1 cent in December, to $12.48. It was up 3.7 percent for the year.
A broader statistic, the median weekly wage for full-time workers, considered by many economists a more reliable measure of wage pressure, is up only 2.3 percent through the third quarter, roughly in line with the inflation rate and hardly enough, economists say, to cause employers to raise prices to cover rising wage costs. "The wage pressure is modest and gradual," Labor Secretary Alexis M. Herman said. "It is very much in line with prices and productivity."
Economists offer several reasons why wage pressures now are less than in past periods of low unemployment. Job insecurity figures on the list, as well as competition from lower-wage workers abroad. But changes in the nature of the work force and in the mix of workers are also significant.
The temporary work force, for example, draws millions of people quickly back into jobs almost as fast as they become unemployed.
"The temporary help agencies like Manpower Inc. serve as labor market brokers," said Lawrence Katz, a Harvard labor economist. Nearly 15 percent of new job growth in recent years has been for temporary workers, a category that barely existed two decades ago.
Welfare recipients are also easing the strain. The percentage of women with children on welfare who do not work at all has fallen to about 10 percent from 19.4 percent in 1991, according to a new study by Jeffrey B. Liebman, a labor economist at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.
The two-earner family is playing a role in swelling the labor force. The percentage of married couples in which the husband and wife both work full time has risen to 29.5 percent from 26.3 percent in 1989, the Census Bureau reports. Young women, age 20 to 24, are jumping into jobs at a much faster rate than men that age, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics reports. And the percentage of men and women 55 to 64 holding jobs has risen by nearly two percentage points for women in the last year and one point for men.
"All these trends are increasingly evident since 1993," said Charles Nelsen, a Census Bureau official. "I assume it is because the labor market is so much easier to enter."
Since January 1993, more than 14 million new jobs have been added to the work force, with 22 percent of them coming in 1997. The job creation in December, and during the year as a whole, was across the board. Even manufacturing jobs, a normally declining category, rose in 1997, growing by 39,000 in last month and 230,000 for the year as a whole. Rising exports of manufactured goods have helped to increase employment, some economists say.
Personnel services, mostly temporary workers, was another big gainer, growing by 45,000 last month and 107,000 for the year. Computer technicians -- programmers and the like -- were in great demand, adding 17,000 in December and 162,000 for the year. The fastest-growing category was retailing -- up 52,000 workers in December, and 513,000 for the year, or 16 percent of the year's total job growth. Construction employment was another big gainer, adding 50,000 people in December and 209,000 for the year.
The job growth data are gathered from a survey of employers, while the unemployment rate comes from a monthly survey of 55,000 households. That survey listed 6.4 million people as actively but unsuccessfully seeking work, and therefore unemployed. That was up from 6.3 million in November. Those who neither hold jobs nor seek them are considered outside the labor force.

Collapse of Equity Sale Leaves Peregrine Investments in Crisis

BYLINE: International Herald Tribune 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Jan. 9

 BODY:
A swashbuckling symbol of the Asian boom of the 1990's, the Hong Kong investment bank Peregrine Investments Ltd., was fighting for its life today after the collapse of a deal to sell a $200 million minority stake to Switzerland's Zurich Insurance Company.
Stung by losses in Asia's stock, bond and currency markets since the onset of the economic crisis last July, Peregrine is now faced with trying to find another suitor to inject badly needed funds. 
 Hong Kong regulators immediately announced they had suspended the stock exchange membership of Peregrine, one of the largest Asian investment banks outside Japan. Officials said they would restrict the company's business in the interest of the investing public.
Unlike its larger global competitors, Peregrine is a purely Asian undertaking, with no big American or European business to cushion the blows taken at home.
The Peregrine news heightened fear in the Hong Kong stock market, where the main index, the Hang Seng, tumbled 3.89 percent. Tom Grimmer, a Peregrine spokesman, denied rumors that Peregrine was closing, but said the company's shares, suspended from trading since Wednesday, would stay off the market indefinitely. "We're now considering alternatives available to us," he added.
Also canceled was a purchase of Peregrine stock worth $50 million by the Chicago International Finance Corporation, a subsidiary of the First Chicago Corporation. The Zurich deal was a precondition for that purchase.
Peregrine's worsening crisis was hardly a surprise after the Zurich transaction was put off earlier this week. Zurich had second thoughts as it emerged that Peregrine might be owed as much as $270 million by a single Indonesian debtor with ties to the ruling Suharto family. That amount alone equaled nearly a third of Peregrine's total shareholder funds.
Given Peregrine's losses in the local stock and bond markets, investment analysts privately expressed surprise that the original deal with Zurich had been struck.
Once the brashest of investment banks that paid some of Asia's largest salaries and transported its executives in Rolls-Royces, Peregrine set out in 1988 to conquer Asia by promoting itself as a home-grown investment bank that would specialize in Asian securities. The company became a leading underwriter of Asian stock sales with 33 offices in 15 Asian countries as well as major global financial centers.
Peregrine Asset Management (USA), a United States subsidiary, manages one mutual fund sold to American investors and acts as a co-manager on at least two similar portfolios.
William Hortz, president of Peregrine Asset Management, which is based in San Francisco, said it was not experiencing any of the problems suffered by its parent.
He also said several United States money management companies had called to express interest in purchasing the United States fund operations, should they become available, but added that any talk of selling was premature.
The Peregrine Asia Pacific Growth fund, which had $14 million in assets as of Nov. 30, lost 28 percent of its value in the fourth quarter and 33 percent in 1997, according to Lipper Analytical Services.

HEADLINE: Clinton Seeks An Increase In Work-Study

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Jan. 9

 BODY:
Declaring the nation "on a roll," President Clinton today proposed new spending to help one million students work their way through college by performing community service.
The proposal, which Congressional Republicans immediately said they would probably support, would raise total spending on work-study programs in the next budget to $900 million, an increase of $70 million. Mr. Clinton said he would include the proposal in the budget plan that he will submit to Congress next month. 
 If Congress approves the extra money, Mr. Clinton said he would be a year ahead of his goal of involving one million students in programs like tutoring local children.
The program is part of Mr. Clinton's larger plan to make college more affordable, a topic he emphasized today at five campaign-style stops across Texas. The goal of making college more accessible is one that Democrats hope will help win over Hispanic voters, among others, in this election year as the party tries to regain control of Congress.
In his speeches, Mr. Clinton pleaded for Hispanic youths in particular to stay in school. In the past, he said, they might have thought it was better to drop out so they could help support their families. "That is simply not true anymore, and we have to change that attitude," he declared at a rally of 9,000 people in heavily Hispanic Brownsville, where he wore his black cowboy boot.
Mr. Clinton said it was clear that anyone who did not attend college for at least two years would have a harder time finding a good-paying job. College graduates make about 75 percent more than high school graduates, he said. And he asserted that his package of credits and grants, which he called "the biggest increase in college aid since the G.I. Bill 50 years ago," would essentially make college available to everyone.
Two of the President's stops were at private events to help raise money for two Congressional Democrats. Both are expected to coast to re-election, but Mr. Clinton was obliged to visit in return for their support last year of his unsuccessful effort to pass "fast track" trade legislation.
His appearance here tonight at a reception for Representative Sheila Jackson-Lee, the Houston Democrat who is unopposed this year, was a favor that Ms. Jackson-Lee sought from the Administration in return for her last-minute support of the trade bill, White House aides said. About 200 people gave $1,000 for a total of $200,000.
Earlier in the day, Mr. Clinton attended a fund-raiser for Representative Ruben Hinojosa in McAllen, near the Mexico border. It raised about $480,000, which was expected to wipe out Mr. Hinojosa's previous campaign debt, from about 500 people at a buffet on the lawn of Alonzo and Yolanda Cantu in a gated community called The Estates. Mr. Clinton said he wanted to thank Mr. Hinojosa "for taking all the heat to stick with me on the fast-track issue."
At nearby Mission High School, Mr. Clinton made his pitch for expanding the work-study program created by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 as part of his war on poverty.
Since he announced on Monday that he intended to submit a balanced budget to Congress -- the first time a President will have submitted a balanced budget since 1971 -- Mr. Clinton has cautioned that there is no surplus money yet to spend.
But the debate over how to spend it has already begun in Washington and state capitals. And almost every day this week, the President has announced new spending proposals, including an expansion of Medicare and child-care programs. And he clearly expects to propose more.
"Our nation is on a roll," Mr. Clinton declared to thousands of students who were packed into Tom Landry Stadium at the high school under warm sunny skies. He cited new statistics showing that the nation added 370,000 jobs last month and that wages are rising.
Still, he said, not all is rosy. Family income among Hispanics is not rising and unemployment is still "unconscionably high," he said.
The solution, Mr. Clinton said, is for young people to stay in school and complete at least two years of college. Doing less, he said, means "playing Russian roulette" with the future.
The work-study program is designed to help students do complete that schooling. Students at more than 3,000 colleges now receive Federal work-study money as part of their financial aid packages.
The concept is not controversial, and Republicans were already planning to propose similar increases for the next fiscal year.
"Work-study is a tried-and-true program," said Jay Diskey, a spokesman for the House Education and Work Force Committee, headed by Representative Bill Goodling, Republican of Pennsylvania. "We're looking at a good increase in it, too."
The Administration and Congress in the past have agreed to several other programs to make college more affordable. Two of those programs took effect Jan. 1, 1988: Hope Scholarship Credits, which give families up to $1,500 in tax credits for each of the first two years of tuition, and education I.R.A.'s, in which families deposit $500 a year into an account and the interest is exempt from taxes if it is spent on education.
On July 1, the so-called lifetime learning credit goes into effect. Under this program, a family can receive a 20 percent tax credit for the first $5,000 of tuition through 2002 and for the first $10,000 thereafter.
Far more contentious issues in education divide the President and the Congress, primarily affirmative action in admissions policies and whether banks or the Education Department should lend the money for student loans.

Panic in Indonesia Replaced by Political Anxiety

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, Jan. 9

 BODY:
President Suharto of Indonesia faces a widening political challenge, with the economic crisis leading to increasingly open calls among his people for him to step down.
On the pages of a leading newspaper, in a small demonstration in the streets and in the words of respected former generals and other influential figures, Indonesians have begun to break an effective taboo on public demands for his removal. 
 The demands spread today, after a panic on Thursday during which the Indonesian currency, the rupiah, lost 26 percent of its value and people across the country stripped supermarket shelves of food in a wave of hoarding.
The panic in Indonesia was at the center of a tumultuous week in which Asian currencies and stock markets imploded, throwing a shadow of uncertainty on the year ahead. The currencies in Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines joined the Indonesian rupiah in plunging to record lows, pulling stock prices down with them.
Residents said Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, was calmer today, buoyed by the prospect of closer United States involvement in solving its crisis.
As news spread this morning that President Clinton had spoken by telephone with President Suharto and was sending senior envoys to meet with him, currency and stock trading calmed somewhat. Though shoppers continued to crowd the markets, they were more orderly than in Thursday's wild spree.
After plummeting on Thursday to 10,550 to the dollar, the rupiah rose, fell and rose again today, to end at 7,990. Stock prices, down 12 percent on Thursday, slipped another 1.2 percent today in hesitant trading.
But the talk of political succession only widened in Indonesia, with 200 million people the world's fourth-largest nation.
"The elite -- except for the favored few -- all want him to step down, but no one really knows how to push him out," said Harold Crouch, an Indonesia specialist at the Australian National University in Canberra. "The pressures on him must be enormous. Whether it's days or months, it looks as if it will be this year, doesn't it?"
The daily Jakarta Post today quoted a former cabinet minister, Mohammad Sadli, as saying that in order to restore confidence, "the existing Government must be replaced."
In another article Arbi Sanit, a political scientist at the University of Indonesia, referring to the 76-year-old President's frailty, said, "We need a President who is in good health."
And today, as the police stood by, about 20 students staged a small demonstration demanding a change in Government. "A new President is needed to restore confidence," said one demonstrator, Kuldith Singh.
Such statements by private individuals reinforced widely publicized calls this week for Mr. Suharto's retirement by a respected group of former generals and Government ministers, and by Amien Rais, a prominent Muslim leader who commands a large following. Ninety percent of Indonesians are Muslim.
Throughout Mr. Suharto's rule, Indonesia has been a bulwark of stability in Southeast Asia, a dependable ally for the United States and a crucial source of oil and other raw materials for Japan and other nations.
The legislature was expected to name Mr. Suharto to a seventh five-year term in March. But the current crisis has brought into the open a growing sense that the time has come for a change.
The economic crash has undermined Mr. Suharto's chief accomplishment over three decades: the transformation of Indonesia from grinding poverty to rising prosperity.
"This must be delegitimizing for the Government, and for Mr. Suharto in particular," Mr. Crouch said. "After all, his great claim is that he is the father of development -- and development seems to be at least held up a bit, if not slipping backwards."
But the prospect of Mr. Suharto's departure causes widespread nervousness because he has made no provision for a successor and has at the same time quelled political opposition.
The only change of government Indonesia has known -- when Mr. Suharto succeeded the nation's founder, Sukarno, in 1965 -- was accompanied by widespread violence in which as many as half a million people were killed.
Mr. Suharto remains firmly in charge, and to all appearances retains the strong backing of the politically powerful military, despite a spate of rumors of a coup that continued to circulate today in Jakarta.
"The army is very much dependent on Mr. Suharto at the moment," said Juwono Sudarsono, a political scientist who leads Indonesia's military college. "Moreover, this crisis is so overwhelmingly economic in nature that a rearrangement in the power structure will not help."
Thursday's panic hoarding was set off by fears that the International Monetary Fund might cut off its three-month-old $40 billion aid program because a national budget announced on Tuesday seemed not to address the country's problems.
But these fears were eased today by the news that the United States seemed ready to play a more active role in addressing the crisis. Mr. Clinton has dispatched the Deputy Treasury Secretary, Lawrence H. Summers, to Jakarta, and the two top officers of the I.M.F. are to visit in the coming days.
In his 20-minute telephone coversation with Mr. Suharto, Mr. Clinton "made it quite clear that the I.M.F. program needs to be followed," according to an Administration official in Washington.
Murdiono, a spokesman for Mr. Suharto, said the Indonesian President affirmed his commitment to the reforms demanded by the I.M.F. "Indonesia is serious about carrying out the plan," Mr. Murdiono said.
In a gesture of commitment today, one of Mr. Suharto's wealthy and influential children, his eldest daughter, Siti Hardianti Rukmana, sold some of her dollars for rupiah at a state-owned bank. She did not say how much she had sold, but aides said it was $50,000.
But such a gesture here had little effect on currencies and stock prices elsewhere in Southeast Asia, and the regional slide continued today.
It was felt most strongly in the Philippines, where stock prices fell to their lowest level in almost five years, and in Singapore, where fears are growing over that country's dependence on the ailing Indonesian economy.
And despite today's slight respite, Indonesia's problems remain as crushing as ever.
The nation is burdened by a foreign debt that the Government estimates at $133 billion, including about $65 billion in money owned by corporations, and most of the payments are due this year.
Companies' urgent purchases of dollars to pay their debts -- dollars that have grown vastly more expensive as the rupiah weakens -- have helped depress the value of the rupiah even further.
This growing debt burden has raised the specter of widespread bankruptcies and has given rise to rumors in Jakarta that the Government might announce a moratorium on debt repayments, a last resort that would destroy Indonesia's credit in the world marketplace.

HEADLINE: Keeping a Clamp on the Bubble;
Call It Overdue, but Japan Credit Squeeze Inflicts Pain

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 9

 BODY:
Surrounded by piles of cardboard boxes in her cluttered office, a middle-aged businesswoman remembered angrily how her bankers once tried to force money on her, urging her to take out a loan to buy a golf club membership as an investment.
Now she desperately needs $80,000 to finance the importing of chemicals for her medical supply business, and her bankers are saying no. She won a contract for medical equipment, but her bankers refused to finance that deal, too. 
 "This is a real credit crunch," said the woman, who runs a company with $1 million a year in sales and who refused to be identified for fear of reprisals from her bankers. "Everybody is feeling it, though people try not to show it because they need to stand tall to survive. You mustn't let your tears be seen."
All across Japan, the largest economy in the world outside the United States, small and medium-size companies are getting the same bad news from their bankers, who are cutting credit lines or refusing to renew loans as they come due. Some experts worry that the squeeze may push the long-faltering Japanese economy into even deeper trouble, worsening Asia's financial crisis and increasing the peril of a global slowdown.
"For the first time in seven years, we are facing a major credit crunch," said Richard C. Koo, chief economist at the Nomura Research Institute. Yoshiteru Iwai, who runs a financial consulting company that has been inundated with calls from credit-starved clients, added: "It's awful, very severe and widespread. Japanese financial institutions have gone crazy."
Or they have just come to their senses, in the view of some analysts here and abroad. For years, the banks lent profligately, helping to send real estate prices soaring throughout the country. Even after that speculative bubble burst in the early 1990's, the banks neglected to rein in their recklessness, refusing to confront a huge mountain of bad loans on their books.
Now, as a wave of bankruptcies sweeps across Japan and as the Government cracks down with tougher regulation, the banks are slamming on the brakes. Their new approach threatens to throttle the hobbled economy. But many experts say that in fact tighter lending standards are just what the country needs to fix its financial system in the long run.
"What credit crunch?" said Alicia Ogawa, managing director at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd. "A lot of what people call credit crunch is simply the banks getting wise." In many cases, she said, they have called loans held by struggling companies that the banks have tried to revitalize for a year or two. The cutting off of credit, she added, is simply "good business."
Good or bad, the squeeze has gained less attention than one might expect, both in Japan and the United States, because so far it has not affected the largest companies. The Toyota Motor Corporation and the Sony Corporation, for example, are flush with cash and have bankers knocking at their doors to lend more, even as many small businesses that are the backbone of Japan's economy are stunned by the rejections they are getting from their lenders.
Paradoxically, with near-zero interest rates, this would seem at first glance to be a time of easy money. But though rates are extremely attractive, money is simply unavailable to many business customers, and one result is that Japan's economy is about as fragile as it has ever been in the 1990's.
The situation is reminiscent of the United States in the early 90's, when rates were low but money was similarly tight. That squeeze was also a result of speculative lending, by the American savings and loan industry, whose portfolios were bulging with bad real estate loans.
For now, in Japan, tight credit has sent the outlook for business to its lowest level in nearly 15 years, according to a Government-sponsored survey late last month of smaller companies. Central bank officials said they were surprised to find that even large banks had a "negative attitude" toward lending.
Unpaid debt is once again going up, bankruptcies are mounting, and the Government has been forced to retreat from its pledge that the nation's top banks are "too big to fail." In November, the Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, among the nation's 20 biggest, was allowed to fail. A few weeks later, Yamaichi Securities, one of Japan's Big Four securities houses, collapsed.
One reason for the credit squeeze is a fear of the unknown and unexpected that was symbolized by the failure of Yamaichi. What frightened the banking world was the disclosure that Yamaichi had more than $2 billion in off-the-book liabilities. Now banks and companies shrink from clients who they suspect may have hidden problems. "There's no more trust," said a Japanese financier who has dealt with South Korean and Southeast Asian clients. "I've had to unwind deals. And that means goodbye for good."
Banks have reason to be wary of even one another. In the fall, during a liquidity run that ended up with the bankruptcy of a medium-size brokerage firm called Sanyo Securities, one regional Japanese bank defaulted on its payments in the interbank market, according to a central bank official. That incident was hushed up to preserve confidence, but it underscores the risks.
The mistrust in the marketplace is so great that both foreign and domestic suppliers are stiffening their terms for payment. Instead of simply trusting a customer to pay within 30 days, they are demanding letters of credit or payment in advance.
Bankers are also tightening credit because their portfolios look like minefields. The Toshoku Company, a major food supplier, suddenly filed for bankruptcy in late December, providing a number of banks with unexpected losses. Now, the banking industry as a whole is wondering which of its borrowers will turn out to be the next Toshoku.
For the year through November, there were 14,772 bankruptcies, the highest number in 13 years, among companies with debt of at least 10 million yen, or $75,000, according to the Teikoku Data Bank, a research agency. It projects the number for the entire year to be about 16,000. The agency added that since the credit squeeze began just recently, only a small number of those bankruptcies were directly related to "kashi-shiburi," or "reluctance in lending," as the situation is described in Japanese.
Another reason for the credit squeeze is tighter regulations. By March 31, Japanese banks with overseas branches will have to meet international standards for capital strength -- requiring them to have capital equivalent to 8 percent of their assets at risk, meaning loans.
For even the most solid of the banks that is a tall order, particularly since they have been depleting their capital base over the last couple of years by starting to write off bad debt and setting aside provisions for losses from more bad loans.
So, most banks, pressed to improve their capital ratios, are finding it easier to reduce their loans outstanding than to raise new capital.
Indeed, Fuji Bank, one of the nation's largest, announced that by 2000 it would reduce its loans and other assets by 6 trillion yen, or about $45 billion, representing 10 percent of its assets at risk. The Yasuda Trust and Banking Company, another large institution, said it planned to cut its assets, including loans, by 45 percent over three years.
The depressed stock market -- which is at less than half its peak in 1989 -- is still another reason for the problems. A fair share of a bank's capital is in the market, and as the market tumbles, so does its capital. That is where the pressure comes to curb loans to stay within the 8 percent requirement.
Government officials have tried to reassure the markets that there will be no more major bankruptcies. But they made a similar promise in 1995 -- and again last year -- when they said that the nation's top 21 banks were too big to fail, at least until 2000. Many bankers now feel that the Government has largely lost control over the economy and the financial sector.
The Finance Ministry is trying to ease the credit squeeze by making a loan pool of 25 trillion yen, or $190 billion, available to small and medium-size businesses over the next 15 months and by guaranteeing other loans. Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto also announced a $15 billion income tax cut in mid-December.
Since then, the Government has eased the pressure on purely domestic banks by giving them an extra year to meet the new capital requirements, which were to go into effect for them on April 1. It also loosened the reporting requirements on stock portfolios for banks, allowing them to report losses on their short-term holdings as a whole rather than forcing them to mark down each stock. Though the moves may appease a few banks, they are a step backward from market discipline, some financial analysts say.
Indeed, some see the whole credit squeeze as a step forward, in the sense that banks are finally caring about risks. In the past, they often allocated cash based on relationships, more than on any kind of serious analysis of creditworthiness, and one reason borrowers are facing difficulties now is the painful transition to a more systematic evaluation of risk.
Still, a consequence is that many mom-and-pop businesses, including a good number that are basically sound and have a long record of repaying on time, are being brought to their knees all across Japan.
Take the case of the woman who has been turned down for loans to import chemicals and medical equipment. She had given the banks collateral -- the building she works in -- to back her previous credit line of $4 million, but the banks said that the value of the building had sunk so low that they could no longer lend to her.
Now, she fears that without access to money for her daily operations, she might miss a payment to creditors -- or have to turn to loan sharks.
"This is bullying against the weak," the woman grumbled. "We could end up defaulting on a bill. If that happens once, you are on a blacklist. If it happens twice, you are out of business."

HEADLINE: For the Sexes, Equality Under the Law and Under the Hair Clippers

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI 

 BODY:
It may pale beside the right to vote, expanded employment opportunities or corporate-subsidized child care, but a new law signed yesterday by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani gave women in New York City hope for liberation from a lingering, undeniably pesky manner of oppression.
At long last, they may escape the tyranny of higher prices for the laundering of a shirt or the cutting of hair that is essentially no different from a man's. 
 Then again, they may not. City Council Bill No. 804-A seeks to ban all gender-related price discrimination in establishments like dry cleaners and hair salons. But merchants may well find ways to sidestep the requirements of the law, and it is unclear how vigorously it will be enforced.
The new law forbids merchants to post prices that distinguish between male and female customers. Existing laws require that retail establishments post all prices for general, basic services.
Its backers called the law a milestone that would, at the very least, begin to erode a tradition of women automatically -- and inexplicably -- paying more for certain services.
"It was an injustice what was being done to women," said one of the bill's sponsors, Councilwoman Karen Koslowitz, a Democrat from Queens. Ms. Koslowitz helped coordinate a 1996 survey of 200 randomly selected hair salons in New York City that found that 48.5 percent of them charged women more than men for a basic cut.
"Nowadays," she said, "it's the same thing: Men color their hair; they have it blow-dried; they have it styled. Where I go, you see men in there all the time. What we want is the same price for the same service."
But while Ms. Koslowitz sounded impassioned, the reactions of women interviewed at random on city streets this week were as likely to tend toward blase.
While some called price discrepancies grossly unfair, others said the gender gap made sense.
"Most women tend to be pickier," said Dannette Bock, an actress who walked out of an Upper West Side hair salon yesterday evening with a freshly trimmed mane of lustrous brown hair. A male friend was at her side, and while she had paid $30 for her cut, he had paid $25.
But Ms. Bock said that she had been under the scissors for 45 minutes while her friend was finished in 20, so the bargain was really hers. "If anything," she said, "it should be charged on an hourly rate."
The new law, similar to one that went into effect in California two years ago, gives the city's Consumer Affairs Department the power to send inspectors into retail establishments to check on posted prices and, if those prices make distinctions based on gender, issue fines of $50 to $500.
A department spokeswoman did not return two phone calls this week requesting information on plans to enforce the law.
The law's backers conceded that some retail establishments may simply change the language on their price lists to eliminate references to gender while making other distinctions: long hair versus short or plain shirts versus ones with more decorative buttons.
But the city's Public Advocate, Mark J. Green, another sponsor of the law, said he intended to make sure it did not languish as idle symbolism, because it was simply too important. He said working women were being hit by a double economic whammy: lower wages and higher prices to launder or dry-clean the clothes they wore to the office.
Mr. Green said several surveys had documented a widespread pattern of dry cleaners and hair salons routinely overcharging women for virtually the same services men received.
But many hair cutters and dry cleaners said that discrimination is the wrong word for the price differences, because the services provided to men and those provided to women differ substantially.
"As far as a woman is concerned, a blouse is just like a shirt," said Bill Seitz, executive director of the Neighborhood Cleaners Association, a trade group. "Except it isn't.
"There are blouses that have beads and blouses that have trimmings and blouses that have lace and all kinds of very exciting and inventive ideas to make Mrs. Consumer or Miss Consumer more beautiful but are difficult to clean and press," Mr. Seitz said.
He said that even when a woman's shirt is almost identical to a man's, it often cannot fit easily onto old machinery designed for the size and shape of a man's shirt. Critics of pricing discrepancies countered that such antiquated equipment should be the industry's problem, not female customers'.
Hair stylists, meanwhile, said most women's hair takes more care and time than men's. "You can't charge the same because it's a different look," said Lyova Shikhil, owner of Belnord Unisex on the Upper West Side. Mr. Shikhil charges both men and women $18 for a basic cut, but for more extensive styling, he charges men $22 and women $34.
"You can cut men one, two, three," he explained. "Women -- you have to make them a princess."
The standard prices at the Panache salon in Forest Hills, Queens, showed that women do not always come out on the short end, revealing an unexpected discrepancy to which the new law would also apply.
Like many salons, Panache charges men $8 for a manicure, but women $6. "Men have a lot more cuticle," said Novell Kuedsak, a stylist there. "Plus, they don't maintain their nails every week like women. They need a lot more buffing."

Stocks Tumble in U.S. As Asian Worries Mount
Stocks tumbled, driven down in huge waves of selling on fears over how deeply America's economy will be hurt by Asia's festering financial crisis. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 222.2 points, or 2.85 percent, its sharpest drop since October's plunge. For the week, the Dow was down 4.8 percent. Broader market measures were also sharply lower.
 
 The slump comes as more investors are worried that American corporations will increasingly feel the pinch of a global economic slowdown caused by the rapid deterioration in Asia. But while Asia is bad news for stocks, it is good for investors in the bond market. Long-term rates slipped to near 30-year lows as the yield on the 30-year bond fell to 5.73 percent. Page A1.
 
Peregrine Investments, one of the brashest symbols of Asia's 1990's boom, was fighting for its life after the collapse of a $200 million deal with a Swiss investor. Hong Kong regulators plan to limit the company's business. D3.
 
H.M.O. Curtails Fertility Coverage
Aetna, one of the country's biggest health insurers, said its U.S. Healthcare health plans would eliminate coverage for advanced fertility treatments, including in vitro fertilization, effective April 1. Aetna had been under pressure from investors to reduce costs and increase profits. A1.
 
Owens Corning Cuts Back
Owens Corning will dismiss 2,200 people, close plants and report unexpectedly weak earnings, reflecting intense competition in the home-insulation business. The company, a leading maker of building materials, said it had been hurt by falling prices despite a boom in the housing industry. Shares of Owens Corning fell $1.625, to $32. The stock has declined 36.6 percent from a 52-week high of $49.875 last Jan. 14. D2.
 
Inspection of Boeing Plants
A team of Federal Aviation Administration inspectors will be sent to two Boeing plants after the discovery that part of the tail of a Boeing 737 that crashed in Indonesia last month appears to have separated from the plane before impact. A10.

Delay in Texas Tobacco Suit
A Federal judge delayed the start of jury selection in a lawsuit filed by Texas against the tobacco industry as the two sides sought to resolve disputes that have impeded a settlement. The tobacco companies named in the lawsuit offered to settle it last week for $7.25 billion, but there remains disagreements over lawyers' fees and over who will decide to divide them. A16.
 
German Unemployment Increases
Germany's jobless rate unexpectedly rose to a postwar high of 11.9 percent in December. It was the ninth consecutive monthly increase and cast doubt on the pace of recovery in Europe's biggest economy. D2.
 
Lloyd's Profits Expected to Drop
Lloyd's of London, the world's oldest insurance market, will likely report a 41 percent decline in profits for 1996 and a 32 percent decline for 1997 because of diminished premium income, a group of Lloyd's analysts estimates. The company reports its financial results belatedly to allow time for claims to be calculated. D2.
 
China's New Consumerism
Glossy, ad-packed newspapers -- with titles like Fine Goods Shopping Guide and Shopping Guide -- have become hot sellers on newsstands in Beijing. The tabloids are evidence that a new generation of Chinese has entered the global consumer culture, whether all can afford it or not. A1.

HEADLINE: Iranians Receptive To Opening To America

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran, Jan. 9

 BODY:
President Mohammad Khatami's "message to the American people," delivered in a television interview the other night, has begun to play well in Iran.
An impressionistic sampling of Iranian public opinion, consisting of two dozen interviews in the rich and poor sections of Teheran today, suggested that Mr. Khatami had succeeded in his evident attempt to sway public opinion at home as much as to reach out to the United States. 
 Most of the Iranians interviewed expressed satisfaction with the President's interview, which was printed in full in a newspaper here and broadcast twice on television in its entirety. But like American officials and other Western analysts, they had widely different interpretations of what he said.
"It was ambiguous," said a 57-year-old homemaker who refused to give her name. "People can interpret it the way they want, whether he was for or against relations with the U.S."
Some Iranians believe that Mr. Khatami's message was the first step toward the renewal of diplomatic relations, even though he went out of his way to say that while he favored cultural and academic exchanges, he did not believe that a dialogue between the two estranged Governments was needed.
"My son is in the States, and I believe we should resume ties," said a 55-year-old textile producer, who gave only his first name, Hassan.
Iran is a country that thrives on conspiracy, and some Iranians are convinced that the Government already has a secret relationship with the United States. "I believe that Iranians have already started relations with America and this interview was to pave the way to tell this little by little to the Iranian people," said Bhnaz Fallahi, a 31-year-old computer engineer.
But a minority of those interviewed said their President's acknowledgment that Americans had been hurt by the seizure of the American Embassy in Teheran in 1979 and his denunciation of the burning of the American flag were proof that he was soft on the United States.
"The President was soft," said a 25-year-old university student whose father was killed in the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980's. "We will never allow relations with the United States."
The first official reaction came today from two Iranian clerics who preached at the authoritative weekly Prayers to tens of thousands of worshipers gathered for the open-air service at Teheran University despite a raging blizzard.
The clerics' remarks were not exactly a ringing endorsement of their new President. But the fact that they did not criticize him either was proof enough that he had not alienated the clerical leadership with his modest proposal for cultural exchanges and his praise for American civilization.
Ayatollah Mohammad Imami Kashani, one of Iran's most important clerics, reserved his criticism for those Americans who, he said, distort the truth and who ignored Mr. Khatami's assertion in his interview that American foreign policy is made in Israel.
"The trumpets of the world's oppressors take a sentence they like from Mr. Khatami's speech and give it their own interpretation," he told the worshipers.
In the same vein, he added: "There was a poor man who couldn't afford anything, so he rubbed a piece of fat on his lips every day and told people what delicious food he had eaten, but people knew he was a liar and didn't believe him. Americans are like that. They lie to people."
It takes a lot for an ayatollah to keep a sermon short, but Ayatollah Kashani's lasted only six minutes. It was not, he said, that he did not have more to say. It was the snow.
Ayatollah Kashani's opinion carries enormous weight. The spokesman for the powerful Guardian Council, which insures that legislation conforms to Islamic principles, he had endorsed Mr. Khatami's hard-line opponent in the presidential campaign in May.
An unidentified cleric who preceded Ayatollah Kashani said the President's remarks were "inspired" by Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has rigidly opposed any warming of relations with the United States. The cleric also endorsed Mr. Khatami's statement that Iran's most popular mantra, "Death to America," was not directed at the American people.
"The crimes of American politicians come from the Israelis," the junior cleric said. He adapted the mantra to the changing times, chanting, "Death to those American politicians who commit these crimes!"
Then he gave an order: "Now shout 'Death to America!' "
The worshipers did, several times.
Morteza Arvandi, a 53-year-old former bookstore clerk explained why "Death to America" was still such a powerful chant. "It's because the Americans have put us under tremendous economic pressure with sanctions," he said. A single tomato, he added, costs almost $2.
Mr. Khatami's interview was not seen by most Iranians when it was broadcast on CNN in Teheran at 2:30 A.M. Thursday. CNN is available only through satellite dishes, which are forbidden in Iran, except for high-ranking officials, foreign diplomats, one or two hotels and a few other privileged individuals.
Iranian television viewers had to wait until official Iranian television broadcast the interview later Thursday morning and evening.
Marziyeh Vahid Dastjerdi, a leading female member of Parliament, who said early this week that only Ayatollah Khamenei, not the President, had the authority to decide on opening an official dialogue with Washington, praised Mr. Khatami's performance in the interview.
"It was very, very good," she said in an interview. "The President followed the leader and criticized having a dialogue between governments. I'm satisfied."
Few Iranian newspapers have weighed in with comment, which is expected over the next several days.
The English-language daily Iran News called Mr. Khatami "a shrewd politician," adding that it would have been politically dangerous for him to go further than he did in bridging the 19-year-old chasm between Iran and the United States.
"Anyone who takes the first step to establish ties with the U.S. without obtaining concessions from Washington to justify the move and to appease the domestic pressure groups would be committing political suicide," the newspaper said.
Only the hard-line daily Kayhan has so far leveled any specific criticism against Mr. Khatami, chastising him for calling the seizure of the American Embassy a revolutionary act that could not occur today and expressing regret that it had hurt the feelings of the American people.
"Why do we have to stand trial and define that revolutionary act as an emotional act just to satisfy Western norms and tastes?" the newspaper asked. "It's a shame that instead of expressing regret, the President did not try to convey the grievances of the Iranian nation to the American people."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
ANXIETIES ON ASIA PUSH U.S. STOCKS DOWN NEARLY 3%

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER and DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The stock market suffered its worst drop since the plunge of late October yesterday, driven down by huge waves of selling on fear over how deeply America's economy could be hurt by Asia's festering financial crisis.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 222.20 points, or 2.9 percent. Equally large declines in broader measures gave the stock market its steepest weekly loss since 1989. 
 The concern over Asia has been ebbing and flowing since the crisis began last summer. At the first peak of worry the Dow fell 554 points, or 7.2 percent, on Oct. 27. Yesterday's decline came after the apparent stabilization of Asia last month gave way to sharp new declines in stocks and currencies.
More and more investors are worried that American corporations will increasingly feel the pinch of a global economic slowdown caused by the rapid deterioration in Asia.
But while Asia is bad news for stocks, it is good for investors in the bond market, where interest rates are determined. That could signal good news for homeowners and consumers, who will probably feel the benefits of lower rates on loans.
Bond investors see Asia bringing slower growth and lower inflation, which make bonds an attractive investment, especially when the outlook for the stock market is uncertain. This belief more than offset what normally would have been negative news for bonds: a strong increase of 370,000 in new jobs in December.
Rather than raising fears of higher interest rates because of too rapid economic growth, short-term interest rates in the bond market plunged enough yesterday to indicate many investors are convinced the Asian situation will slow growth here enough to force the Federal Reserve to lower its interest-rate target.
"People are really being forward- looking and are willing to overlook economic statistics," said Russ Sheldon, chief economist at MCM, a market research firm.
The yield on the two-year Treasury note, a benchmark of short-term interest rates, dropped to 5.17 percent from 5.29 percent and is now down almost half a percentage point this year. More important, the yield is below the central bank's 5.5 percent target for short-term interest rates, a clear sign that investors are now betting the Fed will move its target lower. Long-term rates also slipped to levels near their lowest in 30 years as the yield on the 30-year bond fell to 5.73 percent, just above its recent low of 5.72 percent.
The decline in bond yields has already pushed mortgage interest rates below 7 percent and they might go lower, which could generate a round of mortgage refinancings as more people seek to reduce their monthly payments. That could bolster consumer spending by giving homeowners more cash each month. And if the Federal Reserve does follow through with a cut in interest rates, other consumer interest rates -- on car loans, credit cards and consumer and small-business loans -- could begin to fall.
The changing and varied fortunes of stocks and bonds are largely a result of the economic shock waves from Asia. What began last summer as a currency crisis in Thailand, quickly spread to Malaysia, Indonesia, Hong Kong and South Korea.
But even though the International Monetary Fund has assembled bailout packages totaling more than $100 billion, and private lenders are working to help, each day this year the crisis has seemed to deepen, especially since the collapse this week of the Indonesian currency sent the stock market there tumbling and pulled other markets down.
As the Asian outlook worsened this week, there were daily warnings in the United States that fourth-quarter corporate profits, which will soon be announced, may have been weakened by slowing demand in Asia.
Yesterday, for instance, Adaptec, a maker of computer components, said third-quarter earnings would be sharply lower than expected. Adaptec shares fell 40 percent. It was one of many technology companies to issue such a warning in recent weeks.
As a result, scores of technology stocks have been beaten down and that momentum carried over into yesterday. Oil, banking and brokerage firm stocks were hit hard.
Nearly five stocks fell for every one that rose on the New York Stock Exchange, sending all the major stock indexes sharply lower. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, a major barometer of market health, fell nearly 3 percent, while the Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks sank by an equal amount on one of the heaviest trading days ever, with more than 746 million shares changing hands on the Big Board.
"People are beginning to realize that Asia is not going to go away," said Michael Metz, the chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Company. "Every day we get a warning from corporations that Wall Street's earnings estimates are too high. And that's for the fourth quarter. What's going to happen in the spring?"
The selloff this week, which pushed the Dow down nearly 5 percent, is troubling to Wall Street forecasters partly because the market's behavior in early January has historically been a fairly reliable, albeit unscientific, forecaster of the year.
"There is market lore here in the U.S. that the first five days of the year set the tone for the rest of the year," said Philip J. Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management. "If you put any faith in that legend we're in for some tough sledding."
Many on Wall Street, however, have for some time been expecting 1998 to be a difficult year, largely because the major indexes have just completed an unparalleled third consecutive year of annual gains of 20 percent or more.
Richard McCabe, chief market strategist at Merrill Lynch, and others are advising investors to be more cautious by buying shares of domestic companies that will probably be less affected by the Asian crisis.
The rally in the bond market, some analysts contend, is a sign that some investors have decided that they want to protect themselves by investing in the safety of Treasury bonds, which do not offer the potentially high rewards of stocks but also carry much less risk.
"The surge we are getting in the bond market is coinciding with a decent pullback in the stock market," said Nancy Kimelman, the chief economist at Technical Data in Boston. "There is certainly a reassessment going on of where the risks lie in 1998."

HEADLINE: Seeking to Halt Rutgers Skid, The Governor Sends In a Play

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., Jan. 8

 BODY:
The Rutgers University football team has stumbled for years, but when it lost every game this last season, New Jersey's powerful sports and political establishments decided that enough was enough.
Last month, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman took the rare step of intervening in the university's affairs and proposed her own candidate to run its long-troubled athletic program: Robert E. Mulcahy 3d, the president of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority. During her annual meeting with the university president, Francis L. Lawrence, the Governor urged him to hire Mr. Mulcahy, said Pete McDonough, a spokesman for Mrs. Whitman. 
 Like the Governor, state legislators from both parties said that a successful sports program would draw more attention and dollars to the state's largest university. And they, too, are pushing the candidacy of Mr. Mulcahy, who has been widely praised in his role as the overseer of the Meadowlands sports complex.
The winless season has also galvanized faculty at Rutgers who have long criticized Dr. Lawrence for investing too heavily in sports at the expense of academics. They argue that money being spent on sports should be used to hire more professors, reduce class sizes and buy more library books.
Rutgers's predicament is not unusual. Across the nation, other state-supported institutions are pouring money into intercollegiate sports in hopes of making headlines and hefty profits. If their teams fail, they not only waste millions of dollars a year but face dizzying deficits. They also lose standing with legislators, alumni, corporate donors and prospective students.
But winning teams can fill stadiums with thousands of fans, attract lucrative television and radio contracts and raise revenues and a school's reputation. In 1996, when the Northwestern University football team made it to the Rose Bowl, admissions applications increased by 21 percent and game attendance soared.
"High-profile, winning athletic teams attract attention to the school," Mr. McDonough said, "they attract resources and they attract prestige. The Governor thinks it's a very important part of the university's whole program."
While Dr. Lawrence, in an interview, repeatedly stressed the importance of academics, he said that improving the sports program was a top priority because it would increase alumni and legislative financial support. He said that despite losing $31.5 million on the athletic program in the last decade, Rutgers would remain a member of Division 1 of the National Collegiate Athletic Association in basketball and a member of the Big East football conference, which both require significant investments. He said that spending on sports, about $20 million a year, was an "infinitesimal" portion of the university's $1 billion budget. Dr. Lawrence also said that improving the sports program would give Rutgers more visibility and prestige.
"Sports takes up one whole section in the newspaper," he said, his voice hoarse from having shouted the men's basketball team to an 81-49 victory over Seton Hall, their main rival, on Wednesday. "We want athletics to complement the university and develop its stature to the point where we are as successful as our peer institutions."
Rutgers has been trying to get to that point since the 1970's, when Sonny Werblin, a Rutgers alumnus and former part owner of the New York Jets, insisted big-time sports was the way to attract national attention to the university. The university joined the Big East football conference in 1991. The state also invested heavily in the effort to raise the stature of the football program, providing $29 million in bonds through the sports authority to build a 40,500-seat stadium in Piscataway in 1994.
But the football team kept losing, the new stadium failed to draw crowds, and ticket sales, which are supposed to provide the biggest portion of revenue for athletic programs, dwindled. Rutgers dismissed one football coach, Doug Graber, in 1995, but promised to pay his $290,000 salary until his contract expired next month. Meanwhile, the university hired another coach, Terry Shea, for $300,000 a year. Rutgers is also paying two basketball coaches: Bob Wenzel, who was dismissed in 1996, and Kevin Bannon, his replacement.
"The program is a dinosaur and it isn't competitive with the real world," said State Senator John A. Lynch, a Democrat from New Brunswick who said he canceled his season football tickets for the first time last fall. "Once they chose to play the Big East they needed to do marketing and make sure the athletes succeed academically. They have not done a good job."
But Dr. Lawrence and the Governor do not necessarily agree on who can rejuvenate Rutgers's program, a conflict that could damage Dr. Lawrence's already-shaky standing in Trenton. Mrs. Whitman, top legislators and several members of the Rutgers Board of Governors have said the university should snap up Mr. Mulcahy, whose term at the sports authority ends this month and who is said to want the job badly.
But instead of hiring Mr. Mulcahy immediately, Dr. Lawrence said he would conduct a nationwide search for a new athletic director after seeing the results of two studies of the athletic program that are due this month. He said he would not choose a candidate until spring.
"We don't want to make a quick or a rash decision," Dr. Lawrence said. "Bob Mulcahy has been very successful on behalf of New Jersey. On the other hand, I believe it is too early to speculate on the likelihood of any particular individual being appointed."
One legislator and several people close to Mr. Mulcahy said they saw Mrs. Whitman's intervention in the search for an athletic director as a sign of her disappointment in Dr. Lawrence's performance at Rutgers. Those same people said that Mrs. Whitman has talked to former Gov. Thomas H. Kean, now the president of Drew University in Madison, N.J., about the possibility of replacing Dr. Lawrence.
But Mr. McDonough said the Governor is not motivated by any dissatisfaction with Dr. Lawrence. "I've not heard her say anything about it," he said. "It's just not an issue for the moment."
Mr. Mulcahy, 61, is a Democrat who has led the sports authority since 1979. With a salary of $182,875, he is one of the state's highest paid officials. The Rutgers job, now held by Fred Gruninger, pays $114,000. Mr. Gruninger announced last Oct. 10, a day after the football team suffered a humiliating 50-3 loss to Syracuse, that he would be retiring in June.
Mrs. Whitman has generally praised Mr. Mulcahy for his role in the growth and success of the Meadowlands. Last year, it had $206 million in revenues and a surplus of $34.3 million. People close to Mr. Mulcahy, who was State Corrections Commissioner in the 1970's, said he had enough respect from both the political and sports establishments to turn the Rutgers program around. They said he saw the job as a final challenge before his retirement.
"If you think of the A.D.'s job only as an A.D.'s job, maybe it's a step down for Bob," said Michael Rowe, president of the New Jersey Nets. "But if you want to raise funds, work with legislators and establish Rutgers as a premier entertainment option with sports as a basis, Bob can do it."
Mr. Mulcahy himself would not comment on the prospect of the Rutgers job. "I'm just focused on what I'm doing," he said.
But even with the savviest of athletic directors, Rutgers could have trouble making money on sports because of its location, said Richard McCormick, the university historian. With the New York Giants, the New York Jets and the Philadelphia Eagles nearby, New Jersey residents are less likely to attend college football games, he said.
"The kind of enthusiasm for college games that you get in the South and the West does not exist here," Mr. McCormick said. "We don't have a glorious athletic tradition, and it would be very hard for us to get into that club."
Mr. McCormick argued that the money that Rutgers is putting into sports would be better spent on academics, technology and programs for New Jersey residents. He said that Rutgers was in "a holding pattern" and that many programs sorely needed resources.
"There is more to be achieved in terms of academic programs and public services," Mr. McCormick said. "We have, aside from athletic prowess, a lot of good messages for the people of New Jersey but many are not being heard."
But Dr. Lawrence said other programs had suffered because of the recession in the early 1990's, not because of sports. He said that spending on instruction, research and libraries nearly doubled over 10 years and that last year alone, he dedicated $7 million to hiring professors, buying books and journals and creating new academic programs.
"People are always looking for something to blame for why they didn't get the funds," Dr. Lawrence said. "Those whose programs we're stressing will be very happy, and those that we're not will continue to limp along. It doesn't mean we don't value them."
But, he said, top-notch football and basketball teams could stir enough state pride in Rutgers to bring in more public and private funds, not just for sports but for academics, construction and technology. Legislators -- 22 of whom are Rutgers alumni -- did not hesitate to agree.
"It's a lot easier when a school comes up for a budget hearing if that school has a winning team," said State Senator Richard J. Codey, the Democratic minority leader who said he rarely attends Rutgers games these days. "It wouldn't hurt if you had legislators begging for tickets. It would do wonders for the university."

Backlash At the Pump

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
I like to think of the world as four different gas stations. At the Japanese gas station, gas is $5 a gallon, four uniformed men wait on you and wash your windows, and you drive away at ease. At the American gas station, gas costs $1 a gallon, you pump it yourself and four homeless people mug you around the corner and steal your hubcaps. At the European gas station, gasoline costs $5 a gallon, one person who works only 32 hours a week and has six weeks' vacation waits on you, and four people living on generous unemployment insurance are playing boccie ball across the street. At the Communist gas station gas costs only 50 cents a gallon, but there is none. The four attendants have sold it all on the black market for $5 a gallon.
What is happening, for the moment, is that the American gas station model is triumphing over all others. But not without a struggle. Korea, Japan and the other Asians are scrambling to avoid having to emulate the U.S. system. They like their kind of gas station, which has kept a lot of people employed and preserved social harmony, by using crony capitalism and walls of protection. 
 Question: What will be the backlash in Asia from everyone being forced into our gas station? I see several scenarios:
1. The anti-American backlash. What happened in Asia is that a lot of private businesses in Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, working through their local banks, borrowed money from private American, Japanese and European banks. Then the Asian currencies collapsed and they were unable to pay back their loans. The I.M.F., to stabilize the situation, steps in and asks the Asian governments to take over the failing banks, in order to sort out the bad loans and repay the foreign banks. The I.M.F. also insists that these countries open their economies and let foreigners buy controlling interests in local banks and businesses. In return the I.M.F. lends them money to pay off their debts. Then, when the crisis is over and these countries start growing again, their citizens can repay the I.M.F.
In short, the Asians are being told: Let America in, have your taxpayers pay America's banks back, let Americans buy your crown jewels at bargain-basement prices, and, by the way, get rid of those three extra guys working in your gas station.
Some Asians won't mind this. A Thai friend told me that a friend of his recently lost his wallet with four bank cards in it, one from American Express and three from Bangkok banks. American Express sent him a new card that evening by motor scooter. He still has not heard from the three Bangkok banks. If American Express is now able to buy one of those Bangkok banks and improve its services, will my friend care? Not at all. But a lot of Thai businessmen might when they discover that American Express won't lend money the old crony way, or that they have to sell their Thai hotels and banks to Americans, at fire-sale prices, to stay solvent.
2. The anti-free-market backlash. There is going to be a big push now to see if there is a "third way" between the American gas station and the old Asian one. A lot of countries are going to try to avoid huge layoffs by reducing the workweek, pumping some money into the economy (despite the I.M.F.), keeping some large projects going and asking their people to save more and cash in their gold earrings. Maybe they will lay off one of the four people at their gas station, but still keep three. Their attitude is that there was an Asian capitalist way before and there can be one again. Anything but the American gas station.
3. The political backlash. If you talk to Indonesians today, what's interesting is that they don't blame the I.M.F. or the U.S. for their troubles, yet. They blame the corrupt, greedy, unaccountable Suharto ruling family. As they say in Indonesia, "The Suhartos have everything, except a sense of shame." Open markets ultimately need an open political system, and the emerging middle classes in Asia know it and are pressing for it as a result of this crisis.
4. The ethnic backlash. In Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia, small Chinese merchant classes dominate the economies. If these societies really go into economic turmoil, there is real danger the Chinese minorities throughout Southeast Asia will be attacked. How will China react to that? Hmmm.
My bet: We are going to witness all four backlashes at the same time. It's not easy to change gas stations.

HEADLINE: AETNA IS REDUCING FERTILITY BENEFITS

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Aetna Inc., one of the nation's biggest health insurers, said yesterday that its U.S. Healthcare health plans would eliminate coverage for advanced fertility treatments, including in vitro fertilization, on April 1.
The company said that women who had fertility problems had been joining the U.S. Healthcare plans because they knew the advanced treatments were available. Aetna has recently been under pressure from Wall Street investors to reduce costs and increase profits. 
 The decision was sharply criticized by doctors and advocates for infertility patients, who said that many couples were already struggling to cover the costs of such treatments out of their own pockets.
"We don't question what it costs to fix a tennis elbow or a football player's knee," said Pamela Madsen, a spokeswoman for Resolve, a national patient advocacy and support group for people with fertility problems. "Where are our priorities?"
U.S. Healthcare, which began offering this coverage in 1995, was one of the first managed care companies to do so and set an example that other health plans followed.
Fertility is a problem for 6.1 million Americans, but fewer than half of those who are infertile obtain the expensive medical services, a 1995 survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found. Cost is considered to be a major factor.
A growing number of states require health plans to offer a variety of fertility treatments. But these laws do not apply to most workers because they are covered by plans whose administration is structured in such a way that they are exempt from state jurisdiction under provisions of a 1978 Federal law.
States that require coverage for some form of infertility treatment include New York, Connecticut, California, Texas, Illinois, Massachusetts, Ohio, Maryland, Arkansas, Montana, Rhode Island, West Virginia and Hawaii.
A bill will be introduced in Congress this year to require all health plans to provide for fertility treatments, said Sean Tipton, a lobbyist for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, a doctors' group.
The Aetna decision, which evoked emotionally charged concerns about working mothers and childbearing, added fuel to the debate over whether health plans and the employers who pay for them should be required to cover specific expensive treatments and procedures.
Many managed care companies have been reporting weak profits or losses, and analysts expect them to raise rates and pare benefits. It was not clear, though, whether companies besides Aetna would eliminate fertility coverage.
Mr. Tipton assailed the Aetna move as an example of "a health system that is driven by the interest of shareholder dividends rather than the interest of patients."
Sari Madden, 30, a second grade teacher at Public School 152 in Woodside, Queens, said U.S. Healthcare had paid for procedures at a Manhattan fertility center that eventually led to her becoming pregnant five months ago. She and her husband had been trying to have a baby for two years. "I'm surprised that they are doing this," Ms. Madden said. "If it wasn't for that program, I wouldn't have gotten pregnant at all. I couldn't have afforded it."
Employers can arrange for advanced fertility treatments through a number of health plans, including Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield. About 40 percent of large employers offer some form of advanced fertility treatment, including in vitro, artificial insemination and drug therapy, according to a 1996 survey of employers with 500 or more workers by William M. Mercer, a benefits consulting firm.
Nineteen percent of health maintenance organizations offer in vitro fertilization, the Mercer survey said.
In vitro fertilization, in which eggs from a woman typically are combined with her husband's sperm in a laboratory dish and reimplanted in the woman, can cost $8,000 to $12,000 for each procedure. Ms. Madden said U.S. Healthcare paid for her first unsuccessful attempt and arranged a special price of $5,000 for the second, successful attempt at in vitro, which she paid for herself.
But the cost of adding the in vitro benefit to a standard package of health benefits is only about 26 cents per month for each member of a health plan, said Diana Dean, a consultant with Mercer.
An Aetna spokeswoman would not comment on the economic basis for the change in U.S. Healthcare policy, which patient advocacy groups announced on the Internet several weeks ago. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported the action yesterday.
Aetna said the change applied to 750,000 female members of U.S. Healthcare from 20 to 45 years old. It said about 1.5 percent, or 11,250, had fertility problems, of which fewer than 2,500 had the in vitro procedure. The fertility treatments were not offered as a basic benefit by other Aetna health plans.
Dr. Zev Rosenwaks, director of the Center for Reproductive Medicine and Infertility of New York Hospital/ Cornell University Medical Center in Manhattan, said it was "unfortunate that the insurance companies don't see the treatment of infertility as an important medical condition to be covered."
Dr. Rosenwaks said, "The inability to conceive is a disorder like any other medical condition."
Dr. John Nelson, an obstetrician in Salt Lake City who is a trustee of the American Medical Association, said he had "concerns about insurance measures that specifically single out women." He said in vitro fertilization "is not an experimental procedure," and that "it works very well but it is expensive."
He added, "Are they going to discriminate against any kind of procedure that is expensive?"
Ms. Madsen, of Resolve, said she had had to pay for the in vitro assisted births of her sons, now 5 and 8.
"Even though I had health insurance and my husband worked, we were told then that the desire to have a baby was something optional that was not covered, like plastic surgery or a private room at the hospital," she said.
Resolve, which has 13,000 members, and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine have written to Richard Huber, chief executive of Aetna, to protest the change in policy, which also eliminates coverage for fertility technology called gamete intrafallopian transfer, zygote intrafallopian transfer and embryo cryopreservation.
U.S. Healthcare says it will continue to offer a fertility benefit for diagnosis, surgery, drugs taken orally (but not injected), and intrauterine insemination.
Dr. Rosenwaks said it "could be cheaper to do the in vitro procedure in a good clinic than to do a protracted standard treatment that most insurers pay for, which may not work."

Hyundai Hopes To Raise Auto Exports by 15%

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The Hyundai Motor Company, South Korea's largest auto maker, hopes to increase exports by 15 percent this year as it braces for a slump in domestic sales. With the economy expected to fall into recession and car sales forecast to dip 20 percent, Hyundai is gearing up to increase sales abroad, especially in the United States, which accounts for one-quarter of foreign sales. 
 While exports are nothing new for many Korean companies, including Hyundai -- the auto maker exported 48 percent of its 1.25 million production in 1997 -- they have taken on new urgency as recession looms. Hyundai hopes to increase the number of vehicles sold abroad to more than 690,000, or 15 percent more than the 601,851 units that were sold last year.

HEADLINE: Budget Surplus Is Burning a Hole in California's Pocket

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., Jan. 9

 BODY:
His state again flush after years of scarcity, Gov. Pete Wilson of California today presented the most optimistic budget of his seven years in office, with billions of dollars of proposed new spending for education, water supply systems, roads, bridges and prisons.
In a weeklong series of announcements culminating in his budget message this morning, Mr. Wilson declared in ebullient tones that California is resoundingly back after years of reverses, and is now "the powerhouse of the Pacific" ready to make many deferred "investments for a 21st century infrastructure." His rosy proposals range from a one-week longer school year to smaller elementary school classes to continued planning for a long-envisioned 10th campus of the University of California system at Merced. 
 Mr. Wilson's good news is emblematic of the politics of plenty now playing out in state capitals across the country. A survey by the Denver-based National Conference of State Legislatures found that a total of 30 states began this year with revenue running ahead of budgeted expectations (in California, they have been about $1 billion above forecasts), with 19 states indicating that elementary and secondary school spending would be their top priority.
In Colorado this week, Gov. Roy Romer, a Democrat, emphasized similar goals in his state of the state speech, while Gov. Zell Miller of Georgia also proposed using some of his state's record fiscal reserves on projects from new runways at rural airports to new classrooms for fast-growing school districts. In Massachusetts, the state's rainy day fund, empty when former Gov. William Weld took office seven years ago, now stands at $800 million, and state officials have agreed to use part of the current year's $130 million surplus to pay off past bills.
But the bittersweet twist for Mr. Wilson is that this $73.8 billion budget for the fiscal year that starts July 1 will also be his last as Governor of the nation's most populous state, because of the term limits law that he supported as a candidate in 1990 and now wistfully acknowledges he wishes he could exceed.
That means that the Governor -- whose popularity sank as his state endured a grueling recession and he ran a brief, failed campaign for the Republican Presidential nomination in 1996 -- will be hard-pressed to reap the full benefits of California's recovery, in which the state's job growth is outpacing the nation in every category of non-farm employment and unemployment stands at 5.8 percent, the lowest level in seven years.
"I will genuinely miss this job," Mr. Wilson acknowledged in his annual state of the state message to the Legislature on Wednesday. "Even on its worst days, this is the most fulfilling, best job I've known."
After so many setbacks, Mr. Wilson seems determined not to acknowledge his status as a lame duck, but to make the best bid he can for a legacy. He stayed up, as usual, until 3:30 A.M. Wednesday, polishing his state of the state speech, then jetted around the state to push his proposals. And whatever the shortcomings of his first Presidential bid, the onetime Nixon advance man, who has also served as a United States Senator and Mayor of San Diego, is keeping his options open.
"I don't think he's ruled out running for President at all," said his old comrade-in-arms, Ken Kachigian, a veteran California Republican consultant. "I think everything else being equal, it's going to happen."
This week's budget was, in some ways, less the emergence of a new Pete Wilson than a return of an old one. Mr. Wilson took office in 1991 laying out an agenda for what he called "preventive government," including investments in education and children's health care, but those ideas were quickly swallowed by California's worst economic disaster since the Great Depression. Instead, Mr. Wilson was forced to raise taxes, and he and the legislature struggled each summer for weeks past the budget deadline to dole out the pain.
"California lagged everybody else coming out of the recession," said Arturo Perez, a policy specialist in the fiscal affairs program at the conference of legislatures. "States are definitely now on the upside of the economic cycle, and that is what you'd expect with low inflation and the stock market humming the way it is."
In California's case, the economic recovery began in earnest in 1995, but it took longer for state revenues to reflect the upturn in employment and economic activity, and last year was the first in which Mr. Wilson and the Democratic-dominated legislature found themselves deadlocked over apportioning plenty instead of managing scarcity. In the end, the Governor forced adoption of many of his priorities, including a new statewide test to measure performance of public school students and a compromise $1 billion tax cut package that included an increase in tax credits for children and a greater capital gains exemption for home sales.
Today, the Democratic leader of the State Senate, Bill Lockyer, praised Mr. Wilson's proposal as "a good budget," and quoted an aphorism from Mark Twain's "Pudd'nhead Wilson" that "Prosperity is the best protector of principle." He said Mr. Wilson's proposal for sending $7 billion in construction bond issues to voters for approval seemed "in the ballpark," given the strong economy and low interest rates, but questioned whether the Governor should be so quick to impose his own priorities, like the longer school year, on the education system, or to let local districts use state aid as they see fit.
Since the passage of Proposition 13, which capped local property tax increases in 1978, the share of school budgets borne by localities has shrunk dramatically, but the state is also bound by a later law that requires it to spend at least 40 percent of its general funds on elementary and secondary education. Mr. Wilson's proposals call for spending about 55 percent of the state's general funds on all education, from kindergarten through college, an investment in "human infrastructure" he justified as vital to California's future growth.
California's per pupil spending on education is well down on the list of states, a result of the Proposition 13 limits, but Mr. Wilson warned that "this should not become a state of educational haves and have-nots." Public opinion surveys have repeatedly shown that education is a top priority for state voters. It is expected to be a major issue in the coming race for Governor in which the Attorney General Dan Lungren, a Republican, will face one of a number of potential Democratic challengers, including Senator Dianne Feinstein.
At the same time, Mr. Wilson said the state could not ignore brick-and-mortar needs for new school classrooms, roads, bridges, water conservation programs and prisons, saying, "It is the right thing to do for our people," and adding, "It is also the right way to keep jobs coming."

Delectable Materialism Catching On in China

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Jan. 9

 BODY:
In her neat gray turtleneck, metal-frame glasses and black-and-white Swatch watch, Sang Yan, 27, well educated and thoughtful, could easily fit in on Manhattan's Upper West Side.
Her tastes in clothing, her search for quaint new restaurants, her hopes for a nice apartment are no different than those of her counterparts in much of the rest of the world. 
 She is stylish and aware, and loves to shop. But her shopping is bittersweet, because she must operate on such a stiff budget. Her job -- organizing international exhibitions for a Government-owned textile company -- gives her take-home pay of $182 a month. While that is double the wage of most workers and even many college professors, it does not buy many designer shoes.
What Ms. Sang does buy twice a week, along with 200,000 other Beijing residents for just 12 cents an issue, is the glossy, ad-packed newspaper called Fine Goods Shopping Guide. In the last couple of years this tabloid and a similar one called Shopping Guide have become among the hottest-selling items on Beijing newsstands.
They are the purest evidence that a new generation of Chinese has entered the global consumer culture, whether all can afford it or not.
"It's this way," said Wang Xiaoqian, 35, who makes a modest living as a marketer of Chinese liquor and is an avid reader of the shopping papers. "We've been exposed to the Western life style now, and we want to enjoy it too."
These papers avoid the political cant so common in publications here. They include some "service" articles for the modern, upward-climbing urban dweller: how to decorate that small apartment to make it seem bigger, what to do if your mobile phone is dropped into water, what shoes to wear with a white wedding gown, how to buy a car with monthly payments instead of cash.
These ad-fat, colorful tabloids carry cover stories on movie, soccer and rock stars and carry reviews of movies and restaurants and books. But most of all they are a platform for advertising: ads for video compact disk players and notebook computers, for clothes and cosmetics, for apartments and cars, for curtains and lamps and furniture, for exercise bikes and package vacations to Thailand or Europe, even for liposuction and breast enlargement. Many "articles," on close inspection, turn out to have a commercial sponsor.
There are also personal ads, read by everyone for amusement if not in earnest. Recent examples: "Female, divorced, has two-room house, good figure and appearance, looking for healthy, open-minded man." And, "Male, 29, manager in foreign enterprise, humorous, open-minded, good at computers, looking for pretty girl who loves life." A slice of urban society here has money by any standard and actually buys many of the products offered (though a truly affluent person, Ms. Sang said, would surely read still more upscale magazines like the Chinese version of Elle). But most readers can only shop with extraordinary care.
Mr. Wang and his wife, for example, far from being in the market for private apartments, must crowd in with his parents and an adult brother. His main luxury is a cellular phone -- a convenience and status symbol among young adults that costs more than $500 to buy and register, plus monthly usage fees. Still, the couple forages through the shopping papers.
"It's like window shopping," Mr. Wang said. "We want to see what's going on, what's in the market."
Ms. Sang says she can only buy nice clothes on sale, so she scours her shopping paper to see where the best sales are, as well as to get tips on interesting, inexpensive restaurants.
Private business and substantial foreign trade only got started under the reforms initiated in the late 1970's by Deng Xiaoping. Only in the last several years, as the economy took off, have many people had the money and -- as important -- the opportunity for serious shopping.
Abruptly, glitzy department stores and boutique shopping centers, carrying brands like Benetton, Nautica and Sony, appeared all over Beijing. Slick commercials on television, in magazines and in some newspapers constantly thrust the world of goods and gadgets into everyone's face.
A gaping generation gap has opened up. Like some Americans who suffered through the Great Depression, older Chinese who lived through wars and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of 1966-76 try to save every penny and cannot imagine spending, say, $60 for a shirt.
"My parents don't want to buy anything," Ms. Sang said. "They want me to send most of my salary to them so they can save it for me. They can't understand how I can spend so much in a month."
Ms. Sang, who has a degree in English from a prestigious foreign language institute here, is married to a freelance film editor.
They have what many consider the ideal arrangement, known as "one family, two systems." Through her job in a state enterprise, they get housing and medical benefits and security, if not much income. His private job offers risk but at least the possibility of real money.
They, too, are living with the husband's parents, but they are about to receive, through her Government work unit, a two-room apartment with rent that may be less than $20 a month.
For now, they are spending most of their combined income of $725 a month. But their deep hope, Ms. Sang said, is to save enough to buy that apartment, which may cost several thousand dollars. Then they want to have a baby. Ms. Sang fights off feeling guilty about their spending; they are not profligate, she feels sure. She describes a couple she knows who run through $1,200 a month.
"They eat out every night," she said. "They take taxis instead of buses. They are always going to bars or gyms or badminton courts. It's all costly."
The newspapers that cater to today's consumers took their cue from Deng, who in 1992 unleashed a campaign lending new impetus to what he called "market socialism."
Late that year, the first of the papers, Shopping Guide, was started up. New goods were streaming into the marketplace, and more people had a bit of extra money. But people had long been mired in the cant, and cold reality, of sacrifice.
"Producers needed a place to advertise, and consumers needed a place to learn about all the new goods," said the newspaper's editor, Zhao Yinong, 37. What more logical place than the Ministry of Light Industry -- itself a chief producer of consumer items -- to establish a new paper devoted to the art of better consuming.
It is a safe bet, Mr. Zhao agreed, that his semiweekly paper brings in much more profit to the ministry than does its sister publication, China Light Industry News.
Shopping Guide was swiftly followed by a competitor, Fine Goods Shopping Guide, which has since eclipsed it with newsstand sales twice a week of 200,000, double the impressive-enough record of the original. The newer paper is published, improbably, by an institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, an academic research center. Its editor said he was too busy for an interview.
Both papers started out slim, with a higher ratio of articles to ads, but now they both offer more than 60 pages each, with the articles often hard to locate. Of the two, Fine Goods Shopping Guide is a bit more more upscale and unabashedly devoted to the pursuit of the best of everything.
Mr. Zhao says his paper, by contrast, aims to serve average shoppers as well as the new rich, and it even has touches of Consumer Reports, including, for example, comparisons of the price of identical shampoos or mobile phones at 10 different stores.
"So we are a great help to the Government, helping to control prices," Mr. Zhao said.
Editors of the stodgy political papers that Government offices around the country are required to buy express envy at the enthusiastic readership and profitability of the shopping, entertainment and other lively newspapers that sell out at the newsstands.
In an apparent attempt to whip up some enthusiasm for itself, this week the Communist Party's mouthpiece, People's Daily, began a Monday economics section with financial and consumer news, a Wednesday society section and a Friday culture section.
It does not appear likely that many Shopping Guide readers will be lured. Wednesday's section carried the first of two articles on the high price of electricity in rural areas and a feature on the troubles of a heroic woman who was crippled while protecting state-owned sheep in a snowstorm. Friday's culture section described a major new television series tracing the life of the late Prime Minister Zhou Enlai.

HEADLINE: Affirmative Action's Unlikely Foes

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: LEXINGTON, Mass.

 BODY:
At first glance, Stephan and Abigail Thernstrom would seem an unlikely pair to lead the conservative charge against racial preference in America.
In earlier times, Mrs. Thernstrom, now 61 and a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, attended the "little Red schoolhouse," an elementary school for children of a leftist community in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.; sang songs with Pete Seeger, and voted for George McGovern for President. 
 In earlier times, Mr. Thernstom, now a distinguished 63-year-old history professor at Harvard, participated in Marxist study groups as a graduate student there, challenged loyalty oaths and other features of the McCarthy era, and protested the Bay of Pigs invasion.
By all rights, then, the Thernstroms would more likely be champions of affirmative action and all manner of other liberal causes.
Instead, they have emerged as influential voices on the right, thanks to their much-talked-about new book on race, "Black and White in America" (Simon & Schuster, 1997), and Mrs. Thernstrom's much-noticed appearance in December at President Clinton's town hall meeting on race in Akron, Ohio.
The couple are much in demand on the conservative talk-show circuit, where they forcefully argue that racial preferences are wrong, divisive and, as a tool to help minorities, overrated. They serve on the boards of conservative and libertarian public-policy institutes and acknowledge that in recent years they voted for Republican Presidential candidates for the first time in their lives -- Stephan in 1992, Abigail in 1996.
"Abby and Steve Thernstrom grew up on the left and went through a kind of disillusionment and came to the view that there was something canned and ideologically repressive about the left on race," said Jim Sleeper, an ideological soul mate who is the author of "Liberal Racism" (Viking, 1997).
While some may see a remarkable journey in all this, the Thernstroms say the truth is that they never left home. When it comes to race, they say, the issue is not how much they have changed, but how much the left has shifted from color-blindness to color-consciousness.
Seated on a sofa at the couple's home here in Lexington and stroking his ink-black cat, Aslan (named for a character in C. S. Lewis's "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"), Mr. Thernstrom recalled that in the early 1960's, he supported a bill in the Massachusetts legislature to eliminate all references to race, including the use of photographs, on applications for admission to state colleges.
"That seemed to me then absolutely the ideal -- you admit people without any reference to their race," he said. "And it still seems to be the ideal to me. What's different is that it was a radical idea in 1963, and now it's a so-called conservative idea."
In the 700 pages of their book, thickly packed with charts, footnotes and other references, the Thernstroms juxtapose criticism of racial preferences with an exposition of the remarkable progress they say blacks have made since the 1940's, when Gunnar Myrdal published his classic study "An American Dilemma," on the plight of African-Americans.
The Thernstroms' book argues not only that preferences are divisive but also, implicitly, that they are no longer necessary.
"We do not say that they make no difference whatsoever," Mrs. Thernstrom said. "We do say that they haven't made as much difference as is widely attributed to them and that they carry with them a very high cost. When it comes to race, the test of any public policy is, Will it bring us together or divide us? Preferences flunk that test."
Since publication of the book, the attacks from some on the left have been unrelenting.
Christopher Edley, a Harvard Law School professor who is a consultant to the President's race relations initiative, called the book a "crime against humanity" (a remark he now terms "regrettable"). Although Mr. Edley says he is eager for diverse voices to be heard in the race relations debate, he acknowleges that he strenuously (and unsuccessfully) lobbied to exclude the Thernstroms from a White House meeting that Mr. Clinton held with conservatives in December.
"My whole pitch," Mr. Edley said, "has been the search for the kernel of truth in what the other side is saying. But I think there are some participants, on the far left and the far right, who are too shrill and ideological to be helpful."
Some critics contend that the Thernstroms, in trying to demonstrate dramatic black progress and a lessening of white prejudice, misinterpreted the mountain of data in their book.
Andrew Hacker, professor of political science at Queens College and author of "Two Nations Black and White: Separate, Hostile and Unequal" (Ballantine, 1995), said:
"Here are two white people who are essentially lecturing black Americans, saying: 'What are you complaining about? Stop your griping. Here are the data. You're better off than ever before.' "
Suffused throughout much of their opponents' criticism is a notion that the Thernstroms' work is essentially payback for slights they have endured over the years from those they consider the liberal guardians of racial orthodoxy.
"I think their fixation on the culture wars of the last decade and proving their enemies, the racial liberals, are wrong has in some way distorted their vision and had consequences in the way they interpreted data," said Glen C. Loury, a professor of economics at Boston University.
Mrs. Thernstrom says that in the early 1980's, intimidated by a lawyer working for what she calls a mainstream civil rights organization, she was compelled to decline an invitation to testify at a Senate hearing on extending the Voting Rights Act.
At the time, Mrs. Thernstrom was researching her first book, "Whose Votes Count?: Affirmative Action and Minority Voting Rights" (Harvard University Press, 1987), a critique of the drawing of election districts with large majorities of blacks in order to promote the election of black lawmakers. By her account, the lawyer, whom she declines to identify, told her that if she testified against these so-called majority-minority districts, he would block access to people and data in the South that she needed to complete her book.
"I backed down," Mrs. Thernstrom said. "I never testified."
And in 1988, Mr. Thernstrom, who was among the first historians to use data like bank and home ownership records to trace the social mobility of ethnic groups, was accused by black students of making racially insensitive remarks in his lectures. Although cleared of any wrongdoing, he felt that Harvard's hierarchy had not adequately defended him.
But the Thernstroms vehemently deny that any past indignities influenced their latest work.
"We had some thoughts about writing such a book earlier," Mrs. Thernstrom recalled, "and I said to Steve on a number of occasions, 'You have to get beyond your anger about that situation before you touch this subject.' "
And while acknowledging that the tone of their book may at times be polemical, Mr. Thernstrom said it was difficult to quibble with their empirical findings.
"Whatever the possible truth of the psychological argument," he said, "it's really totally irrelevant to the truth claims of the book."
Yet colleagues and opponents alike say the Thernstroms, especially Mrs. Thernstrom, can be thin-skinned, and at least one former friend says they have a tendency to lash out when criticized.
Mr. Loury, once a close friend of the couple, says the relationship became strained in recent years as he moved somewhat to the left and they, in his view, moved more to the right.
Last year The Atlantic asked him to review their book, and he sent them a draft, which was critical. They sent back a note, he says, that called the review "morally reprehensible, intellectually dishonest and indefensibly nasty."
Mr. Loury and the Thernstroms stopped speaking to each other, although in recent weeks they have begun trying to patch things up.
Asked about Mr. Loury's review, Mrs. Thernstrom said: "I won't talk about Glen Loury, because I don't think it's a story about our book. I think it's a story about our relationship. And that's all I will say."
When her husband started to add something, Mrs. Thernstrom aimed her stocking foot at his shin.
"And," she said forcefully, "I am not going to talk about it."

Strong Performers Look at '98

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
THOUGH United States stock fund managers turned in a terrific average return of nearly 24 percent for all of last year, the final quarter was much trickier to navigate. They had to contend with ever-growing problems in Asia and the resulting stock market turbulence worldwide -- and many managers fared poorly at year-end.
One who did not was Bill Nygren, who runs the Oakmark Select fund. Not only did he post a stellar one-year return, but his performance for the quarter gained him a top-20 ranking among United States diversified funds with $30 million or more in assets. Also in that league for the quarter were Samuel C. Harvey, manager of Hilliard Lyons Growth, and Irving Levine of the Copley fund. 
 Christian A. Felipe, meanwhile, had a great year managing the MFS Strategic Growth fund, but a big drop in one holding in December trimmed his fund's gain for the fourth quarter.
What went right, or wrong, for them over the year? Each takes a look at the past -- and a stab at what might happen in 1998.
 
The Cable Connection
Under Bill Nygren, the 14-month-old Oakmark Select fund gained 55 percent last year, to finish second in the diversified domestic stock group. And Mr. Nygren is optimistic about 1998.
Oakmark Select, with $514 million in assets, is a concentrated portfolio of midsize and large stocks. The fund holds only 19 issues, and annual turnover is a low 34 percent of assets.
"Our style is long-term value, which focuses more on reducing risk then maximizing return," Mr. Nygren said. "Fortunately," he added, "in 1997 there were no big disasters" in his holdings.
A big position in cable television helped cement his high return last year. Holdings included Liberty Media, at 15 percent of assets; Cablevision Systems, 5 percent, and U S West Media Group, 5 percent.
"The cable industry fell out of favor in 1996 because of concerns that they would lose customers to satellite and telephone companies, but the consensus was wrong," Mr. Nygren said. "Telephone companies have backed away in favor of voice and data, and satellite businesses haven't grown as fast as anticipated."
The takeover of First USA (15 percent of the fund last January) by Banc One also helped.
Mr. Nygren says he searches for stocks selling at a large discount to what the company would fetch in a private transaction. Lower interest rates and a strong economy have pushed up prices paid for businesses, he said. But private values have also risen, and he sees no problem with current valuations, though others call them high.
With a return of 8.3 percent for the fourth quarter -- compared with an average loss of nearly 1 percent for the diversified group -- Oakmark Select ranked 11th among those funds. Mr. Nygren says that was helped by a 50 percent gain in Cablevision Systems, one of his five biggest holdings going into the quarter.
 
Concerned About Asia
Asia is a big worry of Samuel C. Harvey, who runs the $57 million Hilliard Lyons Growth fund, which took first place for the quarter among diversified funds, with a gain of 13.4 percent.
The fund did well for the year, too, with a return of 40.4 percent, but Mr. Harvey is not optimistic about 1998. "The last three years have been times when all the good things that can happen to you in investing did," he said. "It's hard to believe that's going to continue."
As for Asia, "it's less of a concern for the companies that we own, which primarily operate in Europe and the United States," he said, "but we suspect that ultimately what's happening there will have an impact on investor confidence here."
Like Oakmark Select, Hilliard Lyons Growth owns just a handful of large and midsize companies (currently 25 stocks) and has low turnover (just 25 percent). Mr. Harvey built up cash, doubling the position to 20 percent by the end of the year because "some of our stocks became so popular that we decided to cut back," he said. "It's our goal to be fully invested, but it's slow going now finding stocks at a good price."
Financial stocks account for one-third of the fund, with the biggest holdings being Cincinnati Financial and American International Group. "Prices have gone up quite a lot, so they don't have the advantage of being priced attractively right now, but we'll stick with what we have," Mr. Harvey said.
The fund holds no technology stocks. Mr. Harvey looks for companies that have some long-term advantage compared with their rivals; with technology companies, he said, it is difficult to figure how long the competitive edge will last.
 
Utility Shakeout Gives a Lift
Irving Levine is the manager and largest shareholder of the quirky $83 million Copley fund. He attributes his fourth-quarter gain of 11.5 percent -- earning Copley third place among diversified funds -- to the effects of the Asian turmoil and a stock market that he considers expensive.
"If there's a slight trepidation in the stock market, there's a flight to our type of stocks," Mr. Levine said. Copley buys stocks that pay high dividends, are heavily traded and have a history of dividend increases. About 55 percent of the fund is in utilities, he said. When interest rates fall, these stocks tend to do well.
Mr. Levine is not optimistic about the market this year. "I think earnings will not come up to plan, so many stocks won't rise in 1998 for a long time," he said. "Maybe by the fourth quarter they'll right themselves."
Copley is unusual in that it is also an industrial corporation, wholesaling imported handbags. That allows it to exclude 70 percent of its dividend income from taxation, so the fund pays taxes itself and does not make distributions to shareholders. Shareholders then pay taxes on gains only when they redeem their shares.
For most shareholders, this means the tax-adjusted return is about three percentage points higher than a comparable return on another fund, Mr. Levine said.
Helping the fund's big year-end gain, Mr. Levine said, were its holdings in acquisition targets like Colonial Gas, the CT Energy Corporation and Delta Natural Gas.
 
Cautious on Technology
Christian A. Felipe, manager of the $126 million MFS Strategic Growth fund, is more pessimistic than not about the new year. "We think Asia will have a material impact on inflation and the corporate profit outlook," he said, "so we're trying to find places that can grow in the face of a global slowdown."
With a return of 50.4 percent on its A shares, the fund, which buys large growth stocks around the world, garnered fourth place for the year in the diversified group. And that would have been higher but for a fourth-quarter gain of only 3.6 percent.
The fund started the year with a 40 percent weighting in technology, but that was pared back to 30 percent by year-end because of price increases and Asia worries. "We're not avoiding technology, we're just being more selective," Mr. Felipe said. The fund's biggest position, in fact, is Microsoft, at 9 percent of assets.
It was the fund's sizable exposure to a software company, Oracle, that depressed its quarterly return, he said. Oracle stock fell 29 percent in one day in December after earnings fell far short of forecasts. Still, Mr. Felipe said he remained a big believer in the stock for the long term.
In late summer, Mr. Felipe began buying domestic retail stocks, which he figures "have no exposure to the Asian currency crisis." Significant consolidation in that industry also helped his return, he said.
For example, Safeway and Fred Meyer, two grocery chains the fund owns a stake in, are consolidating in California, "which should create a more stable pricing environment along with the improving California economy," Mr. Felipe said. Among pharmacies, the fund has benefited from combinations of Rite Aid and Thrifty Payless and of CVS and Revco.

There's Strength in Diversity

BYLINE: By VIRGINIA MUNGER KAHN 

 BODY:
RAY POLESE, a savings plan administrator at Lucent Technologies, decided to take the plunge with his own money about a year ago. He sold all the fixed-income investments in his personal 401(k) retirement plan and put the money into three stock funds and Lucent stock. "I started to listen to our financial education programs," Mr. Polese, 49, said. "If you have time before retirement, you should be more aggressive."
Alex Shervet, 34, a software engineer with the Echelon Corporation in Palo Alto, Calif., puts all his 401(k) money in Brandywine, a growth-stock fund. 
 Sound familiar? Financial advisers continue to recommend a major position in stocks for long-term investors -- even people nearing retirement who have other sources of income like pensions. But they are taking pains to emphasize the importance of diversity in 1998.
"Most people coming to us really don't understand what diversification is," said Lou Stanasolovich, president of Legend Financial Advisors in Pittsburgh. "Typically, they're loaded up on large U.S. equities, and most think the market can go nowhere but up."
Mr. Shervet is a case in point. Though Brandywine lost 14 percent in the fourth quarter, he is unbowed. "When I see significant drops, I don't like it," he said, "but I fully expect the fund to come back. It's a cyclical thing. By the time I need my money, it'll be back in good shape."
Portfolio concentrations like his are not for lack of choice. Most retirement plans that allow individuals to make their own investments have added to their menus. The average plan now offers seven choices, and most plans are continuing to fine-tune the offerings. Last year, 32 percent of 401(k) plans introduced at least one new investment option, according to Access Research of Windsor, Conn., a division of the Spectrem Group, a financial services consulting firm. The most popular addition was an international stock fund.
Before jumping into the new choices, investors should review how their portfolios are divided among stocks -- large and small, foreign and domestic -- bonds and cash.
"Asset allocation is the main determinant of portfolio performance," said Jeffrey Schwartz, senior consultant at Ibbotson Associates, the investment consulting firm that pioneered historical asset allocation analysis. "Regardless of which stocks or funds you pick, the majority of your performance is driven by the underlying asset classes."
Even if you settled a while ago on a firm asset allocation that you expected to fit your risk profile for some time, you might have drifted far away from your plan. The stock market's outsized returns the last 12 months mean that an investor who had sought a portfolio mix of 60 percent stocks, 30 percent bonds and 10 percent cash in December 1996 now probably has about 72 percent stocks, 22 percent in bonds and just 6 percent in cash.
The problem is "if there's an equity correction, you're more vulnerable than you thought," said Ned Notzon, executive vice president for the T. Rowe Price Spectrum Income and Spectrum Growth funds.
By mixing stocks and bonds and cash, investors can lower their portfolio risks, according to historical investment returns. Between 1970 and 1996, a United States stock portfolio that included just a dash of foreign equities (20 percent) was less volatile and returned more than an all-United States stock portfolio, 13.8 percent a year versus 13.5 percent, Mr. Schwartz noted.
"You never know what's going to be the best performer," said William McNabb, managing director at Vanguard Institutional Investor Group. Stocks can underperform other investments for a long period. For example, in the 1970's, both intermediate-term government bonds and long-term corporate bonds outperformed large-company stocks.
Anyone heavily in equities is probably looking at bonds now. The fundamentals are "quite compelling," said Theodore Giuliano, fixed-income chief investment officer at Neuberger & Berman, the big fund company. Not only is inflation quiescent and the dollar strong, which should keep foreign investors interested in United States bonds, but supply is contracting with the decline in the Federal deficit. While stocks and bonds have moved more in harmony in recent years, he said, intermediate-term bonds still reduce portfolio volatility.
And Mr. Guiliano wonders how much longer American stocks can provide such extraordinary returns. Long term, United States stock returns have averaged 11 percent, but they have been more than double that over the last three years.
Todd Eberhard, president of Eberhard Investment Associates in New York, is investing clients' money roughly evenly between stocks and bonds. He says bonds can provide double-digit returns this year as interest rates continue to fall.
Prudence suggests that equities remain a big component of many portfolios. Participants in 401(k) plans have been responding to the bull market for stocks and to financial education by plan sponsors that shows that equities beat other investments over the long haul. At the end of 1997, 54 percent of plan assets were estimated to be in equities, primarily stock funds but also company stock, compared with 42 percent at the end of 1994, said Jeffrey Close, marketing director Spectrem.
BUT what's true for the group is not true for individuals. While some people remain wedded to fixed-income accounts, plenty of people became far more heavily weighted in stocks and stock funds. Consider Mr. Shervet, who has everything in Brandywine.
And he's not even the extreme. At least his fund splits its assets among many stocks, more than 400 at last count. David Morris, 58, a staff manager in Lucent's human resources department, is betting heavily on just one stock: Lucent. At the end of 1996, he decided to put 60 percent of his payroll 401(k) contributions into Lucent shares, up from 50 percent the previous year. In 1997, Lucent gained 74 percent percent, well ahead of the broad market. "I feel Lucent has a very, very bright future," he said. "I minimize my risk somewhat by splitting my money with a stable value fund." He also owns five big-company stocks in an outside account.
While that strategy worked well for him last year, financial advisers consider it one of the riskiest maneuvers. A downturn at an employer -- and one company is much more vulnerable than a pool of companies -- could mean a job loss as well as a loss in his retirement portfolio.
Investing not just among American stocks, but among foreign stocks, too, remains the recommendation of many financial advisers. Many foreign markets, notably the beleagured Asia ones, have not done as well as the domestic stock market recently. But believers in worldwide diversity expect a dollop of foreign stocks to help offset any downturn in domestic shares. For periods of foreign outperformance, they need only go back to the mid-1980's. A basket of foreign stocks far outperformed United States stocks from 1983 through 1988, with returns of 33.9 percent and 16.5 percent, respectively, according to Ibbotson.
"Diversifying into foreign markets makes you less susceptible to a problem here," said Mr. Notzon of T. Rowe Price.
A few days ago, Mr. Polese bought into the argument, shifting 10 percent of his payroll contributions to an international stock fund. It's one of eight new choices in the Lucent plan, which has 123,000 participants. "Based on everything that's been going on," Mr. Polese said, "this is probably an opportune time."
The theory is that foreign markets have not had the big run-up of the United States market -- indeed, some have been beaten down -- and may offer more value going forward.
Mr. Shervet, for one, is not convinced. "If there's a downturn, foreign companies will feel it just as much," he said. "I'd rather pay close attention to the American economy."
PORTFOLIO diversification is particularly important for people who may be tapping their investments within five years. Harold Gibbs, quality manager at Cartwright Electronics in Fullerton, Calif., has 75 percent of his investments in two balanced funds, which tend to hold 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds. He is 61 and may retire in four years. "I wouldn't want to be caught with the market at a low and have to be withdrawing money at that time," he said. "I feel very comfortable with my investments because I'm well diversified."
Finally, some investors have the luxury of putting most of their retirement capital on autopilot. That is the case with Edwin K. Weiss, 59, a pilot with Trans World Airlines. He puts two-thirds of his company's contributions into a moderate portfolio, which is 65 percent in stock funds, and the remainder of those contributions in an aggressive portfolio, which is 80 percent in stock funds. Each portfolio is rebalanced by the plan's manager whenever an asset class moves 3 percent or more above these targets. His own contributions go into a separate plan that he himself rebalances every quarter. As a result, Mr. Weiss has kept his retirement portfolio 80 percent in stocks, with the rest in bonds and cash.
"Hopefully," he said, "my moderate portfolio will handle a case where the market comes down hard."

Bonds May Win the Catbird Seat

BYLINE: By ABBY SCHULTZ 

 BODY:
A TUMBLE in long-term bond rates in the infant days of 1998 could be the beginning of good news for investors who have been moving holdings into bond funds, seeking a haven from the world's tumultuous equity markets.
Long-term rates dropped to their lowest level in nearly 30 years last week after Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, cited the possibility of deflation, or widespread price declines, and gave market professionals reason to hope that the Fed would lower short-term interest rates. And bond rates could fall further, some analysts say, if the Asian financial crisis slows the American economy by more than the market now projects. All in all, many expect bond funds to outperform stock funds this year for the first time since 1993. 
 Mutual fund investors also seem to be betting that way, having stepped up their investments in bond funds in the last three months of 1997. From the stock market skid in late October until mid-December, the rate at which cash flowed into bond funds doubled to $1.3 billion a week, as measured by a four-week moving-average, according to AMG Data Services, which tracks mutual fund cash flows. The rate of money flowing into stock funds slowed from $3.6 billion a week in late October to $1.7 billion a week by mid-December. And for three weeks during the period, stock funds suffered redemptions totaling $2.4 billion.
"There is clearly some reallocation to the bond market from the stock market," said Robert Adler, president of AMG Data.
And that could continue, some portfolio managers say. James E. Conroy, lead manager of the Smith Barney Government Securities fund, for example, says the Asian crisis runs deeper than is generally believed. As a result, he sees the 30-year Treasury yield slipping from the current 5.73 percent -- the lowest since the Government began issuing the bond regularly, in 1977 -- to 5.5 percent by the end of the first quarter and to 5 percent by year-end.
"We're in uncharted territory," he said, adding that he thought the Federal Reserve would lower rates by the end of the first quarter.
Mr. Conroy's fund posted one of the best performances among domestic intermediate bond funds last year, with a return of 11.2 percent, according to Morningstar Inc., the fund tracking firm in Chicago.
This year, analysts project bond fund returns will be in the 7 percent to 11 percent range, while stocks could be poised for a breather after a long bull market.
If bonds gain on stocks, it would fit a historical pattern: Whenever stocks have outperformed intermediate-term bonds by an annualized average return of nine or more percentage points over a five-year period, the difference between bond and stock returns has narrowed considerably over the next five-year period, according to Ibbotson Associates, the Chicago research firm.
In the most recent period studied by Ibbotson, stocks beat bonds by nine percentage points for the five years ended in 1996; historically speaking, the two sectors' performance should be more in sync.
But others are less sanguine about bonds. While they agree that bonds could be the better investment in 1998, they expect inflation threats to end the rally that began last year. That would force investors to be satisfied with returns of 6 percent to 8 percent for the year -- a far cry from the top returns of 1997.
Rates of long-term securities fell more than a percentage point in the last half-year, helping the average long-term Treasury fund post a total return of 11.99 percent and the average intermediate Government fund to return 8.41 percent for the year, according to Morningstar. Over all, taxable bond funds, including Treasuries and corporate and international holdings, returned 8.85 percent last year. That is well below the 23.72 percent return of the average diversified domestic stock fund, but it is more than respectable for bonds.
Can long-term rates get any lower? Yes, said William H. Gross, who oversees bond investing at the Pacific Investment Management Company, or Pimco.
He, too, predicts that the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond will dip as low as 5.5 percent, and that the Federal Reserve will ease monetary policy sooner rather than later, by half a percentage point. These predictions are based on his expectation that the United States economy will weaken substantially. "That weak economy really comes from Asia," he said.
Some managers of big bond funds, like Ian A. MacKinnon, who heads fixed-income investments at the Vanguard Group, are staking out a middle ground. Mr. MacKinnon, who led Vanguard Fixed-Income Long-Term Treasury to a 13.9 percent return in 1997, predicts that the crisis in Asia will slow the economy, but says the effect might be mitigated by higher inflation in the United States.
Mr. MacKinnon does not see much capital appreciation from bonds in 1998. Still, he added, "bonds are a better buy than stocks right now," because stock prices are likely to be hurt as companies grapple with an influx of cheap Asian imports, while their own labor costs rise at home.
William J. Curtin, chief investment officer for fixed income at Putnam Investments, is one of the most bearish managers of big bond funds. He expects Asia's financial difficulties to stabilize, allowing growth in the United States to remain strong. That could lead the Fed to push up interest rates to avert inflation, he said.
Similarly, Fred Robertson, chief investment officer of fixed income at Nicholas-Applegate Capital Management, expects economic growth to pick up after six months, with yields on long-term bonds moving up to 6.5 percent to 7 percent.

Dazzling Returns Bring a Cash Surge to Junk Bonds

BYLINE: By ABBY SCHULTZ 

 BODY:
Junk bond funds were among the best-performing bond funds last year. So, unsurprisingly, they are getting an influx of cash.
AMG Data Services, which tracks mutual fund cash flows, says that in the last three months of the year, junk funds -- those investing in high-risk, high-return corporate debt -- received the most cash of any investment category. In December, more than $5 billion a week flowed into high-yield bond funds, AMG said. 
 These funds posted a return of 12.17 percent on average last year, according to Morningstar Inc., the fund tracking firm. For investors accustomed to double-digit stock market returns, yet getting nervous about equities, the yield on junk looked more desirable than Treasury yields of 6 percent and less. And default rates on junk "went almost to the vanishing point" in last year's strong economy, said Martin Fridson, chief high-yield strategist at Merrill Lynch & Company.
Investors should be wary of chasing past performance in the high-yield arena, however. Weakness in the economy may make it more difficult for managers of high-yield funds to match last year's stellar returns. Still, the United States is unlikely to fall into recession, and that makes high-yield securities more a "hold" than a "sell," said William Gross, head of bond investing at the Pacific Investment Management Company. "Investors will still have confidence in those corporations that pay the interest," he said.
The best course for many investing outside tax-sheltered retirement accounts, said Ian A. MacKinnon, who heads fixed-income investments at the Vanguard Group, may be to invest in long-term, tax-exempt municipal bonds. Munis, he said, are "extremely attractive" relative to the yield on Treasury securities.
Last year, the average long-term, national municipal bond fund returned 8.77 percent, compared with 10.16 percent for the average taxable long-term bond fund. But the muni fund looks better after taxes. For an investor in the 28 percent income tax bracket, taxes would cut the yield on the taxable fund to 7.32 percent; in the top, 39.6 percent bracket, it would be 6.14 percent. ABBY SCHULTZ

HEADLINE: From Gurus to Sitting Ducks

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Mark Landler has covered the media and telecommunications industries for seven years. He will become The Times's correspondent in Hong Kong later this year.

 BODY:
EARLY one morning last July, five of the media industry's most powerful executives gathered around a table before a select audience in a windowless conference room at Idaho's Sun Valley Lodge. It was a formidable lineup: Rupert Murdoch, Gerald Levin, David Geffen, Barry Diller and Edgar Bronfman Jr. And because this was the annual conference run by the investment firm Allen & Company, the atmosphere was aggressively casual -- just five guys in chinos and polo shirts chatting about world domination.
On this particular morning, though, the tycoons were about to be taken down a notch. 
 Andrew S. Grove, the chief executive of Intel, the world's largest maker of computer chips, moderated the discussion. Or more precisely, he commandeered it. Mr. Grove's complaint was that the five panelists were Luddites. Digital technology and the Internet were transforming the worlds of media and entertainment, but these captains of industry were resisting the change.
"They don't get technology, and they think it poses a threat to their core business," Mr. Grove declared in an interview that recalled his comments in the closed-door session.
Maybe the media executives are right to be scared. It is unfashionable in this era of techno-intoxication to suggest that technology could result in anything but boundless growth. But for traditional media companies, the digital age poses genuine danger. The Internet and other new types of media could radically alter the economics of the business. By splintering the mass market into a kaleidoscope of narrow niches, technology is threatening to deprive Time Warner, Walt Disney, Viacom and their peers of the mass audiences on which they depend for advertising revenues and profits.
"The fundamental premises of the media business have been eroding even as the big firms have engaged in high-wire deal-making," said Reed E. Hundt, the former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, who also sat on the panel and offered his own Cassandra-like pronouncements about the future of the industry.
As 1998 begins, worries about technology have left the media industry in a deeply ambivalent mood. On one hand, the stock prices of some of the industry's most visible companies -- notably Time Warner -- have soared to record highs lately after several years of anemic performance.
On the other hand, the media chiefs have been stripped of their role as the intellectual trendsetters of the communications industry. At the annual Sun Valley gatherings, Sumner M. Redstone of Viacom and John C. Malone of Tele-Communications Inc. used to dazzle with visions of the information highway: hundreds of channels, movies at the touch of a button, home shopping, and so on. But increasingly, computer and software executives are generating the new ideas and setting the trends. Now, the moguls seem almost like relics next to the likes of Andy Grove and William H. Gates.
At the Allen & Company conference last July, for example, the normally voluble media executives offered only a token response to Mr. Grove's assault. Howard Stringer, the president of the Sony Corporation of America, was in the audience that morning, and he recalled that the group appeared to be thrown off balance by the criticism.
"The traditional media guys seemed to be on the outside looking in," said Mr. Stringer, who spent 30 years in a bastion of traditional media, CBS.
A few media companies have benefited from the techno-mania: The cable operator Comcast, for example, recently secured a $1 billion investment from Microsoft to outfit its coaxial network with high-speed Internet connections.
But many other companies face a future of huge capital spending with an uncertain payoff -- broadcast networks that must prepare for the coming of digital television, for example, and cable operators that must upgrade their aging wires. And many of the executives no longer have the luxury to be visionaries. They are busy grappling with problems that are the legacy of 10 years of furious empire-building -- a period that could reasonably be called the Media Decade. Viacom, the News Corporation and Disney have all been hurt by failed initiatives, internal squabbling, and weak links in their far-flung operations.
And so the chiefs, who once looked like New Age prophets, now seem more like Moses wandering in a desert where the old assumptions no longer apply and the future is more of a threat than an opportunity.
"The problem is, they were wrong. They've been discredited," said Frank J. Biondi Jr., a longtime media executive who has generally shunned sweeping pronouncements and is now the chief executive of Universal Studios. "Gurus only remain gurus as long as they're right."
 
Ushering In a Media Decade
The Media Decade began in 1986, when all three television networks changed hands in a single year. Those deals turned a spotlight on a business that had generally been shunned by Wall Street because of its unpredictable profits and idiosyncratic management.
Over the next 10 years, the industry set off on a spree of promiscuous deal-making. A result was conglomerates like Time Warner, Viacom and Disney, which snapped up both creators of programming (film studios, magazine and book publishers) and distributors of it (broadcast and cable networks, satellite services and home-video retailers).
The executives justified the bloated deals with dubious talk of "synergy," but Wall Street bought the line. "We have a long history in this country of assuming that the heads of the most lucrative industries must be the wisest sages," said Mark Crispin Miller, a professor of media studies at Johns Hopkins University.
Of course, the executives' empires still relied on the same economic models that had supported mass media since the days of William S. Paley and David Sarnoff, the founders, respectively, of CBS and RCA. The companies produce movies and television shows intended to attract the broadest audiences, enabling theaters to sell the tickets and networks the advertising that ultimately underwrite mass entertainment.
Nobody exploited this formula better than Barry Diller, the shrewd television programmer who helped start the Fox network, introducing Bart Simpson to millions of young viewers. Mr. Diller became a sort of Yoda of the information age when he left Fox in 1992 and set off on a nationwide search for the Next Big Thing. What he discovered was home shopping -- an unapologetically cheesy business of peddling quilted pillows and costume jewelry over cable television.
By harnessing digital technology, Mr. Diller promised to transform home shopping into "electronic retailing," a dazzling interactive medium that would forever change the way Americans used their televisions. Few of Mr. Diller's more ambitious plans ever materialized, and he wound up using his home-shopping channel as the vehicle for a run at an old-fashioned movie studio, Paramount Pictures. Now, Mr. Diller is using another shopping channel as a platform to create another television network. In October, he agreed to pay $4 billion to acquire the television assets of Universal Studios, including the USA cable network.
Mr. Diller may not have unleashed the revolution, but he did understand that television was changing in some basic ways. Digital transmission was turning the TV set from a "dumb" box beaming a few programs at a time to big audiences into a video jukebox from which individual viewers could select the information in which they were interested. Soon, every media chief picked up the siren call of interactivity.
In 1994, Gerald M. Levin, the chairman of Time Warner, trumpeted plans for the company's Orlando, Fla., cable system, which would offer movies on demand and an electronic shopping mall. "When I turn on my television," he rhapsodized the previous year, "I'll be able to switch to anything, anywhere." Similarly, Mr. Malone, as chairman of the nation's largest cable operator, promised to deliver viewers a 500-channel world.
The media chiefs believed that their revenues would explode if they could offer viewers an endlessly varied menu of programming options. What few of them realized was that the technology for genuine interactivity was still years away -- and that no economic model had been devised to support it.
In the meantime, by rushing from mass to niche programming, they were whittling away the economic underpinnings of their business.
 
Viewers Look Elsewhere
Mass media, of course, had been splintering ever since the emergence of cable television in the 1970's. But with the onset of digital technology and the Internet, the fragmentation is accelerating. The Big Three networks, for example, saw their share of the prime-time television audience dip below 50 percent for the first time ever last season.
It is the Internet, in particular, that has media executives spooked. They did nothing to develop it and little to popularize it. And even now, though they all maintain sites on the World Wide Web -- some of them, like the Disney-owned ESPN Sportzone, are extremely popular -- it is not clear how genuinely the media chiefs embrace the Net.
While computer executives see the Internet as a vast new business opportunity, media executives worry about losing television viewers. At the Sun Valley conference, Mr. Grove drew a tart response from Mr. Diller when he showed a chart asserting that in families who routinely use home computers, TV viewership drops by 50 percent. "The drop-off is nowhere near what he claims," Mr. Diller said.
For media executives, the big problem is that they have been resoundingly unsuccessful in squeezing a profit out of the Web.
"The Internet is like the library at Alexandria," Mr. Levin said. "It is enormous, free and democratic, but how you make money on it is not clear yet."
Time Warner, perhaps the industry's most technologically committed company, operates more than 190 Web sites. It has devoted four years and tens of millions of dollars to create one of the largest sites, called Pathfinder, where Time Warner magazines that cost money on the newsstand can be sampled free. But while it generates about $10 million a year in advertising revenue, according to insiders, Pathfinder still loses $10 million a year.
On cable, meanwhile, where digital technology is allowing the giants to edge closer to their vaunted 500-channel universe, the dial is filling up with safe choices rather than the diversity that big media companies seemed to promise. Cable subscribers in New York City, for example, can watch the news on CNN, Headline News, CNBC, MSNBC, New York 1 and the Fox News Channel, in addition to local broadcast stations. Other than for the biggest news events, most of these draw puny ratings.
Other choices on the dial -- American Movie Classics, Turner Classic Movies, Nick at Nite -- have particularly loyal viewers. But they exist not so much to slake a public thirst as to recycle material stored in the vast film and television libraries owned by the moguls' companies. Television may not be the vast wasteland that Newton N. Minow once described, but it is beginning to look a lot like a rummage sale.
A few outlets, notably Time Warner's Home Box Office, continue to produce fresh original programming. But for the most part, more is proving to be the enemy of good. The reason is simple economics.
"As you go from 35 channels to 75 channels, you diminish the audience for everything," Mr. Stringer of Sony explained. "That makes it harder to generate the advertising revenue for quality programming."
That phenomenon already prevails on network television. Andrew Lack, the president of NBC News, said he had no trouble persuading his network to schedule a fourth weekly installment of the news magazine "Dateline NBC" last fall. It wasn't that viewers were clamoring for another fix of Jane Pauley and Stone Phillips; they might have welcomed a new drama, instead. But in the diminished world of network television, "Dateline" is a cheap way to draw a reliable audience, while costly original dramas are just too risky.
The squeeze will become even more acute with the introduction of digital TV this summer, which will allow broadcasters to transmit six programs, instead of one, on a single channel, or else to transmit that single channel in a crystal-clear, high-definition form. With the cost for the conversion to digital TV running into the billions, the networks are wringing their hands about how to use the technology. And why not? They rightly worry that they will not be able to squeeze another nickel out of their advertisers, let alone come up with anything original to broadcast.
Peter Georgescu, the chairman of the ad agency Young & Rubicam, likens the situation to the consumer products business. As companies like Procter & Gamble flood supermarket shelves with "new, improved" soaps and detergents, the profusion of brands turns each product into a commodity. Mr. Georgescu says the media business is entering a similar era, where excess supply is chasing inadequate demand.
 
Will the Paranoid Survive?
To hear Andy Grove and Reed Hundt talk, the media industry is about where the horse-and-buggy business was when Henry Ford first cranked up his assembly line. Mr. Hundt said that people no longer wanted to consume news or entertainment passively. In the future, he predicted, all media would be interactive. And, Mr. Grove said, the Internet could enable advertisers to bypass the conventional media altogether and pitch their products directly, and in targeted fashion, to consumers over their PC's.
"This could be an even bigger deal than what is happening to the telecommunications and personal computing industries," said Mr. Grove in his aptly titled book, "Only the Paranoid Survive," which sums up the arguments he made at Sun Valley.
Media executives dismiss such doomsaying as naive.
"These guys say that movies and TV shows are antique forms of entertainment," Mr. Diller said. "But to think that passive entertainment is going to end is absurd."
He has a point. From "Seinfeld" to James Cameron's "Titanic," television programs and films still have the power to draw mass audiences. Moreover, the media executives' old contentions about the power of their pipelines into the home are getting a new hearing. Shares of Time Warner and TCI have rebounded in the last year, largely because of renewed hopes that cable networks can provide high-speed connections to the Internet. Microsoft and Intel may be frustrated with the media companies, but that has not stopped them from negotiating a bewildering array of deals with them.
Nor is it clear that Mr. Grove or Mr. Gates are any more qualified to divine the future than the media giants whom they seem to have trumped. Right now, the techies are riding high. But there is every reason to believe that they will eventually be hoist by their own petards. In the information age, breakthroughs inevitably become yesterday's news. As the technology executives fall prey to the seductions of the media business, what's to stop their paradigm from collapsing around them?
Perhaps that is why Mr. Levin, a corporate survivor who has ridden every up and down of the Media Decade, seemed less ruffled than some of his colleagues by Mr. Grove's scolding at Sun Valley. Mr. Levin dismissed those comments as "theatrics," and argued that more attention should be paid to ideas than to celebrity executives.
Indeed, Mr. Levin threw cold water on the whole notion that the group who charted the Media Decade's trajectory was ever so elite. The industry, he said, is entering its most fertile period since the 1920's, when radio and talking pictures exploded onto the scene. Yet "one of the things we're lacking," Mr. Levin said, "is a lot of the seminal thinkers and entrepreneurs."
A convenient thought, perhaps, as the sun sets on the moguls' Technicolor dreams.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds Report;
The Money Keeps Rolling In for Variable Annuities

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
WHEN Congress cut the capital gains tax last summer, financial analysts predicted a plunge in variable annuity sales.
After all, annuities are intended to provide shelter from taxes for retirement savings. They are part life insurance, which allows taxes to be deferred until money is withdrawn, and part mutual fund, meaning that returns vary, depending on how the money is invested. 
 With taxes of less concern, people might shift to buying plain old mutual funds, which have smaller fees than annuities and no penalties for early withdrawal.
But sales of variable annuities are cruising along. When the tally is completed, the total for 1997 is expected to hit $85 billion, says the Variable Annuity Research and Data Service in Atlanta. That would put sales growth at 17 percent for the year, down from the 47 percent surge in 1996 but still quite strong.
Ever mindful of the threat to their business, a handful of companies that sell variable annuities -- including Fidelity Investments, Nationwide Insurance and the Vanguard Group -- have cut their expenses in recent months, and some specialists expect more companies to join in.
Lower costs may help keep the fire burning, but even without such tactics, variable annuities have a strong following. The reason is that plenty of Americans are more interested in a measure of safety than in maximizing their investment returns.
Buyers of variable annuities tend to be people approaching retirement who worry that they will not have enough money to see them through. They are in their mid-50's, with perhaps a couple of years of college and household incomes of $50,000 or less.
Typically, they have put their money into savings accounts and certificates of deposit, and some have ventured into bonds. But stocks have scared them. Variable annuities let them participate in the stock market without risking everything.
"These are people who have not saved enough money for retirement, but, who, by the same token, cannot afford to risk much money," said Diane Blakeslee, a financial planner in San Luis Obispo, Calif., who works on commission. "With a variable annuity, I can get someone to invest a little more aggressively."
The security comes in several forms, but there are two features written into all the contracts. When an investor dies, his heirs get back at least the original investment, even if he has invested in a stock fund that has plunged in the meantime. Also, an investor who chooses to get periodic payments instead of a lump sum and who has begun making withdrawals will receive payments for the rest of his life. "You can't outlive your money," said Joseph W. Jordan, the senior vice president for marketing at the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.
There is a trade-off for this added sense of security. Investors usually must pay a penalty to the insurance company of up to 7 percent of their investment if they cash out within seven years. They must also pay a government penalty of 10 percent if they cash in before age 59.
These restrictions, absent from mutual funds, are one reason Richard Lee, a fee-only financial planner in Dallas, discourages customers from buying variable annuities.
But Mary Merrill, a fee-only planner in Madison, Wis., sees these qualities as virtues. "I don't want people to have the temptation of that money being available to spend," she said. "This is kind of forcing them to save for later years."
Either way, variable annuities really make sense only after people have made the maximum contributions to individual retirement accounts, 401(k)'s and other retirement plans that provide an immediate reduction in income tax. Unlike I.R.A.'s and 401(k)'s, variable annuities have no limit on contributions.
WHETHER variable annuities will begin to lose their luster with Americans because of the new tax law is hard to say. For most people who want to be in the stock market and who are saving for retirement, the choice comes down to variable annuities and mutual funds. Because of the insurance costs, the annual fees on variable annuities average a little over 2 percent, or about seven-tenths of a percentage point more than on the average mutual fund. That additional expense eats into returns substantially over time.
Slicing the top capital gains tax from 28 to 20 percent has made mutual funds even more attractive.
Patrick Reinkemeyer, who follows variable annuities at Morningstar Inc., says it now takes 18 years, on average, before a variable annuity produces as much after taxes as a similar mutual fund without the insurance component. The tax change, he said, has added five to seven years to the break-even point.
Here is why: When a long-term investor cashes in his mutual fund, he will owe no more than 20 percent in Federal tax on his capital gain. When the variable annuity owner withdraws his money, he will be taxed at his regular income tax rate, in many cases 28 percent or more.
For someone many years from retirement, the extra years needed to benefit from the annuity may not matter. But the majority of new buyers are in their 50's, and their account values will not be as great when they reach 65 as if they had invested in the underlying mutual fund. Furthermore, if they are in a high income tax bracket, they will pay more in taxes on withdrawals.
Two of the companies that have lowered their fees to help compensate for the tax effect, Fidelity and Vanguard, were already offering variable annuities with expenses below average because they do not use commissioned sales staff to market their products. Fidelity has dropped its total expenses, including insurance and fund management, on its least expensive actively managed annuity to 1.38 percent of assets, from 1.58 percent, slightly more than on the average stock mutual fund. Vanguard's expenses on an actively managed annuity have fallen to as low as 0.75 percent, from 0.81 percent.
Even Nationwide, whose products are most often sold through financial advisers, has cut the insurance component of its fees to 0.95 percent from 1.4 percent on its lowest-cost product. Stock fund management raises total expenses to at least 1.62 percent, depending on the stock account.
Variable annuities are sold directly to consumers by companies like Fidelity and Vanguard, but they are also sold by tens of thousands of insurance agents, along with armies of securities brokers and bankers, all of whom earn commissions of about 6 percent on annuities and about 4.5 percent on mutual funds. The big sales force helps explain how sales of variable annuities zoomed from $9.3 billion 10 years ago to $85 billion last year. The total invested in variable annuities is estimated at $600 billion, much less than the $3.3 trillion that Americans have plowed into stock and bond funds. But by one estimate, variable annuities account for a fourth of the new money into both variable annuities and mutual funds.
Mark Mackey, chief executive of the National Association for Variable Annuities, a national trade group in Virginia, says variable annuities should not be measured solely as investments. He points to the added value of the insurance features.
Yet many advisers say that, for all their allure, the insurance features are of dubious economic value. Given the stock market's growth in the last several decades, they say, it is unlikely that a long-term investment will fall below its initial level, except in the early years.
"I've always thought of the death benefit as something that is really more psychologically valuable than economically meaningful," said Mr. Reinkemeyer of Morningstar. People who want life insurance will often do better by simply buying a term policy, the most economical form.
As for the option of receiving payments to the end of one's life, Limra International, an insurance industry research organization, says few people are choosing it. Most people either take out their money in a lump sum or in a series of periodic payments based on something other than how long they will probably live, said Scott Dunn, a Limra researcher.
The reasons are twofold. Because people are living longer, payments can be very small if based on life expectancy. By taking the money on their own schedule, people can get more money sooner.
The other big drawback to a lifetime stream of payments is that if the investor dies, the payments stop and the account balance reverts to the insurance company, not his heirs. It's a gamble many people do not want to take.
Mr. Mackey of the National Association for Variable Annuities says most comparisons of variable annuities and mutual funds incorrectly assume that a mutual fund will be held for 20 years or so. In fact, he said, many shareholders change funds every two to four years, paying taxes each time. Moreover, managers of stock mutual funds typically turn over about 80 percent of their holdings annually, creating tax costs for investors. These taxes increase the cost of investing in mutual funds.
FURTHERMORE, while Congress cut the capital gains tax rate, it decided that securities must be held for 18 months, instead of 12, to qualify for the best rate. So mutual funds whose managers trade frantically will throw off more taxes and become less tax efficient.
It will take many more months to gauge the full impact of the changes in the capital gains tax. One possibility is that sales of variable annuities will hold up, but that consumers will shift to companies offering lower fees.
"Price war is too strong a term," Mr. Reinkemeyer said. "But I think what you will see is that companies charging lower fees will get an increasing portion of the pie."

In Asia, Stocks Melt Faster Than in '29

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
It's not hard to catch an orange if someone throws one to you. But it gets more difficult if you're juggling eggs at the time.
That is the way Bob Rubin and Larry Summers, this country's top Treasury officials, must feel. If they're not canceling holiday vacations to revive the South Korea bailout, they're packing to fly to Indonesia to try to keep that rescue from unraveling. 
 Asian markets are crumbling again as investors flee. Stock markets in Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines have lost more than a quarter of their value since the end of 1997. And those are the places that haven't required bailouts.
Markets in industrialized nations have been slower to react than in October. The Dow Jones industrial average went up for the first couple of days of 1998. But alarm is starting to spread. The Dow lost 200 points on Friday, bringing its four-day loss to almost 400 points. Still, it and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index remain well above their October lows, something that cannot be said for indexes of smaller stocks.
Many on Wall Street remain confident that the woes of faraway Asia can't really do a lot of damage to our huge economy. "Supertanker America" was the title of the year-end forecast by Abby Joseph Cohen, the Goldman, Sachs strategist whose soothing words helped halt the October plunge.
In Washington, however, they seem worried. The United States has become the world's financial fireman at a time when officials in some of the hottest spots seem more concerned about their own welfare than about financial flames. Our Congress is quite happy to have the fires put out so long as it doesn't have to pay for the water Mr. Summers will carry as he visits Indonesia, where nepocapitalism has left President Suharto's relatives rich and scared of reform.
There has been much talk in recent years about the declining importance of Governments and the rising power of companies and markets. But underneath that talk has been a belief that the monetary authorities -- the finance ministers and central bankers -- could keep everything on an even keel.
Now the juggling skills of those officials are being put to the test. Fears of deflation and shrinking economies are replacing hopeful forecasts of slower growth in Asia. "Historically," said Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, "it has been very rapid asset price declines -- in equity and real estate, especially -- that have held the potential to be a virulently negative force in the economy."
Slow deflation, he said in a speech a week ago, could be handled, but speedy falls in prices were a threat. "The severe economic contraction of the early 1930's, and the associated persistent declines in product prices, could probably not have occurred apart from the steep asset price deflation that started in 1929."
How are we doing now? If you put a dollar into the Singapore stock market at the end of June, just over six months ago, you now have less than 50 cents. If you put it instead into Malaysia, you've got a quarter. From the 1929 peak, it took over a year for the S.& P. 500 to lose half its value, and more than two years for it to fall by 75 percent.
The American economy ended 1997 in something close to a boom, even as Asia was crumbling. Policy makers know what to do to cool down booms, and they have ideas about how to fight deflationary spirals. But combatting both at the same time, albeit in different parts of the world economy, is a new challenge.
Can they do it? Let's hope the answer is yes.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
The Hollywood Stock Market: You Can't Lose

BYLINE: By LAURA PEDERSEN-PIETERSEN 

 BODY:
AS the swooning Dow led you to wonder whether the only difference between Wall Street and the Titanic is that one of them had a band? If so, then maybe you are ready to open an account at the Hollywood Stock Exchange, where shares of the movie "Titanic" (ticker symbol: TITAN) are rising faster than those of Berkshire Hathaway.
The Hollywood what? Yes, it is finally here -- a stock exchange for film fanatics that deals in "Moviestocks" (films in production or recently released) and "Starbonds" (actors), and uses play money called "Hollywood dollars." 
 The exchange, run by HSX Holdings, is simulated and can be found on the World Wide Web at www.hsx.com. The Web site, supported by advertising, was created a year ago by Michael Burns and Max Keiser, two former stockbrokers in their 30's. They hope that the film industry will eventually use the exchange for market research and for financing films -- on the theory that people who are so happy to play a Hollywood-based game might invest in movies for real.
But for now it is still a game, and here is how it works:
After a free sign-up, a player receives an HSX account with $2 million in electronic scrip and is urged to start trading. As in real life, the goal is to buy low (before the films are released) and to sell high (once they are boffo at the b.o., as Variety would put it). Commissions, deducted from the account, reflect the industry standard of 1 percent. There is even a Hollywood Reserve Bank, with the power to adjust interest rates, print more Hollywood dollars and so on.
The prices of the securities are driven largely by actual ticket sales. But just as Wall Street reacts to breaking news, Moviestocks and Starbonds are affected by Hollywood events. A share of "Armageddon," now shooting, jumped 5 percent, for example, on the announcement that Bruce Willis had been signed to star.
And after Gwyneth Paltrow and Brad Pitt split last spring, her Starbond soared while his plunged. "Public perception was that she was better off without him," said David Herman, president and chief operating officer of HSX Holdings. When Will Smith, a star of "Men in Black," wed the actress Jada Pinkett, his bond price rose sharply. "Fans decided that settling down was good for Smith's career," Mr. Herman said.
But on this exchange, players trade strictly for fun, not profit -- though contests during the year offer prizes like tickets to a film premiere or a trip to the Caribbean.
Such goodies are common in the handful of other on-line virtual stock exchanges, too. For instance, CNBC and MCI sponsor a stock-picking contest -- real stocks, play money at www.cnbcsst.mci.com -- for student investment clubs. Winners get T-shirts, and the grand prize is an appearance with the CNBC anchor Bill Griffeth.
So who is playing the Hollywood game? Including the sons of the president of Botswana, 63,000 participants are registered and about 5,000 of them trade each day. The daily volume is about 67 million shares -- approximately double that of the American Stock Exchange. Thirty percent of the players are students, and 20 percent are involved in the media or entertainment industries.
And it is not just movie fans who take their chances on the Hollywood exchange. So do Tinseltown insiders like the actor Albert Brooks, who in 1996 directed and starred in "Mother"; Gordon Paddison, manager of interactive marketing at New Line Cinema, and May Wuthrich, a film scout at the Writers House in New York.
Studio executives seem professionally interested, too. Mr. Paddison said HSX had great potential as a research engine. "Sure, it's only a game," he said, "but everything in Hollywood is perception."
One satisfied customer is Dale J. Borgen, a pastor of an evangelical church in San Dimas, Calif. A popcorn-carrying film buff, he trades on the exchange several times a day and calls the site addictive.
"There's a real intensity about trading against other players," said Mr. Borgen, 28, who has set up an investment site for the game -- http://members.xoom.com/HSJ -- that carries reviews of future initial public offerings (new releases) and fiscal results (box office returns).
Some fans insist that the exchange is educational, though so is driving 90 miles an hour through a Buffalo blizzard to study the laws of traction and aerodynamics. Still, the HSX game can go a long way toward familiarizing people with real investing.
The game has real-time trading and a ticker tape. Starbonds are rated AAA through C. The central bank has a chairman, "Dr. Zeros," who is an HSX employee. There is even program trading. When a sheep was cloned last summer, "sell" programs hit the trading floor as anxious players contemplated the consequences of having not one but six Harrison Fords.
I found out how real the game was when I played it myself. I set out to corner the market on "Deconstructing Harry," (ticker symbol: DECON), the new movie by Woody Allen. My decision was based on positive response from a friend who had worked as an extra for Mr. Allen. But I should have read the small print on my PC screen. HSX, like the Securities and Exchange Commission, requires investors who want to own more than 5 percent of a security to file with the exchange and explain their interests. In other words, Jim Carrey cannot simply buy up all of his Starbonds. To avoid the hassle, I bought less than 5 percent.
The HSX departs from real investing in a way that some people may love: Insider trading is completely legal. "The Internet is very open, so we don't crack down on it," said Mr. Keiser, one of the HSX creators. "You get lighting people, soundmen and gaffers who are all working on projects and gossiping like mad. Traders have to decide for themselves what's fact and what's fiction."
HSX sure seemed educational for Austin Chen, a 23-year-old student at Ohio State University. Mr. Chen won the HSX trip for two to Antigua last year, and he sounds like a winning portfolio manager.
"I tried to find undervalued stocks -- shares in projects that people either didn't know too much about or didn't think would do very well," said Mr. Chen, who may check his portfolio four or five times a day. One of his bigger bets was on "Soul Food," starring Vanessa L. Williams and others. Its stock opened at $10 a share and had reached $35.25 after a month in the theaters.
Meanwhile, Mr. Burns and Mr. Keiser, the founders of the exchange, are working on their plans to take the site beyond simulated investing. Given the rising expense of making movies, HSX is designing a system in which its traders can invest real money in film projects. Mr. Keiser said the idea, which is geared to cash-hungry independent film producers rather than the big studios, will soon be before the S.E.C. for approval.
The HSX managers also say the game can become an audience laboratory for the industry. How movie buffs vote with their play money could supplement the test screenings in Los Angeles suburbs upon which studios often rely. Mr. Herman hopes that studio executives will soon float trial balloons for project concepts on the exchange.
AT times, the sentiments of HSX traders have been impressively on target. Warner Brothers pulled out all the stops for "Batman and Robin" last spring, for example, but the exchange correctly signaled that the Caped Crusaders were headed for the Bat Grave. And while the media had a field day reporting problems on the set of Sony's "Men in Black," its HSX shares generated huge momentum six months before it became a hit last summer.
Well, I have been away from my HSX portfolio for about 10 minutes now, and it is time to get back to trading. I own the limit on Kathy Bates. I had wanted to buy stock in her ever since her 1991 movie, "Fried Green Tomatoes," in which she tells those two obnoxious young women whose car she deliberately smashes, "Face it, girls: I'm older and I have more insurance."

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds Report;
In Search Of A Foothold In Rocky Times

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
AS stock and bond markets around the world became more volatile last year, mutual fund investors sought safety. But they did not always get it.
Some of the very mutual fund managers whose conservative-sounding funds were most in demand reached aggressively for yield, pushing their holdings of relatively volatile types of securities to the limit. 
 Consider the CGM Fixed Income fund, a long-term bond fund. Most such funds perform well when long-term interest rates fall rapidly. But in spite of a decline in rates in the fourth quarter, the CGM fund lost 5 percent of its value as the price of one security cratered. The only bond funds that did worse were invested in Asian emerging markets. CGM declined to identify the problem holding, but it recently pushed its junk bond allocation to a third of its portfolio, the fund's self-imposed limit.
Investors should brace for more blowups in bond funds, said Burton J. Greenwald, who provides advice to mutual funds from his firm in Philadelphia. "I think you may already have some managers who have been tempted to overreach," he said. And stock funds may hold some surprises. "It seems that after three years of such incredible ebullience in the marketplace, some funds might be further out on a limb than investors realize," he said.
If so, it comes at an inopportune time. At the end of last year, investors made a clear shift to more conservative funds. Government bond funds attracted more money than they lost in the fourth quarter -- the first time they had done so in four years. Growth-and-income funds, the most conservative class of general equity funds, took in nearly half of the money coming into American stock funds, the most since 1989. And investors, unnerved by the tumult in Asian and domestic markets, put a bigger portion of their new fund dollars into money market funds.
But fund managers have a far different view of the world. Even as they have posted solid gains, their frustrations have grown because they have found it more difficult to keep up with low-cost unmanaged portfolios, like those that track the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. For the fourth year in a row in 1997, the average stock fund failed to beat the index.
Most bond funds had trouble keeping up with their benchmark, too. As long-term interest rates fell below 6 percent, to their lowest point in two years, the average taxable bond fund produced a total return of 8.85 percent for the year, according to Morningstar Inc., below the 9.6 percent return of the Lehman Brothers Aggregate bond index.
There were a few bright spots. Funds that specialize in financial services, the best-performing sector of the last five years, continued their torrid pace in 1997, gaining 46 percent. And in the final three months of the year, utility funds, one of the worst-performing groups over the last five years, topped the performance lists.
Still, the majority of funds had disappointing returns when compared with their indexes. Is it any wonder that some of their managers reached for higher returns in some surprising ways?
Consider the Oppenheimer Global Growth and Income fund. The manager's midyear report practically screamed "stability," stating in all capital letters that the fund is intended for people "who need to reduce the effect of short-term market fluctuations."
So what were shareholders to think when they opened the most recent report? They found that nearly one-fifth of their assets were invested in some of the most volatile securities around -- zero-coupon Treasury strips, a form of a long-term Treasury bond that reacts sharply to changes in interest rates. By last week, moreover, the portfolio manager, Frank Jennings, had doubled that bet, placing 40 percent of the fund in zero-coupon Treasuries.
So far, the gambit has worked. Declining long-term rates helped the fund to a gain of 28.3 percent last year, and it has gained more than 20 percent in each of the last three years. Yet that performance only put the fund in the middle of the pack of 3,000 equity funds that are tracked by Morningstar and that have been around for three years or more.
After Mr. Jennings took over the portfolio in October 1995, the fund started to adopt some riskier strategies, first by investing more in stocks of small companies and in emerging markets, then, in the last half of 1996, by creeping into zero-coupon bonds.
The fund made a full-fledged bet on the direction of interest rates last fall. As of last week, two-fifths of the fund's $300 million in assets were invested in long-term zero-coupon Treasury bonds -- long-term Treasuries that have the interest coupon stripped away, leaving just the principal.
"They do roughly twice as well as the long bond" when bond prices rise and interest rates fall, Mr. Jennings said of the zeros. "They are equivalent to 50-year Treasury bonds."
Of course, their value also falls more sharply and more quickly when interest rates rise.
A glance back to 1992 and 1994 shows what can happen when rates rise. The average taxable bond fund lost nearly 4 percent in 1994, according to Morningstar, and a few imploded. In 1992, a European currency crisis produced big losses for shareholders in many short-term world bond funds, which aimed to invest in what were then thought to be "safe" government securities. The category has since largely disappeared.
Mr. Jennings bristles at the notion his strategy is speculative. "I'm sensitive to being portrayed as a guy who's just a gunslinger," he said. Zero-coupon Treasuries "are less risky than most junk bonds and most telephone company bonds. And they are less risky than Microsoft stock or a lot of stuff that is in most stock indexes."
Some fund managers disagree. "If a manager's philosophy is primarily to add value by trying to time interest rates, that is as dangerous as an equity manager who tries to time the equity market," said Kevin McClintock, head of taxable fixed-income funds at Dreyfus.
The interest-rate bet seems particularly odd for a fund with a growth-and-income name. Indeed, after the fund made its regular report on its holdings last month, Morningstar moved it into the international hybrid category from the growth-and-income stock category because of its big bet on interest rates. Even Mr. Jennings acknowledges that his strategy is a bit controversial, saying "I've gotten a certain amount of heat on the subject."
STILL, Mr. Jennings points out that only about one-quarter of last year's returns came from his bond positions, and that astute stock picks -- including Nintendo, the electronic game company in Japan, and Dairy Farm International, the supermarket chain listed in Singapore -- accounted for the rest.
Mr. Jennings said his current strategy assumed that the economy could fall into recession, leading to a bear market in stocks and "a massive bond market rally."
"I don't think the average investor appreciates that risk," he said, referring to recessionary prospects.
Investors in the CGM Fixed Income fund might not have appreciated the risks they faced, either. The fund, one in a stable overseen by G. Kenneth Heebner, has been the best-performing general bond fund tracked by Lipper Analytical Services over the last three and five years -- a fact that CGM has trumpeted in advertisements.
But the once-steady performer lost 5.1 percent of its value last quarter, even as long-term interest rates fell and the prices of long-term bonds rose. The average long-term bond fund gained 2.8 percent in the same period, according to Morningstar.
What hurt the CMG Fixed Income portfolio? No one at Capital Growth Management, the Boston company headed by Mr. Heebner, agreed to talk about it.
The fund's most recent portfolio, dated June 30 in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, showed that at least 35 percent of its $44 million in assets consisted of bonds below investment grade -- that is, high-risk junk bonds. Those bonds pay high interest rates, and their value moves more in sync with stock prices than with long-term bonds.
A highly concentrated portfolio is characteristic of the way Mr. Heebner runs his funds. It can lead to significant outperformance when events go the fund's way. But it also means that one holding can cause a portfolio to implode.
A call to CGM's toll-free shareholder information line produced an operator who, while declining to give her name, said "a particular holding" in the fund's portfolio dragged down the fund's performance last quarter. She said that she could not name the holding, but that "the portfolio has since been restructured, about three weeks ago."
The bond market is not the only place where portfolio managers have been tempted to stretch for a performance edge. A stock fund that has done so by reaching down into the tiniest of stocks, known as microcaps, and by betting big is Safeco Growth.
One of the best performers among all diversified American stock funds for the last five years, Safeco Growth gained 50 percent last year, making it fifth best among the diversified stock funds tracked by Morningstar. Assets have exploded, with up to $20 million a day coming into the fund, helping it to triple in size over the last year, to $600 million.
That rapid growth has led the fund to assume increasingly large positions in its favorite stocks. At the end of June, 27 percent of the fund's assets were in companies in which the fund owned more than 5 percent. Less than two years ago, such investments accounted for less than 5 percent of the fund's portfolio.
Some of the fund's positions amount to several times the number of shares that normally trade each day. At the end of September, the Safeco fund owned more than 522,000 shares of Lifeline Systems, which markets an electronic system for summoning emergency medical assistance. That stake amounted to more than 9 percent of Lifeline's total shares, near the 10 percent limit for the fund. Other Safeco funds and employee pension plans owned 6 percent more of Lifeline. Given that a mere 13,500 Lifeline shares trade each day, it would take nearly 60 days for all the Safeco-related funds to sell all that Lifeline stock.
And Lifeline is but one of a dozen companies in which the Safeco Growth fund has stakes of 5 to 10 percent.
"If I believe in a stock, I think it's in the best interest of shareholders not to worry about how to get out of it," said Thomas M. Maguire, the Safeco fund's manager. "This is a diversified portfolio. When I hit a home run with a stock, I'm going to make 300 or 400 percent. I'm not going to hit home runs every time, but the most I can lose in any one stock is 100 percent. The ones I'm right about will more than make up for the ones I'm wrong on."
So far, at least, they have. But sometimes an entire sector falls so far that few individual securities escape unscathed.
For an example, just look at the recent activity in the Asian stock and bond markets. When Southeast Asian currencies went into a tailspin last year, so did stocks in most emerging markets, as well as some bonds and notes issued by Asian Government agencies and banks.
SOME American money market funds held Korean bank debt when those economies began their slump. IBC Financial Data, which tracks money market funds, said the Alliance Money Market Prime portfolio and the Alliance Capital Reserves fund had the biggest exposures last year.
At the end of May, the most recent data filed with the S.E.C. showed that more than 5 percent of each portfolio was invested in bonds issued by the Industrial Bank of Korea and the Korean Development Bank. A spokesman for Alliance said that those funds no longer held Korean securities, adding that the ones in the portfolio early last year matured at full value in October.
The Strong Heritage Money fund, one of last year's best performers among money market funds, also held some Korean securities at the end of August, the date of its last report. A spokeswoman for Strong said that after those securities matured at full value, the fund did not buy any more Korean securities.
While these money market funds escaped harm this time, other funds could get caught leaning the wrong way, especially if interest rates reverse their downward spiral of recent days.

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
Where Immigrant Dreams Prosper, at a Profit

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
ROSENDO STEWART left Colon, Panama, 19 years ago, hoping to prosper in the United States. For years he worked two jobs in New York, as a cabby and a doorman, but could not unlock the door to his dream through hard work alone.
Last month, though, he got a key to prosperity in the form of a loan to buy a taxi medallion, the city's coveted license to operate a yellow cab. Now, instead of paying roughly half of his gross income to lease someone else's taxi, Mr. Stewart will be building equity in his own business. What is more, medallions -- now selling for $237,000 each -- have made taxis one of the hottest long-term investment vehicles around. In the 60 years since medallions have been sold in the open market, their price has increased an average of more than 18 percent a year, versus the long-term historical average of 10.9 percent for large stocks. 
 "In a few years, with the money from my medallion I will open a little store," Mr. Stewart said. "Or maybe I will buy a second medallion and lease it to someone and make money from someone else's work."
Mr. Stewart's chance to move from working stiff to capitalist, junior grade, was created by a curious mix of a small-business loan program dating back to the Nixon years, an obscure Federal tax break and the city's Depression-era decision to make taxi medallions a form of currency.
It is also a modern version of an old story about how government policies, reshaped over the years by shifting political winds and strong market forces, often produce unintended results. In this case, what began as a program to promote black capitalism after the urban unrest of the 1960's has mutated, in part, into a gateway for hundreds of immigrants to own New York cabs.
Mr. Stewart got his help from the Freshstart Venture Capital Corporation, a tiny lender in midtown Manhattan that is a remnant of the Nixon-era program.
Faulted for falling far short of its goals, as well as for management and investment problems, the program was essentially privatized by the Republican-controlled Congress in 1996. The 80 private investment companies around the country through which it operated, including Freshstart, were allowed to keep their licenses from the Small Business Administration, but no new companies can apply.
The Government stopped providing direct subsidies to the remaining companies in the form of cheap capital, while allowing them to keep several million dollars each in below-market financing. It also preserved a special tax break that is intended to attract stockholders and private sources of capital. The break allows investors who buy shares in the companies to defer capital gains taxes on other stock profits.
Under the S.B.A.'s supervision, the 80 lenders, known as specialized small-business investment companies, must still use their capital to help "socially or economically disadvantaged" people, in the language of the law that created the program. All but six focus on underwriting traditional small-business ventures -- from fast-food restaurants to manufacturing plants -- lending largely to blacks and other members of minority groups who might have difficulty obtaining financing or be forced to pay high rates.
The exceptions -- Freshstart and five other companies, all in New York -- also write traditional loans but have found their niche with immigrants and medallions.
Freshstart stands alone in another respect: it is the only one of the 80 companies to go public, hoping the tax advantage will attract enough investors to fuel its ambitious growth plans. Still working with immigrants, it is already financing restaurants in Florida and laundromats in New Jersey. Its goal is a national reach.
"There is a large market of people to borrow from us," said Freshstart's president, Zindel Zelmanovitch, whose first job after arriving in New York from the Soviet Union in 1972 was driving a cab. "We think investing in immigrants is a good business."
Other companies from the program are eagerly watching to see how Freshstart progresses in attracting investors. If going public pays off, they may follow. If not, they may concentrate more on another S.B.A. program in which many of them also participate. This program, which is not limited to helping the socially or economically disadvantaged, provides substantial subsidies, mostly to small businesses, in the form of cheap capital but does not allow investors a tax break.
For now, at least, Freshstart seems to be doing well. Though it operates out of a third-floor walkup office on West 53d Street, between Eighth and Ninth Avenues, its revenue is expected to exceed $3 million this year, more than double the $1.3 million of its last fiscal year, ended May 31. Its profit margin was a spectacular 41 percent last year, helped by an almost total absence of defaults. And its stock, while thinly traded on Nasdaq, is more than holding its own. Since going public in November 1996 at $4.50 a share, it has traded as high as $7.50 and as low as $3. It is now at $5.875.
 
Problems and Risks
To be sure, Freshstart has its problems. The S.B.A. has suggested to the company and some other lenders that they may be putting too much money into medallions. "We have told these lenders to diversify their portfolios," said Don A. Christensen, the S.B.A. official who oversees the companies.
If New York greatly increased the number of medallions -- there are now 12,187 -- prices could plummet. Though there seems to be little chance that will happen, at least for now, prices have been rising at a more moderate rate, 13 percent a year, on average, in the last five years.
In its prospectus, Freshstart disclosed the potential for conflicts of interest posed by the fact that one of its directors, Neil Greenbaum, who is also the secretary of the company, operates an insurance and medallion brokerage company in the same building. In addition, Mr. Zelmanovitch, the president, owns one of the other investment companies that specialize in medallions, the privately held East Coast Capital Corporation, which has offices in the same building in Manhattan.
Freshstart and Mr. Greenbaum say they fully disclose all their relationships to their clients. Because the clients are often not sophisticated about finance and sometimes still struggle with English, Mr. Greenbaum said, company executives explain as many details of the arrangements as the clients will tolerate.
In any event, industry experts not affiliated with Freshstart say one-stop shopping is common in the business, and they add that the company charges competitive interest rates, currently 8.5 to 9.5 percent, depending on the borrower's credit rating.
Such concerns aside, the Nixon Administration program has finally found success in medallion loans, said Timothy Bates, a professor of urban affairs at Wayne State University in Detroit who has been evaluating the program for the S.B.A. since 1994.
"Lending money on New York City taxi medallions turns out to be a deal made in heaven," Professor Bates said in an interview. "You get golden collateral behind your loan because medallions are highly liquid with very little risk for the lender. And so today, we have more loans made under this program for medallions than to manufacturing, wholesaling and construction companies combined."
 
An Outgrowth of Unrest
Investing in immigrants was not the idea 29 years ago when the lending program began. Richard M. Nixon was in his first year as President and the destructive riots that had swept the country earlier in the decade, from Newark to Detroit to Los Angeles, were still harsh memories. Maurice H. Stans, the Commerce Secretary, declared himself a proponent of black capitalism. The Administration, he said, would commit $500 million to low-cost loans in an effort to nurture black-owned businesses.
The S.B.A. began lending money at low rates to 49 of what were then called minority enterprise small-business investment companies. By October 1970, these companies had invested $43.7 million, through direct stakes or as loans.
Critics were soon complaining, however, that the program was too small and too fragmented to create a significant class of black business owners and that too many loans were being made to businesses that had little potential to grow.
At its peak, the program involved 130 investment companies with $250 million to invest, said William A. Kirk, a partner at the law firm of Reid & Priest in Washington who has worked with some of the lenders.
But despite steady infusions of tax dollars, the program never achieved its stated goals, a failure that was documented in a number of private reports and in studies by the General Accounting Office.
Through 1996, the G.A.O. reported last year, taxpayers lost $61 million just in shutting down investment companies that had failed. It cost taxpayers an additional $79 million to sell back, at a steep discount, preferred stock that the Government had bought to help the companies get started; Freshstart got $1 million of this subsidy. Over all, the S.B.A. said it does not have figures to show the program's net return, in dollars or in the creation of jobs and wealth.
The investment companies clearly backed a number of big successes. One was Reginald Lewis, who bought the McCall Pattern Company. Another was Chester Davenport, who bought a company, now known as Envirotest Systems, an auto-emissions testing business. Two others were Ed Lewis and Clarence Smith, who helped found Essence magazine.
But in too many cases, the lenders were too small to make a difference, Professor Bates said, and the S.B.A. never demanded that their managers have any expertise.
"Many failed, and of those that hung on, many invested in bank certificates of deposit, often putting more than half of the funds into C.D.'s," he said. "The game was to get subsidized funds from the S.B.A. and invest in bank C.D.'s and live off the spread, not to invest in black-owned businesses."
After the Republicans won control of Congress in 1994, they set out to kill the program, succeeding for all practical purposes two years later.
But buried amid the program's debris was an overlooked pocket of success: the companies, like Freshstart, that had been quietly lending to cabbies for years.
Though the cabbies were largely not the program's originally intended beneficiaries, they nonetheless qualified for loans because their immigrant status came within the definition of socially or economically disadvantaged. And what they did with their loans fit the bill exactly: they used them to get a foot in the door.
 
A Pocketful of Cabby Loans
 Freshstart, founded in 1982, has made $24 million in loans to more than 500 cabbies. At that, it is one of the smallest lenders in the taxi niche. The largest are the two companies operated by the Medallion Financial Corporation, a publicly traded company with a total of $192 million in loans, the overwhelming majority of them for medallions. (Medallion's structure does not allow investors to qualify for the special tax break.)
Freshstart and the others "understand the needs of cabbies a lot better than a regular bank," said Bob Mackle, a lawyer, insurance broker and tax adviser to taxi drivers. These companies, he added, "understand how well protected the equity in a medallion is, and they know that even if the cabbie does not have perfect credit, they would still be able to write the loan."
Most cabbies start by leasing their cars and medallions, as Mr. Stewart did for years, and drive 10 to 12 hours a day, six days a week. Mr. Stewart said he took in about $200 a day, including tips, or $1,200 weekly. After paying $100 a day for the lease -- plus gasoline and the cost of any traffic tickets -- Mr. Stewart took home less than $25,000 a year.
To buy a medallion and cab is hardly an inexpensive proposition.
Until 1937, the city sold medallions for $10 each. Then it stopped issuing new ones and allowed the price to be set by the market. The price rose so steeply because few of the 11,787 medallions were being traded, and no new ones were issued until May 1996, when the city held the first of three auctions that put a total of 400 more on the market.
For decades, though, "medallion lending was considered risky business," said Michael Higgins, publisher of Taxi Talk, a monthly newspaper. And the few lenders that made loans required them to be paid off in five years. Many drivers simply could not qualify, leaving many taxis in the hands of corporate fleet owners.
The added competition of lenders like Freshstart and Medallion has driven down interest rates, Mr. Higgins said. Cabbies who once had to pay double-digit rates now pay about 9 percent. Moreover, lenders "are giving borrowers up to 20 and 30 years to pay off a medallion," he said, "and that lowered the monthly cost and made it be like gold."
 
A Deal and a Paint Job
Mr. Stewart, who is 43 and lives in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, with his wife and two children, got his medallion for $226,900 in early December.
He was so happy about his new prospects that he grinned nonstop the other day as he maneuvered through traffic from Manhattan to the Bay Ridge Honda dealership in Brooklyn. He was going to the dealer to see his new cab -- a 1998 Honda Odyssey mini-van, the first new car he had ever bought -- before its metallic gray paint was covered with bright yellow.
In his $261,000 package deal with Freshstart, Mr. Stewart put down $35,000 that he had saved. The deal financed the cost of the medallion, the mini-van customized for taxi duty and a host of fees for a lawyer, insurance and various documents. With the down payment, his loan is for $226,000 at 9 percent interest, a half point above the prime rate. After five years, he will have to refinance at the prevailing market rate for medallions, a typical arrangement at Freshstart. Then, assuming that medallion prices have kept rising and that interest rates have not gone through the roof, Mr. Stewart will be able to take a sizable chunk of cash out of the medallion to buy a house, say, or start another business.
Monthly payments on his loan are $3,100, which is more than the $2,800 he was paying in daily lease fees. But even after taking into account his incidental costs, like gasoline, he is building equity in his medallion because about $800 of his check to Freshstart pays down principal.
Many Freshstart clients know little about their financing, except the interest rate and the monthly payment they must make. Mr. Stewart, for example, said he did not know that if he paid more each month on his loan he would pay off his debt more quickly, increasing his equity and reducing total interest charges.
 
'Cookie-Cutter Business'
Small as it is, Freshstart can point to several people who have prospered after it lent them money.
Sasha Muniak was a violinist in a Polish state orchestra on tour in Yugoslavia when he fled through the woods to Italy more than 25 years ago. He eventually made his way to New York, where he and a brother took turns driving a cab round the clock.
When he got a few thousand dollars together, he turned to fellow Polish emigres for more money and then got a loan from Freshstart for his own medallion and cab. He later sold the medallion to raise money for his first tiny restaurant.
Today he owns the Mangia chain of restaurants in Manhattan and relies on major banks for most of his financing. When his newest restaurant, at 40 Wall Street, ran over budget, however, he went back to Freshstart for about $300,000 in additional financing.
But even with loans to immigrants for fast-food outlets, laundromats and Mr. Muniak's latest restaurant, Freshstart still has three-quarters of its portfolio in medallions and cabs.
All in all, it is a lucrative business.
On that $1.3 million in revenue in the year ended May 31, Freshstart had profits of $527,000. The company has $17 million in outstanding loans, its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show, and only one of the loans has gone sour. Freshstart took a loss on a $181,000 mortgage on New York City real estate.
As president, Mr. Zelmanovitch was paid $85,320 in the most recent fiscal year. His family owns about one-twelfth of Freshstart, giving them a stake worth $1.12 million, at current market prices.
Compared with Freshstart's 41 percent, the much bigger Medallion Financial has a profit margin of 36 percent, according to S.E.C. filings.
Andy Murstein, Medallion's president, said his company and Freshstart had such high profit margins "because this is a cookie-cutter business with the same forms and the same collateral."
"Our focus," he said, "is on the medallion, the asset we lend against, not the borrower."
But if Mr. Stewart is any indication, the borrower is a pretty solid asset, too.
As soon as he got his medallion, Mr. Stewart increased his daily 10 to 12 hours behind the wheel to about 14. The reason, he said, is "to make sure I bring in enough money to pay my loan."

Not So Fast: Here Comes the Budget Crunch

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
PRESIDENT CLINTON displayed his deft political touch last week, calling for the first balanced budget in three decades and in the process taking credit for solving a problem that has dogged Washington since the early years of the Reagan Administration.
How much credit he actually deserves is a matter of dispute. For while the green eye-shade crowd is effusive in praising the tax increases and spending trims that President Clinton engineered in 1993, the improved fiscal outlook is a product of a variety of factors ranging from the stock market boom to the lower prices of imports from deflation-wracked Asia. 
 "Think of it as the reverse of Murphy's Law," suggests Rudolph Penner, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office who is now a senior fellow at the Urban Institute. "Everything that could go right has gone right."
 
Storm Clouds
Paradoxically, the real test of fiscal leadership for President Clinton and his successors may be how they manage the good times ahead. For while there are solid reasons to believe that the budget will remain in surplus for a decade or more, the retirement of the baby boomers is certain to push the budget deeply into the red soon thereafter unless Washington acts preemptively to curtail the future cost of Social Security and Medicare.
"The future still looks terrible, but the day of reckoning has been postponed by a decade or more," said Robert Reischauer, another former Budget Office director who is now at the Brookings Institution.
A glimmer from the end of the deficit tunnel was first spotted in 1990, when President George Bush broke his campaign pledge and acceded to a tax increase. A second round of deficit cutting in 1993 also made a big difference, as has the Midas touch of the Federal Reserve in managing monetary policy. But the pace of deficit reduction, accelerated by the coincidence of stable growth, declining inflation, exceptionally low unemployment and off-the-charts tax receipts, caught virtually everyone by surprise.
Last September, the Congressional Budget Office forecast a $34 billion deficit in 1997 that would rise to $57 billion in 1998 and return to balance only in 2002. Last week the Budget Office revised the 1997 deficit estimate down to just $22 billion and projected a $5 billion surplus for 1998 -- a $62 billion swing in four months without any changes in Federal spending or tax policy.
"Forecasters have repeatedly had to play catch-up since the beginning of 1996," marveled Van Doorn Ooms, director of research at the Committee for Economic Development.
Good news begets more good news. The quicker return to budget surplus means a smaller national debt down the road, along with lower interest rates and smaller annual interest payments to service the debt. It now appears that the "baseline budget" -- one that assumes no changes in fiscal policy -- will remain in surplus until 2012.
 
Mixed Signals
At that point, the retirement of the first wave of aging baby boomers, who are entitled to generous Social Security and Medicare benefits, will darken the budget picture. But Mr. Reischauer points out that the ratio of Federal debt to gross domestic product, arguably the most objective measure of the burden of the debt, will probably continue to fall, with debt declining from the current level of 48 percent of G.D.P. to just 20 percent in 2015. And while the baseline-budget deficit will grow steadily after 2012, it is not expected to climb back to the 1992 magnitude (3.8 percent of G.D.P.) until 2028.
Slippage is possible -- make that, likely -- between now and then. Mr. Clinton has already proposed to invest a chunk of the prospective surplus in day care services, while House Speaker Newt Gingrich is appealing to conservative Republicans with calls for "at least a small tax cut every year" when the budget is in the black.
By the same token, even a modest stumble from the straight and narrow path of low inflation and 2 percent-plus economic growth would reduce projected revenues and ratchet up spending on the social safety net. Moreover, said H. Erich Heineman, an economic consultant in New York, "If there's a serious recession, you can forget about surpluses."
But the deeper fear among economists is that budget bliss will persist well into the next decade, undermining the sense of urgency in rethinking how the nation will pay for the retirement of the baby boomers. For while the prognosis has brightened considerably since fiscal reformers first warned of the coming demographic tsunami, there is still big budget trouble ahead.
In 1991, the economists Alan Auerbach, Jagadeesh Gokhale and Lawrence Kotlikoff estimated that Americans born after 1994 would have to fork over an astonishing 84 percent of their wages to deliver on the nation's promises to the old. A recalculation, expected to be published this year, is likely to reduce this anticipated tax burden to around 50 percent. But this would still be a remarkable stretch compared with the estimated 30 percent lifetime net tax rate -- taxes paid less Government pensions and medical care received -- on Americans born in the 1930's and 1940's.
Mr. Kotlikoff, an economist at Boston University, put it another way. To create an actuarial balance between future revenues and promised Government benefits, he estimated that personal and corporate income tax rates would have to be raised by 20 percent right now and kept at the higher rates indefinitely.
Waiting a decade or two to act, of course, would drastically increase the cost of the fix. "The idea that the problem is solving itself simply ignores fiscal reality," Mr. Kotlikoff argued.
Mr. Penner is tentatively optimistic that policy makers will be able to deal rationally with distant but inevitable demographic change, even as they celebrate the current respite from deficit-driven politics of fiscal scarcity. "I'm very impressed with how the idea of Social Security and Medicare reform has entered mainstream debate," he said.
But that is asking a lot from officials trained by voters to focus on the present, lest there be no future. "It will be several political lifetimes until Washington again faces a budget crisis," Mr. Reischauer said.

Democracy, Apparatchik Style

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: PRAGUE

 BODY:
SINCE Central Europe emerged from Communism, the nuts and bolts of democracy have been installed across the region. There are elections, newspapers galore, political parties of all kinds, growing numbers of television channels and radio stations in just about every city.
At election time, politicians file into the studios and debate each other as in any other Western democracy. Even between elections, politicians are frequent guests on television and radio talk shows. 
 But for the most part, Central European leaders talk at -- rather than consult with -- the people they claim to represent.
The notion, taken for granted all across the West, that politicians have to involve the people in the important decisions they make has yet to dent the high-handed tradition long followed by apparatchiks.
The political leadership here, argues Jan Urban, a former dissident and co-director of the Institute for Journalism in Transition, doesn't seem to have developed beyond the Communist-era dictum of making decisions first and then talking above the heads of the people.
This haughty style of politics, with scant attempt at engagement, applies to politicians with dissident backgrounds, in addition to those who were cogs within the Communist system, he adds.
Mr. Urban isn't just talking theory. He is a central player these days in a vivid case in point: the question of the Czech Republic's expected membership in NATO.
 
Familiar Face
On billboards all over the Czech Republic, Mr. Urban's group has plastered the beetle-browed face of the late Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, in his study in the Kremlin, with a title that evokes a parallel TV campaign in which a voice-over says: "Thank you for freely deciding not to join NATO."
The ads are an exercise in sarcasm, intended to shock Czech citizens into wanting to join NATO as badly as their leaders do. The leaders are all in favor, of course, but to date have seemed to lack the political and rhetorical tools needed to rouse public opinion behind them. As a result, for the most part, public opinion polls show fewer than half of Czech citizens in support of NATO membership -- a statistic that does not enhance the Czech case in the United States Senate, where a two-thirds vote will be needed to approve the alliance's expansion.
It is a situation rich in ironies, and it reveals a great deal about what democracy has come to mean in Central Europe.
One of the criteria that Washington established for considering the Eastern European countries as NATO partners was the establishment of democratic institutions, including free elections, independent judiciaries and diverse information media. These are now mostly in place across Central Europe. How they are used is another matter.
"Politicians feel that if they communicate through television by using it as an amplifier, this is sufficient," said Lubos Beniak, who ran a trend-breaking interview program, in the style of Larry King, on the Czech private television channel, Nova. "Generally speaking, television interviews are quite gentle and Czech journalists still feel they are part of politics and want to express their views." It is a formula that makes for deadening public discourse.
And a mentality accustomed to one-party rule is hard to get rid of.
In the Czech Republic, the recently deposed Prime Minister, Vaclav Klaus, who was in office for five years, held regular town hall meetings. But his tolerance for hearing opinions different from his own was fairly limited. On NATO, Mr. Klaus had one rule: the topic was too complicated for ordinary people.
In Poland, where there is overwhelming public support for joining NATO, the politicians have felt little need to explain the difficult issues that come with membership: the responsibilities as well as the rights.
Thus, the necessities of scaling down the huge Polish army, making it more professional and spending money on new equipment have not figured in wide debate. They have been written about in long articles in several highbrow newspapers, but a Polish diplomat jested recently that his nation needed a popular military hero like Gen. H. Norman Schwartzkopf or Gen. Colin L. Powell to explain the everyday realities of NATO to the average Pole.
 
New Approach
One Polish politician has learned the benefits of communicating.
In 1991, Leszek Balcerowicz, the Polish Finance Minister who introduced the hard-knuckle economic measures that helped turn the economy around, was one of the most unpopular public figures. He left office as he came in: tight-lipped.
But he returned in 1995, revitalizing the Freedom Union political party and his own standing. And in last September's elections, he campaigned with a fresh image -- smart ties, new glasses, appealing suits. Most astonishingly, he talked directly and frequently to his coal mining constituents about the need for more tough economic medicine. He was elected to Parliament by one of the biggest margins in Poland.
Still, he is the exception.
The next challenge facing Central Europe after NATO is the European Union. Already prime ministers and presidents from the former Communist nations are flying off to Brussels with victory waves and coming back beaming, saying membership is imminent. They rarely mention the coming hardships -- cutting back agriculture, slimming down steel industries -- that will be needed.
To make sure the people of Central Europe understand the rough ride that European Union membership will initially entail, national television campaigns are being prepared. Not by the invited governments, however. The campaign is being drawn up by the European Union itself.

Day-Care Quandary: A Nation at War With Itself

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
PRESIDENT CLINTON last week unveiled a $21 billion package of Federal grants and tax breaks in what he called "the single largest national commitment to child care in the history of the United States."
The plan, which faces obvious hurdles in Congress, aims to address a desperate shortage of affordable and qualified care-givers for young children by improving wages, while boosting safety and training at child care centers. Currently child-care workers earn on average $6.12 a hour, or about $10,710 a year -- less than the counter help typically earn at many McDonald's -- and turnover in the field is rampant. 
 Such an infusion of money could transform child care in the United States, doubling to an estimated two million the number of children receiving subsidized day care. But it would probably do little to lift the ambivalence that many parents, particularly working mothers, feel in placing their infants in the care of total strangers, especially outside of the home. For working couples, could there be a better way?
A lot of people familiar with the day-care labor shortage think so. Part of the problem, they say, is that the Government is moving to provide child-care options with one hand while taking them away with the other.
In the past decade, Congress and several Administrations have systematically restricted the entry into this country of the very people who could provide at least a partial solution to the child-care problem: foreign care-givers. Long in an anti-immigrant mood, Congress only recently gave many immigrants a deadline of this week to apply for permanent residency or face being barred from the country for years.
"There are a vast number of women who have had and raised many children who'd be delighted to come to the United States and care for children, for whom it's virtually impossible to get visas," said Michael Maggio, a Washington immigration lawyer.
Legal immigrants involved in child care typically work as nannies in individual homes, not in day-care centers, and they represent a small segment of the industry. But if the Government changed its policy and created a special temporary visa or permanent-resident category for immigrant care-givers, parents and day-care center operators could tap a new supply of child-care professionals.
Expanding this source of domestic help may or may not reduce the cost of nannies dramatically; it might simply legalize the now-illegal market for immigrant child-care workers without affecting their wages significantly. But the pool of legal, qualified providers would undoubtedly expand.
Yet under the immigration code, it is easier to bring in a shepherd or kosher cook than someone to care for children in the home or a day-care center. That paradox raises the question: For whom, exactly, is the United States rolling out the red carpet?
The United States lets foreigners come here to live in two basic ways: as temporary immigrants on work visas (it let 24.8 million into the country in 1996, the last year for which figures are available) and as permanent residents (915,900 came in 1996).
The State Department issues a veritable alphabet soup of temporary work visas (A to S, with many varieties in each category) that benefit everyone from defecting Cuban baseball pitchers to Bulgarian folk dancers. But other than a program for au pairs, there is no temporary category exclusively for child care professionals.
 
Inexperienced Au Pairs
In fact, the au pair program is actually considered a cultural exchange program. Every year, the program provides about 11,000 foreign men and women, ages 18 to 26, with an opportunity to visit the United States for up to 12 months for an educational experience mixed with baby-sitting.
Even that popular source of child care now has a cloud over it after Louise Woodward, a 19-year-old British au pair, was convicted of killing her 8-month-old charge in Massachusetts last November.
"The au pair program brings to the U.S. often the youngest and least experienced child care providers," Mr. Maggio said. "It's children taking care of children."
Au pairs aside, there are very few child-care visas issued each year and, not surprisingly, they benefit mainly the well-off. American business executives, Government employees or foreign correspondents who work overseas but who are temporarily assigned to the United States are allowed to bring household help back with them.
In the second major category of immigrants -- those granted permanent residency, symbolized by the green card -- most of those admitted are sponsored by family members who live here legally or by employers who can demonstrate a lack of American workers to do the same jobs.
The outlook for those seeking green cards for child care is bleak. Congress has shrunk the category used to bring in household help to 5,000 positions a year, down from 27,000 a year a decade ago, extending the wait for applicants from years to decades. "If you start the green-card process for your baby sitter now, she'd be eligible to care legally for your grandchildren," Mr. Maggio said.
There is no specific green-card category for household help. Household workers, no matter how qualified, are typically granted green cards as "unskilled workers," a category that has sharply been reduced to accommodate family members of permanent residents and citizens, and to make room for more workers in what the Labor Department considers higher-skilled occupations.
"This is a hole in our visa system and a hole in our labor force," said Jeanne Butterfield, executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association in Washington. "As the economy continues to be strong, people need to step back and realize this is something Congress needs to address."
There is a way to sponsor immigrant household workers and obtain green cards for them in a couple of years -- if you're rich. And the help has to be butlers, chefs or managers who supervise the staff who work at mansions or estates. "But for normal mortals, it's like anything else," Mr. Maggio said. "Getting legal household help has become like getting a Gulfstream IV jet."
And political forces on Capitol Hill have conspired against immigrants who might fill child-care roles. Democrats and Republicans are wary of championing new or expanded categories for foreign-born nannies, because they are perceived as benefiting mainly the upper classes.
Other immigrants who could help fill the child care gap are facing an uphill struggle. Under an agreement lawmakers brokered before Congress recessed last November, immigrants who qualify to become permanent residents have until Jan. 14 -- this Wednesday -- to apply in this country. After that date, they would have to apply for a permanent visa from home, risking being barred from re-entering this country for 3 to 10 years. If they stay here, they are illegal aliens and risk expulsion.
Advocates like Marcy Whitebook, director of the Center for the Child Care Workforce in Washington, want a more rational approach. "The question now is how to build a skilled and stable work force," she said. "People who make the best care-givers are those who see it as a career, rather than feeling it's the only thing they can do." And for many parents, immigrants may fit the bill.

HEADLINE: How Much Is Enough In Saving for Retirement?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Mr. Waddell correctly points out several distortions about the advice that Americans are receiving about their retirement planning. 
 With regard to the problem of excessive savings -- caused, in part, by guessing what future inflation rates will be -- a very simple and effective technique is available that could encourage more people to save by making their goals far more realistic and attainable.
When you consider your retirement accumulation using this technique, called "serial savings," inflation is factored in on a year-by-year basis. The amount of savings is increased each year by the rate of inflation.
Although the dollar amount increases every year, each year's investment will feel the same as a percentage of income.

WHEELS
All Very Swiftian
No need to be shipwrecked on an exotic island to have your sense of scale demolished: a modern Gulliver need go no farther than Detroit. At the auto show last week, Volkswagen rolled out its new Beetle, which returns to the Lilliputian end of the United States market after a 21-year absence, while just a few booths away Ford unveiled its Brobdingnagian new F-250, a pickup whose hood ornament is further off the ground than Dr. Ruth Westheimer's chin. Car makers and critics braced for a struggle over the Yahooish way light trucks have of mangling most any car they hit broadside; manufacturers are quietly pushing to have new side-impact standards set no higher than in Europe, where, unlike here, big light trucks are scarce. But the news on the environmental front might please the Houyhnhnms, Swift's race of selfless, sagacious horses: the Big Three and several Japanese companies are talking seriously about making new high-technology, high-mileage cars in the next few model years, and Ford says it will voluntarily upgrade its light trucks to meet the much tougher emissions standards imposed on cars.
 
PRICES
Won't Be Undersold
Wholesale prices fell two-tenths of a percent in December and 1.2 percent for all of 1997, the Labor Department announced, and the "core" rate, which excludes the volatile food and energy numbers, fell for the first time in memory last year. Analysts are calling the inflation outlook the best in a generation, with even the labor markets -- tight, by historical standards -- on good behavior. Among economists, fretting about inflation is beginning to give way to fretting about possible deflation and the economic harm that would come.
 
JOBS
Won't Be Idle
The latest evidence from the astrophysics lab says the universe will keep expanding forever, a characteristic that the American economy and labor force seem to share these days. An unexpectedly plentiful 370,000 new jobs were created in December, but unemployment actually ticked up slightly because an even greater number of new workers entered the labor force, the Labor Department reported. A record 64.1 percent of American adults are now in the labor force, but it wasn't a salary bidding war that drew them in: Real hourly wages rose just 0.1 percent last month.
 
BUDGETS
You Mean There's Extra?
President Clinton said he planned to submit a balanced budget to Congress for fiscal 1999, three years ahead of schedule, and predicted a comparatively trivial Federal deficit of about $22 billion for 1998. Wall Street yawned, having long since predicted that the strong economy would erase the deficit, but political leaders dived gleefully into an unaccustomed task: arguing over what to do with spare money. The President is expected to discuss new initiatives on child care and the environment in his State of the Union message later in the month; House Speaker Newt Gingrich is talking about tax cuts. Consumers are way ahead of Washington this time: They unexpectedly reversed a three-year borrowing binge in November, reducing their total indebtedness by $4.2 billion, according to Treasury Department figures released last week.
 
ASIAN TURMOIL, PART I
Rescues Needing Rescues
It turns out not to be quite as simple as tossing out a multibillion-dollar life preserver and hauling in the rope. Financial rescue plans sponsored by the International Monetary Fund for several Asian countries showed signs of unraveling last week, largely because of the reluctance of the recipients to swim along quietly in the specified direction. Indonesia announced a new budget that blithely ignored the I.M.F.'s fiscal advice, and when the rescuers' displeasure became known, the country's currency and its stock market sank like stones. Dire rumors, panic buying and fears of political instability swept the country. And in Thailand, which was the first Asian domino to fall, I.M.F.-required austerity measures are already pinching too hard for the Prime Minister, who asked for an easing of the terms.
 
ASIAN TURMOIL, PART II
Devil in the Details
Compared with Southeast Asia, South Korea seems calm. Its streets are quiet, and the stock market has stanched its bleeding. But the particulars of the debt restructuring the country badly needs are proving thorny. After a week of squabbling, creditor banks were near agreement on a plan to give the country a breather of 30 to 90 days on loan payments. Still to be sorted out is what happens next: who will buy a proposed bond issue and what kinds of government guarantees they will get.
 
COMPUTERS
New Year, New Prospects
January is the time of year Steven Jobs likes to spring surprises: He introduced the Macintosh computer with a stunning "1984"-themed commercial that ran just once, during that year's Super Bowl; since then new products from Apple Computer have often been announced at the January MacWorld trade show. Mr. Jobs's show stopper this year was his announcement that Apple had managed a small profit in the first quarter of its 1998 fiscal year. The crisis is far from over for the company Mr. Jobs founded -- and is now trying to turn around after a three-year slide in other hands -- but Wall Street was delighted by the progress so far, pushing Apple's stock up 20 percent.
 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS
Buying Local
Why invent what you can buy instead? SBC Communications, which bought Pacific Telesis in 1996 in the first merger among the Baby Bells, has announced a deal to acquire Connecticut's phone company, Southern New England Telephone, one of the few remaining sizable independents, for $4.4 billion. One lure: S.N.E.T. has regulatory permission to sell long-distance service to its local customers, a privilege so far denied to SBC and its former Bell siblings. And AT&T was attracted by a 26-state local franchise when it agreed last week to buy Teleport Communications for $11.3 billion in stock. The deal would spare AT&T the aggravation and cost of building its own new local service from scratch, and had been expected for months.

HEADLINE: Detroit Turns a Corner

 BODY:
For anyone worried about global warming, last week's most heartening news came from an unlikely source -- the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. All three auto makers announced that they were nearing production of marketable cars that will rely less on gas-burning engines and more on exotic power sources like fuel cells. Because conventional engines account for one-third of America's output of carbon dioxide, the main global warming gas, this was a revelation of potentially enormous significance.
It was also, in a way, amusing, or so it must have seemed to President Clinton. Mr. Clinton has placed a heavy bet on the proposition that American technological know-how can counter the global warming threat at relatively low cost. For this he has been soundly bashed by the auto makers, the producers of coal and oil and other industries that spent millions of dollars last year belittling the threat of global warming and warning that any serious effort to fight it, like the treaty Mr. Clinton agreed to in Kyoto, Japan, would bankrupt the American economy. Yet here were some of the President's fiercest critics tripping over one another to tout their "green" cars and, in the process, suggesting that Mr. Clinton's faith in technology may not be misplaced. 
 Al Gore could also be forgiven a smile. In his 1992 book, "Earth in the Balance," the Vice President called for "eliminating" the internal combustion engine in the next 25 years -- a comment that reinforced his reputation in some circles as a dangerous thinker. Yet right there at the auto show, the chairman of the General Motors Corporation, John Smith, stated flatly that "no car company will be able to thrive in the 21st century if it relies solely on internal combustion engines." To Detroit-watchers, this seemed an epiphany.
To anyone who has followed the big environmental struggles of the past quarter-century, Detroit's change of tune fit neatly into a familiar historical pattern. There has always been a big gap between industrial leaders who say they cannot do something and their engineers, who usually figure out a way to do it. Before Congress passed the 1970 Clean Air Act, Detroit argued that significant pollution reductions would be utterly impractical or prohibitively expensive. Then along came the catalytic converter that, at modest cost, eventually cut harmful tailpipe emissions by 95 percent. Likewise, the oil companies predicted economic doom when Congress mandated cleaner fuels in 1990. Their chemists, however, have since managed to produce such fuels without disturbing profits.
As the record suggests, American industry is not known for spontaneous acts of environmental virtue. But it will respond to timely regulation and commercial realities. One such reality is that Japan is moving quickly to develop low-emission cars. The Japanese caught Detroit flat-footed with their small cars during the oil-price shocks in the 1970's, and Detroit clearly does not wish to be left behind again. In this case, the Federal Government has become an active partner rather than a regulatory adversary. Many of the latest innovations have emerged from the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles, into which Washington has poured nearly $400 million over the last four years.
One question now is whether the auto makers will continue to oppose the Kyoto treaty. The comment by G.M.'s Mr. Smith suggests that Detroit is beginning to see itself as a critical part of the eventual solution to global warming. If true, that would be the most hopeful news of all from the automobile show.

HEADLINE: Indonesia's Downward Spiral

 BODY:
Despite a generous international bailout last year, Indonesia is sinking deeper into financial chaos and political paralysis. This weekend, emissaries from the Clinton Administration and the International Monetary Fund are traveling to Jakarta for urgent meetings on the crisis. They should insist that Indonesia fulfill its pledges to carry out tough economic reforms. Beyond that, they need to make clear that the markets there have collapsed as much from concern over President Suharto's corrupt brand of crony capitalism as from other underlying ailments.
Mr. Suharto has long been warned that a closed economic and political system must be opened up. Indonesia's continued prosperity provided an excuse for not doing so. Even last week, with the economy in crisis, Mr. Suharto announced a budget with wildly unrealistic projections and took several other steps that backed away from earlier promises of fiscal and monetary austerity. If he does not abandon his complacent approach, he risks a cutoff of the vital funding from overseas needed to keep Indonesia solvent. 
 Indonesia has important strengths, including its ability to export manufactured goods and oil. The current crisis arose as international lenders pumped money into its banking and corporate system, thinking that prosperity would last forever. Once the Indonesian currency started dropping, the loans could not easily be repaid. Last week, the currency all but collapsed, throwing hundreds of banks and companies into bankruptcy. Citizens have begun hoarding food. Fears of unemployment and social unrest are spreading. Some Indonesians even fear possible intervention by the army. For the first time, there is open talk that President Suharto, in power for 32 years, should retire.
There is a danger in Indonesia of confusing the country's interests with Mr. Suharto's. Of course, unemployment, riots and political instability would not benefit anyone. The I.M.F. must be careful not to impose such strict measures that the country is thrown into a ruinous collapse.
But there must be no accommodation for the Suharto family's financial interests, which Mr. Suharto has so far shielded. Import monopolies benefiting companies tied to the Suharto family have been retained. Although 16 insolvent banks were closed, one of the President's sons was allowed to reopen his own bank under a different name. Other needless projects, including an unnecessary power plant on Java, are going forward because of their connections to the Suharto family.
The importance of taking vigorous steps to defend Indonesia's currency and to insure the repayment of loans goes far beyond Indonesia itself. A default by Indonesia could spread throughout the region and, from there, jolt the banking systems of Japan, Europe and the United States. As for Mr. Suharto, he increasingly seems more of an impediment to reform. Until recently, he had been expected to be easily reappointed in a few months to another term by his loyal National Assembly. Instead of clinging to power in a nation now mired in debt, Mr. Suharto may well need to decide that the best thing he can do for his country is to step aside. So far, he has shown no sign that he is prepared to put Indonesia's future ahead of his own.

HEADLINE: Ulster Is Downcast as New Violence Clouds Talks

BYLINE: By JAMES F. CLARITY 

DATELINE: BELFAST, Northern Ireland, Jan. 10

 BODY:
The people of Northern Ireland, both the Protestant majority and the Roman Catholic minority, say they fear that after four months of relative calm the sectarian killing here is on the verge of erupting again.
Guerrilla warfare involving the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republican Army, several Protestant paramilitary groups and the British Army has left more than 3,200 people dead in the last 29 years. 
 But last September optimism rose as the main political parties here and the British and Irish Republic Governments finally sat down at the same table to negotiate a peaceful settlement.
The army went back to the barracks, leaving the Royal Ulster Constabulary alone to patrol the streets of Belfast and other cities. At the peace table, Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, spoke for British withdrawal from the province while Protestants insisted that it remain British.
British rule has been the crux of the conflict through this century, but now the parties were talking, not shooting. Hopes that the war was really over seemed to rise.
But a recent surge of sectarian violence and a Protestant threat to undermine the talks, which are to resume in Belfast on Monday, has put the army and huge Saxon armored vehicles back on the street.
The people of West Belfast, where much of the killing has taken place over the years, say that they hope it will not happen, but that they expect more bombs and shootings, even as Mo Mowlam, the Northern Ireland Secretary, appeared on Friday to have persuaded Protestant paramilitary groups not to boycott the talks.
Without the participation of the Protestant parties allied to guerrilla fighters, there is not likely to be any significant progress in the negotiations.
"Recent acts of sectarian violence have once again left the people of Northern Ireland very fearful for the future," Ms. Mowlam, the highest-ranking official in the British province, said she told the Protestant prisoners in the Maze prison on Friday.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, the most prominent Irish-American politician in Irish eyes, and long an opponent of the violence of the I.R.A. and Protestant guerrillas, reflected the public fear, speaking in Londonderry on Friday night before coming to Belfast today on his first visit to Northern Ireland.
In remarks that received prominent coverage on television and on the front page of newspapers here, he said: "There are some who seek to wreck the peace process. They are blinded by fear of a future they cannot imagine, a future in which respect for differences is a healing and unifying force.
"They are driven by an anger that holds no respect for life, even for the lives of children."
New disputes and stalemates, many people say, will stall the talks. Splinter paramilitary groups, which are not taking part in the talks and are not bound by cease-fires called by larger groups, will continue to use violence in an attempt to end the entire peace effort as the main parties argue over who is ultimately responsible for the new attacks.
"I think it's all going to blow up again," said Aidan Darragh, 31, the owner of a newspaper and candy shop on Andersonstown Road in the Catholic part of West Belfast. "It'll break into total mayhem."
Maureen McCorry, 62, a Catholic housewife, said, "I can't see any answer but civil war." She said her brother, a cabdriver, had once been kidnapped and threatened at gunpoint by Protestant paramilitaries.
On the Shankill Road, an adjacent Protestant area, the mood was the same.
A few yards from where an I.R.A. bomb killed nine Protestants in 1993, Eleanor Toal, 19, who is unemployed, said, "I think it's going to break up in violence again."
Her friend, June McNeill, 32, a kitchen assistant, agreed. "Eighty percent of Protestants think it will blow up," she said.
Mark Armstrong, 26, pastor of the Elim Pentecostal Church on the Shankill Road, said his group fostered optimism and love. "But if the trouble does escalate, we're ready," he said. "We believe that God's going to do a mighty work and change lives here in this road."
The politicians involved in the formal talks seem aware of the pessimism.
"My heart is breaking," said Monica McWilliams, 42, a leader of the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition, a Catholic and a participant in the formal talks. "I will never forgive myself if this blows apart. I am close to despair, close to tears. We're almost within reach of a settlement but once again I find I'm standing on the brink, emotionally and intellectually."
In the interviews in West Belfast, the intolerance and mistrust between Catholics and Protestants that has fueled the guerrilla warfare surfaced quickly, more evident now than when there was a lull in the violence.
Mrs. McCorry, the Catholic housewife, said: "The Protestants don't want to be bothered with Catholics. They think Catholics are rubbish. They don't want us to have an equal share. I'm not an extreme person, but since the I.R.A. started bombing all over the place, suddenly Catholics started to get jobs they never had before. It was the bombing that made the British Government open up its ears. Before, we were knocking at the window with a sponge."
"It's terrible to say," she added, "that people have to be killed for the Government to hear what we're talking about. It used to be that everyone who came to my house, the milkman, the bread man, the oil man, the coal man, was Protestant. Now I have a Catholic milk, bread and oil man."
Ms. McNeill, the Protestant kitchen worker, said of Catholics: "Everything is going their way. They're living in lovely homes, built by the Government -- we're living in dumps."
"Half of them are running about getting the dole," she said, referring to public housing and financial aid for Catholics, who have double the unemployment rate of Protestants in the province. "Even their dole is bigger than ours."
The new violence began two weeks ago when a Protestant paramilitary leader, Billy Wright of the Loyalist Volunteer Force, was shot dead in a prison yard by inmates belonging to the Irish National Liberation Army, a group that had splintered from the I.R.A. Protestant gunmen, members of Mr. Wright's group, then retaliated by killing two Catholic men in Belfast.
Simultaneously, Protestant prisoners at the Maze, outside Belfast, began to tell their political leaders that their interests were being ignored by the British and Irish Governments, the talks' sponsors.
In December, they noted, the Irish Government granted early release to nine I.R.A. men serving time for terrorist crimes. The Protestants made it clear they too wanted to be released early and urged their political leaders, of the Ulster Democratic and Progressive Unionist parties, to consider boycotting the formal peace talks that are to resume here on Monday under the chairmanship of George J. Mitchell, the former United States Senator.
Ms. McWilliams said she still had hope for the formal peace talks.
"It's a ship going into gale force winds," she said. "But if we keep a calm and steady hand on the wheel and all hands on deck then we're going to make our way through the storm. But storms are naturally caused and our storms are man-made."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS AIR FARES CLIMB, PROMPTING CALLS FOR REMEDY

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Business travelers are continuing to pay increasingly higher air fares, with the price of a domestic round-trip coach ticket on at least one route surpassing $2,000 for the first time.
Over all, air fares for business travelers have climbed nearly 40 percent in the last two years, according to American Express Travel. And while there appears to be no immediate end in sight to the increases, they have prompted some members of Congress to take a new look at reining in the airline industry. 
 The extent of these higher business air fares can be seen on the Boston-to-Los Angeles route, where an unrestricted round-trip ticket bought on the day of flight costs $2,004 on any of eight major airlines -- even though a leisure traveler in the next seat, who booked well in advance, might pay as little as $238 for a nonrefundable ticket.
Several other routes are flirting with the $2,000 threshold, including New York to Los Angeles, which now costs $1,836 for an unrestricted round-trip coach ticket.
American Express predicts that business fares will rise an additional 6 percent this year. And corporate efforts to control those costs have shown little success. Last week, a group supported by 58 companies that was the most potent force pressing the airlines to hold down ticket prices suspended its operations in frustration after four years.
Unlike leisure travelers who can buy discounted tickets weeks in advance, many business travelers need to make trips on short notice and without restrictions on flight changes and refunds. Moreover, the planes have become more crowded than they have been in years, making seats available at the last minute scarcer and more expensive.
The rising business fares have led to a growing chorus of complaints about airline deregulation and have increased pressure on the Clinton Administration and Congress to take action. Many politicians blame high air fares for hampering economic growth in their districts.
"I know economically it has hurt us," said Representative Louise Slaughter, Democrat of New York, who represents the Rochester area and plans to introduce the Airline Competition and Lower Fares Act in the coming session.
The new bill will join four similar ones that have already been introduced by, among others, Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who is chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, and Representative John J. Duncan, the Tennessee Republican who is chairman of the House Aviation Subcommittee.
The major airlines strongly oppose any Government action, arguing that more people are flying at lower fares than ever before. Airline executives say that businesses and politicians did not offer to help them in the early 1990's, when they lost $13 billion. Now that the economy is strong and passenger traffic is at record levels, they believe they should be able to reap the benefits.
Executives also point out that even though airlines are expected to make record profits for the third consecutive year in 1998, their profit margins still lag behind those of many other industries.
Business travelers feel particularly abused because they account for more than half of airline revenue. For in the through-the-looking-glass world of airline pricing, the fares paid by leisure travelers, who book as long as a month in advance and stay over a weekend night, have in many cases declined, while last-minute fully refundable fares, which are most often paid by business travelers, are skyrocketing.
"The carriers always say that the business traveler is inelastic," said Peter M. Buchheit, director of travel and meeting services for the Black & Decker Corporation, which spent $18 million on air tickets for its American employees last year. "We need to travel so we will pay whatever it costs. But it has reached a point where we can't pay it anymore."
The burden of high fares is even greater on small companies. John W. Galbraith, president of Twin Advertising, a small company based in Rochester that had $2 million in billings last year, said he was thinking about dropping clients outside the city because the high cost of visiting them cancels out the profit he makes from having their business.
"Basically, what the airlines have done to companies like ours is kept us from growing," he said.
The airlines say the higher business fares reflect the higher level of service that business passengers expect. They demand a choice of multiple flights to the same place each day and the convenience of being able to walk on a plane at the last minute -- both of which are expensive.
"We could sell out planes 21 days in advance and that would be it," said Tony Molinaro, a spokesman for United Airlines. "But businessmen say, 'I can't plan my business schedule 21 days in advance.' "
As for the $2,000 fare between Boston and Los Angeles, he said that only a small fraction of passengers would pay that amount because so many discounted fares are available.
But the fact remains that business fares have risen drastically at a time when overall inflation is at a record low. American Express Travel calculated that the average coach business fare between 215 pairs of cities in November, the latest figure available, was $890 round trip, the highest level since the company began tracking fares in 1992.
"Frustration is at an all-time high," said Eric Altschul, a vice president at American Express Consulting Services, speaking of large corporations. "Because it is a cost that they can't control."
So far, efforts by businesses to rein in the airlines have been unsuccessful. Nearly four years ago, Kevin Mitchell, a former travel manager at the Cigna Corporation, formed a group called the Business Travel Contractors Corporation. The idea was to use the leverage of corporate purchasing power to persuade the airlines to simplify their fare structures and guarantee the price of tickets over the term of a contract.
Mr. Mitchell managed to get the backing of 58 companies, including Chrysler, Black & Decker and Procter & Gamble, which spend a total of $2 billion a year on travel. But he could not persuade the airlines to make a deal. Instead, the big carriers agreed to some demands and cut side deals with companies.
Last week, he gave up. "Frankly, a lot of corporations were unwilling to jump on until we could get one of the major carriers," he said.
Over the last year, Mr. Mitchell and other advocates became increasingly convinced that the answer to higher ticket prices was more competition, and he focused more on lobbying in Washington.
The bills pending in Congress seek to create more landing and takeoff opportunities at crowded airports in Chicago, New York and Washington and to use the power of the Department of Transportation to discourage the major carriers from driving low-cost challengers out of business.
The Clinton Administration is already preparing a set of guidelines due out soon that would define what incumbent carriers can do when competing with smaller rivals.
"We have had the statutory authority for 19 years since deregulation to move against airlines for unfair competition but have never done so," said Patrick V. Murphy, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Transportation.
But few believe that much will change until the economy cools or the airlines buy so many new airplanes that there is a glut of seats as there was in the early 1990's.
"The market has a voice of its own," said Kevin C. Murphy, an airline industry analyst at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover. "The businesses are complaining, but they are still buying the tickets."

HEADLINE: Jack Conway, 80, Leader in War on Poverty

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10

 BODY:
Jack T. Conway, who as an official of the Johnson Administration worked to establish Head Start and several other Great Society programs, died on Tuesday morning at his home in Sarasota, Fla. He was 80.
The cause was respiratory failure, his family said. 
 A longtime labor worker, Mr. Conway took a leave of absence from his job at the A.F.L.-C.I.O. in 1965 to head President Lyndon B. Johnson's Community Action Program, an initiative intended to distribute grants to more than 250 communities as part of the Administration's War on Poverty. The Community Action Program was a part of the Office of Economic Opportunity, the agency primarily responsible for coordinating the anti-poverty drive.
As the program's director, Mr. Conway helped to arrange financing for the Head Start and Job Corps programs across the country. At that time, Head Start was intended to assist preschool children from low-income families. But Mr. Conway later resigned, frustrated by what he saw as political battles between liberals and conservatives in Congress over the programs. The programs came under attack from both sides, who saw them either as promoting political patronage or as doing little of actual benefit to the poor.
Mr. Conway came to Washington in 1960 as the deputy administrator of the Housing and Home Finance Agency in President John F. Kennedy's Administration. While there, he helped to draft the Omnibus Housing Act of 1961, which established the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
From 1970 to 1975, Mr. Conway was the first president of Common Cause. Among the group's priorities were public opposition to the war in Vietnam and campaign finance reform. Mr. Conway is credited with steering the group through a time of membership and budget difficulties.
Afterward, Mr. Conway was the executive director of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. He later served as the senior vice president of the United Way of America.
An active member of the Democratic Party, Mr. Conway was chairman of the national committee of Americans for Democratic Action in 1968, when the group was in a contentious debate over supporting the Presidential campaign of either Mr. Johnson or Eugene J. McCarthy.
Mr. Conway also worked with a number of nonprofit organizations to improve social conditions in cities.

Traffickers in Sex Victimizing Slavic Women
Across the world, the selling of naive and desperate young women into sexual bondage has become one of the fastest-growing criminal enterprises. Since the fall of Communism, experts say, women from Russia and Ukraine are being particularly victimized. "Can people really buy and sell women and get away with it?" asked one dismayed young woman. 1
 
Pressure on Suharto Grows
Indonesia's leading opposition figure, Megawati Sukarnoputri, called on President Suharto to step down when his term ends in March and said she was ready to succeed him. As the nation's economic problems reached crisis proportions, pressure grew from other quarters, too, for Mr. Suharto to end his 32-year rule. 8 

Quake at the Great Wall
A powerful earthquake toppled mud-and-brick houses near the Great Wall, killing scores of Chinese and leaving perhaps 20,000 families homeless. Tremors were felt in Beijing, 150 miles away. 9

Interest Groups to Play Big Role in Campaigns
From the left and from the right, so many independent interest groups are poised to spend large sums on advertising to influence elections this year that Republicans and Democrats alike fear the candidates may find themselves playing bit parts in their own campaigns. The first Congressional campaign of 1998, in Santa Barbara, Calif., offers a preview. 1
 
From Pinnacle to the Brink
With President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore virtually cleared of wrongdoing in the long-running campaign finance imbroglio, Secretary of Interior Bruce Babbitt remains the highest-ranking political figure most at risk from the continuing campaign finance investigation. The irony of it all is not lost on him. 1
 
Ambiguity of Mental Fitness
The decision by the judge in the Unabom trial to order a mental competency evaluation of the defendant, Theodore J. Kaczynski, begins a complex process in which there are few widely agreed upon standards. More than 25,000 evaluations are ordered by the courts each year in the United States. But as Mr. Kaczynski's case has shown, the issues of how and when to carry them out and what it means to be competent to stand trial remain unclear at best, mental health experts said. 1
 
Why Nichols Jury Deadlocked
In vote after vote, a majority of jurors raised their hands to sentence Terry L. Nichols to death, but they were blocked by a few holdouts, according to two jurors in the second Oklahoma bombing trial. Leading the opposition to the death penalty was the jury's forewoman. 14

H.M.O. Premiums Increasing
Health maintenance organizations in several states are asking customers to pay larger premiums this year after several years of holding down prices to spur enrollment, particularly in the Northeast, which has long regarded managed care with suspicion. Health care experts said they expected premiums to rise by 5 to 10 percent next year around the region. 1

President Clinton yesterday declared five upstate New York counties a Federal disaster area in the aftermath of a winter ice storm that has spawned floods, crippled the region's power system and pushed thousands of people into shelters, including one inside a state prison. 21
 
Stealth Antennas
As the number of wireless phone subscribers rapidly expands, so does the need for antennas to handle the cellular traffic. While many of the small antennas are on conventional poles or towers, they are increasingly being hidden in "stealth towers," like a 100-foot-tall artificial pine tree built last summer in Franklin Lakes, N.J.. 21

Choose One: Koufax or Sutton?

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
The general managers were given a choice. They could have either of two pitchers, and they could make their selection knowing what the pitchers would do in their careers. One pitcher would pitch for 12 years, having a poor-to-mediocre first six years, then a spectacularly good last six years. The other would pitch for 23 years and win 324 games.
The general managers were asked to choose either Sandy Koufax or Don Sutton. 
 One of the first general managers responding to the question opted for Koufax and predicted that his colleagues would clearly do the same. But they did not. As intriguing as they all found the exercise, the outcome was just as intriguing because the general managers were clearly divided. Eight selected Koufax, six chose Sutton and two said they could not decide.
The exercise stemmed from Sutton's election to the Hall of Fame last week and the continued questioning of his credentials. Yes, Sutton's critics said, he had been the only eligible 300-game winner not in the Hall, but he amassed that total only because he pitched so long. Good health and durability, they argued, do not equal Hall of Fame caliber talent.
But the general managers thought otherwise. Those who chose Sutton generally said pitching is so fragile that it would be difficult to turn down the chance to get a pitcher who could last 23 years and win consistently, if not spectacularly.
"When you look at tying up a pitcher to a long-term contract," Gerry Hunsicker of the Houston Astros said, "one of the primary issues is how many innings is he going to give you and is he durable as opposed to wins. So many things affect wins -- run support, luck to a degree, defense, a lot of things. If you know a guy can give you 250 innings a year, year in and year out, that's the most important thing."
Sutton pitched more than 200 innings in each of his first 15 seasons and 20 of his 23. He had an eight-year stretch during which he exceeded 250 innings. He averaged 33 starts a season and made 34 starts in each of the first three seasons he pitched after his 40th birthday.
Those who opted for Koufax, however, could not avoid his gate appeal and the seduction of his last six seasons, in which he compiled a phenomenal 129-47 record (.733 winning percentage) and a 2.19 earned run average.
"I want the spectacular when you get there," Jim Bowden of the Cincinnati Reds said. "When you win pennants, you win with dominating guys. When you have a guy who wins 20, 25 games for six straight years, it gives your club a chance to win. I'm going to take the most dominating pitcher in baseball because there aren't that many of them."
Doug Melvin of the Texas Rangers cited the attraction that Koufax was and would be if he were dominating teams today.
"In this day and age we've become more entertainment oriented," he said. "I think the spectacular season and the real star status would stand out in today's game. It probably would be a moneymaker."
Ron Schueler of the Chicago White Sox said he would take Koufax "because you probably would have an extra 10,000 people per game that he pitches."
The response from Dave Dombrowski of the Florida Marlins epitomized the difficulty many of the general managers had in making their choices.
"I would love to have had Sandy Koufax in his good years," Dombrowski said. "I'd like to have that guy first of all. Then I'd take the guy who wins 324 games."
But that's taking the easy way out, and that was not one of the choices.
"When you say Sandy Koufax you think of the best pitcher over a time period there ever was," Dombrowski said. "So it's hard to say you wouldn't want Sandy Koufax. But developing him for six years would be a hard chore. I'd rather be getting some return in the beginning. But if I knew I had good starters or the time to develop him properly and you knew you would get those six years, that would be tough to turn down."
Sutton was a consistent pitcher day in and day out, the Marlins' executive added, but he averaged 14 victories a year, not enough to lead a team to a pennant. "I would take the six years of superb because I can't find those guys," Dombrowski concluded. "It gives me a chance to win six straight years."
Pat Gillick of the Baltimore Orioles echoed that reasoning.
"When you have an opportunity to win a pennant, you have to take the opportunity," he said. "With a .733 winning percentage, there's a darn good chance I could win pennants in those six years that Koufax had that record."
Ed Lynch, too, saw the overriding factor as the chance to win.
"There is definitely an attraction toward a pitcher that exhibits consistency for long periods of time," the Chicago Cubs' general manager said. "But the brass ring is the ultimate prize. You could compete for it several times with Sutton, but to get to the top of the baseball universe, Sandy Koufax is more attractive."
And Randy Smith of the Detroit Tigers said: "I'd take the dominating guy. I'd take the ace of the staff rather than the solid contributor."
The general managers who went with Sutton did not summarily dismiss Koufax. But as Bob Watson of the Yankees said: "Sitting in a chair where you'd like to have consistency and longevity, Don Sutton definitely has done that. Here's a solid starter for you. He was a guy you could count on."
Health and durability, Billy Beane of the Oakland Athletics said, come right behind statistical performance, and that is why he chose Sutton.
"If I can have a guy for 23 years," he added, "it's going to help me keep my job. The hardest thing is predictability. When we go into an off season, we project what the next season is going to be for the guy. The easier we can attach a statistical number to a pitcher, the more we can adjust to our strengths or weaknesses."
Bill Bavasi of the Anaheim Angels said he wanted the pitcher who had decent early years. "It's tough to carry a guy," he said.
Woody Woodward of the Seattle Mariners offered a similar view. "I'll take the guy who wins right out of the chute," he said. "I would take Sutton because he could help me win right now."
Terry Ryan of the Minnesota Twins put it simply. "Winning is the name of the game," he said, "and Sutton won."
Steve Phillips of the Mets offered an even simpler reason for his selection. He said he would take Koufax anyway, but remarked: "My owner is good friends with Koufax. I'll pick Koufax."
Fred Wilpon, the Mets' co-owner, and Koufax were teammates on their high school baseball team in Brooklyn.
 
300 Victories Hard to Do
The last pitcher to reach 300 victories was Nolan Ryan. He did it in 1990, becoming the sixth pitcher in a nine-season span to get there. Before that stretch, 19 seasons had gone by without a new 300-game winner. Some baseball people wonder if there will ever be another.
Roger Clemens leads active pitchers with 213 victories, followed by Dennis Eckersley with 193, Greg Maddux with 184, Jimmy Key with 180, Orel Hershiser with 179 and Dwight Gooden with 177.
Clemens could have four seasons like the last one, when he won 21 games, and still be three victories shy at 39. That kind of performance would virtually insure him of reaching 300, but no one expects him to reel off four such terrific seasons.
Maddux, who will turn 32 two weeks into next season, would seem to have the most realistic chance of getting there, but he would need six or seven seasons as productive as his past 10, during which he averaged 17.6 victories a season. He is guaranteed $57.5 million for the next five years. Will he have the economic or competitive incentive after that term to keep going? If not, maybe the skeptics will be right.
 
28 Going on 32
Orlando Hernandez, whose adventures as a defector have been well chronicled the past two weeks, has traveled from Cuba to the Bahamas to Costa Rica, but he still cannot shake his past. The pitcher, half brother of the Marlins' Livan Hernandez, says he is 28 years old. However, a baseball card that predated Hernandez's adventures by four years said he was born on Nov. 11, 1965. That would make him 32.

HEADLINE: Money-Losing Capital OTB Is Accused of Abuses in Spending

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 9

 BODY:
Investigators at the New York Racing and Wagering Board say alleged abuses by the president of the Capital Off-Track Betting Corporation and a lack of oversight by its board of directors show that Capital OTB was mismanaged.
With Davis Etkin as president, Capital OTB was the only offtrack betting corporation of the five in the state to lose money for four years in a row. 
 State auditors released a 36-page summary today of what they found at the company. It cited Mr. Etkin's eight cellular phones and $750,000 in complimentary meals for his family and friends.
Besides the allegations of outright abuses, the report alleged faulty fiscal policy, the lack of an independent auditor and the lack of proper oversight by Capital OTB's directors.
It was the second report critical of Mr. Etkin in as many days. On Thursday, an Albany County task force recommended that Mr. Etkin be dismissed.
Both reports conclude that taxpayers in the 17 counties covered by Capital OTB could have enjoyed millions of dollars in tax breaks if Capital OTB's directors had been more vigilant in overseeing Mr. Etkin. He has denied the allegations.
"Every dime we spend is business-related," Mr. Etkin said on Thursday. "Nobody has ever gone on a trip unless it was to a conference of some sort."
He said Capital OTB's revenue was comparatively low because its region was a "poor area" that was large and costly to manage.
But today's report said that "interviews and review of corporate documents identified a significant lack of fiscal oversight by Capital's management and board of directors."
Michael Hoblock, chairman of the racing board, said he was considering fining the Capital OTB directors up to $5,000 each and bringing civil lawsuits to recover misspent money.
Under Mr. Etkin, the management team spent more than $4 million over the last seven years on activities that had nothing to do with off-track betting, including tennis tournaments and tennis sponsorships, the racing board's report concluded.
"This money should have been forwarded to the localities in the form of net operating profits, which would have allowed elected local officials to spend it on property tax reductions or other county programs," the report said.
From 1992 to 1996, Capital OTB incurred losses of nearly $3 million, including a deficit of $510,710 in 1996. It was the only offtrack betting corporation in the state to report a loss that year.
The next-lowest performing offtrack betting corporation that year was the Suffolk County OTB, which made a profit of more than $2.2 million.
Most of the $750,000 in complimentary meals were taken by the Etkin family at the OTB-operated Tele-Theatre in Albany, when boxing matches were being simulcast there. For example, a March 17, 1996, a check for more than $800 was "comped" at the Tele-Theatre for the Etkin family.
Mr. Etkin is paid $219,000 a year as chairman and chief executive of Capital OTB.
Investigators with the office of the State Attorney General, Dennis C. Vacco, are going over the racing board's report, but it is too early to say whether a case against Mr. Etkin will be developed from it, said Joe Mahoney, a spokesman for Mr. Vacco.
In September, Mr. Vacco obtained a guilty plea from Julie Frankel, a bookkeeper at an OTB-operated club, for embezzling $85,514.
Based in Schenectady, Capital OTB operates 54 betting parlors in a 17-county area encompassing all of northeastern New York that stretches from south of Albany to the Canadian border and from the Rome/Utica area to the Massachusetts border.

Indonesia's Crisis Deepens

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
Just when Washington thought it had contained the Asian contagion in Korea, it erupted again -- this time back in Indonesia. President Suharto's Government promised wide reforms when the International Monetary Fund came in with an economic bailout package in October. But Indonesia has now backtracked on those commitments, especially rules that would impinge on the multibillion-dollar Suharto family enterprises. All week the Indonesian currency fell like a rock, and residents of Jakarta began to hoard food. 
 President Clinton called Mr. Suharto to say he had to comply with the I.M.F. and he sent high American officials to Indonesia to deliver the message personally. But the big issue was whether Mr. Suharto will stay in power or be pushed out by his disillusioned countrymen. DAVID E. SANGER

In Spite of El Nino
The warming effects of El Nino notwithstanding, the County Department of Parks, Recreation and Conservation has released a full schedule of cross-country skiing and outdoor skating for this winter.
Cross-country skiing is permitted every day in daylight hours at the following parks, golf courses and nature centers: Blue Mountain Reservation in Peekskill, Croton Gorge in Cortlandt, Croton Point Park in Croton-on-Hudson, Kitchawan Preserve in Yorktown, Lasdon Park and Aboretum in Somers, Mohansic Golf Course in Yorktown Heights, Mountain Lake Parks in North Salem, Ward Pound Ridge Reservation in Cross River, Cranberry Lake Preserve in North White Plains, Maple Moor Golf Course and Saxon Woods Park in White Plains, Edith G. Read Natural Park and Wildlife Sanctuary and Marshlands Conservancy in Rye, Saxon Woods Golf Course in Scarsdale and Dunwoodie Golf Course, Lenoir Preserve, Sprain Lake Golf Course and Tibbetts Brook Park in Yonkers. 
 When a white flag with a green ball flies (indicating safe conditions) at the following locations, skating will be permitted: Blue Mountain Reservation in Peekskill, Bronxville Lake, Crestwood Lake in Yonkers and Hartsdale Pond along the Bronx River Parkway, Kensico Dam Plaza in Valhalla, Mountain Lakes Park in North Salem, Tibbetts Brook Park in Yonkers, Twin Lakes in Eastchester, Wampus Pond in Armonk and Willson's Woods Park in Mount Vernon.
To check conditions, call the Parks Department's information line at 242-7275 on weekdays. On weekends, call each park directly.
 
Taxpayer Report, Part 2
The Westchester 2000 Research Center, a public-private organization, has released the second volume of "Taxpayers' Report to the Taxpayers." The report on fiscal trends says governments and school districts have made progress in bringing operating costs under control. But because property assessments are eroding and outside aid is shrinking, officials will have to intensify efforts to maintain the gains.
"Real savings lie in cutting down on excessive governments and school districts," said Sal J. Prezioso, the executive director of Westchester 2000. He added that further personnel and organizational changes would be necessary to lower the cost of operations to satisfy taxpayers. The research center's latest report is an update of its 1994 "Governments at the Crossroads" report.
On a positive note, the new report, entitled "Current Fiscal Trends of Westchester Governments and School Districts," said that even though public school enrollments are on the rise, school district costs per pupil have been increasing at a slower rate. But it also said that all levels of government, including school districts, have taken on increasing amounts of public debt.
The report added that despite growth in residential property values, the total assessed value of all properties, including business properties, has been eroding since 1988, and unless the county is able to attract new businesses to help offset further declines, the tax burden on residents will increase.
Copies of the 40-page report will be available on Thursday at libraries, town and village halls and school district offices and Room 901, County Office Building, 148 Martine Avenue, White Plains. ELSA BRENNER

History Reveals Itself in Strange Ways

BYLINE: By ANDREA HIGBIE 

 BODY:
SO, what'll it be: Must See TV or the History Channel? For more and more people, this is not a silly question.
"We want to really bring history -- which some people think is dry and boring -- to a larger number of people," says Charlie Maday, vice president for historical programming at the History Channel. "We want to make it exciting for them." 
Apparently, the idea is working. The channel, which is owned by A&E, has swept up 43 million subscribers since it began three years ago this month.
Mr. Maday, who is 52, says the channel draws "educated, curious, upscale adults," 35 to 54 years old, and more men than women. It operates 24 hours a day, presenting historical documentaries, movies and mini-series.
Productions are commissioned by the channel, acquired by it, are created with other networks or are part of the in-house library. Two World War II accounts, "Hitler's Henchmen" and "Blood and Iron," were created with Z.D.F. and Krossfire respectively.
"We look for an angle that hasn't been told before," Mr. Maday says. "It's not the same old rehash."
"We told about the last mass execution in the United States," he says of the hanging of seven German prisoners of war at the military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kan., in August 1945. Commissioned by A&E and produced with Towers, "The Last Mass Execution" is a tale of death camps, military intelligence and lack of same, a defense lawyer with no legal training and a Presidential decision possibly based on re-election prospects. "We broke the story," Mr. Maday says. "It's history revealed."
Even in movie presentations, events are given a historical perspective. When the channel presents the 1996 HBO film "Gotti," starring Armand Assante as John Gotti, boss of the Gambino crime family, next Sunday, it will be with Sander Vanocur interviewing Jerry Capeci, co-author of "Gotti: Rise and Fall."
Not much goes uncommented on. "The Fifties," a series shown on New Year's Day and being rerun in April, presents the decade in the context of the events that led to it and followed, and includes interviews with David Halberstam, author of "The Fifties" (1994). "When the Century Was Young," an offering eventually to be rebroadcast, looks back even further, to colonial empires and World War I, to changing economies, fashions and etiquette.
"We're not interested in nostalgia for nostalgia's sake," Mr. Maday says. "Nostalgia has mostly an emotional appeal, but history touches upon the events and the ideas to make it really relevant. "The Big House," produced by Greystone Communications and scheduled for later this month, is a four-part mini-series about the four most notorious prisons in United States history: Eastern State Penitentiary, Sing Sing, Alcatraz (built to house the "worst of the worst") and Leavenworth. (Did you know that the Birdman of Alcatraz served most of his time, for murder, at Leavenworth?) Arrogance and miscalculation are the lessons of a documentary produced with the BBC titled "The Man Who Wanted to Start World War III." (It was Gen. Curtis E. LeMay.)
"There's nothing we wouldn't show," Mr. Maday says. Indeed. This includes this week's "Abominable Snowman" and "Dragons," produced by Filmroos for the channel's "In Search of History" series, as well as "The Great Depression," with Mario Cuomo, the former Governor of New York, as the host.
The subjects do tend toward the heavy side, but the channel is certainly fun-loving. A program called "Frankenstein," running on Tuesday, examines Mary Shelley's sources of inspiration; there are shows on big buildings, submarines, battleships and the Crown Jewels.
"It's heavy and light," Joe La Polla, director of scheduling for acquisitions, says of the programming. "We're not all about prisons and the history of Rome. We'll have a light look at highway hangouts and a serious look at the Ku Klux Klan."
Because history is omnipresent (though "not always pleasant," as Mr. Maday notes), pretty much any topic is up for grabs. So, what will it be? Must See TV or Must See History?

LOOSING THE BONDS
 The United States and South Africa
 in the Apartheid Years.
 By Robert Kinloch Massie.
 Illustrated. 896 pp. New York:
 Nan A. Talese/Doubleday. $40. 
 Five hundred years ago, Europeans made landfall both at the southern tip of Africa and in North America. The contrast between the subsequent histories of what are now South Africa and the United States has been riveting, and in some ways disturbing. In both places, a tiny handful of colonists originally found themselves surrounded by indigenous peoples; the outcome centuries later is drastically different.
That contrast was discussed by the historian George M. Fredrickson in his brilliant book "White Supremacy: A Comparative Study in American and South African History." And in Cape Town in 1966, Senator Robert F. Kennedy gave a speech (which makes one suspect yet again that Bobby was the most interesting and original of the Kennedys) describing his keen interest in a particular land, which had been settled by the Dutch in the 17th century and then taken over by the British, which had acquired independence, and where the native inhabitants were subdued -- "a land which was once an importer of slaves and now must struggle to wipe out the last traces of that form of bondage. I refer, of course, to the United States of America."
That speech is quoted by the Rev. Robert Kinloch Massie at the beginning of "Loosing the Bonds," whose subject is ostensibly less broad than Fredrickson's: the relationship between the two countries in the apartheid period from 1948 to 1994, and especially the campaign in the United States to sever commercial ties with South Africa. Massie is an Episcopal clergyman who has been politically active since he was at Princeton 20 years ago, when he led the campaign to compel the university to disinvest from South Africa. And so he is writing (though with conscious self-effacement) what is among other things personal history, a labor of love as well as a monumental work of scholarship.
Monumental is the word, and I must gently protest about its size. There is a tendency in American publishing at present toward books that are simply too long for their subject. I suspect that this is caused partly by cheap paper, and partly by the personal computer. These little critters are splendid at accumulating material and pouring it forth again. But no one has yet taught them the first rule of writing history, which is that the reader does not want to know everything the author knows.
That aside, this is a well-written and well-informed book, one that is indispensable for anyone interested in South Africa, of which it is in reality a thorough history. Beginning more than 300 years ago, Massie describes the country's gradual evolution, its transformation by mining and its capture politically in 1948 by Afrikaner nationalists, who found themselves (unlike the descendants of white American settlers) a small minority among a huge nonwhite majority, and who constructed their strange quasi-theocratic system, called "apartness," to justify white supremacist rule.
By the 1960's, and especially after the Sharpeville massacre, this system impinged on the consciousness -- and the conscience -- of the world. A campaign began against apartheid, and specifically to impose economic sanctions and withdraw investment. The struggle continued through the 1970's and into the next decade, with waves of black upheaval in South Africa, and with disinvestment abroad building to a crescendo in the late 80's: from January 1986 to April 1988, 1,400 American companies pulled out of South Africa, not quite as late in the day as Argentina's declaring war on Germany in March 1945.
By 1990 Nelson Mandela had been released from his appallingly long prison sentence, and by 1994 he was President of a multiracial South Africa. It was a story in which the world could and did take pride; Massie's account is a reminder of just how brutal the reality of apartheid was. For a work of this scope there are not many slips: the name "Afrikaner" was taken up by the Dutch, or Boers, later than Massie thinks; the Afrikaans word for brute force is "kragdadigheid," not "kragdigheid"; and the "London cricket club" that didn't go to South Africa in 1968 was in fact the English national team.
How much effect sanctions and disinvestment had on toppling apartheid is hard to estimate precisely. In 1977, the South African scholar R. W. Johnson published a fascinating book called "How Long Will South Africa Survive?" He didn't quite answer his own question, but the implied answer was "longer than you think." By the beginning of the 80's, when I first reported from South Africa, it was clear to me that white supremacy was doomed in the long run, and so it proved; but then the run also proved longer than many had been confidently predicting for decades.
It also seemed to me 15 years ago that there was an element of shadowboxing or playacting in the Western anti-apartheid campaign. South Africa could have been brought to its knees by a total embargo on its mineral production -- gold, diamonds, bauxite, vanadium and uranium. But that would have meant a real material sacrifice by the West, which disinvestment did not. There were after all plenty of other places, less obviously unethical but quite as lucrative, for American institutions to invest in.
This is not a retrospective argument against disinvestment. If plenty of those who indulged in prophecy on both sides of the argument now look silly, those like Margaret Thatcher and Henry Kissinger who defended South Africa as a bulwark against Communism look mean as well. But the campaign against apartheid itself sometimes ran the risks of self-righteousness and hypocrisy.
Massie knows this, since he is aware that Americans have a tendency "to caricature racial conflict," and are anyway not always in the strongest position to lecture others about racism. Even so, I think he goes astray when he links the anti-apartheid struggle with the civil rights struggle in the United States. Dr. Johnson said that the greater part of life's follies stems from the attempt to emulate that which we do not resemble; and a large part of political misprision stems from false analogy.
It was entirely natural for black Americans to identify with the oppressed black majority in South Africa. And Secretary of State William Rogers explained in 1970 that American opposition to South Africa was largely due to "increased identification of U.S. Negroes with African causes." But the truth is that African-Americans have almost nothing in common with the Africans of Africa: less than the average run of assimilated Italian-Americans have with Sicilians, say, or most Jewish Americans have with Israelis. That is, unless one chooses to believe in just those theories of ethnicity and "blood" on which apartheid was founded.
And the comparison of those two movements obscures as much as it illuminates. In Harlem in 1990, Massie writes, "Nelson and Winnie Mandela further cemented the symbolic unification of the American and the South African struggles over race when they were introduced to a huge crowd by Betty Shabazz, Malcolm X's widow, who declared that the two struggles were really one and the same." But they weren't. The civil rights struggle was about elementary justice; the South African struggle was partly about justice, but also about power.
For all his own intense involvement in the anti-apartheid cause, Massie is surely aware of the dangers of moralistic lecturing. Maybe he has been watching recent world developments. Different forms of American scolding have managed to unite in resentment the leaders of Western Europe; the rulers of Communist China; Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel; Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia, who recently blamed Jewish financiers for his country's problems -- and President Nelson Mandela of South Africa, who insisted on going to Libya to embrace Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi despite the vehement objections of the State Department. The rest of the world envies the Americans their good fortune of history and geography. Americans themselves might think more about its implications.

HEADLINE: A Couple of Kingmakers Talking Shop

BYLINE: By Gail Collins; Gail Collins is on the Times editorial board.

 BODY:
Ralph reed and george stephanopoulos, the most famous 36-year-olds in American politics, are in career transition. After six years in the service of Bill Clinton, Stephanopoulos quit his job as senior adviser to the President in 1997 to write his memoirs, teach at Columbia University and serve as resident talking head for ABC News. The same year, Reed left his job as executive director of the Christian Coalition to start a campaign consulting firm for "pro-family, pro-life, pro-free-enterprise" candidates. 
 They agreed to bring their new political per-spectives to a one-on-one discussion recently at The New York Times. Reed, who is credited with giving the religious conservative movement a wider appeal and less threatening image, repeatedly tried to link issues like abortion to broader political concerns like tax cuts. Stephanopoulos, who was hauled before both a grand jury and Congressional investigating committee during his White House career, kept returning to his concerns about the use of political corruption probes as partisan weapons. But they found surprising areas of common ground on topics from political strategy to protests at abortion clinics.
 
A Sentimental Education
Q: Does it ever feel demeaning, serving the political ambitions of others?
Reed: Sometimes I think it is, sure. You're in a position where you're sort of coming of age professionally. You've got some ideas and some aspirations of your own. And you have to sublimate them to the other person. But my own view is that it's a very good skill to learn.
Stephanopoulos: I agree with his analysis, but I don't like the word. I guess I don't think it's demeaning.
Reed: Demeaning's too strong a word.
Stephanopoulos: What you get, in return for sometimes having to, you know, carry bags or pass the towel over, is an education in how to give advice, see a decision taken , then defend it.
 
 Q: Can you criticize your candidate in front of the staff?
Reed: I don't think it's helpful. I think a strategist or adviser in a political capacity is the closest thing to a secular priest.
Stephanopoulos: (laughs) I was going to say altar boy.
Reed: That person has to know he can go into a confession with you, and you're not going to share that with anybody. I've always tried to be the person who set the tone for being the most loyal, defending the indefensible and demon-strating that you don't get anywhere by under-cutting the boss.
Stephanopoulos: Oh, absolutely. And as you're working for people in successively higher jobs, what you can say at a lower level becomes both impolitic and disloyal at a higher level.
 
 Don't Ask, Don't Tell
Q: Is it that you don't want your boss to tell you certain things? Are there certain things you can't say to him?
Stephanopoulos: There are certain things you shouldn't repeat. I mean, even saying this now -- because of the insanity of the criminalization of political disputes -- makes me nervous. People are going to say: What did Clinton tell you that you can't say? What law did he break?
Reed: There are things that all human beings say that if you came back 10 minutes later they wouldn't say again. If you look at the Watergate tapes, one failure on the staff level was that Haldeman and Ehrlichman would go in and meet with Nixon and he would say: we should go do this. And they would go out and do it.
Stephanopoulos: Right. But you know what probably will happen as more tapes come out? My guess is that Haldeman will be known as somebody who stopped 155 bad ideas and let two really bad ones go through that sent him to jail. What a price to pay.
 
 Q: Are there things about the candidate's private life you would never ask about?
Reed: It's a total G.I.-tract exam. You go over everything from taxes to personal life to business dealings to resume, curriculum vitae, grades -- everything is on the table. There's a parable in the New Testament where Christ basically says: don't go out and try to build a tower without calculating what it will cost. Because if you try to build it and you don't finish it, everybody will point to the unfinished tower and say: Look at what a failure you are. So, as an advocate and friend and adviser, you're saying, Let's count the cost. If there are things in your past that could become a major issue in the campaign and could wreak havoc on your life, your family, your marriage and your business partners -- you ought to know before you go.
Stephanopoulos: (laughing) That is the most elegant justification to get a candidate to turn over everything I've ever heard. From Lee Atwater and Machiavelli to Ralph Reed and the parable of the unfinished tower. I am really impressed.
 
Schooled in Scandal
Q: Is it good politics for the Republicans to have continuing investigations of the White House, when the public doesn't seem to care about it?
Stephanopoulos: It didn't work in 1992; it didn't work in 1996. Even if you don't have
a distaste for it, I would think some political strategist would stand up and say hey, it doesn't work.
Reed: I don't think we should try to use that process to try and gain a political advantage.
I mean, in spite of Iran-contra, Michael Dukakis lost in a landslide to George Bush. Ford, in spite of pardoning Nixon, had he run a better campaign probably would have beaten Jimmy Carter.
Stephanopoulos: Could have.
Reed: Could have. Easily. And the Republicans won the White House after Teapot Dome. Harding was dead, of course. (laughs)
Stephanopoulos: One of the things I do think has been unfair to President Clinton: I think he is the first President ever to have a sustained permanent investigation of issues that should have been wiped away by the election. The old rules were: put it before the voters. They decide. And they certainly had enough information.
 
Q: Has using scandal ever really worked to anyone's political advantage?
Reed: I'm not sure it has. You could almost make an argument that the Democrats should be glad the Republicans focused on Whitewater and Paula Jones instead of issues where Clinton could have been beaten.
 
 Q: Like?
Reed: Taxes, health care, term limits, things of that nature. Crime.
Stephanopoulos: I think Ralph's half-right. It was a bit of a gift -- though I'm sure the President would have preferred not to have been given that gift -- for them to do Whitewater and all those things. But I think you're wrong to think those issues are definite winners for Republicans all the time.
 
 Q: What about the flat tax as a future campaign issue?
Stephanopoulos: My slogan against it will be: read the fine print. The minute you have to come up with details you find out it's a tax cut for people earning over $200,000, but a tax increase for people earning under $200,000. If somebody actually tried to enact a flat tax, there'd be about as close as you'd have to a revolution in the country.
Reed: Well. Obviously we disagree. (laughter) I've urged candidates I've assisted to call for a single rate, simple tax that could be filled out on a postcard -- where the average family of four making $40,000 a year doesn't pay a dime in income tax and doesn't even have to file. I think there's a way to get there. We can debate the fine print. But let's pass something. Let's reform the tax system. Gephardt is very smart; he's got his own plan that does this. Gore really doesn't and the Clinton Administration really doesn't.
Stephanopoulos: Well, of course they don't, because what you just said is not possible. You just promised every American earning under $40,000 zero taxes. It's never going to happen. You can win a campaign promising every family they're not gonna pay taxes; I mean, I suppose you can win if people believe it.
 
 Faith, Hope and Charity
Reed: I think there's a great misunderstanding by those outside the religious conservative movement who believe the movement is focused on abortion in almost a reductionist way. I think their concerns are much broader than that. What they are concerned about is a loss of civility, a coarsening of the culture. Abortion is one symptom of that coarsening.
Stephanopoulos: But does that then lead to a shunning of the more coarse aspects of the right-to-life movement?
Reed: Absolutely, if by that you mean those who advocate the use of violence, for example.
 
 Q: What about people who block abortion clinics?
Reed: I think most people believe the First Amendment protects the right of free speech, including the right to sit in, in a nonviolent way. That's what protesters during the civil rights movement did.
Stephanopoulos: I think this is where Democrats make a mistake -- demonizing people who are acting in an honorable tradition of passive civil disobedience. I may not agree on the issue of abortion, but I have the absolute highest respect for somebody who believes enough in an issue that they're willing to go to jail for it. It's been a huge mistake for Democrats to want to harness the power of religious and spiritual movements when they agree, but to rule them out of bounds in the debate when they disagree....I think one of the things a lot of religious voters took away from Clinton, even when they disagreed with him vehemently, was that he was not hostile to the notion of faith.
Reed: No, he was not. In fact, other than Jimmy Carter there hasn't been a president in my lifetime who spoke more openly about matters of faith than Clinton.
Stephanopoulos: I've always wanted to ask you this. How does an average Christian Coalition voter deal with the question: President Clinton is a born-again Southern Baptist who goes to church every Sunday and professes his faith proudly, and Ronald Reagan never went to church, was divorced and didn't see his kids. How do they deal with that contradiction?
Reed: I'll give you a flippant answer and a serious answer. The flippant answer is, we're not electing the Pope....They're not judgmental in the sense that they're looking for someone just like them. They'll vote for a Jewish person who agrees with them on all of the issues -- cutting taxes and balancing the budget and protecting innocent human life and so forth. And they'll vote against someone who's a born-again Christian.
Stephanopoulos: But what does balancing the budget have to do with faith?
Reed: Well, that's a longer theological dis-cussion. But I would argue that a society, a business, a family that is living a level of prosperity by stealing from those who would come later -- that's a moral as well as an economic question.
 
 Q: Could a pro-choice Republican like Christine Todd Whitman get on the ticket in 2000?
Reed: I don't know about her, but without particularizing it, could someone be on the Republican ticket and be pro-choice? The answer, to the best of my judgement, is yes.
Stephanopoulos: If you're right, that's a big boon for the Republicans in 2000.
Reed: But I don't know that it will happen, if you look at who's running, who's likely to be the nominee in 2000, who they'd be likely to pick as a running mate. I think it would be unlikely that you'd have someone who opposed a ban on partial-birth abortion on the ticket.
 
 Sitcom Politics
Q: What about having candidates taking positions on morality in popular culture?
Reed: The one moment in the entire campaign when Dole really had Clinton on his back heels was when Dole gave his Hollywood speech. It was the only time when Dole ever set the agenda.
Stephanopoulos: It was an effective political speech. It was sexy enough to get on the front page of The New York Times, and it sent a message to base voters.
 
 Q: What did you think of Al Gore praising Ellen DeGeneres for coming out on her TV series?
Stephanopoulos: First of all, maybe we can call a moratorium on politicians identifying with characters in sitcoms? There's a difference between a tactical mistake and a legitimate issue. On the issues, I think the President was absolutely right to go to the Human Rights Campaign Fund dinner, to speak out for legislation banning discrimination against homosexuality in the workplace. That is very different from giving a speech in Hollywood praising a sitcom character in a week when the actress is in a fight with her network over how much sex they can show on television. I just think that's dumb politics. It's not a moral issue, it's just stupid.
 
There They Go Again
Stephanopoulos: Politics is such a dirty word that anything that smacks of partisanship is ipso facto questionable. I mean, look at the con-ventions in 1996. Neither wanted to have an avowedly partisan elected politician in prime time. We had Chris Reeve, they had Colin Powell....The least effective speeches at the Democratic convention were the most partisan.
Reed: Same thing at the Republican convention.
Stephanopoulos: What that means is we have essentially dishonest campaigns. Because both sides speak in the same generalities. And it causes greater problems when you actually have to go govern, because you need a partisan campaign to get people on record for what they want.
Reed: The American people are tired of what they perceive as a pointless game of one-upmanship. What I advise the candidates I work for is that rather than making it the gist of your message to condemn and denounce someone else, find something you think is praiseworthy, find some-thing you think is admirable and noble -- elevate that.
 
 Q: Do you tell your clients no negative ads?
Reed: I don't say no contrast ads. But what I do say is that you should generally use them only to respond to attacks against yourself. I think in today's environment the person who goes negative first usually loses.
Stephanopoulos: The person who's perceived as going negative first.
Reed: Yeah. And if you are going to point out differences between your record and your opponent you should probably do it on the issues.
Stephanopoulos: I think every-body knows talking about your opponents in harsh personal terms doesn't work. But maybe you shouldn't abolish negative ads if you're going to define negative ads as those that compare each side's record. And maybe one cheer for partisanship because the biggest gains government has made, politics has made, has been with close victories in partisan fights -- Medicare, the beginning of Social Security. I suppose partisan Republicans would argue the Reagan tax bill of 1981.
Reed: Right.
Stephanopoulos: We could have a debate about that. But generally, that's the only time you get change.
 
 We All Make Mistakes
Q: So much of the way politics runs now was influenced by you two in one way or another. Is there anything you regret?
Stephanopoulos: I regret working on the investigation in 1990 of the October Surprise. Because it was trying to take away by investigation what you didn't win by ballot box. If I had known then how it would have been carried forward, I like to think I wouldn't have done it. But I probably would have.
Reed: While I was at the Christian Coalition, early on, sometimes there was a harshness in tone about the way we said things that I later regretted....There were things we put in fund-raising letters about the radical left and feminists, stuff like that. ...It was an important and painful kind of learning experience. One minute you're a college Republican, and the next minute what you say and do really matters. The decibel is turned up really loud, and you're in Shea Stadium.
Stephanopoulos: I know the exact phe-nomenon you're talking about. If you're lucky enough to get a job like this when you're relatively young, you think you'd be indulged, or excused because of your youth. All of a sudden I was coming before a Congressional committee. I mean, you just can't imagine that someone could think you're a criminal, for something you might have done at work. Even if you made a mistake -- jeez, you were just talking to your friends. It's an odd moment: growing up, but growing up in public.
Reed: I think one of the things that really helped me when I was at the Christian Co-alition was I read some biographies of Martin Luther King. King was 26 years old when he led the Montgomery boycott -- I hadn't realized he was that young. I began to study the way he became the leader that he was, without ever holding an elective office. He was able to do it because he was thinking more eternally about what he was trying to accomplish. For somebody who trained in the Southern Republican political operative school -- for which Lee Atwater set the tone -- that was a very different way of thinking. The way I had been taught was whatever you do, you do to win this election today, and we let everything else sort itself out later. My thinking totally changed
to let's be sure that every word we speak, every meditation of our hearts is something we will be able to stand before a judgment seat and not be ashamed of.
Stephanopoulos: But can that be sustained when you go back to running races?
Reed: No one who hires me wants to do so at the loss of their integrity or mine, or they hired the wrong person.
Stephanopoulos: Think about Kennedy in 1960. Throughout the first few years of his Presidency -- you read about how Sorensen and O'Donnell, people who I revere, would say let's not do the civil rights bill now, we want to get our economic plan through. I like to think if I'd been working for John Kennedy, I'd have been saying, No! Let's do civil rights. But I'm not sure that's true.
Reed: I don't know if 30 years from now some historian will look back on a moment when I could have made a difference and find me wanting. But I do think if we can think beyond the election about what we can defend as a matter of our own conscience, it would make a big difference in the kind of politics we have. Maybe I'm just naive.
Stephanopoulos: I don't know about naive. I just know that in the middle of a race, there's an illusion of necessity. And of course, what you say is: I'm not compromising my principles, I'm just working for a higher principle at this particular minute.

 BODY:
One Christmas day seven years ago, I'd gone over to the Henry Horner Homes in Chicago to visit with Lafeyette and Pharoah, the subjects of my book "There Are No Children Here." I had brought presents for the boys, as well as a gift for their friend Rickey, who lived on the other side of the housing complex, an area controlled by a rival gang. Lafeyette and Pharoah insisted on walking over with me. It was eerily quiet, since most everyone was inside, and so, bundled from the cold, we strolled toward the other end in silence. As we neared Damen Avenue, a kind of demilitarized zone, a uniformed police officer, a white woman, approached us. She looked first at the two boys, neither of whom reached my shoulder, and then directly at me. "Are you O.K.?" she asked.
About a year later, I was with Pharoah on the city's North Side, shopping for high-tops. We were walking down the busy street, my hand on Pharoah's shoulder, when a middle-aged black man approached. He looked at me, and then at Pharoah. "Son," he asked, "are you O.K.?" 
 Both this white police officer and middle-aged black man seemed certain of what they witnessed. The white woman saw a white man possibly in trouble; the black man saw a black boy possibly in trouble. It's all about perspective --which has everything to do with our personal and collective experiences, which are consistently informed by race. From those experiences, from our histories, we build myths, legends that both guide us and constrain us, legends that include both fact and fiction. This is not to say the truth doesn't matter. It does, in a big way. It's just that getting there may not be easy, in part because everyone is so quick to choose sides, to refute the other's myths and to pass on their own.
We'd do well to keep this in mind as we enter the yearlong dialogue on race convened by President Clinton. Yes, conversation is critical, but not without self-reflection, both individually and communally. While myths help us make sense of the incomprehensible, they can also confine us, confuse us and leave us prey to historical laziness. Moreover, truth is not always easily discernible -- and even when it is, the prism, depending on which side of the river you reside on, may create a wholly different illusion. Many whites were quick to believe Susan Smith, the South Carolina mother who claimed that a black man had killed her children. And with the reawakening of the Tawana Brawley case, we learn that, although a grand jury has determined otherwise, many blacks still believe she was brutally raped by a group of white men. We -- blacks and whites -- need to examine and question our own perspectives. Only then can we grasp each other's myths and grapple with the truths.
In 1992, I came across the story of a 16-year-old black boy, Eric McGinnis, whose body had been found a year earlier floating in the St. Joseph River in southwestern Michigan. The river flows between Benton Harbor and St. Joseph, two small towns whose only connections are two bridges and a powerful undertow of contrasts.
St. Joseph is a town of 9,000, and, with its quaint downtown and brick-paved streets, resembles a New England tourist haunt. But for those in Benton Harbor, St. Joseph's most defining characteristic is its racial makeup: it is 95 percent white. Benton Harbor, a town of 12,000 on the other side of the river, is 92 percent black and dirt poor. For years, the municipality so hurt for money that it could not afford to raze abandoned buildings.
Eric, a high-school sophomore whose passion was dancing, was last seen at the Club, a teen-age nightspot in St. Joseph, where weeks earlier he had met and started dating a white girl. The night Eric disappeared, a white man said he caught the boy trying to break into his car and chased him -- away from the river, past an off-duty white deputy sheriff. That was the last known moment he was seen alive, and it was then that the myths began.
I became obsessed with Eric's death, and so for five years moved in and out of these two communities, searching for answers to both Eric's disappearance and to matters of race. People would often ask which side of the river I was staying on, wanting to gauge my allegiance. And they would often ask about the secrets of those across the way or, looking for affirmation, repeat myths passed on from one generation to the next.
Once, during an unusually bitter effort by white school-board members to fire Benton Harbor's black superintendent, one black woman asked me: "How do you know how to do this? Do you take lessons? How do you all stick together the way you do?" Of course, we don't. Neither community is as unified or monolithic as the other believes. Indeed, contrary to the impression of those in St. Joseph, the black community itself was deeply divided in its support for the superintendent, who was eventually fired.
On occasion, whites in St. Joseph would regale me with tales of families migrating to Benton Harbor from nearby states for the high welfare benefits. It is, they would tell me, the reason for the town's economic decline. While some single mothers indeed moved to Benton Harbor and other Michigan cities in the early 80's to receive public assistance, the truth is that in the 30's and 40's, factories recruited blacks from the South, and when those factories shut down, unemployment, particularly among blacks, skyrocketed.
But the question most often asked was: "Why us? Why write about St. Joseph and Benton Harbor?" I would tell them that while the contrasts between the towns seem unusually stark, they are, I believe, typical of how most of us live: physically and spiritually isolated from one another.
It's not that I didn't find individuals who crossed the river to spend time with their neighbors. One St. Joseph woman, Amy Johnson, devotes her waking hours to a Benton Harbor community center. And Eric McGinnis himself was among a handful of black teen-agers who spent weekend nights at the Club in St. Joseph. Nor is it that I didn't find racial animosity. One St. Joseph resident informed me that Eric got what he deserved: "That nigger came on the wrong side of the bridge," he said. And Benton Harbor's former schools superintendent, Sherwin Allen, made no effort to hide his contempt for the white power structure.
What I found in the main, though, were people who would like to do right but don't know where to begin. As was said of the South's politicians during Jim Crow, race diminishes us. It incites us to act as we wouldn't in other arenas: clumsily, cowardly and sometimes cruelly. We circle the wagons, watching out for our own.
That's what happened in the response to Eric's death. Most everyone in St. Joseph came to believe that Eric, knowing the police were looking for him, tried to swim the river to get home and drowned. Most everyone in Benton Harbor, with equal certitude, believes that Eric was killed -- most likely by whites, most likely because he dated a white girl. I was struck by the disparity in perspective, the competing realities, but I was equally taken aback by the distance between the two towns -- which, of course, accounts for the myths. Jim Reeves, the police lieutenant who headed the investigation into Eric's death, once confided that this teen-ager he'd never met had more impact on him than any other black person.
I'm often asked by whites, with some wonderment, how it is that I'm able to spend so much time in black communities without feeling misunderstood or unwelcomed or threatened. I find it much easier to talk with blacks about race than with fellow whites. While blacks often brave slights silently for fear that if they complain they won't be believed, when asked, they welcome the chance to relate their experiences. Among whites, there's a reluctance -- or a lack of opportunity -- to engage. Race for them poses no urgency; it does not impose on their daily routines. I once asked Ben Butzbaugh, a St. Joseph commissioner, how he felt the two towns got along. "I think we're pretty fair in this community," he said. "I don't know that I can say I know of any out-and-out racial-type things that occur. I just think people like their own better than others. I think that's pretty universal. Don't you?. . .We're not a bunch of racists. We're not anything America isn't." Butzbaugh proudly pointed to his friendship with Renee Williams, Benton Harbor's new school superintendent. "Renee was in our home three, four, five days a week," he noted. "Nice gal. Put herself through school. We'd talk all the time." Williams used to clean for Butzbaugh's family.
As I learned during the years in and out of these towns, the room for day-to-day dialogue doesn't present itself. We become buried in our myths, certain of our truths -- and refuse to acknowledge what the historian Allan Nevins calls "the grains of stony reality" embedded in most legends. A quarter-century ago, race was part of everyday public discourse; today it haunts us quietly, though on occasion -- the Rodney King beating or the Simpson trial or Eric McGinnis's death -- it erupts with jarring urgency. At these moments of crisis, during these squalls, we flail about, trying to find moral ballast. By then it is usually too late. The lines are drawn. Accusations are hurled across the river like cannon fire. And the cease-fires, when they occur, are just that, cease-fires, temporary and fragile. Even the best of people have already chosen sides.

Clean Up Calverton T.W.A. Site

BYLINE: By JEROME REISMAN; Jerome Reisman is a partner in the Garden City law firm of Reisman, Peirez, Reisman & Calica. He specializes in domestic and international business law.

 BODY:
IT may be one of the most difficult economic development strategies ever implemented anywhere the United States. Riverhead Town officials are seeking to redevelop a former defense factory complex that sits astride, for all intents and purposes, the largest and most expensive aircraft morgue ever assembled in the nation -- the remains of Trans World Airlines Flight 800.
It should come as no surprise that potential developers of Calverton are reviewing potential sites within the complex under the watchful eyes of authorities tasked with protecting the debris. While the Federal Bureau of Investigation has determined that no missile or smuggled bomb brought down the flight, we are on the verge of a blizzard of civil litigation that will bring T.W.A. to the edge of a financial abyss. Every aluminum shard and charred wiring bundle will be produced as evidence by the plaintiffs seeking a verdict. The collection of evidence reconstructed in the prime Calverton hangar will be produced for every trial as the families of the 230 killed people on the flight go to court. 
 Despite brochures and plant tours, the redevelopment of Calverton from an empty defense complex to an economic engine that assists all of Long Island will not be easy. The prior town administration had been struggling over the last several years to create a cogent redevelopment strategy for the 4,000 acres that sit inside the fence and 7,000 acres that act as an environmental buffer outside the security cordon. They had real difficulty replicating Calverton, which poured millions into the region's economy and put thousands of people to work. Without a key industry to replace that role, Calverton would demand $3 million annually from the town just to maintain the complex when turned over by the Navy.
Riverhead officials have proposed movie studios in the massive hangars, confident that East End movie moguls who summer in the Hamptons would find the commute alluring. It failed to fly. Town officials then hoped for a massive theme park on the property, but Six Flags went to Connecticut and Disney is putting its East Coast money into Broadway. Now they are wooing industrial real estate in buildings that once produced fighters. Obstacles include East End (dead end?) transportation woes and high electrical costs. (Remember, Grumman flew its final products out of Calverton and enjoyed special energy rate deals with the State Power Authority.)
Today, the Town of Riverhead faces a difficult decision. To make Calverton far more attractive for investment, they should demand that the National Transportation Safety Board remove the T.W.A. wreckage to an area of lesser economic importance. Yet the leasing of 35,000 square feet of prime space by the National Transportation Safety Board has insured that there is a revenue stream of some $1 million a year that is used to maintain the complex. The Navy is the recipient of that cash and, as a result, has slowed down the process of transferring the site. Losing the wreckage means losing the dollars that insure Calverton remains physically attractive to the next generation of users. Ironically, Riverhead hasn't even seen the $1 million in lieu of taxes it used to receive when Grumman managed the site.
It would appear that Calverton's future will continue to be linked to the 747 wreckage until every last lawsuit is settled. Over time, users will find adjacent office and factory space but a comprehensive plan that integrates those massive hangars will have to wait. Nevertheless, Riverhead Town should be far more aggressive than creating a broker's tour of the facility. Artificial governmental barriers between town, county and state should be thrown down to allow for every economic development option to be considered. Innovative and complimentary uses should also be included that develop town destination centers that would aid the sagging downtown area, including a proposed air museum featuring World War II warplanes and an automobile race track.
Restarting aviation manufacturing at the complex might be the most ironic use but one of the most lucrative. Boeing is currently faced with enormous bottlenecks as it attempts to fulfill multibillion-dollar contracts worldwide for a new generation of aircraft. In their sub-contracting of key work to other companies, Long Island could easily see companies like Lockheed-Martin-Grumman set up a production line in hangars adjacent to the T.W.A. morgue where a new generation of airliners could be assembled.
In the end, perhaps the best use of the wreckage might be to serve the same purpose as the china retrieved from the Titanic. Surrounded by the workings of business and commerce, the Calverton site could serve as a constant reminder of what happens when we take technology for granted.

A New Downtown Hotel, and Plans for More in Area

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
PLANS for a new 300-room, full-service hotel in downtown Hartford are the latest example of a market that has rebounded in recent years, with new investment being used to upgrade several existing hotels in the area and hotels newly opened or on the drawing boards in at least six other central Connecticut towns.
"The region has firmed up considerably over the last several years," said David H. Kagan, chief operating officer of the Konover Investments Corporation in West Hartford, which will build the downtown hotel with Albermarle Equities Inc. of Farmington. "Occupancy rates have increased from the mid-50's to the low 70's, and the rates have come up as well. The average rate in the downtown area is about $85 a day right now, which is getting to be in the right range for an in-city, upscale hotel." 
 Based on lodging taxes paid by Hartford hotels, local officials estimate that hotel revenues were $24 million in 1997, topping the previous high of $22.4 million in 1987, even though there were 900 fewer hotel rooms than 10 years earlier.
Scott K. Dresser, vice president of the Greater Hartford Convention and Visitors Bureau, said four of the larger hotels in the region had changed hands recently: the Sheraton Hartford, which underwent a $3.5 million renovation last year; the Radisson Hotel Cromwell; the Holiday Inn in Hartford, which is being upgraded to a Crown Plaza, and the Holiday Inn at Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, which is going to be turned into a Doubletree with a $2.5 million investment.
"There's serious money being invested in these hotels by the new owners," Mr. Dresser said. "The Hartford area hotel industry is booming, and it has attracted a lot of national and local attention."
Mr. Dresser said that he knew one developer who owned an apartment complex in Hartford that he planned to convert to a 220-unit hotel, and that another developer would soon announce plans for an all-suites hotel near the Connecticut River.
"Six, seven years ago that kind of consideration would have been unthinkable in this market," Mr. Dresser said. "There's been just a tremendous turnaround."
"More importantly, there's a sense that more rooms will breed more demand," said Philip Schonberger, who owns Albermarle Equities. "Hartford as a market has never had a fully mature convention and trade show market. The more rooms you have, the more events of that type you could accommodate."
Konover Investments and Albermarle Equities are also the leaders of a development group that last month purchased a 15-acre site north of downtown Hartford where they plan a 100,000-square-foot exposition center, with 1,500 parking spaces. In addition, the Connecticut Convention Center Authority, a quasi-public group, is seeking funding for a study of the feasibility of a 200,000-square-foot convention center in the downtown area. The Civic Center has about 67,000 square feet of exposition space.
THE Konover-Albermarle hotel would go on a site that serves as a farmers' market currently, across Main Street from the Old State House.
"Even right now, there is a demand for a business-class, moderate-to-upscale hotel, somewhere between 800 and 1,000 rooms, and if some of these other developments occur that's only going to expand," said Mr. Kagan of Konover. With a convention center and exposition hall added to the market, he said, "I think 1,500 to 2,500 additional hotel rooms would not be unreasonable."
H. Scott Phelps, president of the Convention and Visitors Bureau, said statistics showed the entire region was undergoing a hotel boom, with occupancy rates in 1996-97 the second highest of any metropolitan area in the Northeast and Midwest -- an average of 68.9 percent in the Hartford region, based on lodging tax revenues, topped only by Pittsburgh with 69.1, and well ahead of the 48 percent low reported in Indianapolis.
"We hit bottom in the early 1990's, but those numbers have turned around with double-digit increases in occupancy and revenues for four years in a row," Mr. Phelps said. "A lot of national developers are beginning to look at the possibilities here." In fact, he said, his office has been working with one Washington, D.C.-based hotel consultant who has been contacted by three developers in as many months who are interested in the Hartford area.
It's not just the downtown, either, Mr. Phelps said. Hotels have just opened, are under construction or are approved in Windsor Locks, Vernon, Manchester, Farmington, Rocky Hill and Glastonbury.
A 52-room Holiday Inn Express just opened off Exit 64 on Interstate 84 in Vernon, bringing the number of hotels in that suburban town to four.
"Some people are talking about some other projects, too," said George H. Russell, the Vernon town planner. "Given some of the occupancy rates we're hearing about, there's a market for more, and there is land available here.
"Vernon happens to be very convenient," Mr. Russell continued. "All the hotels are right off the exits of the highway, and therefore are very accessible to the traveling public. At all four of the hotels, you don't have to drive more than a couple of hundred yards after you get off the highway."
The Promus Corporation recently won approval for a 121-unit Homewood Suites hotel near Route 4 in Farmington. Jeffrey Ollendorf, the Farmington town planner, said he expected another application for about the same number of units from another company this month. "We had a lot of phone calls just prior to the recession, in the late 1980's and even into 1990," Mr. Ollendorf said. "At that time there was a lot of interest in the fact that some of the Hartford hotels had closed and companies wanted to pick up the slack in the suburbs. But then the entire economy went into a slump and most of the plans were dropped. About a year ago, the interest started to pick up again as the economy started to rebound.
"I've heard about some of the other projects coming in around the region, though, and you start to wonder how many units we can absorb," Mr. Ollendorf added. "I've had inquiries from other developers who are interested in coming in even after I've told them what's on the books -- it's a little perplexing to me as to how much we can handle."
MOST towns seem to think that the region can absorb the space relatively easily, however. Manchester approved a 90-room Marriott Courtyard in August, and construction began in late fall. Then on Dec. 15 the town approved a 96-room Residence Inn in the same area, off Slater Street and Buckland Hills Drive.
"Hartford has not been adding a lot of rooms yet, and they lost some space in the last real estate crash, so putting 190 rooms in Manchester is not going to be too much," said Mark Pellegrini, Manchester's director of planning and economic development.
Suzanne M. Hopgood, president of the Hartford-based Hopgood Group, which provides hotel investment advice to institutional investors and developers, said there had been a number of quiet changes taking place in the Hartford area hotel market.
The existing hotels are healthier because they have been refinanced or sold. The Hartford Sheraton, which cost almost $125,000 a unit to build, sold for $25,000 a room in the early 1990's. Others have been sold or recapitalized at from $100,000 or more a unit to $50,000 or less, she said, and new operators have brought costs under control.
"You have much more efficient hotel operations, and everyone has recapitalized at numbers that make it possible to make a profit," Ms. Hopgood said. "People who bought a hotel in Hartford in the last three or four years are in a very good position. You can't touch anything for $25,000 a room today."
But the most significant change has been the growth in demand, she said. The business travel that made up most of the business in the region almost disappeared in the late 1980's as companies nationwide began paring their travel budgets. By the end of 1992, occupancy rates averaged just 52 percent, she said.
Over the last few years, however, companies in Hartford such as United Technologies, Aetna, US Healthcare and Travelers have been expanding, and many of them are bringing people from far-flung divisions to Hartford for training or meetings, which has bolstered local hotel stays. By the end of last year, many hotels were reporting occupancy rates in excess of 70 percent. Because so many of a hotel's costs are fixed, that translates to rapidly growing profits.
"The last three years, the Hartford region has seen 11 percent a year growth in hotel revenue, which increases the bottom line by 30 percent," Ms. Hopgood said. "Every room that comes in now, 70 or 80 percent of those revenues are pure profit."
Mr. Phelps said he hoped a 1990 study that showed there is a market for a convention center in Hartford could be dusted off and re-examined. His organization has booked 500 conventions for the next few years; they are expected to bring 100,000 people and $120 million to Hartford, but with a large convention center the city could attract even more.
"We do get some groups up to the 2,000 range, but the majority of them are smaller," Mr. Phelps said. Many other states have made a major commitment to attracting that travel: since 1990, 82 convention centers have been built around the United States, and 171 others have been expanded. Today, only Montana, Idaho and Wyoming have less dedicated convention space than Connecticut, he said.
"It's a real disadvantage to our staff as they're trying to book conventions in Hartford that we don't have that main convention hall with a lot of meeting space," Mr. Phelps said.

At 10 or at 90, an Actress Is Every-Brahmin

BYLINE: By Vincent Canby 

 BODY:
MABEL TIDINGS BIGELOW is a memorable fictional character you might like to meet in the person of the enchanting Cherry Jones, who plays her to the core of Mabel's singular being in the Lincoln Center Theater production of "Pride's Crossing," Tina Howe's bittersweet feminist comedy currently at the Mitzi E. Newhouse.
Mabel, now 90, was briefly famous in the late 1920's for having been the first woman to swim the English Channel from England to France, unlike the real-life Gertrude Ederle, who earlier made the crossing in the opposite direction. Though Mabel has a daughter, a granddaughter and a great-granddaughter, she accurately describes herself as the last of her line: Boston Brahmins whose blood has become "too blue, too thin . . . spent." 
 Unless you manage to see these Brahmins at Mabel's exuberantly slapdash Fourth of July croquet party, which concludes "Pride's Crossing," they would look like old people of a certain upper class anywhere else. Their money has almost run out. They get by on dwindling dividend checks. Among strangers they can be fearful, overbearing and up-tight. Some, like Mabel, live in what had been the chauffeurs' cottages on family estates they no longer own.
They feel increasingly isolated in an economic, social and intellectual world that has long since abandoned Boston as its center. Yet they are the direct if distant descendants of the men and women whose accomplishments prompted Oliver Wendell Holmes to call Boston "the Hub of the Universe." What a crew these 19th-century New Englanders were: radically independent divines, philosophers, poets, novelists, abolitionists, historians, naturalists, transcendentalists. And don't forget the adventuring capitalists who helped foot the bills.
Mabel and her surviving friends hang on to their manners, at least in public. They tend their memories with the care they might have lavished on delphiniums when still supple enough to bend over. No one more so than Mabel, who could be a granddaughter of one of the forbidding subsidiary figures in the William Dean Howells novel "The Rise of Silas Lapham."
In the course of the seven days that elapse in "Pride's Crossing," Mabel deals with a past that is as vivid to her as -- and far more important than -- her present circumstances. Her favorite granddaughter, Julia, has arrived for one of her infrequent visits, accompanied by Mabel's 10-year-old great-granddaughter, Minty. To mark the occasion, Mabel insists on having a croquet party because, among other things, Minty is being brought up in Paris where, as is well known, absolutely nobody plays croquet.
The preparations for the festivities prompt Mabel's recollections of earlier, not always happier times and a decision she made as a young woman that has forever haunted her life. Mabel's grandfather might have lived in the Boston of "The Rise of Silas Lapham," but she herself is a kind of female equivalent to the rueful male figures in the Boston fiction of J. P. Marquand. When her test came, she failed it.
Ms. Howe describes "Pride's Crossing" as a tribute to an ancient aunt who never left home, never married and never swam a stroke. In transforming her aunt into a woman who did all of these things, she says she is following a theater tradition that allows us to go beyond fact to create fiction that is no less true for being what might have been. What she is writing about is: "The passion of old ladies. When men age, they just get old, but when women age, they become extremely powerful." That's the sort of generalization that playwrights writing about their works are allowed.
At its best, "Pride's Crossing" offers a buoyant portrait of a woman who, having triumphed in one extraordinary way, never forgave herself for not having gone the one step further that might have spelled true liberation. Instead, she allowed her actions to be dictated by a society that had already atrophied.
As staged with brisk efficiency by Jack O'Brien in the limited space of the Newhouse Theater, "Pride's Crossing" suggests the sweep of a novel, moving easily back and forth through the years as Ms. Jones alternates between Mabel at 90 and her younger selves aged 10, 15, 20, 21, 53 and 60, though not in that neat chronological order. In the Boston society in which Mabel was bred, strong women allowed themselves to be dominated by weak men. Money was the cushion of this existence, as we see in Mabel's memories.
She is the youngest of the three Tidings children and the only daughter. Her oldest brother, Phineas, the child her sports-loving father dotes on, wins an Olympic medal in diving. Frazier, the middle child, appears to be on his way to becoming the kind of homosexual who despises himself.
As a little girl, Mabel escapes the suppressed rage of the arid household by spending her time with the Irish kitchen help, later by swimming. Yet she is susceptible to the lures of society. The summer before she goes to England to swim the Channel, she falls in love with the rich young Porter
Bigelow, who is very handsome and already drinks too much. Initially, she was attracted by the extraordinary pinkness of his bare feet in the green grass.
It's in England that she meets David Bloom, a young Englishman who swam the Channel a year earlier and becomes her trainer. This suddenly is true love as well as a way to break away from the family. That she doesn't seize the opportunity is partly because of her commitment to Porter, but mostly because David is Jewish. Her Boston backbone turns out to be brittle. What follows is a story of drunks, suicides, multiple marriages and estranged children, defeats that ultimately lead to a kind of power she didn't know she possessed. .
Ms. Jones, a Tony Award winner for her performance in "The Heiress," is a delight as the feisty Mabel who, at 90, sounds a bit like Katharine Hepburn and, at any age, is a character of startling, unexpected presence.
With only a minimum of costume changes (some in full view of the audience) and without makeup, she slips from one age to the next with what might be called astonishingly theatrical simplicity. In any succession of scenes she may go from being a deaf old lady with a walker to a svelte Back Bay matron of 35, the old lady again and then a pulled-together, none-too-grieving widow of 60. When required, she even has the figure of a distance swimmer.
TWO WOMEN, ONE LITTLE girl and three men play the 19 supporting roles as effectively as possible, though some of the parts are so small that they hardly register beyond being generic types. Angie Phillips is fine as Vita Bright, the 90-year-old Mabel's live-in companion, but quite lost as Phineas, Mabel's brother who, not mysteriously, just looks like a pretty young woman dressed in men's clothes that don't fit.
This is one of the failed quirks of "Pride's Crossing," whose text directs that Phineas be played by an actress and that a man play Mary O'Neill, the Irish cook who says things like "You're going to be the death of me" to any children who may be underfoot. As the cross-dressed Mary, Dylan Baker carries on as if he were a Hasty Pudding joke, though he is wonderfully wry and patient as Mabel's lifelong Brahmin suitor, the club-footed Chandler Coffin.
There are other lapses. Would Mabel's otherwise bright great-granddaughter not know what the English Channel is? After all, she's 10 and lives in Paris.
Ralph Funicello's sets and Kenneth Posner's lighting help make possible the swift pacing, the abrupt swoops in time and the underlying sense of elegy. Yet as written, directed and acted, "Pride's Crossing" is always Mabel's play. You can believe she is a Brahmin, whether she is describing the curious, time-out-of-time peace experienced by the long-distance swimmer or as the old woman who, suddenly becoming aware of Vita dressed as Paul Revere, crows with pleasure, "I love your hat!" She's a woman of substance and humor as well as class.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Plainsboro, N.J.;
The Woes and Benefits of Growth

BYLINE: By JERRY CHESLOW 

 BODY:
WITH sprawling office parks and tightly packed garden apartment complexes, Plainsboro, N. J. is trying to catch its breath after nearly 30 years of rampant development. Since 1970, the 11.8-square-mile Middlesex County township has grown tenfold, from 1,600 people to 16,000.
While much of the township retains its agrarian feel, with 60 percent open land, its main roads are snarled with traffic during rush hours and its schools, although excellent, are becoming crowded. 
 On the plus side, the township is one of the few in New Jersey with an AA-1 bond rating. Its tax rate is $2.40 per $100 of assessed valuation, which is fourth lowest of the 25 municipalities in Middlesex County. Sixty percent of its taxes are paid by corporations, the largest of which are Merrill Lynch and Bristol Myers-Squibb, which provide half of the township's 8,000 jobs and help to keep the unemployment rate down to a minuscule 3.5 percent.
"We need to achieve a housing balance," explained Mayor Peter A. Cantu. "In 1971, when the township was nearly all farmland, 5,000 apartments were approved. And, even today, those apartments make up the bulk of our 8,500 housing units. Now, we are approving mainly single-family homes on lots of between one and six acres."
Mayor Cantu said the township was also allowing cluster development, under which developers are allowed to build homes closer together than the zoning law would ordinarily allow. In return for variances, they must donate land to the township for permanent open space. By the time Plainsboro is completely built out, the Mayor expects it to have an additional 1,500 housing units and a total population of 22,000.
Because of its high proportion of apartments, Plainsboro has a high population turnover, the Mayor said. To build a sense of community, the township frequently sends out fliers listing opportunities for volunteering. For the past 12 years, it has also sponsored Founders Day celebrations on the first Sunday in May. Last year's celebration, complete with a community picnic on the town hall lawn and a parade, was attended by 4,000 to 6,000 people.
Current owner-occupied housing in the township ranges from about $50,000 for some small, one-bedroom condominiums to about $500,000 for some five- or six-bedroom homes on lots of more than one acre, said Rich J. Abrams, an agent with Century 21 Carnegie Realty. There are 30 single-family homes on the market, ranging from $158,000 for a three-bedroom ranch that Mr. Abrams said "needs updating" on Grovers Mill Road in the southern section, to $499,000 for a five-bedroom newer colonial on Stults Drive, also in the southern section.
Most of the township's 1,000 condominium apartments are located in three complexes off Plainsboro Road-Ravenscrest, Tamarron and Aspen. Mr. Abrams said they range in price from about $50,000 for some small one-bedroom units to $79,000 for some two-bedroom, two-bath units.
Two-story town-house condominiums are also plentiful in developments off Plainsboro Road, which bisects the township from east to west, and off U.S. Route 1, a north-south highway on the western edge of town. The largest of the town-house areas is Princeton Landing, off Route 1, which has two distinct communities. One has small, 1,000-square-foot, three-bedroom units that sell for between $95,000 and $110,000. The other has wider streets and larger, more luxurious units with two-car garages, and prices ranging from $160,000 for some two-bedroom town houses to $400,000 for some four-bedroom town houses.
Rental apartments range from about $725 for some one-bedroom units to $1,200 for some three-bedroom town houses. The largest rental complexes are in an area called Princeton Meadows off Plainsboro Road. Mr. Abrams said there was a shortage of rental apartments because Raytheon Corporation recently built a corporate facility in neighboring West Windsor.
"When the Raytheon building is fully staffed, it will employ 3,000 people," Mr. Abrams explained. "And, at least in the early stages, those people are renting."
AMONG the newer residents of the township are Robert and Linda Gelfand, who bought a 17-year-old, four-bedroom colonial on half an acre in January 1996. They moved from Brooklyn to shorten Mr. Gelfand's commute to his job as a systems analyst in Somerset, N.J., about 20 miles north of Plainsboro.
"When Robert brought me out here, I couldn't believe that the housing was so near open fields," Mrs. Gelfand recalled. "Afterwards, everything else we looked at seemed too congested."
Among the major attractions for Mrs. Gelfand, who is a special education teacher by profession and is currently a homemaker, was the highly rated West Windsor-Plainsboro Regional School District, which serves the two communities. It has an average class size of 20 and a total enrollment of 7,287 students in five elementary schools, one middle school and one high school. The Gelfands have a 6-year-old son and a 2-year-old daughter.
"The district encourages parental involvement," Mrs. Gelfand said. "I've already become an active member of the P.T.A. I know the teachers, the principal and the guidance counselor, unlike the New York City school system, which is a lot more impersonal."
Dr. Thomas F. Butler, the interim Superintendent of Schools, said computers are introduced in kindergarten and all classrooms in each building are either networked or in the process of being networked. By next May, Dr. Butler said, each classroom in the district will have at least one computer station for the teacher and one or two stations for pupils.
"We stress technology, with at least one computer laboratory in each school building," Dr. Butler added.
The school population is racially mixed, with 59 percent of the students white, 30 percent Asian or Pacific Islander, 8 percent black and 3 percent Hispanic.
"We have 52 languages represented in our school system," Dr. Butler said.
Last September the West Windsor-Plainsboro Regional High School was rated by New Jersey Monthly magazine as one of "62 public high schools that spend a little and get a lot." Last year's 399 graduating seniors scored average combined totals of 1,170 on the verbal and math sections of the SAT tests, about 180 points higher than the state average. The class of 1998 includes 12 National Merit Scholarship finalists.
Plainsboro was formed in 1919, incorporating approximately six square miles each from Cranbury and South Brunswick. Robert Yuell, the township historian, said that one of the area's most prominent attorneys, John Van Buren Wicoff, drafted the township's petition for incorporation after Cranbury rejected his request that $12,000 be allocated for the construction of a new school building to replace a dilapidated structure in what is now Plainsboro. Mr. Wicoff became Plainsboro's first mayor, a post he held for 30 years. His house, next to the current municipal building on Plainsboro Road, is now owned by the township. It serves as the home for the historical society, which has applied to have the structure, built in the early 1900's, included on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places. If it receives the designation, it would be the first structure in the township to be awarded that distinction.
Early histories of the township list only the Dutch as the first European settlers, and Mr. Yuell said that he had not seen any material containing the names of early settlers. However, several buildings dating to the 1740's are still in use, including a former tavern at 4 Dey Place, which is now a private residence, and a house near Carnegie Lake, which has Revolutionary War cannonballs embedded in its foundation.
"The earliest-known settlement actually dates back to 1700 B.C.," Mr. Yuell said. "In 1982, native American artifacts were turned up during excavations for a roadbed. An archeological dig was conducted, which turned up 25,000 artifacts. The most important finds were the remnants of four 15-by-20-foot structures. Although we don't know who those ancient settlers were, it does constitute a settlement."
THE township was a sleepy, nondescript farming community until 1897, when the Walker-Gordon Dairy Farm was started. It eventually included 2,400 acres, making it the largest dairy in the world. The facility was closed in 1971. Afterwards, the land was farmed or used for grazing beef cattle. The site, on the western end of town, has since been sold to a developer for housing construction.
Many of Plainsboro's present corporations are situated in the 1,200-acre Princeton Forrestal Center on the western side of town. Nearby is the Princeton Forrestal Village, an upscale factory outlet center off Route 1. The township has three shopping centers, each of which contains a supermarket and a strip of stores. The closest large mall is the Quakerbridge Mall in Lawrence Township, five miles to the south.
Plainsboro has nine public parks, the largest of which is the 80-acre Community Park off Scotts Corner Road, which has three baseball diamonds and two soccer fields. One of the most unusual recreation facilities is the Delaware and Raritan Canal Park off Mapleton Road. It is part of the old canal system built in 1831. The canal is open most of the year for boating and fishing. A bike path and picnic facilities will be added in the near future.
Also in town is the Princeton Meadows Golf and Country Club, an 18-hole, 6,100-yard golf course off Hunter's Glen Drive. Rates during weekdays for those who walk the course are $15 in winter and $30 during the regular season. Golf cart rental is an additional $14.

HEADLINE: Luxury Houses: Strong Market, Low Inventory

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
A BLUE-CHIP investment for generations, real estate in high-income areas of the North Shore is experiencing a boomlet that is helping make six-figure salaries more common for top realty agents. Their only complaint is often a lack of inventory.
In a sign that enormous wealth continues to flow into one of the country's richest suburbs, real estate agents in exclusive North Shore villages and enclaves report a resilient market and increasing sales for the most expensive houses. 
 An increasing number of buyers, they said, are knocking down high-priced older houses and replacing them with new ones.
With the economy strong, housing prices stable, mortgage-interest rates low and new Federal tax exemptions that help encourage owners of expensive houses to sell, real estate professionals said they expected that this year would surpass even 1997 and 1996, both exceptionally good.
Agents and officials say young families, newly rich and often beneficiaries of the bull market on Wall Street, snap up houses and properties that cost $1 million, $2 million and higher, sometimes after bidding wars.
The demand for houses between $500,000 and $1 million has also been vigorous, with more than a few bidding wars, they said. Another show of wealth is a trend for buyers to raze expensive houses to build newer, even more expensive houses more to their taste.
"People are buying $900,000 ranch houses and tearing them down," Mayor Leonard Wurzel of Sands Point said. "I've been here 40 years and I've never seen anything like it."
In one case, Mr. Wurzel said, a family paid $2 million for a waterfront home in the village and was preparing to tear it down make way for a larger home.
The phenomenon is sweeping the Hamptons, and housing on farms and other open spaces is leading to the loss of the area's natural beauty, civic and environmental groups say.
The changes are also reportedly occurring in the Five Towns, where major renovations and razing of houses have also increased.
"The strangest thing they are doing here is buying houses in good locations and knocking them down," said Morton M. Haves of Hewlett Harbor, a Realtor in the Five Towns since 1947. "I can't believe my eyes. You see these Dumpsters all over."
The new wealth is also affecting affluent areas in Westchester County, southern Connecticut and New Jersey, said Marc M. Goloven, a senior regional economist for the Chase Manhattan Bank.
"There are strong indications that the suburbs of New York City are experiencing a boom in high-end housing because of the dramatic gains on Wall Street," Mr. Goloven said. "When you consider that $12 billion in bonuses will be paid out by Wall Street, that puts a lot of money in a lot of hands, and part of it is going into high-end real estate."
A regional economist, Thomas Conoscenti of Smithtown, said purchases of expensive houses showed long-term confidence in the region's future and helped assure it. "It's a good sign when people are buying upscale," Mr. Conoscenti said. "It means income levels are moving up, and people have an opportunity to put their money into something less volatile than the stock market."
Mr. Conoscenti said a history of rising property values on Long Island, and particularly in areas with expensive houses, made home ownership an exceptionally sound long-term investment.
The trend has been most pronounced on the North Shore, where villages like Matinecock, Lattingtown, Kings Point, Plandome, Plandome Manor, Muttontown, Laurel Hollow, Old Westbury and Sands Point are perennially ranked among the richest in the country.
Bonnie L. Devendorf, a vice president of a real estate company, Daniel Gale Associates, and manager of its office in Locust Valley, said sales had risen impressively in villages in that area.
"I have been in the business for 25 years and I have never seen anything like this," Mrs. Devendorf said. "There is no question these are among the best years we have ever had."
Luxury builders have returned to the market, she added, buying estates and subdividing and building expensive large-lot houses.
If there was softness in the North Shore market, some brokers said, it was in extremely expensive older estates and houses that reflect older architectural tastes.
Carole Belley, owner of Lovejoy Real Estate in Manhasset, said that meant relative bargains could be found in areas like Sands Point. A classic Tudor with a pool, tennis court and guest cottage on 4.2 acres that went on the market in September 1996 for $2.45 million closed last week for less than $2 million, she said, adding, "That house went for a song."
Mrs. Belley said that the under-$1 million market in the Manhasset and Port Washington areas featured "houses that come on in the 700's and 800's that are gone in a weekend."
Such prices are far above what most buyers on Long Island pay.
The Long Island Board of Realtors and the Multiple Listing Service listed the median sale price of a house in Nassau County as $185,000 in October, up from $179,000 in October 1996. In Suffolk, according to the figures, the median price was $149,000, up from $141,500 a year earlier.
In the North Shore prices rose 6 percent, and inventory fell 15 percent, signs of what the president of the Board of Realtors, Joseph L. Canfora, said was a buyer's market.
Mr. Canfora, owner of Century 21 Selmar Realty in East Islip, said the availability of 30-year fixed mortgages at 7 percent interest rates was stimulating the sales of midrange and lower-cost housing, where sales have also been strong. "We're seeing an increase in activity," he said. "Prices are starting to edge up a bit."
Promises by the state to lower electric rates and a pledge by Gov. George E. Pataki to lower school taxes are also helping the market, Mr. Canfora added.
Low-income to moderate housing remains in short supply, said Jim Morgo, executive director of the Long Island Housing Partnership, a developer in Hauppauge. "The good news is that the banks have really in an unprecedented way responded to the needs of the first-time home buyer," Mr. Morgo said. "There are great mortgage products out there, a great deal of flexibility for these buyers."
For owners of expensive houses, the Taxpayer Relief Act that President Clinton signed in August provides an incentive that may bring more such houses on the market. Under the new law, profits on the sale of a house up to $250,000 for an individual or $500,000 for a couple are exempt from Federal tax. The law has other requirements.
Previously sellers younger than 55 were taxed on profits that were not reinvested in new homes.
The exemption applies only to principal residences.
Realtors said it was too soon to tell whether the exemptions would lead to increased listings. But the buy-and-raze trend in communities like Sands Point is also occurring in the Hamptons and the Five Towns, Realtors in those areas said.
"People want specific locations, but they don't necessarily buy for the house," the president of Cook Pony Farm Real Estate in East Hampton, Melanie A. Ross, said. "They are buying for the address, tearing the houses down and building new ones."
The young newly rich families who are buying on the North Shore are at the leading edge of the Hamptons market, agents in East Hampton and Southampton said.
Other agents said other factors were also at work. "Wall Street is certainly a big part of the very high-end stuff, but, then, I have moved a whole block of guys over from Fire Island in the last few years," said Robert M. Lohman, an associate broker at Agawam Realty in Southampton.
Mr. Lohman said the Southampton inventory was tight, adding, "Everything is selling."
An owner of the Pugatch Realty Corporation in Woodmere, Susan Pugatch, said the strong Five Towns market was fueled by "young people from Brooklyn and Queens and people moving up within the neighborhood."
Mr. Haves said commercial areas of the Five Towns were "like a new Tel Aviv," reflecting a large Jewish population.
For that area and the North Shore proximity to New York City remains important. The Long island Rail Road reports ridership increased in 1996, to 74.4 million passengers, up from 70.2 million in 1992. Ridership through November 1997 was 1.7 percent higher than a year earlier, the L.I.R.R. said.
The railroad said that high employment levels in New York City partly explained the increase, but that noncommuting riders had shown the greatest growth.

HEADLINE: White Plains Center for Culture Makes Gains

BYLINE: By ROBERTA HERSHENSON 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
THIS is a city rich in history and shopping dollars, a retail hub known as the birthplace of New York State. But even its boosters admit to a lackluster quality here, a blandness in place of charm and color, a silence where applause and laughter should enliven the night.
The city, taking a close look at itself, recently pinpointed its own lack of sparkle and allure. Art, culture and entertainment were the missing ingredients, said the Common Council, identifying the need for after-hours activity downtown. A marketing and development study conducted by an outside consultant reached the same conclusion in 1995. Several nightclubs have recently opened, raising hopes of a trend, and the possibility of a multiplex cinema to fill the movie vacuum is coming closer to reality. Debate on the optimal location of a multiplex has been going on since Macy's left its prime Mamaroneck Avenue corner 18 months ago. 
 Now, adding to the brew, the Music Conservatory of Westchester -- formerly the Westchester Conservatory of Music -- is moving ahead with a plan for a White Plains cultural center. The conservatory, currently on the the city's outskirts, would move to a downtown site shared by several other arts organizations whose focus is teaching. The Westchester Arts Council is also negotiating for prime space downtown. Although the plans of both the conservatory and the arts council are contingent on the policies of the new city administration, many are confident that a cultural flowering will take place in White Plains in the next five years.
"The concept is a necessity for downtown," said Margo Jones, executive director of the White Plains Business Development Corporation, a nonprofit corporation founded in 1995 to help revitalize the city. Ms. Jones said she is helping Laura Calzolari, executive director of the conservatory, and Janet T. Langsam, executive director of the arts council, in their efforts to broaden the cultural scope of the city. As the two leaders envision it, their organizations would anchor either end of an officially designated arts district much like those prospering in other cities across the United States.
Vince Ferrandino, planning and development consultant for Ferrandino & Associates, an Elmsford group conducting a $93,000 feasibility study for the conservatory, said there was widespread support for a one-stop, after-school cultural center for children in the city's main business district, where high-quality classes and supervised play might stimulate development in surrounding neighborhoods. "We have received strong and enthusiastic support from a lot of movers and shakers in banking, real estate and other interests peripheral to arts and culture," he said. "We have not heard a negative note."
Mr. Ferrandino, whose company conducted the 1995 marketing and development study for White Plains, said the conservatory's study, which has been financed in part by a grant of $46,000 from the National Endowment of the Arts, would be completed in April. The study will evaluate the potential impact of the proposed center on arts groups and the community, recommend the ideal mix of collaborating partners and gauge the effect of cultural activity on retail enterprise. It will also include a financial plan.
Susan Habel, Deputy Planning Commissioner for White Plains, said that while the Common Council had called for more arts and entertainment downtown, it was premature to talk about the city's role in such development. "The timing is bad," she said. "I don't know what the new administration envisions."
She said, however, that it was unlikely that the city could support one private group like the conservatory to the exclusion of other groups. She added that the performing arts programs sponsored by the public library and the school system were the city's first priorities. "We're waiting for the feasibility study," she said. "There are issues: the conservatory's needs versus all the community's needs."
Ms. Calzolari said a severe space squeeze had prompted the conservatory's plan to leave the 14,000-square-foot building on Soundview Avenue it has occupied since 1980. She said the 69-year-old school, which serves 2,500 students in outreach programs and at the Soundview Avenue site, needed at least 25,000 to 30,000 square feet to insure enough teaching and practice studios, rehearsal rooms and administrative offices. The school is considering the re-use of several existing buildings, including its first choice: a four-story, city-owned building a block from the old Macy's building on Church Street.
Many in the county's performing arts community have for decades clamored for a major new theater. Ms. Calzolari said, however, that the proposed cultural center would suit a different purpose. "Our future space needs are the driving force behind this," she said. "I need a new home."
The conservatory itself would select what Ms. Calzolari calls a consortium of partners for the center. The most likely candidates at present include a dance school and an interactive children's museum, she said. The plan also provides for ventures like a restaurant or coffee bar, a music or art supply store and a bookstore or recording studio. Potential educational and recreational uses of the center, she said, include a private day school, day-care services, a health club or a gymnastics program. Additional space may be set aside for a gallery and an arts library, a performance area, study lounges and a technology and media arts center.
Ms. Langsam said the arts council and the conservatory were jointly recommending an arts district in White Plains to dovetail with the city's urban-renewal efforts. It would encompass a rectangular area along Mamaroneck Avenue and Church Street, extending from Hamilton Avenue on one end to Maple Avenue on the other. Ms. Langsam, who served as the Deputy Commissioner of Cultural Affairs for New York City when city-owned buildings were converted to residential-and-work lofts for artists, said she envisions artists living and working in second-floor studios along Mamaroneck Avenue, while public sculptures in pocket parks would provide a respite for shoppers. "One way or another we'd also like to see a theater," Ms. Langsam added. "We think a 500-seat theater could be filled on a regular basis. Groups would kill for an opportunity to showcase their work in the hub."
Tishman Speyer Properties, the Manhattan-based company that is negotiating to buy the former Macy's building, wants to put a multiplex movie theater in the structure. A spokesman, Steven Rubenstein, said the company is also considering other art-related uses, which he declined to mention. The company hopes to close on the building by the end of March, Mr. Rubenstein said.
The arts council, which has been studying its space needs since moving downtown from Westchester Avenue last year, has been in negotiation with several organizations, including Tishman Speyer and Chase Manhattan Bank, to find exhibition or performance space for its affiliates here.
"Tishman Speyer and Chase and the arts council have been in discussions for nine months to see how theater and exhibition space can be made a part of the total block project on Mamaroneck Avenue," Ms. Langsam said.
Arts leaders and others said that present negotiations were at a delicate stage for renewal in this city, which in 1776 was the site of the provincial congress that adopted the resolution establishing the State of New York.
"White Plains in five years will be a very different looking place," Ms. Calzolari said. "These things have to be worked out soon, because later the space will be gone."

Golf Course-Housing Proposal Lands in the Rough

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
HOUSING built in conjunction with an exclusive golf course is fairly common in the South and Southwest. And a few have been built or are under construction in the Northeast, including two in Connecticut -- River Highlands in Cromwell and Silvermine Woods in Norwalk -- and Purchase Estates in Purchase in Westchester County, where an 18-hole golf course and a dozen of a projected 73 houses have been completed.
Now National Fairways, a golf-course developer based in Greenwich, has dipped a toe in Easton waters and found them a bit chilly. 
 The company's proposal to pay $14.1 million for 692 acres in Easton and 45 abutting acres in Weston on which to build a hundred $1-million-plus homes on 3-acre lots and an 18-hole championship golf course for the home buyers is meeting serious resistance because the land is part of the Bridgeport Hydraulic Company watershed.
The project, called Trout Brook Valley, is planned on land designated Class 3 by the Water Supply Division of the state's Department of Public Health -- meaning that it is beyond the drainage area of the reservoirs, and classed as surplus acreage. Nevertheless, the nonprofit Connecticut Fund for the Environment in New Haven, Easton's Conservation Commission, the Town of Weston and most of the more than 250 people who attended a public hearing on the matter on Dec. 22 want the property preserved as open space.
"The development would shoot a hole into the center of 10 square miles of protected land, fragmenting Bridgeport Hydraulic's Class 1 and 2 land, and land protected by the Aspetuck Land Trust, Nature Conservancy, and Redding Land Trust," said Gail Bromer, a member of the Easton Conservation Commission and chairwoman of the town's Open Space Committee.
Class 1 and 2 lands cannot be sold because they include reservoirs or surround reservoirs and drain into them. Class 3 land is beyond the drainage area, considered surplus and off-watershed.
"When we bought these lands from 1910 to 1930," said Daniel Neaton, vice president of real estate for the water company, "we were not sure how much Greater Bridgeport would grow. We never had a specific use for Trout Brook Valley. We don't think it would even be a good water storage area, although there was talk about it at one time."
The company, he said, needs the proceeds from prior, current and future sales of surplus land to help finance a $100 million, federally mandated system of five filtration plants that it has built in its Fairfield and Litchfield County service areas.
And National Fairways says there is a big demand for its product. "Any big name private golf course has a waiting list of five to 10 years," said Marc Bergschneider, its president. "It's impossible to get into a good club at any price."
He said that Easton and Weston had the kind of profile he seeks out. "They are rich towns where nothing is being built under $700,000," Mr. Bergschneider added.
GOLF memberships will cost $100,000, he said, and 20 deposits on preconstruction memberships of $80,000 -- refundable if the course is not built -- have already been received. Twenty town residents, Mr. Bergschneider said, "will be permitted to play on Mondays, when we are closed, at $250 a day."
An alternative for the towns would be to purchase the land themselves. "If they are able to buy we're out," said Mr. Bergschneider, "but the likelihood is close to zero."
State statutes give towns, land trusts and the state's Department of Environmental Protection the right of first refusal to buy water-company-owned property for sale. But William J. Kupinse, Easton's First Selectman, acknowledged that there was no fund set aside for this. "There would have to be a request for an appropriation to be voted on by Town Meeting," he said.
Weston, according to George Guidera, its First Selectman, has been negotiating to buy its portion, but is unable to agree on a price. "This is a significant property," said Mr. Guidera. "If Easton doesn't buy, that has nothing to do with our purchase. If Easton is looking for a contribution they should come to us with a proposal."
Mr. Kupinse and Ms. Bromer noted that at the December public hearing Paul Newman, the actor and philanthropist whose home is in Westport, offered to start a fund for purchasing the property with a pledge of $500,000, to be paid in $100,000 installments over five years.
Darice O'Mara, the actor's personal assistant, said from Mr. Newman's New York office that he had expressed concern for the low level of open space in Connecticut, the protection of drinking and the lack of water studies to determine need far into the future.
National Fairways, a developer of more than a dozen golf courses along the Eastern Seaboard, will appear before the Easton Planning and Zoning Commission tomorrow to support its application for a special-use permit for the golf course. While the housing complies with current two-acre zoning, a hearing on the subdivision is scheduled for Jan. 26.
Under scrutiny are a proposed road width of 24 feet instead of the state standard of 30 feet, and the number of homes on a dead end street, both considered impediments to adequate fire and police protection.
In addition, a complex series of applications and approvals from the two towns' Conservation and Inland Wetlands Commissions, the state Departments of Health, Environmental Protection and Public Utility Control and the Army Corps of Engineers must be processed before the land can change hands and the project move forward. Without the utility-control agency's decision, which is not expected until March 4, no other decisions are enforceable.
"When any utility sells land we look at whether it is required for service," said Beryl Lyons, spokeswoman for the agency. "Common sense tells us that it may not be needed now, but may be needed tomorrow. As an agency concerned with the economics of public utilities, we must look at two independent appraisals submitted by the utility as to the fair market value."
If the sale is approved, she said, her agency would determine the split of future profits between shareholders and rate payers. "In the case of recreational use, including golf courses, the greater portion goes to the shareholders," she said.
Bridgeport Hydraulic, the largest privately owned water company in the state, filed its application to sell its 667.93 acres last Oct. 6. The remainder of the land is owned by the utility's parent, Aquarion of Bridgeport, which was strongly criticized by the Connecticut Fund for the Environment for a perceived conflict of interests.
Aquarion's contract to sell its land, which is exempt from Department of Utility Control review because it is owned by a holding company, not a utility, had options that would allow the holding company to become a part owner of the golf course by taking all of its payment in shares. "It decided to take cash rather than equity," said Larry Bingaman, vice president of corporate relations for Bridgeport Hydraulic. The contract also calls for five memberships in the golf club for top officials of Aquarion.
An additional 160-acre tract of Class 3 watershed land owned by the United Water Company in New Milford has been targeted by the Meadowbrook Golf Company of Chicago for development as a public golf course. "It's in the conceptual stage," said New Milford's Mayor, Arthur J. Peitler. No public hearings have been held to date.
"The alternative," said the Mayor, "could be 85 houses. There would be a clubhouse, possibly a pool and minimal housing, keeping demand for town services low. There would be benefits in cash flow that we would split with the water company in a partnership. People here would get some breaks on greens fees, but membership fees would not be high."
According to Mr. Bergschneider, Trout Brook Valley would provide Easton with $1.5 million a year in homeowners' real estate taxes of $15,000 to $20,000 a year, plus the golf club's taxes.
"We have not gone into a depth analysis of town services required," said First Selectman Kupinse. "It is likely to be tax positive, but who knows what the market for high-priced homes and $100,000 golf memberships will be in two years, when they plan to start construction?"

HEADLINE: Another Familiar Name Quits Downtown Pittsburgh

BYLINE: By CHRISS SWANEY 

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH

 BODY:
REFRIGERATORS, power generators and railroad air brakes were all made here by Westinghouse. But by late 1998, the corporate headquarters that once housed more than 1,000 employees will be home to only 60 as Westinghouse, which acquired CBS Corporation two years ago, completes its transition into a pure media company.
For years, the 23-story, black aluminum and glass structure known as known as the "black box" by employees at 11 Stanwix Street was one of the few holdout headquarters amid the exodus of other Fortune 500 corporations. At one time, Pittsburgh was home to 14 Fortune 500 corporations, but now only a handful still call the old industrial city home. Downtown Pittsburgh's streets now are eerily quiet after 6 P.M., once the 140,000 daytime corporate workers have fled for suburban homes. 
 One after another over the years, major national industrial companies that grew to maturity here -- including Gulf Oil and Koppers Corporation -- have moved away or reorganized or changed in a way that has shifted their business from the imposing downtown headquarters building that once housed them. Now such concerns are being raised about Westinghouse Electric Corporation, which purchased CBS in November 1995 for $5.4 billion and changed its name to CBS Corporation last month. . The company has also moved its headquarters to New York City.
Already, the former Westinghouse has reduced its presence at the headquarters building to 450 employees and put its remaining industrial businesses under the banner of Westinghouse Electric Company or Welco, for short, until a new owner is named.
That's because under a revised separation strategy, the company said that it was abandoning plans to spin off its industrial businesses into a new company that would have kept the old Westinghouse name. Instead, it will sell them piecemeal or as a group by the middle of 1998. In December, the company sold its power-generation business for $1.53 billion to German conglomerate Siemens A.G.
Still, the path the former Westinghouse is taking contrasts strikingly with the approach taken by other corporate giants who have left the city. Westinghouse is leaving with more of a whimper than a bang.
"Westinghouse has been an absentee landlord since the 1980's, so their leaving will not be as significant a loss as the loss of our steel mills," said Dennis Unkovic, a partner at the Pittsburgh-based law firm of Meyer Unkovic & Scott LLP.
He was quick to add, however, that some of the company's remaining industrial businesses might fare a lot better without Westinghouse. "They can now focus operations on serving and fueling nuclear plants that they designed in the early 1980's -- Westinghouse accounts for almost half of the 110 nuclear plants in the United States," he said. Jeffrey Williams, a strategy professor at Carnegie Mellon University's business school, says Pittsburgh will survive because the region "is becoming a 'silicon valley' for high-tech start-ups."
AMONG such companies that have set up operations in or near Pittsburgh, he said, are Fore Systems, an Internet software maker; Transarc, a computer software subsidiary of I.B.M., and Respironics, a high-tech health-care products manufacturer. In all, 3,600 start-up high-techcompanies have created 100,000 jobs in the last decade, according to a report last fall by the Pittsburgh High-Tech Council.
But to retain this emerging high-tech industry and its employees, real estate brokers say the city needs to add upscale restaurants, shops and more space for start-ups, which typically require no more than 40,000 square feet. To provide such space, the former Westinghouse is spending $500,000 a floor to get space ready for new tenants at its 420,000-square-foot building, where existing tenants lease about 10 percent of the space.
Brokers say the Westinghouse headquarters building comes on the market just as other older former Fortune 500 headquarters buildings are still seeking tenants. The Koppers Corporation, an industrial products manufacturer, today occupies only 15 percent of the 459,000-square-foot building on Grant Street that once was its headquarters. Eighty percent of the building is leased by law firms and small service companies.
Next door to the Koppers Building is the former headquarters of the Gulf Oil Corporation, which was once among Pittsburgh's biggest employers. The Chevron Corporation, based in San Francisco, acquired Gulf in 1984. The oil company has no presence in the 44-story structure, though the building is still known as the Gulf Tower. About 80 percent of the building is leased by Transarc, the software maker, and there is a scattering of other small tenants.
One advantage that the Westinghouse headquarters building will find in leasing space or in selling it is a 450-car garage in the building, according to brokers.
"Other large buildings waiting to be leased or on the sales block do not have parking garages," said Peter Sukernek, general manager of Howard Hanna Commercial Services, a regional real-estate brokerage.
Space in the Westinghouse headquarters building comes on the market at a time when 3.5 million square feet of downtown office space is already available. The vacancy rate amounts to 13.7 percent overall, according to Grubb and Ellis, the national real estate firm. Brokers say the aim is to have the vacancy rate drop to between 7 or 8 percent in 1998.
WESTINGHOUSE has been identified with Pittsburgh since 1886, when George Westinghouse began manufacturing air brakes for the railroads. Over the years, the company not only built its headquarters in the city but also developed manufacturing plants for power-generation equipment, research laboratories, training centers and offices for support staff.
At its height in the mid-80's Westinghouse had 12 million square feet of space in buildings in Greater Pittsburgh. CBS Corporation now has 5 million square feet in the area.
"It will still take some time to sort out the future of all our real estate, but we do not plan a fire sale," said John Coulter, real estate director of CBS Corporation.
At the same time, the former Westinghouse has been trying to dispose of many other properties. The company's 138,000-square-foot training center about seven miles east of downtown, which will be vacant in March, is on the market along with 12.2 acres of underdeveloped land. In its heyday it housed about 450 workers who worked on panel boards for nuclear power plants. A million-square-foot technology center in the suburb of Churchill has been on the market for several months. Its sole tenant, Northrop Grumman Corporation, took 180,000 square feet in November 1996.
A 165,349-square-foot research facility near Forest Hills, five miles east of Pittsburgh, is up for sale. The three-story research lab, which sits on 11.7 acres, was built in the 20's.
The former Westinghouse also plans to jettison its 14-acre recreation center site off of Greensburg Pike and is considering donating it to the borough and a group trying to develop a national broadcasting museum rather than selling it for development.
Just last year, Alcoa donated its 31-story, 442,500-square-foot corporate headquarters building to several downtown economic development groups. Alcoa is building a new $40-million, 236,200-square-foot, six-story headquarters on the Allegheny River in Pittsburgh's North Side. The new building, which is scheduled to open in July, is designed for 400 employees. The company now has 1,500 employees at Alcoa's old Sixth Avenue headquarters building erected in 1952. Most of them will be dispersed to office space elsewhere in the city.
Other moves that are expected to help soften the blow of the Westinghouse departure include some new tenant leases and major commercial construction. PNC Bank recently announced plans to build a 400,000-square-foot operation center on the site of the old Baltimore & Ohio Railroad terminal on Grant Street and First Avenue, downtown. PNC Bank also is taking 350,000 square feet of office space at the USX Tower (the former U.S. Steel Tower, built in 1967) on Grant Street -- the high-profile, 64-story office tower has been plagued with office vacancies for more than a decade. With PNC, the occupancy rate in the building will top 90 percent for the first time since 1982.
Construction also has begun on a new 250,000-square-foot Lazarus department store with a 500-car parking garage below. The store will be on the block bounded by Wood Street, Fifth Avenue, Oliver Street and Smithfield Street near other major stores. City officials also have quietly contracted with Chicago-based Urban Retail Properties Company to try to add more upscale shops and restaurants downtown.

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey;
Near Downtown New Brunswick, More Housing

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
FIVE years ago two developers began transforming 6.6 cleared acres not far from New Brunswick's reviving downtown into housing. The original concept called for an enclave of for-sale town houses.
But now plans are in place for the final phase of the redevelopment, which when completed in 1999 will be an element of a mostly market-rate rental community. 
 Construction of the 82 rental apartments, Richmond Court, and 7 town houses with 15 units that will make up the $12.5 million final component is expected to start by this spring, contingent upon receiving approvals. They will join a 5-story, 117-unit rental building, Riverwatch Commons, and 14 other town houses with 18 units now on the site, near the Hyatt Regency Hotel in the Hiram Market area next to northbound Route 18. The total town-house component is called Townhomes at Hiram Square.
When the last element is completed and occupied there will be about 400 people living in the area, said Christopher J. Paladino, president of the nonprofit New Brunswick Development Corporation, which is developing the new rentals with the Applied Companies of Hoboken. Applied, which completed the Riverwatch Commons rental building last May, is developing the new town houses alone.
Mr. Paladino said that slow sales of the first 18 town houses that his group and an earlier private developer had built made it clear that "people were not willing to make a commitment to buy." So two and a half years ago "we seized the opportunity to do rentals, which still gets people with middle incomes to the downtown," he added.
More than $700 million worth of public and private investment has risen in this Middlesex County seat's downtown since its revitalization began in 1975, according to the city's Department of Planning, Policy and Economic Development.
It now has a wide array of new stores, restaurants and office buildings. Among the latter are Johnson & Johnson's corporate headquarters as well as academic and medical buildings for Rutgers University, St. Peter's Medical Center and the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital.
More is under way, including Liberty Plaza, a 130,000-square-foot building rising on George Street at Liberty Street for the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. The $44 million project also has 15,000 square feet of retail space.
Bringing upscale housing downtown has been a slower process. What the new rental structure shows is that "we are building on a sense of community that turned a once bleak tract into a thriving downtown community," Mayor James M. Cahill said in a statement when he announced the project at a news conference last November.
COMPLETING the transformation of the 6.6-acre site is also important because it opens up the opportunity to redevelop two other nearby parcels. All three are part of a larger effort conceived in the 80's by local officials to create a residential neighborhood that would draw upper-middle-class people back to the city.
The plan, which at one point called for a mix of some 500 residences in a $130-million project called Riverwatch, has had its share of challenges. Among them were a long land acquisition process and the collapse of the housing market in the late 80's, which affected the early town houses at the first redevelopment site.
The other sites edging the Raritan River on the opposite side of Route 18 -- a 14-acre site occupied by the city's police headquarters and the 2.5 acre Old City Dock tract -- still await plans for renewal.
The same is true for an additional seven downtown acres that were not part of the original Riverwatch plan. Mr. Paladino said that a new master plan was being drawn up for the three sites, adding that it was expected to be presented to the city by the end of February. Preliminary discussions, he said, center on a mix of uses, ranging from an entertainment complex to office and retail space, to a marina and additional housing.
The shift to market-rate rental housing at the initial downtown site came in 1995 when the Applied Companies began building the five-story rental building, called RiverWatch Commons. At the time the market for such a development had been untested in New Brunswick, where no sizable new market-rate rental projects had taken shape in 30 years.
But Joseph J. Cicala, a vice president at Applied, said that his company "believed young professionals would be attracted to living close to downtown" and that the demand for rentals was -- and still is -- strong in the state. Additionally, he said, financing is more readily available for rental housing than for town houses, adding that the city's demographics supported rentals.
That was borne out at Riverwatch Commons. Three months after it was completed all 117 of the one- and two-bedroom apartments, with 700 to 1,000 square feet of space, were leased at rents of $875 to $1,400 a month.
The market that project attracted -- young professionals working in the city or living in the area and commuting to work in Manhattan -- is also expected to be drawn to the new rentals, Mr. Cicala said and added: "The first project allowed us to create a market, a critical mass; and now there is the potential to continue our efforts."
The size of the apartments and rents are expected to be on a par with those at RiverWatch. But the units will be in two three-story structures that will echo the scale of the existing, as well as the new, town house structures.
The new town houses, like the old ones, will have brick and stone facades. They will contain two- and three-bedroom apartments on one to three levels and with 1,200 to 2,100 square feet of space. Prices are expected to range from $179,000 to $250,000.
Applied has not ruled out converting the 82 rentals into condominiums. "It is important for New Brunswick to build for-sale housing," Mr. Cicala said. "The city is not ready for it now, but that is not to say there will not be a market sometime in the future."
Mr. Paladino agreed and added that the second goal of the Riverwatch plan -- to get middle-income buyers to invest in the area -- will happen, albeit in a more methodical way. The new master plan is being designed to meet the realities of the late 90's, he added, noting that traffic, environmental and market issues posed challenges, especially to the redevelopment of the riverfront tracts.
Meanwhile, improvements to Boyd Park, stretching for a mile and a half along the river, were completed recently and work is under way to refurbish the Delaware and Raritan Canal and towpath as well as to create new car and pedestrian roads. The $11.7 million in improvements will make the linear greenway and the waterfront accessible to the city.
As for the riverfront sites targeted for renewal, plans are to relocate the police headquarters by May 1999 to a site along Livingston Avenue at the southern end of downtown, which is now occupied by a post office. All but the facade of the post office will be demolished and replaced by a four-story 133,708 square foot building that will house the police station as well as the municipal court, the Middlesex County Prosecutor's office and several city departments.
That building and a 118,743-square-foot structure to be built across the street and house county administrative offices would complete Civic Square, another downtown redevelopment. Already in place is a 160,000-square-foot Rutgers academic building.
What ultimately will rise on both sites is unclear. A mix of uses, including a hotel, a marina and additional housing, rather than just housing, is being considered, said Mr. Paladino.
"We want to capitalize on the momentum in place," he said. "It is an opportunity that may not be there in the next decade."

HEADLINE: It Was the Year of 'Let's Make a Deal'

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
A FEW years ago real estate executives were coining slogans like "Stay alive till 95" and "Find something to do until 20-02" that expressed the difficulty of operating in a market that was sluggish at best. Today, nobody has the time to think up clever sayings. They are too busy making deals.
"It's been a phenomenal year, the best we have seen on the service side of the business since 1989," said Steven A. Swerdlow, executive vice president in charge of CB Commercial's New York office. Prime space in midtown office towers, Mr. Swerdlow said, has all but disappeared. "In the top 65 buildings," he said, "we are down to a 3 percent vacancy rate, which we have not seen since 1981." 
 The prosperity has been widespread. The downtown Manhattan office market, considered so feeble that a special city incentive program was designed for it in 1995, was host to the five biggest leasing deals of the year. One such deal, the Goldman, Sachs lease at 10 Hanover Square, involved a building that had been considered for conversion to residential use. As a result, many executives expect to see the pace of conversion slow as landlords seek to market their properties as offices.
Out in the suburbs, speculative office building is already under way in northern New Jersey, and local specialists say they expect one or more projects to get under way in Stamford, Conn., this year.
A new office tower is rising between 42d and 43d Streets along Broadway, and another Times Square building is expected at the northwest corner of 42d and Broadway for the Reuters news organization. Bear, Stearns is making plans to put up a new headquarters on the east blockfront of Madison Avenue between 46th and 47th Street now occupied by the long-vacant 383 Madison.
These activities are renewing interest in other possible development sites, some well known and others, such as one on Third Avenue between 43d and 44th Streets using the air rights over St. Agnes Roman Catholic Church, that have been little discussed until recently.
The Columbus Circle site now occupied by the Coliseum and the site now used as a parking lot on the half block on Seventh Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets are probably the most prominent uncommitted sites, along with two remaining Times Square properties that are being marketed by their owner, the Prudential Insurance Company.
"Those Times Square parcels will be developed within a year," said Jeffrey Katz, the president of Sherwood Equities, which manages the building at 1 Times Square. A group led by Mr. Katz sold the triangular building where the ball drops on New Year's Eve for a record $1,100 a square foot last year.
A developer is expected to be designated for the Columbus Circle location from a list that includes Millennium Partners, Tishman-Speyer Properties and a partnership involving Bruce C. Ratner, Donald Brodsky and Peter M. Lehrer. Officials of the Rockefeller Group, which controls the Seventh Avenue plot, invariably referred to as "Rock West," say they expect to sign an anchor tenant in the first half of this year for a new building they would develop.
Other possible office building sites include 310 Madison, at the southwest corner of 42d Street. Researchers at CB Commercial found that the owner, Harry Macklowe, can empty the building if it is scheduled for demolition, so he could move quickly if the right tenant came along.
The Durst family, which is building the 1.6 million-square-foot tower designated 4 Times Square, also controls property to the east, although it is missing a critical L-shaped parcel at the corner of Avenue of the Americas and 42d Street. Douglas Durst, the president of the company, said he had not given up on acquiring the parcel, but said that if unsuccessful, he would go ahead with a midblock building sometime after 2000.
A few blocks to the east, the church of St. Agnes, now being rebuilt after a 1992 fire, occupies a site in the middle of the block between 43d and 44th Streets and Lexington and Third Avenues. To the west is an office tower designated 425 Lexington. To the east is a group of low-rise houses that developers have been eyeing for years as the site of an office tower. Adding the air rights from the church could improve the economics of such a project, if the land can be assembled, CB Commercial's researchers reported.
It may take years for these possible projects to be built. Some, like the Coliseum, appear likely to go ahead quickly, while others will require a lot more things to fall into place before the start of any building. Among them are development on the Ninth Avenue side of the Post Office building at 34th Street and over the Port Authority building at 42d Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues. But the fact that people are blowing the dust off old plans and figuring out ways to get them done is an indication of how sharply the market has turned in the last few years and how executive mindsets have shifted from trying to stay afloat to changing the skyline again.
Here is how the different sectors of the commercial real estate market performed last year, and the outlook for 1998.
 
Midtown Offices
Lower Vacancy Rate And Higher Rents
Vacancy rates in Class A office buildings in midtown fell to 8.5 percent in December, compared to almost 12 percent a year earlier, while average asking rents, including both direct rentals and sublets, increased to $40.68 from $38.82, according to figures compiled by RELocate, a real estate information company.
These averages understate the kind of prices being paid by tenants who want the best locations in the Plaza District, generally defined as the area bounded by 45th and 59th Streets and Third and Fifth Avenues.
"We are seeing rentals in the $50 to $60 per square foot range, with some reaching as high as $70," said Robert Emden, an executive managing director of Grubb & Ellis New York. In addition, he said, the period of free rent for a new tenant while the interior construction work is performed was no more than six months now, and the amount of construction a landlord is willing to do is no more than $35 to $40 a square foot, compared to 18 months of free rent and $60 a square foot in construction allowances when tenants had the upper hand.
He said that since no new office space had been built for years, demand was outrunning supply. "It is a struggle to come up with space," he said. "You have to get to it before it hits the market."
High prices in the prime midtown core will drive tenants to places they might not have considered before, executives say. "People will move when rates get high," said James D. Kuhn, the president of Newmark & Company Real Estate. "We saw that happen in the 70's and 80's when rates peaked."
Mr. Kuhn said office users would warm to the charms of the Jersey City waterfront, Metrotech in Brooklyn, and Stamford as the differential in rental rates grew. The prices will also effect the pattern of development in Manhattan as well, he said, citing the recent activities of owners, including real estate investment trusts such as Vornado Realty Trust.
"Vornado is paying about $420 million for One Penn Plaza, which would have been unheard of not too long ago," Mr. Kuhn said. He said the price implied that the New Jersey-based REIT felt it could get rents in the range of $30 to $40 a square foot.
He said Vornado's other investments in the area near 34th Street and Eighth Avenue showed it was confident the area would attract a higher caliber of tenant than it does now, and pricier retail stores. "Penn Plaza is going to take its place alongside Times Square and Grand Central" as hubs of activity in the city, Mr. Kuhn said.
Of course, good news for owners can be bad news for tenants. "In this market, owners can get away with murder," said James Meiskin, the president of Plymouth Partners, which represents tenants. "It is much more difficult now for tenants, and you are going to see companies leave the city."
 
Downtown Offices
Rise in Leasing May Cut Conversions
Like a dozen or so older office buildings near the lower tip of Manhattan thought to be no longer suitable for use as modern office space, the structure at 10 Hanover Square was scheduled for conversion to residential use. Before the conversion could begin, the big financial services firm of Goldman, Sachs reached an agreement to lease all 522,089 square feet of it.
After years in the doldrums, office leasing in the downtown area picked up sharply last year, prompting some owners to reconsider plans for conversions.
Michael T. Cohen, the president of Williams Real Estate, said the reason for the quick comeback of Downtown is that alternatives of the past are unavailable. "In the 80's when pressure built up in midtown, 50 million square feet of light assembly space in Midtown South was converted to office," he said. "Now there is no Midtown South to convert, so Downtown is the bargain overflow area. But it is going to run out."
Six of the biggest leasing transactions of the year took place below Canal Street, including the decision by Standard & Poor's to lease over 930,000 square feet at 55 Water Street.
"Standard & Poor's made a commitment, and that was a catalyst transaction," said Frank A. Cento, a senior director in Cushman & Wakefield's downtown office. "That made other companies realize they had to make commitments as well, and it kicked off a lot of activity."
That activity included Merrill Lynch's purchasing of a 760,000-square-foot building at 222 Broadway (at Fulton Street), the city's Human Resources Administration taking 483,000 square feet at 180 Water Street and, at year's end, Empire Blue Cross-Blue Shield signing for 449,000 square feet at 1 World Trade Center.
Despite the flurry of leasing activity, some executives note that downtown is still based on financial services, and say that a sharp correction in the stock market could produce plenty of empty space quickly again, as it has in the past. "Downtown is a single-industry town," said Anthony E. Malkin, president of W&M Properties, which develops and manages commercial ventures.
 
Investment Sales
REIT's Grow In Importance
On Oct. 3, NRK Management paid $115 million to buy the building at 810 Seventh Avenue, between 52d and 53d Streets. Before the year was out, the company had resold it for $143.4 million to Tower Realty Trust, earning a profit of $28.4 million in just 67 days.
"We are long-term holders and we had no intention of selling," said Adam Hochfelder, vice president of NRK, whose president is Richard Kalikow. "The only way I can describe it is to say that they made us an offer that we couldn't refuse."
According to Darcy Stacom, an executive director of Cushman & Wakefield and a prominent sales broker, the sales of 810 Seventh and 100 Wall Street, which also turned over in less than a year at a substantial profit, were the most significant of the year because they demonstrated the growing importance of real estate investment trusts in New York.
Tower, which bought 100 Wall for $58.5 million from the Witkoff Group, which had paid $37 million earlier in the year, became a publicly traded REIT this year and evidently felt the need to make acquisitions quickly to meet Wall Street's performance goals. "We had to close by 5 P.M. on Dec. 31, and that's what happened," Mr. Hochfelder said.
Tower, the former Feldman Equities, is one of the new REIT's making their presence felt in the New York market. Others include S. L. Green, which is targeting Class B office buildings that can be upgraded, and Boston Properties, which also sold its initial public offering this year and promptly bought 280 Park Avenue at 48th Street for $321 million and 875 Third Avenue at 52d Street for $210 million.
Not a new REIT but an increasing factor in the city is Vornado Realty Trust, which purchased Bernard Mendik's portfolio of Manhattan office towers and is investing in buildings near Penn Station, which is emerging as the southern anchor of a district being revitalized by the changes in Times Square at the north end.
"There is a lot of capital chasing deals," Ms. Stacom acknowledged, but argued that the economic fundamentals in the city were good.
"Interest rates are low, office vacancies are low and the city is prosperous," she said. "There is a lot to drive up values, and we have a ways to go before we get back to 1980's prices."
Industry analysts say what is happening in New York is part of a national trend. Dennis Yeskey, managing director of Deloitte & Touche's real estate practice in the New York metropolitan area, said that public consolidation of the real estate market was just beginning. "It's the same process that other industries went through in decades past," he said. Real estate is such huge asset class, he said, that even investments of hundreds of billions nationally represent only a few percentage points of the total.
Because New York is a complex market with large individual assets, Mr. Yeskey said, some REIT's felt the need to grow and gain experience in smaller markets before investing here. "They rehearsed out of town before opening in New York," he said. But he said they would be an increasing presence in the market.
 
Suburbs, Other Boroughs
Building in Jersey, Not in Westchester
The development picture in New York's suburbs is decidedly uneven. Office buildings are going up in Parsippany, Florham Park, East Hanover and other locations in New Jersey and there are stirrings along the Jersey City waterfront facing lower Manhattan.
But north of the city, in Westchester County, there does not seem to be anyone willing to put a shovel in the ground. Rocked by corporate downsizings and departures, the county still has an overhang of vacant space, and what activity is taking place is rehabilitation to upgrade existing structures.
Right now the big question marks are hanging over Fairfield County, Conn., and particularly Stamford, where three development sites for office buildings that could total nearly 1.5 million square feet are just about ready for construction to begin. The problem is lining up an anchor tenant who would commit to leasing a substantial portion of a new building.
"This market has shifted," said Jeffrey H. Newman, a senior vice president and manager of the Fairfield office of W&M Properties. "It's less of a corporate headquarters for Fortune 500 companies and more of a place for insurance and information technology companies. Most of the leases we are doing are in the 5,000 to 10,000 square foot range."
Local real estate officials say it is unlikely that any of the projects, which include a cleared site facing Stamford Town Center, will proceed until those elusive anchor tenants can be found. Two of the big companies that decided to move to Stamford recently did not help in this regard. Swiss Bank is building its own headquarters and Zurich RE took over the old headquarters of GTE Corporation.
In the boroughs outside Manhattan, substantial office development is unlikely, although stores like Home Depot, Kmart and Price Costco are finding new locations. The reason, said Joshua Muss, the president of Muss Development Company, is that building costs are almost as high as in Manhattan, but office tenants are unwilling to pay Manhattan rents.
Mr. Muss, who is building Renaissance Plaza, which includes Brooklyn's first new hotel in decades, said that with tax incentives from the city, downtown Brooklyn could have a big future as an office alternative to New Jersey. "Taxes and union pay scales are based on Manhattan, but you can't get Manhattan rents" he said. "You need $30 a foot to make a project pay, but you can't get it."
 
Retail
Rental Rates Hitting the Roof
Rental rates for prime retail space have gone so high that further increases are unlikely, retail real estate specialists say. But even so, there is demand for the large spaces that are likely to become available this year at Rockefeller Center and later at the old Alexander's site at Lexington Avenue and 58th Street and at the Coliseum site on Columbus Circle.
"They are getting $400 a foot on Madison Avenue, $500 a foot on Fifth Avenue and $250 a foot in midtown," said Faith H. Consolo, a senior managing director at Garrick-Aug Associates, referring to the annual cost of a square foot of space in a store. "They have gone up so much over the last few years that I don't see them going up by much more than 5 percent in the first quarter and then leveling off in the second."
Alan Victor, executive vice president of Lansco Corporation, said that the biggest problem in the Madison and Fifth Avenue area was finding space, that demand far exceeded supply.
"These days you have to be ahead of the market by developing locations," Mr. Victor said. This often involves buying out the leases of existing tenants and moving them to new locations to accommodate new entrants.
He said one of the big events of the year was expected to be the announcement of the long-awaited plan to redevelop the retail space at Rockefeller Center. Although the center draws millions of visitors a year, the retail space has largely been occupied by small shops, and management has made it clear that it plans to combine the below-ground concourse with the street and upper levels to create space for large destination stores.
"They are going to create a mega shopping area there that will transform the place," Mr. Victor said.
He said he also expected plans for the Alexander's site to be made public this year, with the anticipation that the former department store would be redeveloped by its owner Vornado as a mixed-use building with 300,000 square feet of retail space and 500,000 square feet of living space on the upper floors. Redeveloping the long-closed store would bring new vitality to the neighborhood, something other retailers are already seeking to capitalize on.
"There are a couple of vacancies on 58th Street, and my phone has been melting," Mr. Victor said.
Despite city restrictions on development, retail specialists said they expected to see the continued spread in the city of "big-box" stores -- large spaces devoted to limited categories of merchandise.
"Rockefeller Center is one of the few places with the kind of size that retailers want," Ms. Consolo observed. "But you will also see things like a big Crate and Barrel downtown."
Michael N. Hirshfeld, director of the retail program at Equis of New York, noted that another retail phenomenon, the off-price outlet mall, was creeping closer to the city. Bargain hunters new have to drive about 50 miles to get to Woodbury Common, near Harriman, N.Y. "Metro Mall, a 1.3-million-square-foot outlet mall, is under construction in Elizabeth, which is within 20 miles of the city," he said "It looks like a home run."
 
Hotels
Occupancy Rates And Prices Up
With a booming economy and an influx of tourists to what is now perceived as a safe, vibrant city, New York's hotels filled almost to capacity. According to a study prepared by Coopers & Lybrand's lodging and gaming group, hotel occupancy last year was a record 85.5 percent, and the average room rate increased 9 percent to $175 a night.
Analysts say they do not expect the occupancy rate to increase much this year because of the lack of available rooms, although room rates may increase as hotel operators use the high demand as an opportunity to push prices upward. In spite of the demand, and an increasing flurry of proposals to convert existing buildings to hotels, not a huge quantity of new rooms are likely to reach the market soon. If all the most likely projects happen, they would add about 1,700 new rooms, which would not make much of a splash in a market that already has about 65,000 rooms, according to Coopers & Lybrand.
Tourist-class hotels, which charge under $100 a night, experienced the most growth in occupancy last year, up 7.2 percent, while the two top luxury categories were flat or down. Analysts attribute this to some travelers reducing their standards as rates for convention and first-class hotels increased, and to the attractiveness of New York to visitors on tight budgets.

HEADLINE: ENVIRONMENT;
Threatened Creatures Slowing Some Construction to a Turtle's Pace

BYLINE: By KAREN DeMASTERS 

 BODY:
With the economy healthy, building is going on all over the the state, but in some instances the building of homes, commercial developments or roads is in conflict with the desire to protect the animals and plants that help give the state its special character. It is the job of the state Department of Environmental Protection to see that the animals and plants can live with the construction that keeps the state moving and growing, but it often takes time to work out the details.
For example, the last 1.5 miles of a 7.5-mile stretch of four-lane highway under construction around Freehold will be delayed at least a year in order to give Monmouth County officials time to realign the road to bypass a swampy area where bog turtles live. The bog turtle, a 4.5-inch-long brown turtle with a yellow, orange or reddish blotch on each side of its head, is considered "endangered" by the state government and "threatened" (a lower level of alert) by the Federal government. Monmouth County officials had hoped to advertise for bids for the last section of the Route 33 bypass in the spring, said Michael F. Barrett, director of the county department of public works and engineering, but will probably now wait until spring of 1999. 
 New Jersey has 14 nesting pairs of bald eagles, which are also deemed endangered by the state and threatened by the Federal government. Two of those pairs nest near areas planned for development. In the Smithville section of Galloway Township in Atlantic County, more than 1,800 single-family homes, condominium units or town houses have been completed since the early 1980's. K. Hovnanian, the developer based in Red Bank, had hoped eventually to build up to 6,800 units, but the number has been scaled back to 4,200, partly to protect a pair of bald eagles. Negotiations about the project, which is on both sides of Route 9, have been underway for about a year and are not complete yet, said Michael Gross, a Tinton Falls lawyer who represents the developer.
In Logan Township, Gloucester County, a proposed industrial park, Liberty Properties, is being redesigned to provide a buffer area to protect another pair of bald eagles, said Amy Collings, a spokeswoman for the Department of Environmental Protection.
In Hanover Township, in Morris County, the blue-spotted salamander -- on both the state and Federal endangered lists -- is affecting a town house development known as Cambridgesquare. The salamander is a five-inch-long creature with dark blue or black skin with light blue speckles. The scope of the development is being reduced to eliminate the impact on the salamander.
The blue-spotted salamander, along with the wood turtle, a species considered threatened by the state (but with no Federal designation), is in the way of the completion of Eisenhower Parkway, which has been proposed to run through the Hatfield Swamp in Essex County, where both animals live. The road now runs 5.3 miles from South Orange Avenue at the Livingston Mall to Route 280. A section that would continue 1.8 miles north from Route 280 to Bloomfield Avenue would cross the swamp. Where the road will eventually go, and when, depends on an environmental impact statement that the county is preparing.

HEADLINE: MUSIC;
In Praise and Remembrance of a Fallen Leader

BYLINE: By LESLIE KANDELL 

 BODY:
CHAMBER music. Would that be four or five people, peaceably playing string quartets or wind quintets in a small concert hall? Not at the 10th annual "Sing in Praise of King" celebration in Newark. Even its previous tributes to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. were chamber music only in the sense that they were presented in nearby churches, and churches are traditionally friendly to chamber music.
The opening of New Jersey Performing Arts Center has made it possible to move this year's eclectic concert on Wednesday to the capacious Prudential Hall, hardly a chamber. A homegrown coalition of performers -- a wind trio and a string foursome from the New Jersey Chamber Music Society, plus a jazz septet led by the pianist and composer Steve Colson -- expands the term chamber music into something more like glorious mosaic, or perhaps smorgasbord. 
 Additional performers will contribute readings, speeches and choral singing in remembrance of Dr. King, who was assassinated 30 years ago. Mr. Colson, who was born in Newark, will lead the premiere of ". . . As in a Cultural Reminiscence." The half-hour work was commissioned by the New Jersey Chamber Music Society, which offers jazz evenings as part of its regular series and is a resident affiliate of the new arts center.
The text of the new work is to be read by its authors, Amiri Baraka of Newark and Richard Wesley of Montclair, both influential in poetry and drama of the black experience. The keynote speaker is Dr. King's daughter, the Rev. Bernice King, who like her siblings works hard to keep his memory alive. At the Chamber Music Society's suggestion, the Newark Community Concert Choir, 70 voices from local churches, was invited to sing spirituals, gospel songs and a chorus from Handel's "Messiah."
"The new piece is probably my best effort so far at merging forces," Mr. Colson said in a telephone interview from his home in Montclair, where several of the musicians live. "It's more devoted to strings than the others are. Jazz allows me to take any form and stretch it. If we were allowed to play what we want, we would have no trouble."
In that veiled complaint, Mr. Colson drew attention to one major difference between jazz and classical music: jazz relies on improvisation, which is by definition not notated. Even using computer software, Mr. Colson says, he had to finish composing in time to transfer the music into written notation, and then extract individual parts and make them legible.
But scheduling problems for such a mixed gathering required compromise: the musicians who were classically trained had to wait to rehearse until they received the score, while the jazz players had to make last-minute adjustments from their unwritten versions. In fact, a special dress rehearsal takes place just before the concert, as a bonus for 1,900 schoolchildren.
"Steve's players are great improvisers," said Oliver Lake, an alto saxophonist and composer from Montclair who has recorded his own music with Mr. Colson. "I'm definitely going to want to be there." It would be background enrichment for Mr. Lake, whose group, Trio Three, is presenting a demonstration of 20th-century chamber jazz on Friday at the Chamber Music America conference in Manhattan.
Describing his new memorial composition, Mr. Colson said: "Basically, it has to do with people and memories. Events pass, and we look in retrospect. The title came to mind when I was playing some miscellaneous pieces for Amiri and Richard. We were trying to put text and music to different strands of memories that have to do with the black experience."
Mr. Colson played music in several moods. "They would stop me and make comments," he said. "Later, I listened and tried to construct music based on their comments that would support the text and give the flavor."
For "Reminiscence," Mr. Colson, who teaches world music at Bloomfield College, updated and incorporated some familiar spirituals named by Mr. Baraka, including "Blessed Assurance," "This Little Light of Mine," "Go Tell It on the Mountain," "O Freedom" and "We Shall Overcome." In Mr. Colson's assessment, "they sound like themselves, but hopefully with an extra layer."
He said he found Mr. Wesley's portion more original because it represented a single individual's personal recollection of events surrounding Dr. King's public life. "I arranged the spirituals with an ear toward the later music," he said. "I will conduct, but there is a brief piano part, which I kind of spread out. My part is partially covered by Brian Carrott on the vibes."
W HILE the classically oriented Chamber Music Society has mounted a jazz series (whose next concert is on Jan. 30 at Union Congregational Church in Upper Montclair), Mr. Colson moves in the jazz world and seldom makes the musical crossing. Instead, he performs in places larger than the 2,750-seat Prudential (40,000 at the 1980 Chicago Jazz Festival in Grant Park) and lengthy efforts like a three-hour piece at Symphony Hall in Newark in 1989, with the composer Anthony Davis at the piano and Henry Threadgill on alto saxophone.
But his family members have made other musical crossings, most notably his elder son, an economics major at Yale, who, Mr. Colson confided, prefers rap.

HEADLINE: A Show of Efficiency vs. a Show of Extravagance

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
THE future of the automobile is definitely green.
The question is whether it is green, as in environmentally friendly, or green, as in big profits. Conceivably, it could be both. 
 The two visions of the future were starkly displayed here last week at the news media preview of the North American International Auto Show, which opened to the public yesterday at Cobo Center. The Detroit show has become the main American platform for introducing concept vehicles that signal the auto industry's future direction, and the prototypes that many of the world's manufacturers showed here will be traveling the auto-show circuit this year, including the New York International Auto Show in April.
Many of the 1998 concepts cars fall into two camps: inventive vehicles that would use far less fuel and produce far less pollution than today's models, and extravagant, powerful, potentially high-profit machines that seem to mock the very idea of conservation and restraint.
In the first group, the hometown teams -- General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler -- showed their latest environmentally sensitive offerings.
G.M. showed a family of advanced-technology vehicles, including an extended-range EV1 electric car and a hybrid-power, all-wheel-drive performance car that it says could get 80 miles to a gallon of gasoline.
The next-generation EV1 and a Chevrolet S-10 electric pickup truck are the first G.M. vehicles to use nickel metal hydride batteries, which double the range of the two vehicles. G.M.'s two new hybrid vehicles include one that uses an electric motor charged by an efficient gas-turbine generator. The other has an electric motor and direct-injection turbo-diesel engine, capable of 80 m.p.g. G.M. also showed a fuel-cell vehicle that runs on electrical energy created from a hydrogen-oxygen chemical reaction and a compressed-natural-gas vehicle with a one-liter, three-cylinder turbo-charged engine.
Ford pulled the wraps off the P2000, a revolutionary family car that, it says, can get 63 m.p.g. The P2000 is about the same size as today's Taurus but about a ton lighter. It is powered by a new, aluminum, 1.2-liter direct-injection engine, in which fuel and air are mixed in the cylinder rather than in an outside chamber. Ford says the engine has low emissions and packs loads of power.
Chrysler's second-generation hybrid-fuel concept car, the Dodge Intrepid ESX2, could drastically reduce the cost of hybrid-powered vehicles. While Chrysler estimated the development and production cost of its first hybrid concept, the Intrepid ESX, at about $60,000 over that of a conventional car, it says the ESX2 reduces that premium to about $15,000. Although it has room for up to six people and more trunk space than the 1998 Dodge Intrepid, the ESX2 is extremely lightweight. The body consists of six plastic panels that weigh half as much as the 80 steel pieces on a conventional car.
Another Chrysler concept car at the show, the Plymouth Pronto Spyder, uses the same materials to make the exotic midengine sports car affordable.
The ESX2's diesel-electric hybrid engine has the potential to meet future emission requirements while achieving a mileage rating of 70 m.p.g. A small battery powers the accessories and an electric motor provides a boost during hard acceleration like passing a car on the highway. But the car is primarily powered by the diesel engine, which is lighter and less costly than a battery and electric motor combination that would produce the same power.
At the other end of the show-car spectrum, electric motors are used only to pamper the occupants of lavish luxury-car prototypes. Mercedes-Benz showcased its Maybach sedan, a car that is likely to go into production as a rival to Rolls-Royce. Powered by a 5.9-liter V12 engine, the Maybach was designed to be a modern intrepretation of the large, chauffeur-driven sedans that once picked up society matrons at the opera. It is 22 inches longer than the Mercedes S-Class sedan and features a humidor for cigars, three telephones, a bar, a flat-screen TV that folds down from above and reclining rear seats with leg rests.
Also in an opulent vein is Chrysler's Chronos, yet another attempt to develop a styling theme for a flagship Chrysler model, this time by drawing on classic designs from Virgil Exner, Chrysler's design chief in the 1950's. The long, low-slung Chronos, with sweeping lines and prominent rear fenders, has a number of luxurious touches, including a prominent chrome grille. Inside, the seats and steering wheel are covered with hand-sewn leather. The Chronos is powered by a 6-liter V10 engine that produces more than 350 horsepower. Like the Maybach, it has a built-in humidor.
Aston Martin's Project Vantage also has a powerful engine: a six-liter V12 capable of 200 miles an hour. But its light body of aluminum and carbon fiber should help it get a respectable economy rating of 20 m.p.g.
A number of concept vehicles represented further forays in cross-breeding cars with sport utility vehicles. The most unusual was the Buick Signia, based on the luxurious Park Avenue sedan but offering the all-wheel drive versatility of a sport utility. Outfitted with retro gauges and the blond wood popular in the 1930's, the Signia is easy to enter and exit because of its low height and extra-wide doors. But the seats are high, offering the commanding feel of a sport ute. The rear floor slides out 15 inches to make loading and unloading easier. The rear hatch is removable. Buick officials say the Signia hints at the division's "near-term product direction."
And for a completely different, even absurd, twist, Chrysler showed a concept vehicle it calls the Jeepster, a cross between a V8 sports car and a Jeep that can traverse rugged terrain. Its new 4.7-liter 32-valve V8 engine will make a production debut in the all-new 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee.

GRAPHIC: Photos: Sleek and powerful, Chrysler's Chronos concept represents the show's opulent vein. The hybrid-powered Dodge Intrepid ESX2. Buick mated a Park Avenue and a sport utility vehicle and came up with the Signia. Ford's very light P2000.

HEADLINE: H.M.O. Premiums Rising Sharply, Stoking Debate on Managed Care

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER 

 BODY:
Health maintenance organizations in the New York region are asking customers to pay larger -- in some cases much larger -- premiums this year after several years of holding down prices to spur enrollment in an area that long regarded managed care with suspicion.
The increases, mirroring those by managed care companies around the nation, vary by plan and by who is covered. But even big employers, who are typically able to negotiate the cheapest rates, say they expect the first substantial increases in several years. 
 "We're thinking probably in the range of 5 to 7 percent," said Laurel A. Pickering, managing director for the New York Business Group on Health, a trade organization that represents large companies like American Express, Time Warner and Consolidated Edison. The picture was different several years ago, she said, when premiums actually decreased.
Health care experts said they expected premiums to rise by 5 to 10 percent next year, prompting worries about whether the increases are a blip or a troubling sign that managed care is no better at controlling costs than traditional indemnity insurance.
There are many reasons for the increases, experts say: rising drug and hospitalization costs; employers willing to pay more in flush economic times, and plans offering wider choices to patients increasingly frustrated by the limits of managed care.
But many analysts in New York State say the primary reason is that managed care companies had kept prices artificially low for years to encourage reluctant New Yorkers to sign up, and are only now coming to terms with the actual cost of care.
"It's like Nobody Beats the Wiz," said Dr. Barbara A. DeBuono, the New York State Health Commissioner, referring to the giant electronics retailer that declared bankruptcy last month. "You go to the Wiz to get a TV at dirt-cheap prices. They go into bankruptcy. Believe me, the similarities are not lost on me."
And as the rates for commercial policies rise, a debate is beginning in New York that is already under way in California and Florida, where managed care serves a far greater portion of the population. (About 40 percent of New Yorkers are enrolled in managed care, compared with 70 percent of Californians.)
The basic question is: will managed care, in the long run, begin to mimic traditional insurance with its looser control over costs and annual premium increases that far outpace inflation?
The theory behind managed care was that health maintenance organizations would eliminate waste by limiting access to specialists and tests that they deemed unnecessary. But some critics of managed care say the savings from such restrictions can be realized only once, and that as the years roll on, large rate increases like those in indemnity plans are inevitable.
"We may have squeezed what we can out of the health care system," said State Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis, a Manhattan Democrat who is chairman of the Insurance Committee.
Other experts cite a second, contradictory dynamic: that managed care has, in fact, failed to cut costs significantly as it offers finicky customers in the New York region a level of choice much more like indemnity plans. For example, they say, some plans charge customers a slightly higher monthly fee in exchange for the right to see any specialist they want, whether the doctor is a member of the plan or not.
Critics say that managed care in the New York region is essentially discounted fee-for-service medicine, and that such an approach was a major reason for the financial problems of the largest H.M.O. in New York, Oxford Health Plans.
"Managed care companies do not manage care," said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association. "Instead they manage price: the prices they pay to providers. There are really few good examples of any sound managed care in New York."
Many people in the managed care industry contend that new laws and regulations are forcing the industry to make changes that drive up costs: specifically, regulations like the Managed Care Bill of Rights in New York, which requires health maintenance organizations to disclose certain information to consumers, and laws mandating minimum hospital stays for procedures like childbirth and mastectomies.
"Those are things that add up," said Leslie Moran, a spokeswoman for the New York State Health Maintenance Organization Conference, an industry trade group.
Others in the industry assert that, whatever the problems of managed care, it is still the cheapest and most efficient means of delivering health care and that the increases are overdue after five years of virtually flat costs. HIP Health Plan of New York, for example, plans to raise its rates in 1998 between 4 and 6 percent, the first increase in four years.
Leslie Strassberg, the company's senior vice president, said that managed care will continue to save money as more people enroll and the companies find better ways to balance cost control with service to patients.
"There is an equilibrium that has to be reached, and it's not going to be reached by skipping the squeeze-the-costs-out phase," he said.
It is unclear what broad effects the increases in health maintenance organization premiums will have. Some experts worry that more employers, who have turned to H.M.O.'s as a cheaper alternative, will drop coverage for their workers entirely, especially in small companies with low-paid employees.
In Binghamton, N.Y., Barbara D. Daly, whose two small businesses have been growing rapidly, said she had planned to begin offering her four employees health insurance next year. But after her H.M.O. told her to expect a 15 percent increase next year, she said she wondered if she could afford it, especially if premiums grow year after year.
"Now that health care reform is no longer on the national agenda, we are looking at who-knows-what increases," said Ms. Daly, who runs a coffee and gift shop and an importing business. "It's open-ended."
And people who buy insurance on their own say the increases add yet another layer of worry about whether they will continue to be able to afford insurance.
People who buy insurance on their own tend to be the sickest in the state, requiring the most costly care, and the requested rate increases for those policies are the highest. For example, Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield has requested a 51.6 percent rate increase for one such plan to cover what it describes as massive losses.
Linda Gibbs, 45, a singer and freelance bookkeeper in Manhattan who has ovarian cancer, says she worries how she will make her payments to Oxford, already $311 a month, if the premiums go up much more and she gets too sick again to work.
"Health care, housing and food -- they are the body's necessities," she said. "We should be covered for these things. I'm a pseudo-socialist."
In the Northeast, the state with the smallest increases is Connecticut, where regulators and advocates say a keenly competitive market has kept projected increases below 5 percent. But in New Jersey, managed care officials said they expected rates to rise between 5 and 8 percent.
In New York -- where for years premiums have risen very little and some actually have gone down -- seven managed care companies have already asked for rate increases of more than 10 percent in 1998, a level subject to approval by state regulators. In all of 1997, only four companies sought increases that high. The companies submit their increase requests to the state not once a year, but periodically as they decide on their rates.
More broadly, a survey of health maintenance organizations at the start of 1997 in the mid-Atlantic area -- New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania -- estimated an average premium increase of 1.6 percent. For 1998, the companies estimated an average increase of 4.4 percent, according to the survey by Douglas Sherlock, a health care analyst at the Sherlock Company. Estimates, he added, tend to be lower than the actual increases.
Dr. DeBuono, the New York Health Commissioner, said she believed the plans should receive increases to assure their solvency as the state's medical system, for years behind the rest of the nation, becomes more dependent on managed care.
"Medical costs are going up," she said. "Utilization is going up. They are not managing care. So what's a plan to do? Either raise their rates or go out of business."
John Calagna, a spokesman for the State Insurance Department, said that regulators would carefully study the requested increases in the coming months. The department often pares down companies' requests, but Mr. Calagna echoed Dr. DeBuono in saying that companies had kept prices low for so long that some might need increases to stay afloat.
"It doesn't make sense if people can't afford the coverage," he said. "And it doesn't make sense if the companies can't pay the claims. It's a balancing act."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 13, 1998, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about increases in premiums for health maintenance organizations in the New York region misstated the amount paid by one patient, Linda Gibbs, to Oxford Health Plans. Her premium is $216 monthly, not $311.

HEADLINE: Machine Tool Orders Down In November

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11

 BODY:
Orders for machine tools fell in November, though total purchases so far for 1997 remain above the 1996 level, an industry survey showed today.
Orders from American companies for domestic- and foreign-produced machine tools fell 12.7 percent, to an estimated $637 million, from a revised gain of 11.3 percent, to $730 million, in October, a report from the Association for Manufacturing Technology and the American Machine Tool Distributors' Association said. 
 All regions had a drop in November. The two industry groups previously estimated that October orders rose 6.6 percent, to $699 million.
Estimated machine tool orders for the first 11 months of 1997 totaled $7.51 billion, 18.8 percent ahead of the corresponding period a year earlier. November estimated orders were 15.2 percent more than the $553 million estimated in November 1996.
Machine tool makers and distributors "did not see a substantial change in business" in November, said Ralph Nappi, president of the distributors' group. "There is not a company that isn't enjoying a pretty good year. All indications for 1998 are strong with anticipated growth in the 5 percent to 8 percent range."
Bridgeport Machines, for instance, expects to report stable business for the quarter that ended last month. "Our U.S. business has remained reasonably steady for the past 12 months," said Dan L. Griffith, the chief executive, "and it appears that business will continue to remain steady for at least the near term."

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs Magazine Becoming Harder to Predict

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
Soon after taking over as the editor of Foreign Affairs in 1992, James F. Hoge Jr. stood before Washington members of the Council on Foreign Relations and presented them with their worst nightmare for their magazine: a mock front cover with the supermodel Cindy Crawford on the logo (instead of the usual rearing horse and rider) and cover lines like, "Boris' Babes," "Best Bets in Dictators" and "Sexiest Ethnic Rivalries."
Mr. Hoge, former publisher of The Daily News of New York, was poking fun at those who feared he would take the magazine in a lowbrow, lightweight direction. 
 Mr. Hoge was chosen because the council, which publishes Foreign Affairs, wanted a new kind of person to shepherd the journal into a new kind of world. And as the magazine moves out of its 75th anniversary year, readers say Mr. Hoge has successfully managed that transition by publishing new voices, tackling new subjects and making the magazine more accessible and less predictable.
"Foreign Affairs used to be the magazine of a certain kind of liberal establishment," said David Rieff, who has written several articles for Mr. Hoge. "He's opened it up, he's allowed the air in."
Still, in a period with no defining international conflict, when other media outlets have drastically reduced their foreign coverage and Americans are assumed to care little about news outside their borders, it remains to be seen what mark Mr. Hoge will ultimately make.
"The jury is out on what is going to happen," said Victor Navasky, the publisher of The Nation, "both in terms of a coherent foreign policy on the part of this country and the role that Foreign Affairs will play."
Indeed, some might expect Mr. Hoge to try to fill the void with something along the lines of George F. Kennan's historic "X" article, published in Foreign Affairs in 1947, which established the nation's policy of Soviet containment.
But although Mr. Hoge said articles submitted to Foreign Affairs were frequently touted as the next "X," he had no grand illusions about setting the agenda for the coming century.
"From the beginning, we've understood that there isn't to be a second Kennan piece," Mr. Hoge said in a recent interview at his book-lined office off Park Avenue. "The circumstances of the cold war allowed for an overarching theme for American foreign policy. That is simply not the case in the post-cold war world."
Indeed, Mr. Hoge and his managing editor, Fareed Zakaria, maintain that this moment in history is more interesting. "The whole world is up for grabs," Mr. Zakaria said. "We can run articles asking, 'Is nationalism the future?' 'Is globalization the future?' 'Is East Asia rising?' 'Is Russia collapsing?' -- all these big topics."
"The cold war had narrowed and focused our perspective," he continued. "Now you have this sort of wonderful confusion."
Mr. Hoge and Mr. Zakaria have exploited this confusion by expanding Foreign Affairs to include unorthodox articles about privatizing pensions and about the gender gap in Eastern Europe.
Though Mr. Hoge has yet to shake things up with a piece on the order of Francis Fukuyama's "The End of History," which ran in The National Interest in 1989, a few articles have generated lasting discussions. "The Clash of Civilizations?" by Samuel P. Huntington, for example, generated impassioned debate and became a book. In that 1993 article, the Harvard professor argued that the fundamental source of conflict in the post-cold war world would be cultural clashes between civilizations, as differentiated by language, culture, tradition and religion.
In addition, Paul Krugman's 1994 article "The Myth of Asia's Miracle" prompted Singapore to revamp its economic policies, according to a 1996 article in The Wall Street Journal. In his article, Mr. Krugman, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, argued that East Asia's impressive growth resulted from investment and labor, not efficiency, and would not last -- a prescient prediction.
And while Foreign Affairs may no longer be considered an establishment mouthpiece, it continues to have influence. "Virtually everyone I know in the foreign policy-national security area of the Government is attentive to it," said Strobe Talbott, the Deputy Secretary of State.
Stanley O. Roth, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific Affairs, added: "I would not want to tell you that every edition produces 10 policy issues. On the other hand, people do read it and views get reflected -- if not immediately, then over time."
If Foreign Affairs has become merely a forum for a variety of ideas, some might question its potential influence. But Mr. Hoge said he had the opportunity to affect the debate, if not to define it, and was proud of having no party line. Since its founding, the magazine "has always been at its most useful and influential during times of transition," Mr. Hoge said. "We think it is terribly important, given the position of this magazine, that we not be seen as having a point of view or particular political slant."
Indeed, many readers commend Mr. Hoge for fostering debate by publishing opposing views about sensitive subjects like Bosnia.
Because of the journal's close association with the elite Council on Foreign Relations, Mr. Hoge, 62, and Mr. Zakaria, 33, have also tried to open the "club" to new members, inviting younger voices in, as well as more women, and encouraging less stodgy writing.
"With important authors, one can treat them with kid gloves," Mr. Zakaria said. "The aim now is to edit the magazine for the reader, rather than the writer."
Foreign Affairs has also benefited from an increasingly global economy, building new readers in the business community.
And although Mr. Hoge maintains that he does not expect Foreign Affairs to appeal to a general audience, he has made several concessions to the realities of a competitive magazine market.
In addition to a redesign that included changing the cover from a dull gray to a glossy blue, Mr. Hoge shortened the articles from an average of 7,000 words to 5,000.
He started publishing six times a year instead of four and divided each issue into three distinct sections to make it seem less like an academic journal.
The direct rivals of Foreign Affairs include Foreign Policy, World Policy Journal, The National Interest and several others, all with considerably smaller circulations.
Five years into Mr. Hoge's tenure, Foreign Affairs' vital statistics look good. Circulation has crept up to 100,814, syndication has almost quadrupled and ad pages have increased about 40 percent since 1991, according to David Kellogg, the publisher.
For the last decade, Foreign Affairs has also made several hundred thousand dollars profit, Mr. Kellogg said, adding that this was rare for a scholarly magazine. And leaders of the Council on Foreign Relations say they are pleased with what Mr. Hoge has done.
"It often used to just sit on coffee tables," said Leslie H. Gelb, a former New York Times columnist who has been president of the council since 1993 and who worked in the Defense and State Departments. "Now people are actually reading it."
Because Mr. Hoge was best known as a tabloid publisher and was the first editor in 20 years who had not served in the Government, he has taken some getting used to.
Mr. Hoge's predecessor, William G. Hyland, had served as an aide to Henry A. Kissinger, the former Secretary of State; before him, William P. Bundy had served as an Assistant Secretary of State under President Lyndon B. Johnson.
But foreign policy heavyweights who write for the magazine say that Foreign Affairs has retained its seriousness and that Mr. Hoge has earned their respect. "In spite of the fact that it's a little more jazzy today, the content is excellent," said Zygmunt Nagorski, president of the Center for International Leadership, who initially accused Mr. Hoge in a letter of "transforming a Louis XIV wine bottle into a Coke bottle."
In trying to make Foreign Affairs more reader friendly, however, some say Mr. Hoge still has a way to go. "There is often a deadliness to the prose," said the editor of a scholarly journal who insisted on anonymity.
And although the magazine gets only 25 percent of its revenue from advertising, it remains a tough sell on Madison Avenue. "The big agencies are very afraid of Foreign Affairs," said a former advertising executive for Foreign Affairs who refused to be identified. "A lot of media buyers are just out of college. They tend to look at it as assignments they once had and hated."
Moreover, at a time of Web sites and sound bites, one cannot help questioning the very survival of Foreign Affairs. To which experts say the public ignores matters international at its peril.
"I don't think there's been a time since the 1930's when Americans have been more indifferent to foreign policy, but that doesn't make Foreign Affairs any less important, any less good, any less necessary," Mr. Rieff said. "If Foreign Affairs folds, then that will be the kind of proof positive that this has become a truly irresponsible country."

HEADLINE: It Isn't Just Big Brother Who Is Watching

BYLINE: By BILL DEDMAN 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Jan. 11

 BODY:
When Cameron Barrett taught his co-workers to surf the World Wide Web, he never imagined what they would do with their new skills.
At a small advertising agency in rural Traverse City, Mich., Mr. Barrett, 24, was hired to teach some fortysomething female employees how to view and produce Web pages for clients. 
 In a class, he mentioned that he wrote fiction. So several employees visited his Internet home page (www.camworld.com), where they found short stories about sex, humor, violence and estrangement: an unnamed narrator describes killing everyone in a stark white room; a snowman accidentally knocks his wife's head off during lovemaking. ("In the morning, the sun came out and that was the last he ever saw of his wife or children again.")
After six weeks on the job, Mr. Barrett was dismissed. "The owner told me that two of my female co-workers read my fiction, got scared, shared it with their husbands and then went to my boss and said, 'Either he goes or we go,' " Mr. Barrett said. "They thought the character in the stories was me."
Now Mr. Barrett, a specialist in new media, stocks groceries on the night shift for $8 an hour, with no benefits. His former employer declined to comment.
And though there hardly seems to be a national epidemic of people losing their jobs over their home pages, Cameron Barrett is not the only person in this situation. Workers in Virginia, Texas and California said they had been dismissed or disciplined for the content of their Web pages, even though the pages are maintained with their own computers, time and money. Others said they had been ordered to modify their pages.
Both groups said a common directive was to remove any reference to where they work, making it difficult to publish a resume on line.
The dismissals are legal, experts in employment law say. Nearly every American is an "at will" employee, meaning "you can be fired for a good reason, a bad reason or no reason at all," said Mayer G. Freed, a professor of law at Northwestern University. "People say, 'There ought to be a law.' But there's not. There would be a huge cost to the economy if every firing would be the subject of a lawsuit."
Although they may not break new legal ground, the Web page cases do reveal a culture clash between longstanding, unwritten standards of corporate propriety and the new perspective of Web-savvy employees -- the kind of workers that companies are clamoring for.
The employees, often right out of college or high school, are accustomed to publishing on line their narcissistic scrapbooks of highly personal poetry, photos, and a lot of thinking out loud about sex and religion and sex and politics and sex.
Many of these younger workers have been on the Internet for years, comfortably saying to strangers what they would not say to a friend at work. But now millions of people have personal (but public) Web pages -- America Online, the largest on-line service, is adding more than 100,000 a month -- while still more of their co-workers and managers and parents are learning to find those pages on the Web.
In Virginia, more than opinion is revealed on the Web site of Lizz Sommerfield, 23, a 1996 Yale graduate and Internet engineer who goes by "SexyChyck." As SexyChyck, Ms. Sommerfield poses for 1,000 visitors a week in her leopard print underwear. It's not the full-blown nakedness the Web is known for, but she does carry ads for hard-core pornographic sites. "I do it because it's fun," Ms. Sommerfield said. "I like the attention."
Her previous employer, a mom-and-pop publishing company, ordered her to remove any reference to the company, and she did, but felt violated and quit. "It upset me that someone was spending so much time digging into my personal Web site and reading everything and giving it to my boss," Ms. Sommerfield said. "I didn't feel like my boss needed to act like my parents."
She quickly was hired at a large company with many Internet-savvy employees. She showed the site to her employer, who also asked her not to use the company's name. "Almost everybody at the company has a personal Web page," she said. "I am the only person who has been told, 'You may not tell anybody where you work.' I feel kind of bad crumbling under society's foot."
Companies are accustomed to dismissing employees for misuse of computers at work. Many company policies restrict use of E-mail, limit access to offensive Web sites and prohibit disclosure of confidential information. Few policies, if any, directly address personal Web pages.
The closest corollaries in the non-computer world involve dismissals ofworkers for posing nude in magazines like Playboy. Such dismissals -- of New York City police officers, Wall Street stockbrokers, even a ball girl for the Chicago Cubs -- have not been successfully challenged.
"It's an interesting dilemma," said Linnea B. McCord, a professor of business law at Pepperdine University. "Tampering in people's privacy goes pretty far and gives the employer a lot of power. But if you can be fired for bad judgment for sitting in a public place in your underwear, you can be fired for sitting in your underwear on the Internet."
Employees have some safety only if they are dismissed for a reason relating to race, sex, religion, ethnicity, age or disability. Some employees are protected by union or personal contracts that limit reasons for dismissal. State and Federal laws protect whistle-blowers, those who refuse to do something illegal, and workers who file claims for workers' compensation. Some local ordinances prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.
There are no applicable First Amendment free-speech protections -- the First Amendment restricts the actions of government, not business.
The employees dismissed in the Web page cases are still free to speak out about their cases -- and they do on their Web pages. Mr. Barrett and Ms. Sommerfield say they do not want to embarrass their employers. They only want to warn others what could happen.
They were bothered, they say, more by Web illiteracy than by corporate heavy-handedness. Particularly galling is the prohibition against including Web links to their employers on their pages As Ms. Sommerfield explained: "They said, 'Well, we don't want to give anyone the possible impression that we endorse what's on there.' A link is not an endorsement."
Mr. Barrett still publishes fiction on the Web. But readers must agree to a contract. Among the terms:
"By reading Cameron Barrett's experimental fiction, I understand that I am able to tell the difference between Cameron Barrett's fictional characters and Cameron Barrett, the person."
"I am a sensible human being and do not think that Cameron Barrett is a psychopath who is going to hunt down and kill his co-workers."

HEADLINE: Internet Helps to Keep Silicon Valley in a Boom

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

 BODY:
Silicon Valley's booming economy continued at a near-record growth rate in 1997, adding 53,000 jobs and showing surprising strength in the manufacturing sector, which was once widely believed to be dispersing to low-cost labor regions around the world.
The strength of the nation's premier technology region was reported in an annual survey of the region's economic and social health issued yesterday by Joint Venture: Silicon Valley, a coalition of corporate and civic organizations. 
 The report showed that while growth began to slow in the second half of last year, the region's economy, which has long been marked by cycles of boom and bust, is in the midst of a sustained period of growth.
"Employment growth has outstripped labor supply since 1995," said Douglas Henton, president of Collaborative Economics, a Palo Alto, Calif., firm that prepared the report. "We're starting to wonder how the valley can continue to maintain this growth rate."
The growth is being driven principally by the emergence of the Internet as a commercial force.
"We're still very much in the Internet era," Mr. Henton said.
The region now generates 40 percent of California's exports, despite having only about 10 percent of the state's population. In 1996, Silicon Valley surpassed Detroit as the nation's leading exporter, according to the study.
Silicon Valley was once largely limited to Santa Clara County, on the southwest side of the San Francisco Bay. But Joint Venture now defines the valley as an economic and cultural area bounded by San Mateo in the north, Gilroy in the south, Scotts Valley in the west and Fremont and Milpitas in the east.
The region covers about 1,500 square miles and has a population of 2.3 million according to Joint Venture's data. About 23 percent of its residents are foreign born, many of them drawn by high-tech jobs.
The valley is frequently held out as the archetype of the so-called "new economy," which is characterized by a highly skilled labor force.
The biggest job gains were reported in software, where there were 8,300 new jobs, outpacing computers-communications, which added 7,500 jobs.

Sure, They're Expensive, But the Picture Is Great
Offering the viewing audience its first good look at the future of television, the world's electronics manufacturers introduced high-definition production models at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nev., last week. Nearly all of the digital sets shown were large projection models rather than the "direct view" kind that use picture tubes, despite the fact that such televisions account for 90 percent of the market today. 
 The manufacturers conceded that the introductory models, at $5,000 to $10,000 or more a set, are expensive, but they said prices were likely to fall rapidly. Page D5.
 
Silicon Valley's Boom Stretches On
The economic boom in Silicon Valley roared ahead in 1997, as the region added 53,000 jobs and manufacturing remained strong. An annual survey of the region's economy, long marked by sharp boom-and-bust cycles, is in the midst of a sustained expansion. D4.

Web Pages Provoke Backlash
People in states from Virginia to California report that they have been dismissed from their jobs or disciplined for the content of personal home pages on the World Wide Web. Others say they have been ordered to modify their pages. Many are unhappy to find that such actions are perfectly legal. D5.

HEADLINE: TCI Seeks Variety in Software And Suppliers for TV Boxes

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF with GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

 BODY:
John C. Malone, the chairman of Tele-Communications Inc., believes he can succeed where his predecessors have failed.
With two deals announced at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nev., this weekend, Mr. Malone has disclosed a plan that is intended to rein in the Microsoft Corporation's power and simultaneously fuel the dynamic economic growth that the cable television industry has been seeking so eagerly. 
 By using Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Java programming language as a counterweight to a consumer version of Microsoft's Windows operating system, Mr. Malone is trying to relegate Microsoft to the same status as his other vendors.
Rather than letting Microsoft provide all of the software for his interactive cable network, Mr. Malone is trying to create a model that puts the various components of the set-top box in the hands of numerous different vendors, much as if the box were a faucet and he were parceling out to different vendors the handle, washer, filter and pipes that affect the flow of the water.
In this case, the water -- or programming -- is supposed to flow both ways, and needs a variety of software and hardware to do so. So Mr. Malone has created a "layer cake" business model in which each vendor provides only one piece of an integrated system that includes set-top box hardware, operating system software, the Java programming environment, software applications and a head-end server for distributing video and other digital content.
But it is a risky gamble.
Industry executives in Las Vegas this weekend said the cable industry infighting reminded them of the early days of the personal computer industry, where in 1981, I.B.M. initially offered PC buyers three competing operating systems: Microsoft's MS-DOS, the Digital Research Corporation's CP/M and UCSD Pascal.
In the PC industry, however, consumers quickly settled on the low-cost alternative. Because Microsoft's operating system was the least expensive option, it became a standard, attracting the widest selection of software applications.
Indeed, despite his efforts to create a more competitive marketplace, Mr. Malone may have repeated over the weekend the blunder made years ago by the International Business Machines Corporation.
"Think of this as a poker table where most of the chips say Windows and William Gates is now holding them," said Richard Doherty, president of Envisioneering Inc., an industry consulting firm in Seaford, N.Y. In Mr. Malone's vision of the future interactive cable industry, the line between traditional television channels and personal computer software applications will rapidly be blurred.
For example, while watching the History Channel, a television viewer will eventually be able to use a handheld clicker to select a character on the screen and call up a box with additional information via the Internet.
Because the new set-top boxes will actually be powerful computers, today's one-way channels will be complemented by the equivalent of personal computer programs that have been converted for the television screen, programs for bill paying, electronic mail or games.
Mr. Malone sees this as nirvana for the ambitious cable television industry, which has consistently promised new services, like home banking, that it has proven unable to deliver. He wants his company to collect a portion of each electronic transaction made over the new interactive set-top boxes that Tele-Communications will begin offering to consumers in 1999.
Tele-Communications is the nation's largest cable operator, with its boxes in 12 million of the nation's 65 million cable-equipped homes. The biggest, Time Warner Inc., is still in negotiations with a variety of potential suppliers for both software and hardware.
Microsoft last year invested $1 billion in another cable company, the Comcast Corporation. Brian L. Roberts, the president of Comcast, said over the weekend, "The industry has been searching for a new revenue stream for a number of years, and the prospect of this convergence is very promising."
Mr. Malone, who is eager to avoid total dependence on Microsoft, is using Sun's Java as an additional layer of software to offer more choices to software developers and an alternative to Microsoft.
The advantage of Java is that it permits software developers to write programs that can be run on many different types of computer hardware. That could be important if different and competing types of hardware are used in the set-top boxes distributed by the cable companies.
A second advantage of Java is its security design, which is better than most personal computer environments today. The language was created by Sun engineers specifically to thwart rogue programs like computer viruses and worms, which threaten computer networks.
Security is an important consideration if cable companies expect to gain the confidence of consumers they hope will do their banking, pay bills and shop via their television screens.
But the more software applications are running, the more memory the set-top box will need, and more memory costs more money.
On Saturday, Mr. Malone acknowledged that in order to run the Java alternative, it would be necessary to add memory chips to the set-top boxes. That, industry executives said, could end up consigning Sun to the same role as the losing personal computer operating systems in the early days of PC's.
People familiar with the cable agreement signed by Sun and Tele-Communications on Friday said that in order to avoid that Sun's chairman, Scott G. McNealy, had agreed to pay Tele-Communications the additional costs to insure that there is room for the Java standards.
Several company insiders said the payments could amount to as much as $10 to $12 a machine. Sun officials would not comment.
At the same time, Mr. Malone also said Saturday that Tele-Communications was continuing discussions with Microsoft on a possible $1 billion investment to help build an interactive television network more quickly.
One cable industry chief executive, who spoke on the condition that he remain anonymous, said the industry badly needs new sources of revenue and that at a practical level, it might be worth ceding domination to Microsoft if that would help add new revenue sources. "Cable has not had a big new product in years," he said. "We need the catalyst of Silicon Valley to move ahead."
At the same time, although the battle has now been joined, it is clearly not over. In addition to Microsoft and Sun, Oracle, Intel, I.B.M. and AT&T are all still jostling for a place at the table -- or inside the new digital set-top box.
Moreover, while Mr. Gates proposed a new computer-oriented digital television standard called HD0 in his speech at the Consumer Electronics Show on Saturday, the nation's television broadcasters have yet to settle on a standard.
And then of course there is the largest unanswered question: Do television viewers care about any of this?
The computer industry is betting heavily that consumers will be willing to open their wallets for these new services. However, with many American homes already paying $25 or more a month for cable, there is little evidence yet that they will be willing to foot the bill for the much-hyped interactive television of the future.

HEADLINE: Why Microsoft Is Taking a Hard Line With the Government

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR with JOHN MARKOFF 

 BODY:
The Microsoft Corporation's final chance to avoid being dragged into court by the United States Government came on Oct. 16, when the Justice Department summoned Microsoft's legal team to Washington. For 90 minutes the lawyers were interrogated by Joel I. Klein, the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division, and his staff.
The Microsoft team, led by William H. Neukom, senior vice president for law and corporate affairs, detailed the business and legal reasons for the company's requiring personal computer makers to ship its Internet browsing program as a condition of licensing its industry-standard Windows 95 operating system -- and why Microsoft was intent on continuing that practice. 
 "We thought we had given them a lot more to think about, that this was a complicated matter and that we had a strong legal position," Mr. Neukom recalled.
But to the Justice Department, the product bundling seemed a clear violation of Microsoft's 1995 consent decree with the Government, which prohibited tying the sale of one product to another.
Mr. Klein said he left the Oct. 16 meeting convinced that Microsoft would not budge and would not address the Government's concerns. Four days later, Attorney General Janet Reno, with Mr. Klein at her side, announced that the Government was suing Microsoft.
The Government's suit has escalated into a bitter battle -- and a bruising experience for the company. In recent weeks Microsoft, usually so sure footed, has appeared at times to be throwing a temper tantrum, picking fights with a Federal judge and the Justice Department.
Microsoft's combative stance has prompted a backlash in the industry, trade press and among computer users that even Microsoft executives acknowledge has blemished the company's good name. Last week, Microsoft executives softened their language, but did not change the company's position.
As the courtroom confrontation resumes tomorrow, the question remains: Why is Microsoft taking such a hard line?
To find the answer, go back to the summer of 1994, before the Internet was a household word, long before there was a market for browser software.
In 1994, after four years of Government scrutiny, Microsoft, the Justice Department and Europe's antitrust authorities were poring over a proposed consent decree that focused mainly on slightly altering Microsoft's licensing practices.
On July 13, 1994, Microsoft's legal team was in Washington going over the language of the decree. The draft of the settlement terms said that Microsoft was prohibited from tying the use of one of its products to another. But the provision in the decree included the qualification that "this shall not be construed to prohibit Microsoft from developing integrated products which offer technological advantages."
At 10:30 P.M., William H. Gates, the Microsoft chairman, called the company's general counsel, Mr. Neukom, and the head of the company's outside legal team, Richard J. Urowsky, a partner of the firm Sullivan & Cromwell, at a Washington hotel. Mr. Gates demanded that the last four words -- "which offer technological advantages" -- be stricken from the decree.
Mr. Gates, according to Mr. Urowsky's account in a court deposition, successfully insisted "that Microsoft would not accept any limitations on its right to design new products."
Microsoft sees its crusade in the current case not as arrogance, as its critics charge, but as an uncompromising defense of principle. It is saying that Microsoft and Microsoft alone should be the arbiter of what goes into its products, and how it defines an integrated product.
Microsoft insists that the Government's consent-decree case, though narrow in some respects, represents a challenge to the way it does business. At stake, Microsoft contends, is nothing less than who will control innovation in the economy -- entrepreneurial companies like Microsoft or Washington and the courts.
To the Justice Department, the case is not about innovation but about the abuse of market power. The heart of the suit, Government officials say, is that Microsoft's Windows operating system and its Internet browser, Explorer, are separate products. By forcing PC makers to bundle Explorer with Windows, they add, Microsoft is using its near-monopoly in operating-system software to restrict competition in the market for Internet browsing software, where its main competitor is the Netscape Communications Corporation.
"This portion of the consent decree adopts a basic antitrust principle," Mr. Klein, the antitrust chief, said. "It prohibits use of monopoly power to beat back a competitor."
In a temporary order on Dec. 11, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of the United States District Court in Washington agreed with the Government on that point. He also ordered the company to come up with a temporary plan for offering PC makers a choice of loading Windows onto their machines with Explorer or without Explorer. A final decision in the case is expected later this year.
Microsoft rivals cheered the December ruling, but it was seen mainly as a moral victory with little impact on the fortunes of the software powerhouse. Because PC makers get Explorer free, few, if any, would choose Windows without Explorer.
Microsoft's solution for complying with the judge's order -- offering Windows without Explorer, but only in an outdated version of Windows -- seemed designed to prove its point: Windows and Explorer have become a single integrated product.
Under Microsoft's reading of the consent decree, the company has the absolute right to declare Windows and Explorer an integrated product and market it as it sees fit.
"This is not about thumping Netscape on the head," Steven A. Ballmer, a Microsoft executive vice president, said. "This is really about the fundamental right to innovate."
Is Microsoft a relentless innovator or a modern monopolist? The current case will not settle that question, but in its thousands of pages of court filings, corporate documents and E-mail memos, it will add grist for both sides of that debate.
The court documents and interviews do clearly show that from drafting the language of the consent decree to responding to the rise of the Internet, Microsoft has kept one central objective in mind -- protecting and extending the reach of its Windows operating-system software, the corporation's crown jewel.
An operating-system program serves as the central nervous system of a computer. More than 80 percent of the world's personal computers run Microsoft's Windows, giving the company a leg up in new markets like Internet software. That is especially true if Microsoft decides, as it has with the browser, that what other companies are selling as a stand-alone product will be an "integrated feature" of Windows for which nothing extra is charged.
That kind of behavior presents a quandary for antitrust policy. The goal of antitrust is to safeguard competitive markets in the interests of consumer welfare. By pulling stand-alone programs into its operating system, Microsoft is giving computer users more product for less money -- a consumer benefit.
For nearly two decades, Microsoft has steadily added more and more to its program, from point-and-click icons to facsimile software. By bringing new features into its operating system, Microsoft has made computers more powerful and easier to use for millions of consumers.
But as its market power has increased over the years, Microsoft has been able to crush competitors -- eliminating competition and perhaps innovation, which could harm consumers. Microsoft can crimp competition with the same strategy it employs to help consumers. What were once separate products, markets and profitable businesses for other companies can be pulled in to become "features" of Microsoft's Windows operating program.
Once it determines that a new company is a threat, Microsoft can deploy its integration strategy with a vengeance. In September 1995, Paul Maritz, the executive in charge of Microsoft's operating-system business, met with executives of the Intel Corporation, the leading microchip maker. It was a month after Netscape had sold shares to the public and the Internet start-up was suddenly a hot company. When the discussion turned to Netscape, one Intel executive, who asked not to be identified, recalled Mr. Maritz saying: "We are going to cut off their air supply. Everything they're selling, we're going to give away for free."
Since August 1995, when Microsoft's Windows 95 was introduced, the Explorer browser has been both marketed as a separate product in retail stores and bundled onto the operating system by PC makers. Each new version of Explorer has been improved and more closely integrated -- sharing more and more programming files -- with the operating system.
An E-mail on Dec. 20, 1996, from Jim Allchin, a senior vice president, to Mr. Maritz, the operating-system executive, urged a hastening of that integration. "The current path is simply to copy everything Netscape does packaging and product wise," Mr. Allchin wrote. He added, "We should think first about an integrated solution -- that is our strength."
The Allchin memo is included in one of the Justice Department's court filings. Microsoft says the memo should be read mainly as a recommendation for improving Windows, which benefits users and Microsoft.
Microsoft's strategy has certainly pounded Netscape. Last week, the Internet pioneer announced that it would report a sizable loss for 1997.
Still, antitrust policy is not intended to protect companies but to protect economic and consumer welfare. Economists who study high-technology markets say the issues in the Microsoft case are complex.
"An operating system is an evolving creature, adding more features and functions over time," said Carl Shapiro, a professor of economics at the University of California at Berkeley and a former chief economist in the Justice Department's antitrust division. "But there is a problem if Microsoft can use its market power to stifle innovation because start-ups never really get a market test if they are killed in the crib before they become a core threat to Microsoft."

HEADLINE: Russia's Nuclear Temptation

 BODY:
The end of the cold war has produced an alarming nuclear irony. Russia is now more dependent on its nuclear weapons than ever and at the same time those weapons are more vulnerable. That increases the chances that in a severe crisis Moscow might consider using them. It is imperative for Washington to help reverse that trend, and President Clinton has the tools to do so, if he is willing to use them.
When the cold war ended, the Soviet Union had one of the largest land armies in the world, an abundance of conventional weapons and a nuclear strike force nearly equal to that of the United States. Since then, domestic politics, economic problems and general neglect of the military have left Russia with a hollow conventional force. As that force has deteriorated, Russian military planners have placed increased emphasis on nuclear weapons, which are less expensive to maintain. 
 But steeply declining defense budgets have left even some of those weapons dangerously exposed. Most Russian ballistic-missile submarines are kept in port because it costs less to keep them idle than to put them to sea. That makes it easier for another country to knock out Russia's submarine fleet. NATO's ill-advised expansion, if approved, will bring Western forces closer to the Russian border. While a NATO strike against Russian nuclear weapons now seems unimaginable, the psychology of vulnerability on the Russian side is real.
The Clinton Administration should act to defuse this growing nuclear risk. Progress in negotiating and ratifying new arms reduction treaties has slowed, held back in part by the opposition of Communists and nationalists in the Russian parliament and Republicans in the United States Senate. But Mr. Clinton and President Boris Yeltsin of Russia can move on their own to take off high alert some of the 3,000 nuclear warheads each side now has ready to fire at the other on short notice. George Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev took a similar step with nuclear bombers and missiles in 1991.
Such a decision would provide additional time for communication and diplomacy in a crisis. About a third of American warheads could now be taken off alert without risking national security. Russia can be expected to reciprocate. Specifically, Mr. Clinton could order the launch keys for part of the MX missile force removed. MX guidance systems could be taken out of the missiles and stored in their silos. Silos could even be covered with heavy objects that would have to be removed before launching.
Several of these ideas have been proposed by former Senator Sam Nunn and Bruce Blair of the Brookings Institution and are viewed favorably by American military planners. All that is needed now is for Mr. Clinton to take political leadership on this issue. Reducing Russia's reliance on nuclear weapons ought to be a concern of the highest order for the Clinton Administration.

HEADLINE: U.S. Officials Tackle Crisis In Indonesia

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, Jan. 11

 BODY:
With Asia's economic crisis threatening to set off political upheaval in Indonesia, a team of President Clinton's top aides arrived here this evening and immediately began searching for ways to stop the free fall of the region's currencies and stock markets.
The officials met tonight with one of Asia's senior leaders, Lee Kuan Yew, the founder of modern Singapore. Both American and Asian officials acknowledged that the potent mixture of Asia's continuing market panic and the sudden political uncertainties over the future of President Suharto of Indonesia will make the situation over the next several days particularly volatile. 
 "This began as an economic crisis, but now it is having political and social consequences that are increasingly difficult to contain," a senior adviser to President Clinton, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said in Washington before the delegation of officials from the Treasury, State and Defense Departments and the National Security Council was sent over the weekend.
"It has suddenly become an issue of stability and security," added the official, noting how the stock and currency markets were both triggering and responding to the political uncertainties.
A result is that an array of officials are rushing to Jakarta, Indonesia's capital, to assess President Suharto's economic intentions and his political future. The first to arrive was Stanley Fischer, the No. 2 official of the International Monetary Fund, which has made it clear that a $40 billion bailout program for Indonesia could be suspended if the country does not comply with its terms.
On Monday, the American delegation, led by Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, will fly to Jakarta to meet with Mr. Suharto and his economic officials. On Tuesday, they will be joined by Defense Secretary William S. Cohen, who is on a previously scheduled Pacific tour. The director general of the I.M.F., Michel Camdessus, is expected later in the week.
Tonight, after seeking Mr. Lee's assessment of events in Indonesia and elsewhere, Mr. Summers offered few specifics about what he would seek to accomplish in Jakarta.
"We are here on behalf of the President to consult with the countries in the region on economic policy," he said, measuring his words to keep from further roiling the markets, "and to urge sound policies that can promote confidence and stability."
Mr. Suharto is at the center of the concerns. Since taking power in 1965, he has governed the world's fourth most populous nation largely without challenge, enabling his children and friends to snap up the most lucrative of the country's huge infrastructure projects and export operations.
Despite the rampant corruption that has long made Indonesia an expensive place to do business, private investors and major companies poured billions of dollars into the country -- and into Suharto family enterprises -- viewing it as one of Asia's fastest growing and largest markets.
But economic crisis has resulted in a rapid turn of sentiment. And suddenly the ailing, 76-year-old leader is under pressure from three directions.
The markets battered Indonesia's currency with a fury last week, as investors sold it out of fear that the country's resistance to reforms dictated by the I.M.F. could lead to the failure of the October bailout plan.
The hemorrhaging of the currency, in turn, has greatly raised the probability that Indonesian companies could default on its foreign debt, which by most estimates is at least $80 billion. The weakness of the rupiah makes it far more difficult for Indonesian companies to pay back the loans. At current rates, repaying $1 of loan requires more than three times the amount of local currency than it did earlier this year.
The second pressure comes from the I.M.F. and foreign leaders. In a phone call to Mr. Suharto on Thursday, Mr. Clinton stressed the importance of restoring market confidence by enforcing Indonesia's commitments to the I.M.F. But that means enforcing austerity in a country that despite its remarkable growth, still suffers from considerable poverty. Mr. Suharto reportedly told Mr. Clinton that he would enact the reforms.
On Saturday night, according to Indonesian news reports, he ordered the cancellation of billions of dollars in projects, including three power plants and an airport. But there are growing doubts about whether he will follow through.
The third pressure comes as a growing number of Indonesians, including retired generals and few academics, are publicly calling for Mr. Suharto to step aside or designate a successor who could soon take over. Mr. Suharto faces re-election by a national assembly in March, which until a few weeks ago had appeared to be a perfunctory endorsement of his continued rule.
Many Asian officials say they believe that Mr. Suharto will remain in power. He still commands the loyalty of the military. And until now he has successfully kept a tight lid on dissent.
But Mr. Suharto was never challenged in part because of the country's spectacular economic growth. Now, with that growth severely in jeopardy, the country's best-known opposition leader, Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daughter of former President Sukarno, called over the weekend for Mr. Suharto to step down.
The issue of succession is clearly wrapped up in how investors view Indonesia as the markets reopen this week. Several major investors in Asia, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said were already looking past the Suharto era, and wondering whether his successor will end the era of crony capitalism.
In his conversation with Mr. Suharto -- which American officials will only describe in scant detail -- Mr. Clinton reportedly raised the recent example of the bailout of South Korea. In that case, the country's new leader, Kim Dae Jung, who will be inaugurated as President next month, reluctantly endorsed the I.M.F.'s dictates.
Korean banks are now working out an agreement with foreign lenders, including banking giants like Citibank and J. P. Morgan -- to delay repayment of their debts and perhaps to issue bonds, guaranteed by the Government, to restore a flow of capital into South Korea. Its currency has finally stabilized.
But working out a similar solution in Indonesia would be tricky at best. Until a successor is designated, the markets cannot be confident that Mr. Suharto's promises will bind the next government. And Indonesia's debts are spread out over hundreds of private companies, vastly complicating negotiations. Moreover, the United States would be likely to object to giving those debts a Government guarantee because it would send a message to banks and private firms around the world that they can expect to be saved from bad investment decisions if a country faces economic meltdown.
"This has to be all new to Suharto," a senior Singaporean official said tonight. "This is a man who spent his whole life learning how to control a powerful army. And suddenly he, and his army, are trying to figure out how the markets would react to this decision or that."
The American interests in this process are complex. Clearly American officials are loath to be seen meddling in the delicate issue of Indonesian succession, for fear of a ring of colonialism. Mr. Summers is expected to limit his discussion carefully to fiscal policy and economic management. But American officials do not want to lead Mr. Suharto into economic retrenchment decisions that could result in violence on the streets.
And there are effects beyond Indonesia. The Asian market declines last week were staggering, as stocks in Hong Kong fell 14 percent more, Singapore declined by 23 percent, and Manila by 19 percent. Wall Street reacted, in part due to Indonesia, with a fall of 2.9 percent on Friday, and American officials are clearly concerned about the possibility that a general loss of market confidence would spread to Tokyo and the United States.
But there are other concerns about contagion as well. The currency devaluations here could force other countries -- especially China -- to think about devaluing their currencies so that their products remain competitive in export markets. Mr. Summers is likely to travel to Beijing this week to seek renewed assurances from the Chinese authorities that they will not take that course. And the general decline in the value of assets around Asia reduces the ability of countries in the region to invest elsewhere, potentially triggering deeper economic troubles.

HEADLINE: Budget in the Black: A Dream Come True Proves to Be Somewhat Hard to Cope With

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11

 BODY:
What seemed like a pipe dream only months ago now seems all but assured: the Federal Government will start running budget surpluses soon, perhaps even this year, leaving Congress and the White House with a windfall on their hands.
As they begin debating what to do with it, they face three basic choices. 
 They can begin paying off some of the $5 trillion in debt the nation has accumulated, most of it in the last 15 years. They can cut taxes.
Or they can increase spending on any one of a number of popular and pet programs.
Each choice has its advocates, and the most likely outcome will no doubt involve choosing something from each category. It remains unclear whether any surpluses would be substantial enough for major initiatives of any type, and whether the new fiscal flexibility could survive an economic downturn.
But both parties in Congress and the Clinton Administration are gearing up for a battle over how to allocate whatever money does become available, marshalling arguments based on ideology, economics and tactical politics that could help define the nation's priorities as it enters a new century.
The debate centers on how best to insure continued economic growth. Economists generally advocate a reduction in the national debt as the best of the choices that are available, because by reducing the Government's need for credit it would help reduce interest rates and make more money available for private investment in new factories, technologies and other things that help spur growth.
Republicans and Democrats agree, up to a point. But after a decade in which their partisan agendas have been restricted by the deficit, both parties are reviving old priorities and they are maneuvering for advantage in this year's midterm Congressional election and the 2000 Presidential race.
Many Democrats argue that the nation is in need of investment in education, health care, poverty-fighting programs and other social needs. Without such expenditures, they say, a large portion of the population will continue to lose out in today's highly competitive economy, and the middle class will continue to lose ground, creating strains that will ultimately undermine the nation's prosperity.
"There are times when sound social investments bring you back more than reducing your debt," said Representative Charles B. Rangel, the Manhattan Democrat, who supports more spending on education, urban transportation and job training, among other programs.
But most Republicans object to additional spending, both on the grounds that it is an inefficient way of promoting economic growth and because it runs counter to their efforts to shrink the size and influence of the Federal Government.
Republicans, therefore, tend to support tax cuts for ideological as well as economic reasons -- and to see great political appeal in tax cuts, too.
"It's about downsizing the size and power of Washington and upsizing the power of individual Americans by leaving more money in their pockets to use as they see fit," said Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.
To economists, the big question is whether anything will be left for reducing the debt after the politicians finish their grab for spending increases and tax cuts.
"The economics are totally disconnected from the politics," said Robert D. Reischauer, the former director of the Congressional Budget Office, who is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. "The economics of paying down the debt is that it produces distant and diffuse benefits to the economy, which to incumbent politicians have virtually no salience."
 
Paying Off the Debt
The national debt stood at $204 billion at the end of World War II. It took 30 years for the debt to double. Then it doubled again between 1975 and 1982. In the last 15 years it has grown more than four-fold as the Federal Government financed the huge budget deficits it began running early in the Reagan Administration by issuing more and more Treasury bonds.
Eliminating the annual budget deficit means the nation is no longer adding to its total debt. Net interest payments on the debt are one of the biggest Federal expenditures, amounting to $244 billion last year, 15.2 percent of all Government spending and an amount equal to 3.1 percent of the nation's total economic output.
The debt will decline only if Washington makes a policy decision to begin paying it off by applying any surpluses to it.
One of the most compelling reasons to do so is that reducing the debt would give the nation additional financial flexibility in dealing with the likelihood that the approaching retirement of the baby boom generation, starting around 2010, will exhaust the money set aside to pay Social Security and Medicare benefits.
Some analysts think the benefits of reducing the debt, while real, are overstated. They say that as the economy expands, the debt load and the accompanying interest payments will become a correspondingly lesser drag on growth. As a percentage of total economic activity, the Government's net interest payments will be cut in half over the next decade, to 1.5 percent of gross domestic product, the Congressional Budget Office said last week.
Recent polls have suggested that voters see reducing the debt as the best use for any surplus, and many members of both parties in Congress say dealing with the debt has to be at least a part of any approach they adopt. But even advocates of putting debt-reduction first said it would be a struggle to keep the demand for tax cuts and more spending at bay.
"It will be difficult," said Representative Jim Bunning, a Republican from Kentucky. "The political dynamic will have to become secondary to what's best for the country."
 
Cutting Taxes
The economic benefits of tax cuts have been heatedly debated since President Reagan adopted the supply-side argument that broad-based tax reductions would more than pay for themselves by unleashing a wave of additional growth.
Democrats, in addition to many economists, have long derided the supply-side approach, blaming it for leading the nation down the path of huge deficits in the first place.
"I will do everything I can to prevent anyone from using a projected future surplus as a pretext for returning to the failed policies of the past," President Clinton bluntly warned Republicans last week not to push for a big tax reduction.
But the enthusiasm for tax cutting remains undiminished among most Republicans. Even if they make only modest claims for the economic benefits, they see tax cuts as a way to starve and therefore shrink the Federal Government, an ideological goal toward which they have made little progress.
"I have no philosophical objection to reducing the debt," said Daniel J. Mitchell, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group that is influential among Republicans. "I just don't think you get nearly the return you get from tax relief."
Americans are less taxed than citizens of almost any other nation. Nonetheless, by one important measure -- Federal revenues as a percentage of total economic output, a figure that stands at about 19.9 percent -- the nation's tax burden is hovering close to its post-World War II high. Republicans said that figure alone, which is partly a result of the tax increases of 1990 and 1993 and partly a result of strong economic growth, is justification for more tax cuts now.
But even the most ardent tax cutters agree that some tax cuts are better than others when it comes to increasing growth. Speaker Newt Gingrich is among those who have been calling in recent weeks for any surplus to be applied to an across-the-board reduction in income tax rates or another form of broad-based tax relief.
Conservatives want to avoid settling for narrow tax reductions of the type that the Clinton Administration and the Republican leaders endorsed last year. They included steps like a $500-a-child tax credit that do little or nothing to spur more savings and investment.
The tax-cutting proposal with the most momentum is to reduce or eliminate the so-called marriage penalty. This penalty leaves many married couples in which both partners work with higher tax bills than if they were unmarried. But it would cost the Treasury at least $20 billion a year in foregone revenue to eliminate the marriage penalty completely.
 
Spending More
As with the question of the economic impact of tax cuts, there is a raging debate about the economic payoff from many types of Government spending. But as with tax cuts, there is inexorable political pressure, even among some Republicans, for more spending.
In the last week alone, Mr. Clinton proposed big increases for the Medicare system of health insurance for the elderly and of Federal support for child care. Mr. Clinton structured his proposals in a way that he said was fiscally responsible: the proposals to make Medicare and other health coverage more readily available to people as young as 55 would be largely paid for by those who benefit from them. But Republicans said he was already indulging the Democratic penchant for ever-larger Government programs that ultimately will prove wasteful and inefficient and put the taxpayers on the hook.
Proponents of increased spending on education, health coverage, child care, job training and other social needs say the country cannot afford not to invest more in those areas -- and that every dollar spent on improving school systems, for example, or preventing drug abuse, saves much more down the road by keeping people out of jail and off welfare.
The American people "know that throwing money at problems doesn't work," said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat. "But they also know that nothing substantial can happen on the cheap, and they understand the urgency of investing in the future."
The other category of spending already being hotly debated in Congress is building roads, bridges and mass transit systems. Proponents, and there are many in both parties, say such projects improve the nation's economic strength by creating jobs and allowing goods and people to move around more quickly.
Opponents say such projects are often little more than old-fashioned pork, something concrete for elected representatives to bring home to their constituents.

HEADLINE: Eldon W. Lyle, 89, a Fighter Of Diseases Affecting Roses

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Eldon W. Lyle, a noted plant pathologist of Tyler, the East Texas town known as a center of rose research, died on Dec. 28 at a Tyler nursing home. He was 89 and had lived in Tyler most of his life.
Dr. Lyle earned international renown in the fight against diseases affecting the rose, like black spot, a devastating fungus that causes leaves to wither and drop and keeps the plants from flowering. He discovered how to control the pest over 50 years ago when he devised a carefully planned pattern of spraying the rose crops that form a mainstay of Tyler's agriculture and the whole region's economy. 
 He also raised the fame of Tyler roses by developing a cutting method that aids the formation of each rose bush and makes it hardy enough to withstand winter's cold. Heading the Texas Rose Research Foundation in Tyler, he was closely associated for many years with the annual Texas Rose Festival and Tyler Rose Park, a huge municipal garden and tourist attraction.
His advice to rose fanciers battling black spot fungus was a steady program of spraying every week to 10 days, from the time the first rose leaf buds break to early fall. His recipe was one-half tablespoon of either maneb (Manzate) or folpet (Phaltan) combined with one-half tablespoon of benomyl (Benlate) to one gallon of water.
"Roses don't need a lot of care," he often said. "They need a little on a regular basis."
A native of Corpus Christi, Tex., he graduated from Oregon State University and began to study roses at Cornell University, where he wrote a dissertation on the control of black spot disease for his doctorate in 1937.
He arrived in Tyler at a time when leading growers were raising their sights from the local market to the state and national levels and started testing their rootstocks scientifically. Hired as a plant pathologist, Dr. Lyle helped breed various varieties as he investigated hybrids, genetic composition, cultural adaptation and fertilizer needs to achieve maximum results.
He expected to conduct full-time research under field conditions to control rust disease and red spider mites and instead found a black spot epidemic raging throughout the region's rose industry. It left bushes weak and market stocks poor, but he managed within three years to control the disease with commercially produced dust fungicides, assuring him a national reputation.
Twice widowed, Dr. Lyle leaves no immediate survivors.

HEADLINE: Chorus of Politicians, Executives and Experts Is Unable to Agree on the Key

 BODY:
Following are comments from politicians, educators, economists and cultural leaders about the projected budget surpluses and what to do with the money. 

Rep. Bill Archer
Republican of Texas
Chairman, Ways and Means Committee
 I'm conservative in almost all things, but I'm especially conservative when it comes to money. I believe the American people are overtaxed. I believe the Government spends too much. And I believe the Government can't solve people's problems by taking taxes from one group of citizens in order to give it to another group of citizens
Yes, I believe in a balanced budget and I fought hard to enact one. I'm proud of that. But I'm not a conservative because I believe in a balanced budget. I'm conservative because I believe that a smaller government with less power means greater freedom and more opportunity for the American people
It isn't about accounting and it isn't about numbers. It's about our values, our principles, our beliefs. It's about downsizing the size and power of Washington and upsizing the power of individual Americans by leaving more money in their pockets to use as they see fit.
When the day of a surplus arrives, and it will thanks to a Republican Congress, I believe it should be used to reduce the tax burden on the American people and to pay down our national debt.
 
Hugo F. Sonnenschein
President, University of Chicago
 University of Chicago economist Gary Becker won the Nobel Prize in 1992 for successfully showing that "human capital" of the kind created by education is as vital as financial and physical capital to a prosperous economy.
Investments in human capital are the best ways to guarantee that tomorrow's workers will compete successfully in the increasingly competitive global economy. And the success of the American people in the decades ahead depends on the quality of the human capital they bring to the global economic table.
Chicago economist Kevin Murphy has shown that the average college graduate earns twice as much over a lifetime as the average high school graduate. They are twice as productive and will pay significantly higher taxes.
The best, most fundamental education provides students access to the entire world of knowledge and teaches a profound appreciation for the possibilities of human achievement.
Such education creates citizens who will help lead our debates about issues from human cloning to the role of government in social welfare to the importance of the exploration and colonization of space.
There is one more way in which education adds value to society: by training the scientists and scholars who create the innovation -- in science, technology, medicine, business -- that in turn drives our economic growth.
 
Priscilla Lisicich
Executive Director
Safe Streets Campaign, Tacoma, Wash.
 The most important thing I think we need to do is to keep mobilizing the people in our communities to stop violence and substance abuse.
I think we need to free the funds up to come right to the local level. A second arena where I think we need funding is for creating more job and job-training opportunities for our young people as well as for people in disenfranchised communities.
I would like to see more energy focused on building stronger support for education. We need to provide more fiscal support for our communities to provide good schooling and the support systems, insuring a curriculum is available and that teachers receive the kind of training they need to help build young people to be successful in today's economic community.
I also think that we need to provide a focus on rebuilding or improving transportation systems in this nation.
When I think about quality of life, we need health systems, we need to address a national health plan, we need to be able to support particularly our children and insure their healthy future.
I would look to see us reverse the trend on building more jails and we need to invest in prevention and building opportunities for people in communities rather than continuing to incarcerate.
 
Mayor Richard M. Daley
Democrat of Chicago
 I would spend the money in the three areas that are central to the continued revival of our big cities, and of the nation as a whole: education, drug abuse and job training.
In Chicago, we're determined that we have to improve the public schools to give our young people a chance at a decent life and to encourage the middle class to remain in the city. It means spending money to repair and renovate school buildings and to add summer school classes and early childhood programs.
Drugs are the source of many of the evils of our society. They ruin lives, they breed crime, they destroy neighborhoods and they tear families apart. If we could sharply reduce the amount of illegal drugs in our society, we would solve a lot of society's problems.
Finally, the Federal Government could spend some money to strengthen the links between the educational system and the world of work. We need to work with the schools, community colleges, employers and the unions in a coordinated effort to improve job-training programs.
We should start by making sure our young people are prepared to become productive, responsible, caring members of society. That means they have to be well-educated, drug-free and job-ready.
 
Senator Pete V. Domenici
Republican of New Mexico
Chairman, Senate Budget Committee
 After nearly 30 years of deficit spending, news of a black-ink budget is obviously welcome. But as we enter this new era we should be careful to do no harm.
First, the Congressional Budget Office forecast still projects a slight deficit for the current year, and smaller deficits for the next two years. It is not until 2001 that the surplus amounts to much -- $14 billion, growing to $69 billion in 2002. Indeed, over the next five years a vast sum of $73 billion is expected to accumulate.
Over the same period, Federal spending will exceed $8.8 trillion. Therefore, this $73 billion surplus is less than eight-tenths of 1 percent of the Federal spending expected over these next five years. Not a lot of running room for those who have begun to lay claim to it, and certainly well within the range of estimating errors.
Therefore, we should first apply a portion of any surplus to shoring up our Social Security and Medicare systems. Second, I would favor applying a portion of the surplus to a modified marriage-penalty fix in the Federal tax code. And finally I would consider applying some portion toward living up to the Federal Government's prior commitments -- but do not make more commitments until the ones we already have are addressed. Here I'm talking about national parks and Federal infrastructure commitments.
 
Rep. Richard A. Gephardt
Democrat of Missouri
House Minority Leader
 Being from Missouri, I have a "show me" approach to surplus spending -- show me the surplus and then we'll talk about how to spend it. After a lot of sacrifice and discipline, we have put the economy on the right track and essentially balanced the budget. What a wasted effort this would be if we immediately returned to the failed policies of the 1980's that put us in the hole we've been trying to dig our way out of ever since.
In my view, the goal in any budget and spending equation is, How do we keep the economy growing at a high rate? Higher growth means better jobs, higher wages, a higher standard of living and lower deficits. If a high, sustained rate of economic growth is the goal, then every spare dollar should be plowed into the things that grow the economy -- education, child care, Social Security and middle-income tax relief.
Middle income taxpayers made the biggest sacrifices in order to balance the budget. It is those people, together with the President and Congressional Democrats who made the hard decisions, who should decide how best to spend any deficit cutting dividends. The benefit of this dividend, therefore, should be spent on those who made the greatest sacrifice.
The Republican leaders in Congress are the last people who ought to have a say in how any surplus gets spent. They, after all, opposed the budgets in 1990 and 1993 that brought this deficit to the point of producing a surplus.
 
Robert Hormats
Vice Chairman
Goldman Sachs International
 My initial view is that we should avoid a bidding war among politicians to spend a budget surplus that we are not sure we have, and if we have it we are not sure how long it's going to last. And the trouble is when you start deciding how to spend something like this there is a tendency for politicians to get carried away attempting to curry public favor by large spending increases or large tax cuts which could erode any surplus very quickly.
The best investment in the future is to pay down the national debt, or slow its growth, which reduces the future interest-burden on our children and enhances future growth prospects.
If, after a couple of years, we have a substantial surplus we might use some of the money to provide incentives for individuals to establish private retirement accounts to supplement Social Security. That would go hand-in-glove with the idea of meaningful Social Security reform, which would improve the prospects for retirees to have higher income in their old age without increasing payroll taxes on the next generation of workers to pay those benefits.
The remaining portion should address educational needs, because an investment in human capital will provide higher returns to the country and improve prospects for continued productivity, which in turn will strengthen revenues in future years helping to insure continued surpluses.
 
Nathan Leventhal
President, Lincoln Center
I would think that a very modest portion of any budget surplus, should there be one, should be used to restore funding for the nation's cultural institutions, so that each American would be contributing 62 cents rather than the current 38 cents. That would be about $75 million restored through the N.E.A.
On another subject, the concept of substantial Federal support through revenue sharing or other devices to our major urban areas seems to have slipped from the agendas of some of our political leaders. This would be an appropriate time to take steps to reinforce the economic strength of all of our major cities and industrial areas.
Two specific areas would be a revival of Federal support for new construction of housing, which has virtually evaporated in the last decade. Secondly, greatly increased aid to all levels of public education, including public universities, which are struggling throughout the country to keep their tuition affordable to the increasingly lower-income populations that they are serving.
 
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Democrat of New York
The current economic expansion is now in its seventh year and shows no signs of ending. The unemployment rate is below 5 percent for the first time in 24 years and the current official inflation rate -- which almost certainly is overstated -- is about 2 percent. The deficit has been reduced from $290 billion in fiscal year 1992 to $22 billion in fiscal year 1997, or less than three-tenths of 1 percent of our G.D.P.
In no small part, this present moment can be attributed to the budget policies included in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. The tax increases and spending cuts imposed then were not popular but they were absolutely imperative. As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee at the time, I can assure you that we knew what we were doing. We had to put a stop to the ever-growing and unprecedented level of deficit spending and we did just that.
We have dealt with the deficit, now is the time to deal with the debt.
In 10 to 15 years, the full impact of the baby boomers will appear in the budget. Now is not the time to be cutting taxes. Now is the time to save. It often helps in these matters to have a goal. I suggest that we undertake to reduce the national debt by $1 trillion over the next 10 years. It is doable, and it must be done.

HEADLINE: Governor Proposes Surplus Be Used for Construction

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 11

 BODY:
With New York State's coffers flush with unexpected revenue, Gov. George E. Pataki proposed today paying for a variety of construction projects with $425 million in cash, rather than adding to the state's $30 billion debt by issuing bonds.
In a preview of the 1998-99 budget he plans to release later this month, Mr. Pataki said the state would save $260 million in interest by paying for the projects with cash from the 1998 budget surplus, rather than borrowing to finance them. 
 The construction projects include renovating Rich Stadium in Buffalo and building a sports complex on Coney Island.
"I am proposing that we use this opportunity to do the fiscally responsible thing by paying down the state's debt," Mr. Pataki said in a written statement. "Others may look at surpluses as a reason to increase spending, but I am here to insure that they do not."
Mr. Pataki's proposal helps set the stage for what is almost certain to be a fierce election-year battle over how to spend a budget surplus that is estimated to be as much as $2 billion. Earlier this week, the Governor proposed accelerating property-tax reductions the Legislature adopted last year, saying he wanted to put money back into New Yorkers' pockets sooner than the legislation required.
Mr. Pataki's latest proposal drew a lukewarm response from Mr. Pataki's main rival in the Legislature, Sheldon Silver, the Speaker of the Democratic-led Assembly.
Patricia Lynch, a spokeswoman for Mr. Silver, said the Speaker would not take a position on the Governor's plan until he had the chance to see whether the budget Mr. Pataki proposes this month provides enough money to pay for schools, day care for needy families and other programs that Mr. Silver supports. "We're adopting a wait-and-see approach," Ms. Lynch said.
The Governor's plan is intended to change the way the state pays for the so-called Community Enhancement Facility Assistance Program that he and the Legislature enacted last year. The program allows the state to issue 30-year bonds to pay for a variety of economic development projects.
But the program has been widely criticized by representatives of anti-tax groups and other fiscally conservative organizations. Because the program allows the Governor and legislative leaders to spend $425 million on projects of their choosing, the critics contend, it essentially amounts to a blank check they can use on pork-barrel projects.
Brian Backstrom, the vice president of Change-NY, a conservative group that has been a strong ally of the Governor, described Mr. Pataki's proposal today as an empty gesture.
Mr. Backstrom said that while he supported the idea of retiring state debt, he did not believe it was appropriate for the Governor and legislative leaders to have "a slush fund" that allows them to dole out pork-barrel projects.
"Normally, pay as you go is far more responsible than borrowing and adding to the state's enormous debt load," he said. "But this proposal is nothing but putting a new wrapper on a completely unnecessary and irresponsible slush fund. You can dress it up however you want, but this program belongs in the garbage can."

HEADLINE: U.S. to Back Baltic Membership In NATO, but Not Anytime Soon

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11

 BODY:
The United States and the three Baltic nations will sign a formal charter on Friday that explicitly supports efforts by Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to become members of NATO, American officials say.
The document, called the Charter of Partnership, does not promise them membership -- a commitment that Washington could not make on its own in any case. Instead, it is a formal statement of common interests and common goals that future American administrations will find difficult to dilute. 
 Without pledging the United States to the defense of the Baltic countries, the charter embodies a moral and political commitment to the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the three tiny lands, whose quest for independence sped the disintegration of the Soviet Union.
President Clinton will be joined at a White House signing ceremony by Presidents Lennart Meri of Estonia, Guntis Ulmanis of Latvia and Algirdas Brazauskas of Lithuania.
For the Clinton Administration, this public display of commitment will be the most formal demonstration to date that America's plans for Europe's future are not limited to the first round of NATO expansion.
Even that first round remains controversial. The Senate has yet to approve the admission of Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. A vote on that issue is expected in the spring.
The Baltic charter has involved a year of diplomatic work, with negotiators cognizant not only of Moscow's concerns, but also of those of skeptical NATO allies and American Senators.
"The Russian response so far," one senior Administration official said, "has been surprisingly quiet and matter-of-fact." American officials have begun to brief Russian officials here on the text of the charter and expect a more negative public reaction after the signing on Friday.
In its most contentious and intensely negotiated section, the charter promises the Baltic nations that Washington will do everything possible to get them ready to join NATO and supports their efforts to do so.
But there is significant opposition to their membership on political and military grounds, and officials say the issue is not likely to surface during the presidencies of Mr. Clinton and Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia.
America's NATO allies insisted that the charter make clear, as it now does in its final version, that any Baltic membership of NATO will depend not only on each country's readiness to join, but also on NATO's determination that including any Baltic country "would serve the overall strategic interests of the alliance."
A senior diplomat from a NATO country said: "Membership must not be just in the interest of the Baltic states. It must be in NATO's interests." Had Washington pushed Baltic membership now, he said, it would have seriously worsened larger European strategic interests.
While NATO countries have different views, the diplomat said, membership will depend in large part on how well the Baltic countries themselves improve their relations with Russia. That, he predicted, will take a decade or longer.
That is why some critics suspect that the White House wants to have it both ways.
Holding a highly public event with the Baltic leaders and emphasizing that NATO's door remains open is important for American principles as well as for domestic political concerns.
Refusing to recognize the Soviet annexation of the Baltic nations, which followed the Nazi-Soviet pact of 1939, Washington preserved their embassies here. And since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Washington has worked hard to get Russian troops out of the Baltics, to promote economic and political stability and to help give the Baltic countries some idea of how to defend themselves.
At the same time, Washington can rely on NATO allies to insure that Baltic membership in the alliance is put off for the foreseeable future.
Ojars Kalnins, Latvia's Ambassador to Washington, sees the charter as "a culmination of the last six years of the extraordinary U.S.-Baltic relationship since independence."
"This is a historic document in which we assert common interests, values and a common vision of the further development of the European continent, including our integration into that new European security and economic structure," Mr. Kalnins said.
While the Baltic countries would have liked more specifics on NATO membership, he said, they did not expect it.
The charter also establishes some new, concrete institutions: a four-party "partnership commission" of the United States and the Baltic nations, to be chaired by Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott; working groups on economic development to be formed by Washington and each Baltic state, to be chaired on the American side by Under Secretary of State Stuart Eizenstat, and similar working groups, already established, on defense issues.
This charter, a senior American official said, is intended to give each Baltic nation "a perspective for the future, to reassure them they are not being forgotten and that they have a level playing field for future NATO expansion."
"We want to show them that they are part of the vision and part of the process," the official said.
That vision, he explained, is that of a fully integrated Europe, where the Baltic nations can become members of all European and trans-Atlantic institutions, including the European Union, NATO and the World Trade Organization.
The Americans have told the Baltic Governments explicitly not to expect to be part of any second round of NATO expansion. Washington would like to see such a round in 1999, assuming that the Senate and the legislatures of other NATO members first approve membership for the Poles, Hungarians and Czechs.
Washington has told Baltic leaders that their own eventual membership is a political and moral "litmus test" of the American strategy for a peaceful and democratic Europe, "whole and free." But at the same time, there is concern over antagonizing Russia.
Paul A. Goble, a Baltic expert and former State Department official who works at Radio Free Europe/ Radio Liberty, said, "In some sense, while I want the Balts in NATO now, I believe that they will not enter NATO until Russia stops fearing NATO" -- in other words, until NATO is so transformed that it is more of an organization of cooperative security than of collective defense.
"I think that's sooner than many think," he said. "NATO is already being transformed, and I tell the Balts that the NATO they get into will not be the NATO they expect to join."
In a speech at Stanford University in September, Mr. Talbott described the American task as balancing the anxieties of the Baltic countries about Russia, combined with their aspirations to join NATO, against "Russia's fear and loathing at the prospect."
"Quite bluntly, Russians need to get over their neuralgia on this subject," Mr. Talbott said. "They need to stop looking at the Baltic region as a pathway for foreign armies or as a buffer zone."
The three Baltic Presidents will take part in a series of public meetings and events in Washington and New York, including meetings with nearly every senior American Cabinet secretary and with think tanks, banks and businessmen.
President Brazauskas of Lithuania is now a lame duck with the recent election of Valdas Adamkus, who was born in Lithuania but fled as a teen-ager as the country was forcibly absorbed into the Soviet Union. He went to the United States, retiring in 1996 as a top administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency's Chicago region. His American ties are a sensitive subject for Moscow.
American and NATO officials have carefully monitored Russian reaction. In the last year, American officials and officials of NATO countries say, Moscow has sharply toned down its pressure on and statements about Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania and is concentrating more on regional economic cooperation with all countries on the Baltic Sea.
Moscow originally insisted on an American commitment that the Baltic states would never join NATO. But in his summit meeting in Helsinki in March 1997 with Mr. Yeltsin, Mr. Clinton refused to rule out Baltic membership. Mr. Yeltsin proved willing to sign a formal agreement of understanding with NATO anyway, breaking the logjam of Russian opposition to the first round of NATO expansion, which was announced in Madrid in July.
The Russians, through Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin in July and Mr. Yeltsin in late October and again last month in Stockholm, have moved to offer the Baltic nations "joint security guarantees," alongside Western and NATO guarantees, so long as the states agree not to join NATO, remaining neutral on the model of Finland.
Russia is also offering normalization of relations and an end to border disputes, including tacit permission, if any were needed, for Baltic countries to join the European Union or any non-NATO organization.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright has told Foreign Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov of Russia that Washington and Moscow should simply agree to disagree on the possibility of future Baltic membership in NATO and work together instead on regional economic and environmental cooperation.

HEADLINE: Crisis in Asia Brings World To New York

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
The Italian, British, Japanese and American investment bankers who met last week around a conference table at Citicorp headquarters in Manhattan had at least two things in common: an abiding interest in the economic crisis in Asia, and the belief that the most logical place to talk about it was New York City.
That New York would become central to the Asian story, economists and international trade experts say, was neither obvious nor predictable. Banks in Japan and in Europe have more exposure to debt from troubled countries like South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia -- and thus more at stake -- than banks in the United States. The International Monetary Fund, which is supervising the bailouts in those countries, is based in Washington. 
 Yet the Asian crisis, at least for now, is not being principally addressed in Tokyo or London or Hong Kong, but in the corporate canyons of Manhattan. The strength of the dollar and the stability of the United States economy, the longstanding political relationships between the United States and Far Eastern nations, the staggering profitability of America's biggest investment houses -- almost all based in New York -- have contributed to a single, shared global insight: New York is where the money is.
The decline of world political tensions since the end of the cold war has been a factor as well, experts say. A crisis that would once have raised the highest levels of alert within the State Department has been seen, in the 1990's, as simply an economic crisis and therefore more the concern of the capitalists in New York than the diplomats in Washington.
"The money is being more controlled now, and it's being controlled by New York," said Anthony P. DeCaro, an independent international trade consultant who has worked with many Asian governments.
There is a certain sweet irony for the city in all this. For many years, New York has supposedly been doomed to a future as one among many financial capitals. But the Asian crisis has highlighted the continued importance of a central economic hub. Government officials in South Korea could have gone anywhere for their economic hired guns, but they chose New York-based Goldman, Sachs & Company and Salomon Smith Barney as their official advisers.
In the world of international finance, all eyes are on New York. "We're in a very unusual position," said Jeff Bahrenburg, a global strategist and first vice president at Merrill Lynch. Eventually, he said, other financial centers and nations, especially Japan, will return to greater influence. "But in the interim it's going to force companies to come here to get financing," he said. "New York will be the main center."
Economists and financial experts are divided about how long this New York minute may last or what it might mean for the city, mainly because Asia's turmoil is so volatile and its implications so mixed.
Some banks based in New York, for example, have already been hurt by bad Asian loans. Sales to investors of international stocks and mutual funds are expected to decline, and tourism from Asia to New York has slowed to a trickle. Companies that import goods from South Korea have been hit by crosscurrents: Imports are cheaper because of the currency changes, but Korean producers are more anxious for payment. At the same time, their sales here have shrunk because their customers, Korean immigrants, have been sending millions of dollars to relatives back home.
But the major potential effects on the city, the experts say, are all yet to come -- it is simply too early in a rapidly evolving story to detect them. The important thing, they say, is that New York is in the game and calling the plays.
In the 1980's, for example, when New York similarly became a center for working through a debt crisis in Latin America, it took years for the effects to emerge fully, but they were profound. Many of the foreign banks and securities companies that gradually entered the city to be closer to the Latin American action stayed when it was over. New York's role as a center of what came to be called emerging market investing grew partly from the Latin American experience, said Lawrence R. Uhlick, the executive director of the Institute of International Bankers, a trade group based in New York.
With Asia, the current theme is caution. Few economists are predicting dire effects for the United States or New York as its money capital -- at least at this stage -- but hardly anyone is expecting an employment boom either, except perhaps in the rarefied realm of international traders and analysts. If the crisis can be contained and resolved, however, the long-term benefits to the city will be huge as market barriers are dropped and New York becomes identified as a portal to their entry.
Some firms may get a windfall from the billions of dollars in fees that are expected from bond sales, restructured debts and rewritten legal trade agreements. For example, Coudert Brothers, a law firm based in New York and specializing in international trade, has already seen an increase in business, mainly from export and import contracts that have suddenly had to be amended.
The volatility of the world's money has also increased activity at currency trading desks, where billions of dollars change hands on fractional changes in values. Opportunities have also emerged for companies with profits to invest. Merrill Lynch recently expanded its presence in Asia by buying some assets of a big Japanese investment house.
A World Trade Organization agreement signed last month in Geneva is expected to be particularly favorable for the city in the long run. Under the agreement, capital-starved Asian countries agreed to drop longstanding barriers to financial activity by foreign companies. The agreement, trade officials said, was a direct result of the Asian crisis, and will benefit the United States -- and thus New York as the national money capital -- for years to come.
"Of any region of the country, we are the ones who will benefit the most, because the preponderance of the corporations that will benefit are right here in New York," said Rae Rosen, the senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, referring to the trade agreement.
Although consumers in Asia are expected to buy fewer imported goods in the short term, the effect will likely bypass the New York region, where exports to Asia are a small part of the economic mix.
And economists say imports from Asia -- made cheaper by the fall in Asian currency values -- will act like a lid on prices that will keep down inflation, and thus interest rates. That could lead to a boom in refinancing of debt that would further benefit New York.
"There is potential for a lot of positives," Richard K. Strauss, a financial services analyst at Goldman, Sachs who follows the securities industry. He said one of the main effects of the Asian crisis in the United States -- falling interest rates -- might cause a boom in refinancing, as companies try to get lower rates. That alone could create huge profits for the securities industry, he said.
But New York's moment as economic ringmaster cannot last, the experts say. Tokyo has been humbled for now, but its banks and other financial institutions are rebuilding their strength. London, Paris and Frankfurt have been focused on the internal issues surrounding European economic unification next year, but will probably also re-emerge more aggressively after that. A sale of new South Korean debt would undoubtedly have to involve all the world's markets to be successful, and that will also take the focus off New York.
The bankers who met at Citicorp agreed on Thursday to a crucial step on South Korea's debt -- allowing more time to repay up to $28 billion.
"I don't see 10 years from now New York being the undisputed global center of the world," said Mr. Bahrenburg at Merrill Lynch. The city may get some disproportionate benefits in the short term, he said. But in the long run, he said, "everyone will win," because a more equalized system of financial capitals means more customers for everybody.

HEADLINE: Casinos Paying Top Dollar To Coddle Elite Gamblers

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Nev.

 BODY:
It was past midnight at the Mirage Casino and Resort, and the actor Bruce Willis was sitting at a blackjack table, an unlit cigar between his teeth, drinking watermelon juice made especially for him and wagering more than $200,000 an hour. With $8,000 riding on one hand, Mr. Willis was dealt an ace and a 10. He slapped the winning cards down on the felt table. "Look what I got," he bragged.
Relishing a lucky streak and a stack of more than $50,000 in winnings in front of him, Mr. Willis looked over at a group of friends at another reserved blackjack table, drinking free bottles of Louis Roederer Cristal and betting thousands of dollars each hand. Celebrating his good fortune, the movie star thrust his arms above his head, like a referee signaling a touchdown. 
 "Fran, give me a kiss," Mr. Willis said to his dealer, a friendly woman in her 40's who blushed and obliged, blowing a kiss.
With the competition for wealthy, high-stakes gamblers intensifying, casino operators like nothing better than to see some of their top customers, like Mr. Willis, the basketball star Dennis Rodman and the Australian media mogul Kerry Packer, wagering huge sums of money and having a good time doing it.
These men are members of an elite, a growing group of the highest of high rollers who once belonged exclusively to a handful of casinos but who are now being heavily recruited by casinos across the United States and around the world.
Although the spread of casinos has made gambling more accessible to average Americans and prompted companies to expand their use of slot machines, their buffet dinners and their theme-park-style attractions to lure middle-income customers, casinos are nevertheless spending more time and money than ever courting people like Mr. Willis, who is considered a premium player, and Mr. Packer, who is in a top tier of gamblers known as whales.
Premium players, who typically wager from $100,000 to $250,000 a visit, number in the thousands. But whales, who gamble more than $1 million a visit and who may have lines of credit up to $20 million and win up to $26 million in one visit to a casino, number only about 250 in the world, those who recruit them say.
The competition for the top high rollers is global, and because wealthy gamblers are also aggressively pursued by Asian and Australian casinos, American casinos "are trying to compete with these markets in a way that has never been seen before," said Robin M. Farley, a gaming industry analyst at BT Alex. Brown. "A lot of capital is being invested in high-end play."
Along Las Vegas Boulevard, temples of opulence are rising to attract wealthy gamblers. The Las Vegas Hilton recently spent $44 million to build three suites to house its biggest bettors, and Caesars Palace, another favorite of high rollers, spent $13 million on two luxury suites. Mirage Resorts recently spent an estimated $150 million on art, including paintings by Renoir, Monet, Cezanne, Van Gogh and Picasso. They hang behind the frosted-glass doors of the Mirage's high-stakes gambling room, but next year the company plans to move the paintings to the Bellagio, a $1.8 billion hotel and casino it is building to cater to big spenders.
Farther down the Las Vegas Strip, at the MGM Grand, a $700 million redevelopment project will include a building housing 30 private villas called the Mansion, where guests can step into a gigantic courtyard that appears to be outside but is actually enclosed under a climate-controlled dome. "Even the air they breathe will be exclusive," Ms. Farley said.
To stay close to some of the world's richest gamblers, major American casino companies have offices in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and Sao Paulo, Brazil.
Because so many high-stakes gamblers come from Asian countries, industry executives and Wall Street analysts are trying to gauge what effect Asia's deepening economic crisis will have on the casino business.
"What will happen to the high-roller business for which the casinos are gearing up?" Ms. Farley wrote in a research report. "Will the currency crisis beach the whales?"
Mark Juliano, the president of Caesars Atlantic City, said, "Anybody who tells you the economic crisis is not going to have an effect on their business has got to be kidding."
So far there are few signs that the competition for premium gamblers and whales is slowing. Well-paid marketing executives, or "player development" people, continue to travel around the world, calling on wealthy gamblers, offering them expensive gifts, corporate jets to fly them to the casinos, lavish accommodations, huge lines of credit for gambling and a discount on their losses. Once the gamblers are on the casino premises, 24-hour butlers are at their service, and personal hosts cater to their every need.
The places most frequented by whales and premium players in Las Vegas are the Mirage, the MGM Grand, Caesars Palace and the Las Vegas Hilton. The whales are not sighted in Atlantic City as often, but the Taj Mahal and Caesars are their preferred destinations there.
One of the most widely recognized and wealthiest whales in the world is Kerry Francis Bullmore Packer, the media tycoon and financier who is one of Australian's richest citizens. Mr. Packer did not respond to telephone calls to his office in Sydney.
Other well-known whales include members of Malaysia's Quek family, which has holdings in real estate, banking and manufacturing; the Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi, who, according to one casino executive, arrives in town with an entourage that includes his barber and masseuse; and the Sultan of Brunei, one of the world's richest men, who, a Las Vegas casino executive said, placed $250,000 chips all over a roulette table for each spin.
One American whom some industry executives include among the whales is Roger King, the chairman of King World Productions, which distributes syndicated television programs like "Oprah" and "Jeopardy." Mr. King is as well known around Atlantic City and Las Vegas for his antics as for his wagering. In 1993, according to a report by New Jersey casino regulators, after a night of gambling and drinking, Mr. King threw up at a casino bar, asked an employee to help him procure a prostitute and later accused employees of stealing his money. Mr. King declined to comment for this article.
A dealer sued Mr. King in 1987 after Mr. King had won $22,500 on a hand of baccarat. The dealer testified that Mr. King, in a fit of excitement, had hugged him and lifted him off the floor by his throat, holding him until others urged him to let go. The dealer won compensatory damages.
The ranks of premium players are much larger. Casino executives name Mr. Willis, the professional basketball players Charles Barkley and Mr. Rodman and the magazine publisher Larry Flynt. Although he may be classified only as a premium player, Mr. Flynt waded into whale territory when he gambled thousands of dollars a hand at blackjack for some 16 hours on a visit to the Las Vegas Hilton, Ralph Priola, an assistant manager at the hotel, said.
Everything the top gamblers receive is complimentary, and few requests are out of the question. Whether it is Chateau Petrus 1982 or Chateau Lafite-Rothschild 1961 -- both sell for thousands of dollars a bottle -- hotel and casino employees comply.
Sometimes the requests are unreasonable or illegal, like procuring prostitutes or drugs, or break local gaming regulations, like setting up a private room for gambling. "We've had people ask for things that we just won't do," said Mr. Juliano, the president of Caesars Atlantic City. But one executive at a major casino in Las Vegas recounted an occasion in recent weeks when hotel employees had to devise a system of code words to deliver dozens of prostitutes to the suite of one high roller. As the women arrived, "if he didn't like them, he'd give them $300 and send them away," said the executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "At one point, he had 30 women in his suite at one time."
All casinos that cater to high-end players have lavish suites available for their best players. The rooms are reserved exclusively for high rollers, and are rarely made available for rent. To receive an invitation to stay in the suites, "we like to see that you've had a million dollars circulating in the casino at one time," Mr. Priola said. He recalled that he had given a tour of the Hilton villas to Donald J. Trump, himself a casino developer. Mr. Trump walked through the smallest of the three villas -- 12,600 square feet of Italian marble, wall and ceiling murals, swimming pool, media room and three bathrooms with Jacuzzis and fireplaces -- and remarked, "The next time I'm out here, I'll have to stay here."
But, Mr. Priola pointed out, Mr. Trump is not a high roller: despite his wealth he would not be permitted to stay in the villas. "The bottom line is, if you don't generate enough credit as a player, even he wouldn't be able to stay here," Mr. Priola said. (Mr. Trump has high-roller suites at his Taj Mahal hotel and casino in Atlantic City.)
Although few in number, whales contribute significantly to a casino's revenues, since many of them have the potential to bet as much as $1 billion annually, industry experts say. The gamblers like anonymity, and casinos provide them with private planes, private hotel entrances, private elevators and gambling rooms away from the public and as close to private as the state allows.
A casino that caters to the top gamblers cannot be fainthearted. Although some whales play blackjack, the game of choice is baccarat, which has only a 1 percent advantage for the house, and the bets often climb as high as $250,000 a hand. A customer betting at this level can win millions on one visit, devastate the company's quarterly earnings and make shareholders cringe. But the casino that can sustain such short-term losses knows that the customer will be back, and over time, the house's advantage will prevail.
A gambler with a $1 million line of credit receives $100,000 to bet with upon arrival. And if that gambler loses $1 million, the casino will discount the loss as much as 20 percent, leaving the customer owing $800,000. The reason for such generosity is clear. Industry analysts estimate total worldwide annual revenues from high-roller play to be about $3 billion.
By providing amenities and services to the small number of whales around the world, casinos are making a relatively safe bet that while they may not trap the gamblers with regularity, they are most certain to make their properties more attractive to the midlevel players who contribute the largest percentage of revenues.
"A lot of this investment in high-end play improves play overall," Ms. Farley said. "The improved standards are a draw to other players."
As much as casinos relish the high rollers, doing business with them can have its pitfalls. When they win, the whales and premium players leave with the casino's money immediately. But when the high-rollers lose, casino operators sometimes have a difficult time collecting the debt. The credit that is extended to the top gamblers is about as binding as a gentleman's agreement, and bettors who wager millions of dollars can be excessive risk takers who eventually run out of money.
For all that they give to lure high rollers, casino companies can never be sure that their coveted catch will stay in the net. "The problem is they might not stay," said Marvin Roffman, a gaming industry analyst based in Philadelphia. "They'll check into the free hotel suite, take the free chauffeured car that the casino gives them, and go over to another casino."

To receive an invitation to stay, "We like to see that you've had a million dollars circulating in the casino at one time," said Ralph Priola, a hotel manager.

HEADLINE: Paul O'Leary, Economist, Is Dead at 96

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
Paul M. O'Leary, an economist who oversaw the rationing program during World War II, died Jan. 1 at the Kendal at Ithaca nursing home in Ithaca, N.Y. He was 96.
Dr. O'Leary served on the faculty of Cornell University from 1924 until 1967, taking several leaves to join other economists from Eastern universities in President Franklin D. Roosevelt's "brain trust." During the Depression he was an aide to the consumer advisory board of the National Recovery Administration and later was chief economic analyst for the Commerce Department. 
 His most prominent role, however, was running the rationing program as the deputy chief of the Office of Price Administration in the early years of World War II. Mr. O'Leary oversaw the distribution of the books of paper coupons required for purchases of fuel, food and other commodities. It was a job that forced Mr. O'Leary, described at the time as plain-spoken, to deny many people and industries the goods they wanted.
Faced with what he called a desperate situation in September 1942, Mr. O'Leary decreed that any apartment building or commercial building that could convert to burning coal had to do so to help ease the shortage of fuel oil to heat homes.
Later that year, he decided to ration coffee purchases to one pound every five weeks -- about one cup a day -- despite criticism that there was no need to allocate what was hardly a nutritional requirement.
"We're not making semi-moralistic distinctions between necessary foods and so-called luxury foods," he told The Associated Press in 1942. "We don't feel that it is our business to tell people what they should eat and drink."
In August 1943, Mr. O'Leary resigned after disputes with Prentiss M. Brown, the new head of the Office of Price Administration, who opposed the methods of the "professors and theorists" in the agency. Mr. Brown had dismissed John Kenneth Galbraith, the Harvard economics professor, who had been in charge of the agency's price-setting division.
Mr. O'Leary returned to Cornell, and in 1946 served as the first dean of its newly formed business school. In 1951, he became dean of the college of arts and sciences. In 1957, he returned to teaching and research in his specialty, American financial history.
Mr. O'Leary was born in Lawrenceville, Kan., and studied at the University of Kansas and Harvard before receiving a doctorate from Cornell in 1929. He was the widower of Harriet Barton O'Leary. He is survived by a brother, Theodore O'Leary of Shawnee Mission, Kan.

A Gandhi Steps Up in India
In the southern Indian town where Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated in 1991, his widow, Sonia, said she would "step forward" into the political life of the ailing Congress Party. With elections due soon, many think she will seek the Prime Minister's job. A1 

U.S. Delegation Goes to Asia
A team of President Clinton's top aides arrived in Singapore and met with local authorities to search for ways to stop the free falls of Southeast Asia's currencies and stock markets. They and other experts will meet later with President Suharto of Indonesia, whose reluctance to enact reforms has led to calls for his resignation. A6
 
Hong Kong Bank Shuts Doors
The largest investment bank in Asia outside Japan, Peregrine Investments Holdings, was forced to shut down today, the first major casualty of the economic crisis that has swept through the region and the first major bankruptcy in Hong Kong since the territory reverted to Chinese rule last July. Prices plunged on the Hong Kong stock market, with the Hang Seng market index falling nearly 10 percent immediately after trading began. A6
 
Chiapas Women Protest Army

Envoys Will Go to Algeria
Envoys from Canada and the Arab League are expected to arrive in Algiers today as part of stepped-up international efforts to reduce the violence in Algeria, where hundreds of civilians have been massacred in recent weeks. An armed group attacked the village of Sidi Hammed near Algiers late Sunday, wiping out "dozens of families," the newspaper Liberte reported today. The Government has blamed Islamic militants for the attacks. (Reuters)

Government Rejects Plea In Unabom Case
After a week in which Theodore J. Kaczynski reduced the Unabom case to chaos, a weekend review of a new offer of a guilty plea was rejected by the Justice Department because Mr. Kaczynski seemed to be trying to retain a chance at freedom, people close to the talks said. The talks showed that both sides in the trial were struggling to find a way to end what has become a public spectacle. A1
 
Reducing Drugs in Prison
President Clinton is expected to sign a directive today ordering the states to report the extent of drug use in prisons, which will be used to create a base figure that each state must improve upon before it can qualify for Federal money for prisons. The document reflects a belief within the Administration that crimping the supply of drugs in prison will cut the demand for them after the convicts are released. A1
 
A Choice Assignment
Congress and the White House have three basic choices in deciding what to with a Federal Government surplus that now seems almost assured: They can begin paying off some of the $5 trillion in debt the nation has accumulated. They can cut taxes. Or they can increase spending on any one of a number of popular and pet programs. Both parties in Congress and the Clinton Administration are preparing for a battle over how to allocate whatever money does become available, marshaling arguments based on ideology, economics and tactical politics.

School as a Means to an End
Students are increasingly disengaged and view education less as a vehicle to expand their minds and more as a means to increase their incomes, a survey of college freshmen shows. The annual nationwide poll shows that two suggested goals of education -- "to be very well off financially" and "to develop a meaningful philosophy of life" -- have switched places in the past three decades. Professors and administrators say it is not news to them. A14

HEADLINE: Amid Asian Turmoil, Bullish Forecast for New York City

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
The Asian economic crisis has created uncertainty and heightened volatility in many parts of the world, but not in New York City. Most economists say that 1998 will be much like 1997: steady, with job growth led by Wall Street, and a continued overall surge in tourism.
The economy, according to most forecasts, is expected to grow more slowly than last year, reflecting a slowing national growth rate. The New York City Office of Management and Budget, for example, expects the city to create about 31,000 new jobs, compared with 47,000 last year. State Comptroller H. Carl McCall's office has projected an increase of 37,000 new jobs for the city. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, slightly more optimistic, is predicting 40,000 new jobs. 
For the most part, the forecasters say, Asia's troubles will remain a distant cloud on the city's horizon. The number of tourists from the Far East is expected to remain depressed, but increasing numbers of visitors from other places, especially other areas of the United States, will offset the drop in Asian tourists. Decreased exports, as Asians reduce their foreign purchases, are expected to have only a minimal effect because exports to Asia are not a big part of the local economy. Employment in manufacturing and government will continue to decline, economists say, but the sharp drops of years past appear to be over.
On the other hand, the boom in tourism leaves little room for growth. A study by PKF Consulting, which tracks the hotel industry, said that the number of hotel night stays in the city would remain flat, because at 83 percent capacity, the city's hotel rooms are for practical purposes all booked up.

HEADLINE: Northern New York Battles Ice Damage

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY 

DATELINE: WATERTOWN, N.Y., Jan. 11

 BODY:
The people who live in this old mill town do not flinch when a foot of snow falls overnight, or when the mercury plunges below zero, or when the bitter winds whip off Lake Ontario. Everyone remembers the blizzard of '77, when the snow drifts touched the roofs of the old frame houses on Rutland Street. This is not a town for soft people.
But even the hardiest souls find themselves astonished at the scope of damage wrought by the huge ice storm that has paralyzed much of upstate New York and parts of New England and Canada. Heavy ice has splintered thousands of trees and downed thousands of power lines upstate. The precipitation, combined with snow melt, has pushed the Black River and other tributaries to record crests, flooding low-lying areas that include hundreds of houses in places like Watertown and Carthage. 
 The immense upstate counties that run along Lake Ontario and the Canadian border are largely without electrical power. Full repairs could take a month, or longer. Officials at the Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation say that much of the power system must be rebuilt.
"It looks like a B-52 made a practice run," said Trooper R. A. Amyot of the state police. "Things are down all over the place."
Today, though, as chalky flakes of snow fell on Watertown, local officials found reasons for optimism. Most main roads were passable thanks to a melt on Saturday. And today's original forecast of a foot of snow and temperatures in the single digits proved too extreme. Only about four inches of snow accumulated and temperatures remained in the 20's. This allowed the nearly 3,000 Niagara Mohawk emergency workers to hurriedly begin restoring power lines and repairing transformers. But they hoped that electricity could be returned to parts of Watertown by Monday.
"We've faced many, many emergencies," said James Cosgrove, a Niagara Mohawk spokesman, "but nothing of this magnitude. These people are hurting." Mr. Cosgrove said Niagara Mohawk attempted to dispatch six helicopters to fully assess damages, but the snowfall and gray skies forced the company to cancel the trips.
In other parts of the country, the storm caused floods across the South and spread thick, clinging ice across the Northeast and the eastern third of Canada. At least five deaths were blamed on the storm in Canada, as well as three in Maine and one in New York.
In southeastern Canada, some 11,000 Canadian Army troops were helping in the effort to restore power to 900,000 households without electricity today. Officials said parts of Montreal could be without power for two weeks.
Utility officials estimated that 229,000 homes and businesses still had no electricity today in Maine, with 41,000 blacked out in New Hampshire and 36,000 in Vermont. Niagara Mohawk officials estimated that 300,000 people across upstate New York remained without power. Gov. George E. Pataki today asked President Clinton to make Lewis the sixth upstate county to be declared a Federal disaster area. On Saturday, Mr. Clinton named Jefferson, St. Lawrence, Franklin, Clinton and Essex Counties as disaster areas.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency has established a disaster field office in Albany. Nearly 5,000 state workers in a dozen agencies are involved in storm relief, including 2,288 National Guard soldiers.
Fire, police and emergency workers rumbled up Interstate 81 early today. Food, bottled water, scores of power generators and other supplies also poured in, though more is needed. The New York City Fire Department dispatched its urban search and rescue team of 11 vehicles, 21 firefighters and two emergency medical technicians.
Bob Hagemann, the Jefferson County Administrator in Watertown, said the lighter snowfall today was a relief but he worried that any amount of snow could cover downed power lines. "We're tremendously concerned about public safety and that people are going to come across live wires," Mr. Hagemann said.
The brunt of the storm hit Wednesday night, and it continued until early Friday, stretching across New York roughly from Watertown through the Adirondacks to Glens Falls. Usually, the North Country would be blanketed in snow by now, but mild winter temperatures meant that this storm's heavy precipitation fell as ice, not snow. The ice coated trees and power lines, weighing them down and allowing heavy winds to tear them apart. In Watertown, the trees on the town square were splintered with huge branches strewn among downed power lines.
Many people warmed their homes with emergency generators or wood stoves or fireplaces. But thousands of others fled to shelters. Mr. Pataki said the total number of people in upstate shelters was 9,031, including 1,200 people in SUNY Potsdam.
In Jefferson County, which has a population of 110,000 people, more than 2,100 people are staying in 40 shelters set up in schools and firehouses. Nearly 300 people have sought refuge inside Watertown High School, and some have been there since Thursday.
Amal Shata took her two small children and her elderly mother, Zeze Salmon, who recently joined the family from Egypt. "My Mom just came last year, and she is shocked," Ms. Shata said. "It was very, very scary."
Mona Henry took her two sons on Saturday afternoon after her youngest, Richard, 2, developed an ear infection from sleeping in their unheated house. "I don't have the money to buy a generator or a kerosene lantern, so I'll wait for the power to come on," Ms. Henry said. Like others, she said she realized that her family may be stuck inside the shelter for the rest of the week.
Across the street at Kinney Drugs, two pharmacists, Ruth Ellen Wickwire and James Peters, filled prescriptions by the light of a battery-operated lantern. Mr. Peters said he was able to stay at his rural home outside Watertown because his wife had driven to Rochester to purchase a 5,000-watt generator.
Mr. Peters said he had collected rainwater from a tub outside, then heated it on a wood stove for a bath. Ms. Wickwire said she and her sister were making do with a kerosene heater and a fireplace.
Waiting for a prescription, a nun, Sister Carol, said 40 sisters and 10 others were huddled at the Sisters of St. Joseph Mother House. She said they were keeping warm with a generator and passing the time playing cards and board games.
"We're praying for all of those who are not as fortunate as we are," Sister Carol said. "If there is anybody who is cold, they're welcome to come to the Mother House."
After using an emergency generator for two days, Watertown's largest hospital, Samaritan Medical Center, suddenly found itself in a crisis at 7:20 this morning. A hospital spokesman, Timothy Gleason, said the generator collapsed from strain, leaving Samaritan without power for seven minutes. In the intensive care unit, nurses manually pumped air for patients on ventilators. A backup generator eventually restored some power.
"Until we get back to full power," Mr. Gleason said, "it's still a real tense situation."
At 3:30 P.M., the hospital regained full power when Niagara Mohawk ran a special electric line.
Despite the strain, 12 babies were born on Thursday and Friday at Samaritan, including Ryan Caldwell. Ryan's father, Eric Caldwell, cleared fallen branches from the driveway on Thursday to drive his wife, Paula, to the hospital. Then Mr. Caldwell spent Saturday in Syracuse buying a generator so the family could return home today.
The practical problems that lie ahead for people in Watertown and throughout the North Country are enormous. Since the banks -- and automated teller machines -- are closed, many people are running out of cash. Jefferson County's 1,000 employees were unable to pick up their paychecks on Thursday. What stores opened today dealt mostly in cash, though there were many examples of generosity. Scott Gray, owner of Gray's Flower Shop, arrived at Samaritan Medical Center with a box of free candles. Mr. Gray estimated that he had distributed thousands of free candles.
"I don't have the heart to sit there and make money off someone's hardship," he said.
The Watertown Police, however, reported a handful of attempted robberies on Saturday night in the town's darkened business district. Mr. Hagemann, the County Administrator, said the long-term effect of this storm would not be known for some time. "It will have a tremendous economic impact," he predicted. "Businesses have been down since Wednesday or Thursday."

HEADLINE: In South Korea, A Prudent Bailout;
What to Do Next

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Lawrence B. Lindsey (Op-Ed, Jan. 6) hit the nail on the head about the danger of bailing out insolvent countries. Since the Mexican rescue, the message has been clear: imprudent investments will be backstopped by Uncle Sam, so swing for the fence. 
 The United States and the International Monetary Fund should announce that they are out of the bailout business as of Jan. 1, 2000. The United States should redirect part of its I.M.F. support to three to five newly chartered, competing bank insurance companies. These should be public-private entities that would offer insurance to foreign banks on market terms. The premiums would be paid in cash, and trading partners would be encouraged to adopt standards of disclosure like those in the United States.
Finally, I.M.F. funds should only be used to support our trading partners' transition from central banks to currency boards, which cannot create money and therefore excess liquidity. The program would encourage the growth of democracy, as cronyism and corruption would be exposed to the light of capitalism.

HEADLINE: ON PRO BASKETBALL;
Say This for Knicks: They're Never Boring

BYLINE: By Mike Wise 

 BODY:
There were 2.4 seconds left, and the Seattle SuperSonics were inbounding under their own basket with a chance to win the game. Gary Payton wanted to pass to Vin Baker, but Baker could not free himself from his defender. In one of those away-from-the-action snapshots, you could understand why.
Buck Williams, classy veteran, elder statesman and all-round swell guy, clenched Baker's jersey in his hands the way a pit bull might clench a rag doll with his teeth. 
 Dale Ellis became Payton's option, and John Starks was shadowing him as he launched the last errant shot of a wildly entertaining game last night at Madison Square Garden that was won, remarkably, by the Knicks, 92-91. "They grabbed my jersey earlier," Williams said. And then, perhaps speaking for his team, he added, "I did what I had to do."
When Coach Jeff Van Gundy said the Knicks had gone from the hunted to the hunter after Patrick Ewing was lost to injury, it sounded as if he had spent his down time watching B-movies. But after nine games without Ewing, whatever the Knicks are pulling from their Injured All-Star Survival Kit is working.
"I've been watching a lot of Classic Sports," Starks said, "and all those guys ever talk about is how mentally tough you got to be. I'm convinced that's all it is."
Can the Knicks keep this up? Who knows? They beat the team with the best record in the National Basketball Association last night after coming within a point of knocking off Chicago on Friday. They are 5-4 in Ewing's absence.
For the price of admission, you are no longer guaranteed a 7-foot superstar. But you do get to ride the Starks roller coaster, watch Williams and Charles Oakley lose layers of skin on their knees and occasionally see Larry Johnson and Allan Houston play like the next best things to franchise players.
"I know people don't think we have what it takes to keep playing like this, but that is irrelevant," Houston said. "Those people aren't playing."
Or as Oakley said succinctly, "We know what we have in our house."
The perception is that they cannot keep this up, that sooner rather than later their adrenaline rush will wear off and they will settle into a world of mediocrity. But the other side of that argument is this: The more they learn to play without Ewing and recognize their new roles, the more cohesive and confident the Knicks will become.
It is not a given, but games like last night's make you wonder. The atmosphere at tip-off had all the electricity of a zoning-ordinance meeting. Even with Payton and Baker and their marvelous team, whose record is 29-7, making their only trip to New York this season.
The Knicks had taken a 47-43 lead at the half, yet the building did not spring to life until near the end of the third quarter, when the Sonics seemed to be hampered by New York's defense. And then Starks, shooting 1 for 9 from the floor after three quarters, ignited his team. With fewer than four minutes left, he hit back-to-back 3-pointers that brought the crowd to its feet. The second shot, a 27-footer from the right wing with a man in his face, put New York ahead by 88-87.
After Ellis's miss at the end, the Knicks embraced. Starks began looking for Van Gundy. "Jeff! Jeff!" he yelled as the coach left the court. Van Gundy finally looked back. Starks clenched his fist and double-clutched twice.
About Van Gundy: masterful game plan. You give him a day to prepare for any team in the league, and the odds are his team will be in the game. He did a few things that surprised Seattle, one of which was to put the 6-foot-6-inch Houston on the 6-3 Payton.
It not only curbed Payton's effectiveness in the post, but also gave him longer arms to shoot over from the perimeter. Van Gundy also used Williams well, playing the 37-year-old power forward an economical 24 minutes when he could have been tempted to play him longer. He also told the Knicks to attack the basket, instead of settling for jump shots against Seattle's vaunted traps and double teams.
Van Gundy has a lot of detractors, but at least he listens to what they have to say. At one point, a talkative fan of about 12 behind the bench told Van Gundy to watch Oakley's defense on Ellis. "O.K., thanks," Van Gundy said. "I will."
The Knicks are making us reconsider what we think about them. They have more warts than the largest toad, more structural flaws than the Mir. But they do what they have to do with the tools they have.
After the madness was over and the antacids were gone, and the Knicks had treated their fans to a third improbable finish in five nights, Starks was asked if this crazy, up-and-down existence -- an existence that was the same when Ewing played -- would ever end.
"That's how it is in New York," he said. "That's how it always is."
There is a good chance the ride will not be as long this year. But here in the arena of America's Tums team, it is still as wild as ever.

HEADLINE: Think Globally, Focus Locally;
Seeking 'Cruising Speed', Washington Post Editors Prefer Stability to Sizzle

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9

 BODY:
It's not Ben Bradlee's Post anymore.
The Washington Post that Leonard Downie Jr., the executive editor, and Robert G. Kaiser, managing editor, inherited from Benjamin C. Bradlee seven years ago is bigger, richer, fatter and farther-reaching than ever. 
 But the oversized aura that once suffused The Post -- what Mr. Downie calls the "superman image" that pervaded the newsroom when Mr. Bradlee was pushing his reporters after scoops -- has yielded to a more subdued ambiance.
Mr. Kaiser's announcement last week that he intended to return to reporting after June 30 was a new turning point, and underscored the distance the paper has come under Mr. Bradlee's two proteges.
It is as if Mr. Downie and Mr. Kaiser had managed at last to achieve the "cruising speed" that Mr. Bradlee often said he admired in other great papers. Still, there are plenty of careful Post readers who wish their paper would do less cruising and more of the old hard-driving that gave The Post its reputation in the 1970's.
But Mr. Kaiser thinks the critics remember only the glory, not the gaffes; Watergate, and not the 1981 Pulitzer Prize the paper had to return after the reporter, Janet Cooke, confessed she had invented her story of an 8-year-old heroin user.
"The Post of 1974, for which I was the Moscow correspondent and which I dearly loved, was still Ben Bradlee's Post," Mr. Kaiser said, speaking of the Watergate year, "and Ben's notion of a newspaper was to have a lot of flash and spark and creativity, that it should contain something every day that would get everybody talking about The Post."
But, he added, "It was uneven as hell, and Janet Cooke was the ultimate expression of flash over control."
Mr. Kaiser, 54, said that a record of cool management was epitaph enough. "My proudest accomplishment is that I helped Len get through seven years with no disasters, no explosions," Mr. Kaiser said, "and I consider it our biggest compliment that we have survived the most charismatic newspaper editor in the United States of America."
Steadiness and sobriety, not sizzle, seem to be the watchwords as The Post moves forward. In an era of post-modernism, in the post-cold war world, the paper that Mr. Kaiser's successor will share with Mr. Downie has emerged as the post-Post.
The evidence of change is everywhere.
The Post's news staff now includes 660 full-time and 90 flex-time employees -- most of the latter are working mothers -- making it twice as big as in the Watergate year of 1974, when President Richard M. Nixon resigned as the scandal reached its apex. Then, The Post news staff numbered just 356. Most of the new slots and new space have been used to strengthen the coverage of the city and the surrounding suburbs -- some of the wealthiest areas in the country.
In those suburbs, The Post is king. The paper's weekday circulation is near a record high at 776,000, its 65 percent Sunday penetration of all households in the Washington area is deeper than that of all five leading New York metropolitan region papers combined. And the sheer square footage of newsprint devoted to news each week has increased by almost 50 percent.
To cap it all off, the stock price of its parent, the Washington Post Company, hit a record of $489.63 on December 15; it closed at $465.875 Friday. (In August of 1981, when the only major competitor of The Post, The Washington Star, closed, the Washington Post Company's stock price hovered between $25 and $30.)
The fruits of this economic success have been put back into coverage. In recent months, the paper has begun publishing suburban tabloids two and three times a week for distant counties from a ring of new suburban bureaus, using 30 new reporters, editors and photographers.
Perhaps because the changes have been so sweeping, when the paper's top editors and its publisher, Donald E. Graham, talk about what they have done, they tend to talk more about reach than reporting.
"If you drive 50 miles west of the District of Columbia you end up in a place called Fauquier County, Va., where 47 percent of all adults read The Washington Post on Sundays," said Mr. Graham, 52, who is also president of the Post Company, when asked to describe what his paper had accomplished.
"And if you drive 50 miles east to St. Mary's County, Md., you end up in a place where 40 percent of all adults read The Post," he added.
What is missing in this inventory of success are accounts of the articles themselves. Even readers who love The Post complain that while the paper delivers the news with unstinting depth and breadth, it rarely surprises.
"Their definition of news is more conventional than that of The Los Angeles Times or The New York Times," said Thomas B. Rosenstiel, a former media critic for The Los Angeles Times and now director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism, a media watchdog group chiefly financed by the Pew Charitable Trusts.
"It's more institutional, more process oriented," Mr. Rosenstiel said. "Is that necessarily because they're in Washington and government is the dominant local industry? Or is it because they are operating according to conventions?"
While the paper pays close attention to the processes of government, its management is also closely focused on the newsroom staff. In particular, newsroom managers have made a concerted effort to increase the number of black, Hispanic and Asian journalists.
The effort came at a price. Tensions over race and careers were brought roughly to the surface two years ago, when an article in The New Republic portrayed The Post as a caldron of racial anger, with white staff members blaming minority preferences for stunting their careers, and blacks charging that their work was being held to a higher standard.
Despite some factual errors, Mr. Downie said, the piece hit home. "It reflected reality because we have surfaced those tensions more than any other paper has," he said. "If you don't surface those tensions then people suffer in silence, and when you surface them it creates some discomfort."
At the moment, 14 percent of the newsroom staff is made up of minority journalists; the average for newspapers over all is 11 percent.
But the increasing diversity of the staff has not always salved often- brittle relations between the paper and the city's black communities.
Marion S. Barry Jr., the District of Columbia's charismatic but troubled black Mayor, who was re-elected in 1994 after serving a prison term for misdemeanor cocaine possession, criticizes The Post with thinly veiled racial allusions.
"The Post is obsessed with trying to get me out of office, or keep me from running for office," Mr. Barry said in a statement in response to a request for comment. "It clouds the news objectives and the more they do that the more people see them for what they really are up to."
Mr. Barry's ire notwithstanding, The Post has made coverage of the daily life, achievements and culture of Washington's diverse black community staple fare.
Its efforts have not always won it praise. Ronald Walters, professor of government and politics at the University of Maryland, noted that "They still focus on the worst news coming out of the District and all the criminal justice issues." Although, he adds, "Every now and then, good stories come out of their metro section. . ."
The paper's coverage of the nation and the world has also expanded: since 1974, the number of Post foreign bureaus has gone to 20 from 11 -- the newest is a bureau in West Africa -- and the number of national bureaus has gone to six from two.
Asked about articles, Mr. Kaiser picked a few favorites: David Hoffman's 16-part series on the new Moscow elite last year; Kevin Sullivan's interview, published Friday, with President-elect Kim Dae Jung of South Korea -- a first for a Western paper, he said -- and Mr. Woodward's coverage of Vice President Al Gore's use of a White House phone to raise money for the 1996 Presidential campaign.
Some readers try to explain what is missing from The Post today by pointing to the death last year of Ann Devroy, the paper's formidable White House correspondent who routinely produced 300 articles a year, many of them exclusive reports that made reporters and politicians all around Washington take notice.
Dick Morris, the former political adviser to President Clinton, likened the 1996 Presidential campaign, with Ms. Devroy absent, to "playing the Yankees without Mickey Mantle."
Mr. Graham said that Mr. Downie would select Mr. Kaiser's replacement from within The Post newsroom. The process is expected to take several weeks.
Newsroom handicappers have already drawn up a list of potential successors to Mr. Kaiser, including Karen DeYoung, 48, the assistant managing editor for national news; David Ignatius, 47, the assistant managing editor for financial news, and Milton Coleman, 51, the deputy managing editor.
Some of the developments that will influence the decision involve yet more big changes on the horizon for The Post. Later this year, a new $250 million printing and distribution plant in College Park, Md., will open, allowing a redesigned Post to print color on all section fronts and print three separate zoned sections each day for suburban readers.
For all its reputation as a paper of Capitol Hill and the Federal encampments downtown, The Post is overwhelmingly a suburban paper, with 80 percent of its sales going to readers outside the District. (The Post, Mr. Graham and Mr. Downie separately pointed out, has the largest circulation of any newspaper in Maryland or Virginia.)
 Its reach is a matter of particular pride to Mr. Graham, whose desk is adorned with a flimsy flier from a newspaper vending machine. "Still 25 cents," it says. Mr. Graham keeps the sign as a reminder that The Post's unusually low price -- most big-city dailies charge 50 cents or more -- is part of what makes it a paper for everyone in the Washington metropolitan area, and that its enviable market dominance is confirmed each day when half of the 1.4 million households in the Washington area buy the paper.
"Here's a statistic I like," Mr. Graham said in an interview. "This morning we sold more papers in a market with four million people than The New York Times sold in an area with 14 million." (While The Times's daily circulation is 1,074,741, just 670,000 of those papers circulate in the New York metropolitan region.)
So the paper is sitting on financial, if not emotional, heights. "I think this is a good time to take stock," Mr. Downie said of his process of choosing a new managing editor by leaving the field open at the outset. "Seven years of Bob and Len is ending and we are beginning a new period, with new presses and new projects, and I need to make sure I'm not overlooking anybody."

HEADLINE: First Steps to Reclaim Streets Are Precise, Joyful, Loud

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
The sound of drums echoed through the streets, signifying the hope and renewal of one north-central Philadelphia neighborhood devastated by lost work, poverty and drugs.
Inside the rowhouse on 23d Street where she has lived for 63 years, Alice Barry, 81, put down her sewing and pulled back her curtains. "There goes my children," said Mrs. Barry, who had stitched their first uniforms four years ago. 
 Vicki Thompson, 40, heard the familiar drumbeat in her office in the community center that used to be a Roman Catholic rectory, just up the block from Mrs. Barry. "It's a different noise," Ms. Thompson said. "Years ago it was gunshots."
She hollered out the window: "Go, Foot Stompers! Go, Foot Stompers!"
On the street, Audra Holbrook, 11 years old and all legs, was leading the girls, high stepping in her red and white pleated skirt and white boots with red plumes. LaMark Shorts, 17, the captain of the boys, brought up the rear, the drummers marching tall, pounding out their message: The North Philadelphia Foot Stompers have arrived.
Up and down the block one recent morning, people went to their windows and doorways to soak up the energy of their own drill team, 16 girls and 7 boys, more welcome than any fancy parade. They were practicing, marching through the neighborhood's past and its unfolding future, past abandoned buildings and newly renovated brick rowhouses, past vegetable and flower gardens that will bloom come spring in what used to be vacant lots prowled by drug dealers and prostitutes.
"The neighborhood is rising," said Helen Brown, 56, who kept house for a rich family on Society Hill for years, and went home at night to fight to hold her battered block of 23d Street together so it could rise again.
Nothing symbolizes the rebirth more vividly than the Foot Stompers, not just a drill team, but the heartbeat of the emerging 33-block north-central Philadelphia neighborhood known as St. Elizabeth's-Diamond Street. The story of the Foot Stompers reflects the rebuilding that has required, in addition to money and political muscle, all the organization, creativity, drive and discipline that makes a drill team.
It is a rebuilding amid an urban battlefield. A man was fatally shot the day after Christmas only a block from where the Foot Stompers were marching. The unemployment rate is 29 percent. The median family income is less than $9,000 a year. In this setting, a drill team, with its military roots and rigor, is more fitting than any string band.
"Get those legs up! Get in line!" Mrs. Brown, who lost her only son, Earl, to AIDS and poured her grief and love into the drill team, was commanding the troops from a wheelchair. The cast on her left leg, which she injured while marching, has not held her back, any more than all the other obstacles.
When Mrs. Brown and a neighbor, George Manigault, started the drill team four years ago, the young people had nowhere but the streets to play. "The girls used to jump rope," Mrs. Brown said. "They were arguing among themselves -- 'Who's next?' They were hollering and hooting. All that energy. I said, 'Why don't you get a drill team?' "
Mrs. Brown being Mrs. Brown, the girls knew it was not a question. "We said, 'All right,' " recalled Sharnae Johnson, 12.
"After the jobs left, the drugs moved in," said Mrs. Brown, who went to work as a housekeeper after the electronics factory where she had worked for 26 years shut down, one more statistic in the neighborhood's downward economic spiral.
Thousands of residents had fled. In 1994, over bitter protests, the Diocese of Philadelphia closed St. Elizabeth's Roman Catholic Church and school, long an anchor on 23d Street.
"People had gotten so discouraged," said Sharnae Johnson's grandmother, Evelyn Johnson, 69, whose 24-year-old grandson was shot to death in 1989. "They had lost hope. When a person is without hope, they don't do anything."
There were no after-school programs for the children. There was certainly no money for a drill team. Without drums, the boys practiced by beating sticks against the Philadelphia phone book.
"The phone book is a very good drum," Mr. Manigault said.
The drill team was only one idea Mr. Manigault, Mrs. Brown and others had for the neighborhood. "We had all this vision," Mrs. Brown said, "but we didn't have resources."
Sister Mary Scullion had both.
A Catholic nun and community organizer, she moved into what had been the convent of St. Elizabeth's around the time the drill team got started. Project Home, the community development corporation she founded with an accountant, Joan Dawson-McConnon, to help homeless men and women, was transforming the abandoned convent into a residence for 24 recovering drug addicts.
At 44, Sister Mary has crawled down manholes and into the darkest alleys to invite the homeless to Project Home's shelters.
"Sister Mary, she doesn't come in and say, 'We're going to do this,' " Mrs. Brown said. "She comes in block by block and asks you, 'What can Project Home do to help you?' "
Three years ago, Sister Mary had her first meeting with the residents of Mrs. Brown's block at Mrs. Brown's home. "Mrs. Barry, she said she wanted ceramics classes," Mrs. Brown recalled. "We said we didn't want any more houses to be torn down on our block. We said we would like to see our houses rehabbed."
Everyone wanted a place for the youth. As meetings were repeated on every block, neighbors who had grown wary and withdrawn through the bad times began to reconnect.
"The energy just multiplied," Sister Mary said.
She knew that the Philadelphia Plan, established by Mayor Ed Rendell and Gov. William Casey in 1994, represented a huge opportunity for St. Elizabeth's-Diamond Street. The plan has linked corporations -- the city gives them tax breaks -- with nine community development corporations working to redevelop devastated neighborhoods.
The Crown Cork and Seal Company, an international can company in northeast Philadelphia, made a 10-year, $2.5 million commitment to the St. Elizabeth's-Diamond Street neighborhood through Project Home.
The money has helped pay for the opening of the community center in the former rectory on 23d Street, along with another community center on Diamond Street. Alice Barry got her ceramics classes. There are also aerobics and adult learning classes, computers and health care provided by a part-time nurse.
A youth center has opened in the former Catholic school. A $1 million donation from the Sisters of St. Francis has helped finance the renovation of four houses in the last year, with plans to renovate 10 a year for the next 10 years.
Sister Mary made Mrs. Brown a professional community organizer. "She said I was doing it anyway, why not get paid," Mrs Brown said.
Mrs. Brown hired Ms. Thompson, who went to school to learn mortgage counseling so she could help working poor families buy the renovated three-story houses that sell for $25,000. The first family, a formerly homeless woman and her son, who works two jobs, at an auto parts store and driving a food service truck, will move in soon.
"I've been here through the bad," Ms. Thompson said. "I want to be here through the good."
The drill team has new uniforms, and money to travel to competitions. The Foot Stompers have become ambassadors for the neighborhood -- a drill team with a roomful of trophies, instead of the drug dealers many outsiders have come to associate with north Philadelphia.
"They call us the City of Brotherly Blood, North Filthy," said one of the drummers, Ron Young, 15, known as D.J. "The first thing they see is the graffiti, and it's dirty, and they think people don't care about themselves."
The Foot Stompers came marching down Ron's block two summers ago. "The noise, the marching, the drums," he said. "It was like something I'd never seen before. It was a good noise. I just looked and said, 'Dag, I wish it was me.' "
LaMark Shorts taught him how to play the drums, and soon Ron Young was a drummer, too.
The Foot Stompers say people look at them differently when they march. "They see you as a smart and active kid," Sharnae said.
"When I'm marching, people are like, 'Ooh, you play the drums,' " Ron said.
It is not how everyone sees him when he is in his usual baggy jeans and parka. "They think I'm going to rob them," said Ron, who talks of becoming a lawyer or a doctor.
Nate Robinson, 40, a recovering drug addict in Sister Mary's residence, was answering the phones at the community center when he heard the drums. "It wakes me up," said Mr. Robinson, a fork-lift operator and gospel singer who is marking seven months without drugs.
The neighborhood is awakening too, but the struggle is only beginning. Drugs are still sold openly. The sound of gunshots has faded, but not disappeared. There are still no supermarkets, dry cleaners or banks, though Mrs. Brown and her neighbors hope businesses will begin to return as the improvements continue.
Mrs. Brown, whose son was 32 when he died, knows that the young members of her drill team will have to fight to survive. "We might can't save them all," she said. "But we might can save half of them."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 16, 1998, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about the formation of a drill team in a Philadelphia neighborhood referred incorrectly to the Pennsylvania Governor who helped link businesses with community development organizations in 1994, and misstated his given name. The official was Robert Casey, not William, and he is not the current Governor; he left office in 1995.
The article also referred incorrectly to the Roman Catholic authority that closed a church and school in the neighborhood. Philadelphia is an archdiocese, not a diocese.

HEADLINE: Japan Questions Its Costly Program to Predict Earthquakes

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
SHORTLY after 1 P.M. one day last year, the silence of a room full of computers at the Japan Meteorological Agency was suddenly broken by a warning. "An abnormal crustal change has occurred," a recorded voice announced.
A strain meter buried more than 600 feet beneath the ground some 100 miles southwest of Tokyo was showing unusual readings. Could this be a sign that a major earthquake was about to occur? 
 Akio Yoshida, director of the meteorological agency's earthquake prediction information division, pondered whether to summon the "six wise men," a group of expert seismologists who always carry pagers for just such a situation.
The six would immediately be whisked by police cars to a special room in Tokyo, where each seat at the conference table has its own large flat-panel computer screen. If the wise men, after examining the data, concluded that a "big one" was imminent, Japan's Prime Minister would be asked to issue a warning for the region southwest of Tokyo in which four million people live.
Immediately, bullet trains there would stop, highway traffic would be diverted, schools and many businesses would close and hospitals would turn away outpatients to leave room for earthquake victims. Areas prone to landslides or tsunamis would be evacuated.
On this particular day, Mr. Yoshida concluded that because the abnormal readings were coming from only one strain meter, the problem was a broken instrument and the wise men were not summoned.
But the elaborate procedure, required by a 1978 law, attests to the seriousness with which Japan treats earthquake prediction. While most nations, including the United States, believe that forecasting earthquakes is next to impossible and have scaled back such efforts, Japan has continued to spend more than $100 million a year on the task, doing everything from burying strain meters to investigating whether fish get the jitters before upheavals.
But now Japan's program faces an overhaul as well. A government advisory committee report last summer concluded, in effect, that the nation has spent more than $1.3 billion over three decades in pursuit of a nearly impossible dream.
The report only added to questioning that has intensified since scientists failed to predict the massive Kobe earthquake that killed more than 6,000 people in January 1995.
It is not surprising that Japan places so much emphasis on earthquake prediction. This archipelago is one of the most seismically active in the world, lying at the juncture of four of the earth's tectonic plates, which regularly and violently shake the surrounding region as they grind past one another. Every Sept. 1, the anniversary of the Tokyo earthquake of 1923 that killed more than 140,000 people, millions of citizens engage in earthquake preparedness drills.
"If we can succeed, we can save lives and property," Mr. Yoshida said of the prediction efforts.
Forecasting hinges mainly on observing precursors of an earthquake, like foreshocks, crustal movements, changes in the chemical composition or level of ground water or even strange animal behavior.
The Tokyo metropolitan government once sponsored research on whether catfish swim strangely before an earthquake. The Japan Marine Science and Technology Center has a video camera on the bottom of Sagami Bay to observe anaerobic clams that live on top of hydrothermal vents on the sea floor. The hypothesis is that the prequake creaking of the earth might release more methane and sulfides from the sediments, making the clams more active.
The most intensive effort, however, is focused on the Tokai region southwest of Tokyo. It is the only area for which, by law, the wise men can be called and the Prime Minister issue a warning. Scientists said the area, where three tectonic plates come together, last had a huge earthquake in 1854 and is overdue for one of magnitude 8, considered a great earthquake. Two nearby earthquakes in the 1940's were preceded by slippages along the fault. So scientists reasoned that if the same pattern occurred in Tokai, an earthquake could be predicted.
The region is now blanketed by underground strain meters. There are also four seismic stations on the seabed offshore. Minute changes in the tilt of the earth are observed using a water-filled tube more than 1,000 feet long -- sort of a giant carpenter's level. In all, 186 measurements are made round the clock and transmitted to the computer-filled monitoring room in Tokyo.
But so far, there has been no earthquake. And the Earthquake Assessment Committee, as the six wise men are formally called, has never been paged. Nor has any earthquake in Japan been successfully predicted since the first five-year plan to develop prediction methods was started in 1965. Japan is now on its seventh such plan. Some claims elsewhere in the world of successful earthquake prediction, like one in China in 1975, are disputed.
So far, no reliable precursors have been found. Foreshocks, for instance, precede some earthquakes, but not others, and in many cases, small tremors occur that are not followed by big ones. Scientists often claim to have found precursors -- but only after the earthquake has occurred. After the Kobe earthquake, for instance, Hiroshi Wakita of the University of Tokyo found that chlorine levels in the water in one well rose during the 10 months before the quake. But skeptics said it is not clear whether that would have happened anyway.
Robert J. Geller, an associate professor in earth and planetary physics at the University of Tokyo who is the loudest critic of Japan's program, argues that earthquake prediction might be more than difficult -- it might be inherently impossible. Professor Geller, an American, asserts that earthquakes are chaotic phenomena, and that how large one becomes is determined by a myriad of unmeasurable details.
"It's like a chain reaction on the highway," he said. "After the first two cars crash, can you predict how long the pileup will be?" That would require generally unknowable data such as whether the drivers in the oncoming cars are drunk and how well their brakes work.
Dr. Geller and other critics say that money spent on prediction could be better spent on basic earth science research or on designing more quakeproof structures, which might save more lives.
To be sure, some of the prediction budget is spent on pure science. Government agencies and scientists find it easier politically to obtain financing for earthquake prediction than for pure research, just as much basic medical research in the United States was financed as part of the war on cancer.
But even much of this basic research, critics contend, consists of collecting reams of data on earth movements that are not well disseminated to others. Nor is the research peer-reviewed, with the five-year earthquake prediction program being routinely renewed.
"Every time, the report says there has been a lot of progress but there are still some difficulties," said Prof. Masayuki Kikuchi of the University of Tokyo's Earthquake Research Institute. He compared the pattern to that of the Imperial Army in World War II, which kept assuring the public that Japan was winning the war while urging people to fight harder.
But defenders of the program say Japan has an obligation to continue, not only for itself but for the poorer quake-prone countries of the world.
"Can we give up efforts at prediction and just passively wait for a big one?" said Kiyoo Mogi, a professor at Nihon University and former chairman of the wise men's committee. "I don't think so."
He added: "Weather forecasters have thousands of people and satellites and big computers and a long history of data and experience every day. Despite that, they are often wrong. But if we said, 'Let's quit forecasting the weather,' we'd be an international laughingstock."
Professor Mogi argues that if a piece of glass is bent, one cannot predict when it will break because glass is homogeneous and stress is distributed uniformly. But if a piece of wood, which is heterogeneous, is bent, the weak parts will start cracking first, and a sound will be heard before the piece breaks. Similarly, he said, there are heterogeneous parts of the earth like fractures and underground water that might react before an earthquake.
Still, Dr. Mogi believes that making a definitive yes-or-no prediction, as the six wise men are required to make, is beyond current scientific capability. He argued for warnings with some probability attached, so that bullet trains could slow down, rather than stop. When his idea was rejected, he resigned from the wise men's committee in 1996.
That reflects one of the risks of earthquake prediction: a false prediction can be almost as costly as a missed one. It is estimated that if a warning were issued for Tokai, it would cost an estimated $7 billion a day in lost business and other economic disruptions. If the predicted earthquake did not occur, Dr. Mogi said, the public backlash would kill the earthquake prediction program.
"We have made people blindly believe that 100 percent prediction is possible in Tokai," he said.
On the other hand, some question how valuable a vague or probabilistic warning would be. Last Feb. 26, the day of the earthquake scare caused by the faulty meter, the Meteorological Agency did issue an advisory saying that abnormal crustal movements had been detected but that the problem might be an instrument problem. A later survey found that more than half the public ignored it.
The current five-year earthquake prediction plan ends in March 1999. A committee formed by the Ministry of Education is already working on the next plan.
In light of the big budget deficits Japan is now experiencing, the program is likely to be scaled back. But earthquake prediction has a strong constituency among the public, the scientists who receive the money and the agencies that dole it out.
Megumi Mizoue, a professor emeritus at the University of Tokyo who now heads the wise men's committee, said the new plan would devote less money to haphazardly searching for earthquake precursors like changes in underground water levels or animal behavior. But the effort to detect a Tokai earthquake will continue, he said, adding that the big earthquake might be approaching.
After scientists failed to foresee the Kobe earthquake, the response was more spending, not less. A new program of more intensive crustal observations, with its own $100 million annual budget, was started. At 1,000 locations, the Pentagon's Global Positioning Satellite system is being used to detect minuscule earth movements. But the new program is being called "observation" rather than prediction.

Japan is riddled with earthquakes because a huge slab of Pacific crust slides very slowly beneath the archipelago, shaking it up periodically. Quakes occur as plates fracture and rub against one another.

Rattling Down Life's Bumpy Road

BYLINE: By JON PARELES 

 BODY:
For a memorable rock voice, beauty doesn't count. This column is devoted to albums by songwriters whose voices crack and squeak and bawl and quiver. They're not soothing; they're unvarnished and willful, and in their flaws they reveal their humanity.
 
Victoria Williams
 Teetering between the childlike and the childish, Victoria Williams always takes her time. She sings in the high, quizzical tone of a precocious little girl, but she's no naif. Within the homey delicacy of her music, she muses on history and memory, love and family, about what's left after a life is over. On "Musings of a Creekdipper" (Atlantic), her songs suggest a leisurely rustic sphere where she can contemplate questions like "Who's going to bury the last man when he dies?," provide a wedding benediction and wish for "a train run by the sun/Connect the small towns every one." In "Blackbirds Rise" she visits a graveyard where she looks at the headstones, thinks about the moment when "Mother Earth meets Father Time and takes his hand," and takes comfort from watching the birds fly overhead. Ms. Williams's music rambles from Appalachian folk to Tin Pan Alley to rhythm-and-blues to mountain gospel, all with a casual grace that adds up to a profound tenderness. 

Fred Eaglesmith
 Fred Eaglesmith's voice is as battered and creaky as the vehicles he sings about on "Lipstick Lies and Gasoline" (Razor and Tie). There's a 1963 Stratochief in "Pontiac" that's a getaway car for a messy stickup, and a rattletrap old truck in "Water in the Fuel" that the singer is driving away from a failed romance. In Mr. Eaglesmith's songs, things are always breaking down: gearshifts, love affairs, common morality. He writes with the bluntness of classic country: "Don't ring that bell, don't sound that alarm/There ain't no use, she's already gone." And he responds to disappointment in classic American ways, like drinking, getting a gun, thinking about God, hitting the road. At heart, he knows the highway will only take him further from his hopes. Still, he's not giving up; his music clatters and twangs, like the Band with some blown gaskets, and he sounds too cantankerous not to get himself in more trouble.
 
Jon Langford
 After decades of singing with noisy, disheveled bands like the Mekons, the Waco Brothers and the Three Johns, Jon Langford leads a straightforward, streamlined rock band for his first solo album, "Skull Orchard" (Sugar Free). The songs push ahead confidently, like country-rock with an infusion of the Who, and Mr. Langford applies his gruff voice to full-fledged melodies. Within his clear-cut rockers and waltzes, Mr. Langford has a lot on his mind: commercialization, unemployment, Wales's history, private insecurities and plastic surgery, a procedure he sums up as: "Strive for perfection/Do away with yourself." Smart, cynical and still impassioned about the state of humanity, Mr. Langford has recharged his music by stripping away any indulgences.
 
Lullaby for the Working Class
 Mandolins plink, harmonicas hoot and glockenspiels tinkle in Lullaby for the Working Class, a mini-orchestra of wistful Americana. Ted Stevens, the band's singer and main songwriter, is a connoisseur of the elusive and fragile on the band's second album, "I Never Even Asked for Light" (Bar/None). In a voice that sounds sleepless and troubled, he ponders hazy emotions, the toll taken by progress and a pervasive sense of loss: "How many ways can you say that you've been broken?," he sings in "Man vs. the Tide." Played on acoustic instruments, the music seems folksy, but it's a long way from rustic simplicity. With the oblique imagery and idiosyncratic structures of collegiate rock, Mr. Stevens's reveries wander from family traumas to space travel to the possibility of faith.
 
Various Artists
 Love doesn't go smoothly on "The Rose Grew Round the Briar" (Yazoo/Shanachie), a collection billed as "Early American Rural Love Songs" that were recorded in the 1920's and 30's. Culled from old 78-r.p.m. disks, the album mixes blues and hillbilly songs, with relatively familiar names like Cannon's Jug Stompers and Blind Willie McTell alongside rarities from the likes of Shortbuckle Roark and Family, the duo Eck Dunford and Hattie Stoneman, or Lottie Kimbrough, whose "Lost Lover Blues" includes both whistling and backup yodeling. Backed by claw-hammer banjo picking or ragtimey fingerpicked guitar, most of the singers stoically confess how lonely they are, how even death would be better than unrequited love. Dock Boggs, like a precursor of death-haunted gangsta rappers, sings about a false-hearted lover driving him to his grave, then nonchalantly warns, "The man who won my darling girl/Feel the bite of my .44." Of the 23 songs, only one (by Alfred and Orville Reed) is a corny portrait of domestic bliss; the others balance fatalism with wry acceptance.

Detroit's Big 3 Say Asia Is Forcing Cost Cuts

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 12

 BODY:
The Big Three American auto makers might be expected to pop champagne. After all, the stock market has soared, the economic expansion continues, and interest rates have fallen to record lows, all of which would normally lure buyers to showrooms.
Instead, Detroit is acting almost as if a recession had hit, hunkering down to shave pennies wherever possible in an effort to cut costs sharply in the face of growing competition from Asia. 
 The Ford Motor Company told Wall Street analysts on Friday that it had cut $3 billion in costs last year and planned to trim an additional $1 billion this year.
"This is the first time in the history of Ford that we've reduced our total cost of doing business from one year to the next," Alex Trotman, Ford's chairman and chief executive, said last week. "It is pretty clear now that we will have a record year in terms of profits for 1997."
Indeed, for the Big Three, cutting costs seems to be the only way to increase profits. The market for car and truck sales in the United States is not growing, and it might even shrink slightly this year. In addition, there has been no room to increase car and truck prices, in part because the strengthening dollar has allowed Asian auto makers to lower their prices, forcing the Big Three to follow suit.
John M. Devine, Ford's chief financial officer, said, "What is going on in Asia is putting enormous competitive and pricing pressures on us."
The relative prices of new cars and trucks in the third quarter were the lowest in 17 years, according to Comerica Bank, which calculates how many weeks of work on average it takes to buy a new vehicle. To be sure, the competition -- and the rebates -- are strongest on cars and mini-vans rather than on popular sport utility vehicles.
"We have deflation in the auto industry in spades," said Jack V. Kirnan, an auto analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.
The General Motors Corporation said last week that it had spent $1 billion more in 1997 on rebates and other incentives than it had expected to a year ago. And Ford announced on Friday that it would increase the rebates and discounted lease deals it was offering through April 2. Its cheapest car, the 1998 Ford Escort, now costs $10,745 including the $1,000 rebate.
That is still well above the discounted prices of some of its Asian competitors. Because of the strength of the dollar, foreign auto makers may set low prices or introduce rebates without eating into their profits. Just last week, for example, Hyundai, the South Korean auto maker, increased its rebates -- its cheapest car, the Accent coupe, can now be had for $8,534.
Because the Asian currency crisis has left sales so weak at home, Hyundai plans to increase its exports by 15 percent this year, with the bulk of the shipments headed to the United States, the company said on Friday. Some analysts in Asia believe that Hyundai will try to increase exports even further and will be forced to cut prices further to do so.
So far, the largest Asian auto makers, Toyota and Honda of Japan, have used the weakness of the yen to hold down prices on their new models, even while adding new features. Though both companies tend to steer clear of cash rebates, Toyota has been offering discounted lease prices as a way of reducing prices.
Shoppers have forced the Big Three to follow suit, putting pressure on their profits. Because they are earning less on each car they sell, yet do not want to disappoint shareholders with weaker profits, the American companies are trying to make up the difference by cutting costs.
"The opportunity for price increases is virtually nil," said Robert J. Eaton, chairman and chief executive of the Chrysler Corporation, who said the company would have to offer higher rebates to keep its sales strong. "To maintain the current market pace will require more incentives than we had last year."
Chrysler has adopted a limited hiring freeze, adding only essential workers like engineers. The company is concentrating on reducing its expenses in other ways, too. Chrysler cut $1.2 billion in costs during the 1997 model year, and it plans to cut at least $1.5 billion in the current model year, which ends in September, said Thomas T. Stallkamp, the company's president. "We're just about 50 percent of the way there," he said.
The combination of good economic times and all the cost-cutting is expected to produce strong 1997 profits for the Big Three, which are to announce earnings figures this month. Analysts expect healthy profits to continue next year, and one analyst raised his estimate of Ford's prospects after the briefing last week.
G.M. is expected to report fourth-quarter earnings of $1.97 a share, up from 55 cents a share in the fourth quarter of 1996, according to a consensus of Wall Street analysts' estimates prepared by First Call. That would bring G.M.'s 1997 earnings per share to $7.83, up from $5.37 the year before. Profits this year are expected to be even higher: $8.01 a share.
John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s chairman and chief executive, said that although the decline in Asian currencies "puts competitive pressure" on the company, "all in all, it should be a good year."
G.M., which has increased its profits even as its market share has shrunk in the United States, refused to release information on its cost-cutting efforts, but a spokesman said it had worked hard to meet aggressive, internal cost-cutting goals. "If you don't get it in price and you don't get it in volume and you show a bottom-line improvement, most of that is due to cost-cutting," said Mark A. Tanner, the spokesman.
Ford is expected to report fourth-quarter profits of $1.25 a share, up from 98 cents a share a year earlier. That would bring its 1997 earnings to $5.36 a share, well above the $3.45 a share it earned in 1996. This year, Ford's earnings are expected to decline slightly from 1997, to $5.21 a share.
Profits at Chrysler, hurt in the fourth quarter by a slow introduction of its newest large sedan models, are expected to be the weakest of the lot, though still respectable. Analysts expect it to earn $1.12 a share in the fourth quarter, down from the $1.51 a share it earned in the fourth quarter of 1996. That would bring Chrysler's 1997 profits to $3.96 a share, down from the $5.21 a share it earned in 1996. But earnings are expected to improve markedly this year, when analysts expect Chrysler to earn $4.97 a share.

Wall Street's Stumbling Bull Is Relying Heavily on 2 Legs

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
The American stock market has come under severe pressure early in 1998 and has slumped. But it appears that things would be much worse were it not for two disparate groups of buyers: foreigners and individual Americans.
The foreign buying may have been the more important factor in recent months, helping to explain why the big stocks -- the ones known internationally -- have been the strongest. The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks remain well above the lows they reached in October, the last time the world grew fearful over Asia. But the Russell 2000, an index of smaller stocks, has fallen to its lowest levels since August, and is 2.2 percent under its October low. 
 Yesterday, however, it appeared that domestic orders, many from individual investors but some from institutions, turned around the latest world flight from equities.
One important way to look at trading is through a market indicator somewhat misleadingly called cash flow. Every time a trade takes place at a level higher than the previous one, the value of that trade is chalked up to positive cash flow; when a trade takes place at a price lower than the previous one, the value of that trade is seen as negative cash flow.
The logic of the indicator is that the price movement shows whether a trade was initiated by a buyer or a seller. Clearly that is often accurate, but not always.
There are separate figures for all cash flow and for that stemming only from large block trades exceeding 10,000 shares.
On Friday, when the Dow Jones industrial average fell 220 points, cash flow was negative all day, whether from blocks or all trades. Traders of all stripes were apparently selling.
But yesterday, after a worldwide round of selling caused American stocks to open sharply lower, there was steady buying pressure from smaller accounts, while block trades were heavily negative at the opening of the New York Stock Exchange and then remained slightly negative the rest of the day.
That would seem to indicate that a lot of American investors, given a weekend to think about the Asian crisis, concluded it was not that important to this country. That is consistent with the argument made by many investment advisers: the strong United States economy will suffer little from an Asian collapse.
Logically, those who accept the argument might be expected to be inclined to stick with companies that derive profits primarily in the United States, rather than overseas. But it has not worked out that way in the market, for reasons that appear to have less to do with bad logic than with the role of foreign investors. As for American investors, some of their money may have been diverted from foreign stocks into American ones. The lack of alternative investments in this country may also have played a role. The Asian crisis has sent a lot of money fleeing to the safety of dollar-based investments, and much of that has gone into medium-term Treasuries -- so much so that two-year Treasuries traded yesterday just above a 5 percent yield. For many American investors accustomed to good returns, stocks seem the only place to be.
A buyer of that two-year Treasury will, of course, earn 5 percent a year for the next two years, barring only a Treasury default. By contrast, as many an investor in Asian stocks can attest, an equity investor can lose that much or more in an hour or two, not to mention in a year. But it appears that American investors -- as opposed to the more jittery people who manage money for large institutions -- are not concerned with such possibilities and still view price dips as buying opportunities.
Someday, of course, price dips will no longer be opportunities. But the market's performance reinforces the theory that individual investors will not lead the market down, but will move out of stocks only after something -- perhaps a recession -- has come along that clearly calls into question the wisdom of staying in the stock market.

HEADLINE: French Canadian Is a U.N. Chief's First Right-Hand Woman

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 12

 BODY:
A French Canadian with a flair for finance and a great enthusiasm for New York life was appointed as the first Deputy Secretary General in United Nations history today.
Louise Frechette, the new Deputy Secretary General, is resigning as Canada's Deputy Minister of National Defense to help Secretary General Kofi Annan finish the job of redesigning the United Nations administration from the top down. 
 She was based in New York twice as a diplomat, most recently as Canada's United Nations representative from 1992 to 1994.
"I love New York," she said in an interview today in her more or less empty new office down the hall from Mr. Annan's. "I love the city; it is one of the most vibrant in the world. I'm glad the United Nations is right downtown. There is something about being in the middle of a real city, with all its diversity, its culture."
At the United Nations, she will have the authority to fill in for Mr. Annan as he chooses. A year ago, diplomats were predicting that the General Assembly would never grant such latitude to an official largely outside its control. A number of developing nations wanted the job to be largely one of assisting poor countries, but in the end did not try to block Mr. Annan's plan.
He made it known early in his administration that he was looking for a woman for the job. But today, introducing Ms. Frechette at a news conference, he joked that this was a false impression. "I was looking for the best person to do the job, and it happens to be a woman," he said.
Ms. Frechette, 51, a Canadian born in Montreal and educated in French at the University of Montreal and the College of Europe in Bruges, Belgium, said she never really spoke English fluently until she took a job in Ottawa in her 20's. She also speaks Spanish. From 1985 to 1988, she was Canada's Ambassador to Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, after which she returned to Ottawa to review Canada's relations with Latin America.
Apart from diplomatic assignments, Ms. Frechette has done work in economics, finance and international trade, culminating in her appointment as Assistant Deputy Minister for Economic Policy and Trade Competitiveness in 1991.
Ms. Frechette, who is expected to take a leading role at the United Nations in economic and development issues, said today that the crisis now centered in Asia is a lesson in "how an economic phenomenon can develop at a speed we couldn't imagine" and how no country is immune from the effects.
"We have to wrap our minds around globalization," she said, adding that from a United Nations perspective, this involves going beyond the workings of financial markets to an understanding of the economic and political needs of nations and the speed at which large institutions will have to operate to meet them.
While at the United Nations, Ms. Frechette -- working with Madeleine K. Albright, who was then the chief United States delegate -- was pivotal in devising a peacekeeping operation for Haiti with the return from exile of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1994.
She was a regular at the lunches organized by Ms. Albright, now Secretary of State, for the handful of women who represented their countries here, and high-ranking women in the United Nations system. "Madeleine was a very faithful member of the club," Ms. Frechette said.
In Washington, a spokesman for Ms. Albright said that she cheered today's news.
"Secretary Albright remembers Ambassador Frechette fondly, and believes she's the perfect choice for this new position of Deputy Secretary General," James P. Rubin, spokesman for the Secretary of State, said in an interview today. He described Ms. Frechette as "one of the finest diplomats the Secretary has ever encountered."
Haiti continues to be a preoccupation for Ms. Frechette, who considers the issue of how to follow through on peacekeeping missions to be a challenge for the United Nations. The Government in Haiti, for example, is shaky, and there is little money to spend on the development of strong civilian institutions.
"A country needs a well-functioning justice system, a well-functioning police force," she said. "Elections are necessary but are not enough in themselves."
Members of the United Nations have backed away from peacekeeping operations, often citing the unresolved problems they have left behind in many parts of the world. Ms. Frechette said that maybe it is time to stop measuring the work of the organization by its peacekeeping missions.
"Many of the peacekeeping operations had to do with the end of the cold war," she said. "We were helping conflicts come to their final resolution. This era is behind us. We shouldn't assess the U.N.'s performance by whether they are creating a peacekeeping operation every few months."

White House Bailouts for Asia Draw Fire

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12

 BODY:
With the financial turmoil in Asia showing few signs of abating, liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans are stepping up criticism of the bailouts engineered by the Clinton Administration, putting the White House under additional pressure as it prepares to ask Congress for more money.
Although the Administration has won muted support for its stance toward Asia from leaders of both parties, members of Congress at either end of the ideological spectrum have grown increasingly vocal in their objections in recent days, and seem certain to demand a full-scale debate about using American money to contain the crisis. 
 "We must be vigilant and aware of what is taking place, but insist on discipline and thoughtful action before taxpayer dollars are put at risk," said Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.
Some Republicans object to using taxpayer money to help other nations. They are particularly upset with the Administration's freedom to lend money to embattled nations without Congressional approval.
The more libertarian-minded conservatives say the best approach would be to minimize the involvement of the United States and International Monetary Fund and allow the free-market system to work by penalizing the banks, securities firms, companies and countries that made bad investments. Bailouts, they say, encourage international investors to make risky bets with the confidence that governments will pay for their mistakes.
"The free market is no longer at work in the field of international finance," said Senator Lauch Faircloth, a Republican from North Carolina, who is among the most outspoken critics of the Administration's strategy. "We have privatized the gains and socialized the losses."
Many liberal Democrats are equally opposed to the current policy, designed mainly by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin. But they object for different reasons than the Republican critics.
The Democrats say the bailouts are propping up repressive regimes in nations like Indonesia that have little respect for human rights, allow exploitation of workers and condone development plans that damage the environment. In countries such as South Korea, these Democrats say the economic prescription imposed by the I.M.F. will unfairly inflict most of the pain on the middle class and allow financial institutions and international investors to escape with little damage.
"Until we deal with the negative consequences we're going to oppose enhancing the international mobility of capital," said Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat. "If the Administration will take seriously our concerns, it can break what must look to them like an unholy alliance between liberals and conservatives."
Mr. Rubin said the interdependence of the American and Asian economies and financial markets and the broader interest the United States has in a stable, prosperous Asia have left the United States with no choice but to help develop a solution to the crisis.
"Our nation's economic and national security are vitally at stake in the situation in Asia," Mr. Rubin said.
"There's a high level of seriousness in Congress about how to think through and deal with these matters," he added. "But there certainly will be a debate and discussion when Congress reconvenes."
Congress has been out of session for the last two and a half months as the Administration has worked, through the I.M.F. and on its own, to stabilize financial markets in Asia and limit damage to the economy.
But the Administration's decision just before Christmas to lend $1.7 billion of taxpayer money to South Korea galvanized longtime critics of direct American involvement in such bailouts. The failure of the I.M.F. plans throughout the region to calm the markets has brought further criticism from Congress that the White House's approach is flawed.
The first flashpoint in the debate will be the Administration's request for a $3.5 billion contribution to an emergency fund established by the I.M.F. to deal with sudden financial crises of the type afflicting Asia. The request was blocked before Congress adjourned last fall -- largely because it became enmeshed with the separate but equally contentious issue of American support for international family planning efforts -- and is likely to be resubmitted to Congress in the next month or two.
The Administration will also ask Congress this year for an additional $14.5 billion to bolster the I.M.F.'s financial strength under a plan agreed to last fall by the I.M.F.'s 181 member nations.
Consideration of both I.M.F. requests is certain to be tied to efforts by Republicans to limit the Administration's freedom to provide direct loans to foreign nations without Congressional approval through the Exchange Stabilization Fund, a $40 billion kitty that can be used at the President's discretion to deal with international financial problems. The $1.7 billion loan for South Korea came from the stabilization fund.
Mr. D'Amato pushed through legislation several years ago that restricted the size and length of any loans made by the President from the stabilization fund. Those restrictions lapsed on Sept. 30.
Some Republicans, including Mr. Faircloth, want to reimpose those restrictions. Republicans said it was likely that they would tie any new appropriations for the I.M.F. to limits on the Administration's use of the stabilization fund.

Greenspan Heckled
 LOS ANGELES, Jan. 12 (Reuters) -- Community advocates heckled the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, today for defending financial aid to Asia while poor neighborhoods in the United States needed help.
"It's a disgrace," some shouted when the subject of Asia arose during a community financing forum attended by Mr. Greenspan. "You should be ashamed of yourself." One heckler was ejected for refusing to calm down.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Motorola Has Profits Below Expectations

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
Hit by the economic turmoil in Asia, Motorola Inc. reported yesterday that its profits for the fourth quarter were slightly below the expectations of Wall Street analysts.
The fourth-quarter results of the company -- whose global businesses range from microchips to cellular phones -- had been anxiously anticipated among investors as an early sign of the impact of the Asian troubles on American high-technology companies. 
 Motorola collects nearly 30 percent of its revenue from Asia, industry analysts estimate, and in a statement last evening, Motorola's senior executives noted the impact of the slide in some of its Asian businesses.
The preliminary reading from analysts, though, seemed to be that Motorola's results were probably not a deeply worrying sign that technology companies were being battered by the Asian financial crisis.
"There is some order weakness out of Asia, but it doesn't seem to be a disaster by any means," said Jonathan Joseph, an analyst with Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities in San Francisco.
Motorola, based in Schaumburg, Ill., released its results after stock trading had ended yesterday. The stock fell $1, to $54.50, on the New York Stock Exchange, then slipped further in after-hours trading, to $54.375.
For the quarter, Motorola earned $321 million, or 54 cents a share, up 35 percent from $238 million, or 40 cents a share, in the comparable quarter a year earlier. Excluding special charges for discontinued operations, earnings were $393 million, or 65 cents a share -- 3 cents below Wall Street's expectations, based on the consensus of 28 analysts polled by the First Call Inc., a research firm.
Fourth-quarter sales rose 7.7 percent, to $8.3 billion, from $7.7 billion in the 1996 fourth quarter.
"During the fourth quarter, the deterioration of economic conditions in certain Asian markets had an impact in terms slowing the growth of sales, orders and profits, as well as putting pressure on pricing," Robert L. Growney, Motorola's president and chief operating officer, said in a statement.
A conference call with Wall Street analysts, when Motorola executives are expected to offer additional details of the Asian weakness on the company's individual businesses, is scheduled for this morning.
While the impact of the Asian crisis on Motorola may be less severe than feared, the larger question -- both for the region and for companies with sizable businesses in Asia, like Motorola -- is how deep and how lengthy the downturn will prove to be.
Some American technology companies had been experiencing growth rates of 20 percent and more in the once-booming economies of East Asia.
Christopher Galvin, Motorola's chief executive, said in yesterday's statement that he expected growth of his company's Asian business to slow to 10 percent in the first half of 1998. Yet he added that his cautiously optimistic assessment was based on an assumption that the recent bailout efforts would succeed in steadying the Asian economies.
"We are still facing challenges in the near term, as we expect the economic conditions in certain markets in Asia that affected fourth-quarter results to continue for at least the first half of 1998," Mr. Galvin said. "We are assuming the cooperative efforts of many nations and the International Monetary Fund will help to stabilize the Asian situation."
In the fourth quarter, Motorola said that the Asian slide in particular hit its cellular phone, pager and semiconductor businesses.
Despite the current problems, Mr. Galvin expressed Motorola's corporate confidence in the long-term attractiveness of Asia as a region in which to do business.
"We will continue to control costs," he said, "but we will also continue our investments in Asia where appropriate."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Bond Prices in Spurt, but Stock Rally Later Trims Gains

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Low inflation, Asian financial turmoil, a plunge in the stock market and investor flight to the perceived safety of the American bond market sent Treasury prices sharply higher early yesterday. But a later rebound in stocks took away some of the gains in bonds by the end of the day.
In the morning, the yield on the 30-year bond, which moves in the opposite direction to the price, plunged as low as 5.66 percent, from 5.73 percent on Friday. The power behind the demand for Treasuries was investor confidence that the economic collapse in Asia would lead to slower growth and lower inflation in the United States and, in turn, force the Federal Reserve to lower short-term interest rates. 
 Traders said, however, that once the Dow Jones industrial average rebounded from its opening 137-point decline, investors wondered whether the bond market had moved too far, too fast. For example, the yield on the two-year Treasury note fell early yesterday to 5.02 percent, half a percentage point below the Federal Reserve's 5.5 percent target for the shortest of short-term interest rates, the Federal funds rate. The yield had dropped from 5.64 percent just since the end of last year.
"There is a push and pull here on whether the Fed is going to ease," said Rob Kapito, vice chairman of Blackrock Financial Manangement, which manages $55 billion in fixed-income investments. "If the Fed doesn't ease, then the short end has gone too far."
Late in trading, the yield on the two-year note popped back up to 5.17 percent, where it finished Friday.
But the yield on the 30-year bond managed to finish at 5.69 percent, its lowest level since the bond was first regularly issued in 1977. The price, which moves in the opposite direction, rose 20/32, to 106 9/32. Long-term yields on corporate and other bonds also continued to move lower to levels that have not been seen for almost 30 years.
The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note also fell, dropping to 5.36 percent from 5.41 percent. The positive story on inflation, which is expected to be reinforced today with the report of a minimal increase in December consumer prices, is still holding investor attention, even if some are wondering whether short-term interest rates may have come down too far for now.
"The market over all is a little ahead of itself," said Gerald A. Guild, senior vice president of the taxable fixed-income department at Advest Inc.
The fact that short-term interest rates have moved dramatically below the target for the Federal funds rate, which applies to overnight loans between banks, has convinced many analysts that investors think the central bank will ease interest rates soon. But some of the buying of short-term government securities is coming from foreign investors looking for a safe harbor and some American investors who want an alternative home until the recent stock market volatility cools down. All this means that the dive in short-term interest rates may be overdone.
The surge in the bond market over the last week was started by comments on deflation, which occurs when prices fall rather than rise, that the Federal Reserve Board chairman, Alan Greenspan, made in a speech on Jan. 3 in Chicago.
Just the mention of deflation -- Mr. Greenspan did not say it was an immediate threat -- was enough to make many investors think that the Fed would now consider lowering interest rates to prevent the Asian turmoil from slowing growth here too much and pulling prices lower.
Then, last Thursday, a Fed governor, Laurence H. Meyer, added to the sentiment when he suggested that the Fed might have to ease interest rates if the Asian crisis slowed the American economy much more than expected.
The following are the results of yesterday's weekly auction of three- and six-month Treasury bills.

HEADLINE: 'Made in New York' Is Coming Back Into Fashion

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO 

 BODY:
In her glass-walled corner office overlooking the garment district, Natalie Walker of Tahiti Apparel designs the many styles of summer: sexy leopard-printed bathing suits, sensible navy-and-white-striped maillots and matching sheer cover-ups. And the suits are made not in Sri Lanka or Hong Kong, like so much other apparel, but across the East River at a factory in Long Island City.
"I'll personally take a subway to Queens and try on the suits myself," said Ms. Walker, the executive vice president of design and merchandising for Tahiti, which owns the license for Jones New York Swimwear and 15 other swimwear brands. 
 Bill Blass, Geoffrey Beene, Oscar de la Renta and Nicole Miller are just some of the major designers who make most of their apparel in New York City. Although designers say labor is still less expensive abroad, making their products locally gives them the flexibility and quickness they need to respond to the market.
"It's all about speed," said Richard Feldman, president of the Feldman Manufacturing Corporation, a private-label manufacturer in Queens that makes swimwear for Jones New York, as well as J. Crew, Eddie Bauer and Victoria's Secret. "The buzzword is quick response. The swimwear can go from here to our warehouse to a distribution center in 48 hours. If you go to the Orient, you need three to four months."
For more than two decades, the garment industry in New York City has hemorrhaged, losing tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs as work moved overseas. But last year, for the first time, there was a slight uptick in New York apparel employment, and while no one is predicting a turnaround, a few trends have made New York a more attractive place for apparel makers.
In the mid-1970's, employment in apparel and textile manufacturing in New York City peaked at about 250,000. By 1991, according to data compiled for the Fashion Center Business Improvement District, the number of employees in the apparel and textile manufacturing sectors had fallen to 104,415. By 1996, the number had sunk further, to 82,500. But last year, for the first time since the bloodletting began, the figure rose, to 84,000.
"It's a modest increase, but in my view, it's a big gain only because you stemmed the tide, you stopped the decline," said Barbara Randall, executive director of the improvement district, a nonprofit organization formed in 1993 to promote the garment district in the West 30's and the fashion industry. "I don't think that all of a sudden, manufacturing is going to come back in droves, but I do think that apparel manufacturing is here to stay. The water has found its level."
The combined manufacturing and wholesale output in New York City totals $20 billion a year, according to a draft study of the fashion industry that was commissioned by the improvement district. Designers say the ultimate cost of making apparel in New York is comparable to overseas production when they factor in the cost of shipping merchandise, traveling to and from the factory and paying the necessary duties and tariffs.
And now that there are six to eight fashion seasons a year, instead of four as in the past, companies must design and produce more different styles of clothing. Making clothes locally enables designers and manufacturers to fill the racks in stores on time.
With instant feedback from bar codes about what is selling and what is not, stores are reducing their own risks by placing smaller orders closer to the seasons, knowing they can reorder styles that sell well. Being able to fill those reorders swiftly can make or break a factory.
Consumer fickleness also makes shifting gears quickly a necessity.
"Pleats or no pleats, plaids or solids," said Bruce Herman, president of the Garment Industry Development Corporation, a nonprofit economic development organization. "Who can say sitting here in December what will be selling in May? If you're sourcing off shore, you've already made that decision. If you decide right, you make a lot of money. If you decide wrong for a few seasons, you're out."
But some apparel companies that have chosen to make all their clothes in New York City grumble about some aspects of local production. Ellen Mullman, the sales manager for Tamotsu, a manufacturer of bridge sportswear that is based in Manhattan and produces 95 percent of its clothing in New York City, loves the time and money she saves by not having to "get on a plane to China or Hong Kong." But she hates having to pay more for inferior work.
"There seems to be less pride in craftsmanship in New York in general," she said. "If you see a Giorgio Armani jacket and turn it inside out, it will be made with loving care."
Others disagree. "We have world-class talent right here in New York," said Janet B. Paszkiewicz, the Garment Industry Development Center's sourcing coordinator. "We have an immigrant population that comes in with the skills already acquired."
The fashion industry is toying with the idea of a "Made in New York" label to cash in on the city's reputation as the world capital of pop culture. (Apparel is still the city's biggest manufacturing sector.)
"That's actually a powerful marketing tool," Mr. Herman said. "We encourage companies to put 'Made in New York' on their labels, but we also feel it has to actually mean something. The garment shouldn't be thought of in New York but made in Sri Lanka."
Alan Sealove, chairman of Victoria Royal, an evening-dress manufacturer in Manhattan, has just returned to New York. After making dresses for years in Hong Kong, his company started producing a small quantity of clothes in New York's garment district only three months ago.
"We liked that we could get the finished product in the store quicker," he said.

HEADLINE: Sex Bias Is Reported by U.S. At Border Plants in Mexico

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 12

 BODY:
Concluding a six-month review of charges of sex discrimination in Mexico, the United States Labor Department reported today that thousands of border assembly plants administer medical tests to weed out pregnant applicants and harass pregnant workers to coerce their resignation.
Others simply dismiss pregnant workers to avoid paying maternity benefits, the department said. 
 Noting that discrimination against pregnant workers appears to be a violation of Mexico's own labor laws, Secretary of Labor Alexis M. Herman followed up on the findings by phoning her Mexican counterpart, Javier Bonilla Garcia, to request consultations, officials said.
"This is a serious issue, and we need to consult with Mexico as to implementation of its employment discrimination laws," Ms. Herman said today in a statement.
The Labor Department's review responded to a complaint filed last year by Human Rights Watch and other American and Mexican rights and labor groups under the terms of a labor side accord of the North American Free Trade Agreement -- or Nafta -- in which Mexico, Canada and the United States agreed to set up offices within their own labor departments to review the other countries' labor rights practices.
The complaint argued that managers of Mexico's tax-free assembly plants, known as maquiladoras, routinely require female applicants to take urine tests and question them about their menstrual cycles and sexual activity to screen out pregnant women.
The vast majority of Mexico's 2,700 maquiladora plants -- which employ more than half a million workers and account for more than $29 billion of Mexico's export earnings -- are owned by United States corporations. How the American and Mexican Governments follow up on the Department's confirmation of widespread sex discrimination will be closely watched because one of the goals of the Nafta accord was to upwardly harmonize labor standards in the three countries.
The Labor Department reported that the harassment or dismissal of female Mexican workers who become pregnant "occurs" and "violates Mexican law."
On the other hand, the report did not so unequivocally characterize as illegal the practice of administering pregnancy tests to women seeking factory jobs. That is because the Mexican Government has expressed contradictory interpretations of its own labor laws, said Irasema T. Garza, who heads the Labor Department's national administrative office and directed the review.
Mexico's Labor Ministry responded to the complaint by arguing that administering pregnancy tests to job applicants was not illegal because Mexico's labor laws protect workers only after they have been hired, Ms. Garza said in an interview. On the other hand, the Interior Ministry and Mexico City's Human Rights Commission have both said that refusing to hire women because they are pregnant violates the law.
"That's why we are seeking these consultations, to clarify inconsistencies in the Mexican Government's position," Ms. Garza said.
Although the Department's findings largely confirmed the charges outlined in the complaint, LaShawn Jefferson, a Human Rights Watch researcher who investigated pregnancy discrimination in 47 maquiladora plants in 1995 and 1996, said she was "disappointed by the equivocal nature of this finding."
"One of our central points was that pregnancy discrimination constituted sex discrimination, which is prohibited by Mexico's labor code, its Constitution and its international agreements," Ms. Jefferson said. "This finding seems to equivocate as to whether it is illegal."

HEADLINE: Health Spending Grew Slowly in '96 but Still Hit $1 Trillion

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12

 BODY:
Health spending increased in 1996 at the lowest rate in 36 years, but topped $1 trillion for the first time, the Government reported today.
 Such spending has been growing at the same pace as the economy for four years in a row, contrary to earlier projections, which showed health care eating up a bigger and bigger share of the nation's output. Even so, consumers did not see more money in their pockets, because many employers shifted costs to their workers. 
 The report, from the Department of Health and Human Services, describes pent-up pressures for a possible increase in health care spending in the near future. Health insurance premiums appear to be rising again as insurers catch up after holding the increase in premiums below the growth in medical costs, the report said.
"National health expenditures increased 4.4 percent in 1996, the slowest growth recorded since 1960," said the study, by Katharine R. Levit and other Government economists. The increase was still greater than the change in the Consumer Price Index for all items, which rose 3.3 percent in 1996.
"Despite this slow growth, health spending managed to top $1 trillion for the first time," the report said. "On average, spending for health care in 1996 was $3,759 per person, $126 more than the $3,633 spent in 1995."
Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, said the report showed "significant progress in slowing the growth of health care spending."
And Ms. Shalala said the new balanced-budget law would "help control spending even more."
The report analyzes the slowdown in health costs, part of which is attributable to the growth of managed care.
"Since 1993," it said, "increases in health spending have averaged 5 percent annually, with each year registering successively slower growth." By contrast, from 1966 to 1993, national health spending rose more than 11 percent a year, on the average.
The study found that taxpayers were picking up more of the nation's health care tab. Federal, state and local government programs accounted for 47 percent of all health spending in 1996, up from 40 percent in 1989.
From 1989 to 1996, Ms. Levit said, health spending by government agencies rose 9.7 percent a year, on the average, while health spending by the private sector rose 5.8 percent a year.
Ms. Levit and other Federal officials said that government health spending might grow more slowly than private health spending in the next few years, because of cutbacks made under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, signed by President Clinton in August.
National health spending reached $1.04 trillion in 1996, up from $991.4 billion in 1995, the Government reported.
Medicare and Medicaid together spent $351 billion in 1996, accounting for one-third of the total.
Medicaid spending by the Federal Government and the states totaled $147.7 billion in 1996, up 5.3 percent from the year before. Medicaid provides coverage for 36 million low-income people.
Medicare, which provides health insurance for 38 million people who are elderly or disabled, spent $203 billion in 1996, up 8.1 percent from the previous year.
The report also made these points:
*The growth of health spending, after adjustment for inflation, was extremely low. The increases were 1.9 percent in 1996, 2.2 percent in 1995 and 3.3 percent in 1994.
*Americans spent 13.6 percent of the gross domestic product, or almost one-seventh of the nation's total output, on health care in 1996. This share has been the same for four years.
*Doctors and hospitals are getting a smaller share of the nation's health care dollar. Prescription drugs and long-term care, which includes home health services and nursing homes, are getting bigger shares.
*Hospitals "capitalize on Medicare's payment regulations to maximize their revenues," discharging patients to nursing homes affiliated with the hospitals.
*Spending for doctors' services has been slowing for six years. It rose just 2.9 percent in 1996, to $202.1 billion.
By contrast, spending for prescription drugs rose sharply. Americans bought $62 billion of medications from retail outlets in 1996, an increase of 9.2 percent over the amount bought in 1995.
The Government said that the growth in premiums for employer-sponsored health insurance had fallen by more than half in four years. Spending on premiums rose just 3.6 percent in 1996, after a growth of 8.4 percent in 1992.
In the last few years, Ms. Levit said, spending for health care benefits has risen faster than premiums, squeezing the profit margins of insurance companies.
Though health spending may rise at a more rapid rate, she said, "there is currently no expectation of a return to the double-digit increases of the 1980's."

HEADLINE: VACANT CUBICLES -- A special report.;
Software Jobs Go Begging, Threatening Technology Boom

BYLINE: By AMY HARMON 

 BODY:
Every so often, the co-founder of Carnelian Inc., James Kittock, hears the phones at his Silicon Valley start-up company begin to ring in order, from one cloth-covered cubicle to the next: 0976, 0977, 0978. . . . He knows -- everyone in the Valley knows -- it is the recruiters, calling to steal his programmers away, often at huge salaries.
Mr. Kittock, 27, cannot really blame them. Carnelian itself has been known to resort to guerrilla tactics in what has become an increasingly desperate scavenger hunt for highly paid digital-age translators who can mediate between mind and machine. And like other employers nationwide these days, Carnelian has found that there is simply not enough talent to go around at any price. 
 "For us, it was a choice of lowering our standards or waiting, and we chose to wait," Mr. Kittock said, "but it's tough to see time slipping by and things not moving ahead because of a lack of horsepower." His company, which develops software for Internet publishing, could use twice the dozen programmers it now employs.
Mr. Kittock's lament echoes throughout the world of high technology and beyond. As America relies more heavily on computer software than ever before, the demand for people who can develop and use the tools of the modern age has vastly outstripped the existing supply. And the shortage is expected to get much worse as an estimated one million new programming jobs come open in the next nine years.
Help-wanted ads are multiplying for the coders who can write in fashionable computer languages like Java, for the testers who find the bugs that the coders invariably leave behind and for the systems analysts who figure out how to make it all work together.
The talent shortage is so pronounced that members of the Clinton Administration announced yesterday that the Government would invest $28 million in new initiatives to encourage training more programmers. The initiative was announced at a meeting that will continue today with industry officials and academics in Berkeley, Calif., to explore potential solutions.
Under the Administration's plan, which was first reported in The Washington Post, the Labor Department will offer $3 million in grants to schools, businesses and local governments to retrain laid-off workers as programmers, and it will spend another $8 million to build a World Wide Web site where employers can post job offerings and workers can post resumes. The Commerce Department will spend $17 million to bring technology resources, including training, to poor people.
The Administration's initiatives are driven by concern about the economic implications of the programmer shortage when information technology, grossing more than $865 billion a year, is the nation's largest industry, with the software segment growing more than twice as fast as the overall economy.
What is more, the shortage is contributing to a looming crisis known as the year 2000 problem, a legacy of a long-practiced programming economy in which years were denoted with two digits -- using 75 for 1975, for example. Unless all date-sensitive lines of computer code are tracked down and fixed, many businesses and institutions, from banks to government agencies to research labs and air traffic control centers, will be thrown into chaos or simply cease operating on Jan. 1, 2000.
Why the shortfall in programmers? For one thing, in Silicon Valley over the last two years, hundreds of new companies have opened, all hungry for someone -- anyone -- who can string together lines of computer code.
At the same time, the field has yet to recover from a downturn in the late 1980's and early 90's, when downsizing by aerospace companies and big technology concerns like the International Business Machines Corporation and the AT&T Corporation threw many computer scientists out of work and discouraged college students from pursuing computer careers. From a peak of 50,000 in 1986, the number of bachelor's and graduate degrees in computer science plummeted to 36,000 in 1995.
Yet, for students, job security is not the only issue when deciding for or against a career in computer science. Some cite its image: The "nerd factor," marked by the pasty pallor known as a "monitor tan," seems to trump a recent "geek chic" trend in a notoriously antisocial profession. And much of the work is tedious.
"We need a large technical class that is well trained to do work that is mind-numbingly boring," said Eric Roberts, associate director of Stanford University's computer science program.
Over the last two years, the overheated job market has pushed up computer science enrollment, but to nowhere near the level that analysts say will be necessary to meet the industry's needs. Between 1996 and 2006, more than a million new jobs requiring software skills should be created, according to a recent Bureau of Labor Statistics report. That represents a remarkable 6 percent of all new jobs expected to be created in that period.
But those numbers, which make no attempt to measure projected supply, join a slew of other emerging statistics that expose the extent of a labor shortage that could have significant economic repercussions. According to industry estimates, 200,000 to 400,000 jobs requiring computer software skills stand open now.
In Silicon Valley, where the competition for the best and brightest is most fierce, companies like the Netscape Communications Corporation offer perks like car washes at lunch and an in-house dry-cleaning service that provides cubicle-to-cubicle delivery. Alex Musil, a 22-year-old who was hired recently, said he particularly enjoyed Netscape's Le Concierge service, which handles entertainment purchases for employees.
"I bought my parents a cruise through them," said Mr. Musil, who was hired out of Stanford University with an annual salary of $54,000 last year.
Without enough programmers to go around, established companies are being forced to delay or even scrap technology projects, and start-ups are finding it harder to attract the workers they need.
If the talent drought continues, the entire national economy may feel the effect of lost wages and slowed innovation. And the competitive advantage that the United States has long held in technology may be at risk.
"This is like running out of iron ore in the middle of the Industrial Revolution," said Harris N. Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of America, which represents computing and telecommunications companies.
 
Paucity of Recruits
Image and Tedium Repel Students
The most pressing question for both research and industry is how to get more computer scientists into the pipeline.
"Despite the fact that there are huge salaries to be made, kids don't choose these fields," said Richard Skinner, president of Clayton College and State University in Atlanta, who heads a Commerce Department task force on how universities are responding to the labor shortage.
A good programmer needs to exist comfortably in the "machine state," writing and meticulously checking and double-checking hundreds of lines of code that are often just a small part of a much larger project. It is a talent that is hard to come by -- and one often disparaged in mainstream culture.
There are few role models for computer-related jobs, and even people like William H. Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft Corporation and something of a popular icon, tend to be far better known for their achievements as business moguls than for their skills as software engineers.
"Let's face it, when you think of a programmer, the image is an overweight person eating Snickers bars and drinking Coke and sitting in front of a screen with big glasses on," said Ed Lazaowska, chairman of the computer science department at the University of Washington. "The pitch I make to high school kids is: 'Where's the intellectual excitement? Why would you choose civil engineering or mechanical engineering? There's only so much you can do with asphalt.' "
But Tamer Hendi, 19, a student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, sees little that is cool about computer science. "I couldn't see myself doing it," he said. "I'd rather do chemical or industrial engineering, try to get a job where there will be more dealing with people."
At this week's meeting in Berkeley, in the hope of countering the negative image, industry officials recommended a promotion campaign similar to the dairy industry's "Drink Milk" ads that feature basketball and football stars and other celebrities wearing milk mustaches. Such a campaign, which could be sponsored by the computer industry, would promote the positive aspects of information technology and possibly feature industry leaders like Kim Polese, the young founder of the high-profile software start-up Marimba.
Recruiting more women like Ms. Polese to the field is considered crucial because the share of computer science degrees awarded to women in the United States has fallen steadily, to 28 percent in 1994 from a peak of 36 percent in 1984. A more proportional representation of women could go a long way toward meeting the need for programmers.
Only 17 percent of those taking the advanced placement test for computer science in the nation's high schools last year were women, the lowest of any subject. Girls often lack the early math training that many boys get. And in what Jane Margolis, an anthropologist at Carnegie Mellon University, calls the "computer gene" response, many women she has interviewed simply believe they are not born with the ability to do computer science.
At the same time, many women who demonstrate both the aptitude and appetite for programming are turned off by the nature of the work. For example, Zoe Woodworth, 21, who was one of only six women in her freshman computer science class of 100 at Carnegie Mellon, is also one of three who have since dropped out.
"I love math, but I realized I'm just not a computer scientist," Ms. Woodworth said. "I was burned out, and I didn't care about the subject matter. It just seemed passionless." She is now an art major.
The bigger problem may have less to do with image than with reality. The jobs where programmers conceive and design products are rare. The bulk of the openings are for what students refer to derisively as "cubicle hackers" or "code machines," people who type endless streams of commands to someone else's specifications.
Max Edleson, a Stanford freshman who ran a corporate Web site last summer, knows the drudgery. "I got paid a massive amount to sit in front of my computer eight hours a day, but I got physically ill doing it," he said. "I felt this void of thought that I couldn't deal with."
Mr. Edleson, who said he had intended to major in computer science, is now studying philosophy instead.
Even students like Eric Cheng, a much-sought-after Stanford graduate student, have doubts about the profession.
"There's never a question that you won't get a job," Mr. Cheng said. "There's just the question of will you be bored. If you go in the movie theaters around here on opening night of any science fiction or thriller, you can see the people with monitor tans. I just don't want to be like that. I'm looking for more of a balance."
Graham Miller, Mr. Cheng's classmate, is already thinking about an exit strategy. "Programmers only last up to 10 years or so," Mr. Miller said. "After that, you need to find something else to do."
Still, for Mr. Miller and many of his colleagues, the payoff comes with the thrill of solving a problem, of making a program work. "It's about understanding what the computer is thinking," Mr. Miller said.
 
Broader Job Market
Software Producers And Clients Compete
The hunger for programmers is not limited to companies that make software to sell to others. As the nation's corporations reorganize themselves to take advantage of the huge digital file cabinets known as data bases and of communications networks and software that allow them to increase productivity, the high-technology help-wanted ads are increasingly posted by the likes of Wal-Mart, General Motors and Federal Express. In the job market, that leaves the software producers competing against the buyers of their products.
"In the past, it was just I.B.M., Intel and us looking for these people," said David Pritchard, director of recruiting for Microsoft.
Some economists argue that the work force will naturally swell to meet the demand as salaries for those with software skills climb as much as 20 percent annually compared with the 4 percent annual wage increase of the average American worker. The average programmer earned $58,200 in 1995 and $66,500 in 1996, according to the Information Technology Association of America. But a consensus is growing in industry, academic and government circles that the lure of higher pay may not, by itself, be sufficient to correct the skilled-labor shortage.
"This is not like we need hundreds of more sales clerks," said Shirley Tessler, a researcher at the Stanford Computer Industry Project, a group of academicians investigating the shortage. "There is a serious demand for high-end people. We're talking about people to design software for a critical medical device that goes inside your body, to do product management, to manage quality assurance."
Nor is Ms. Tessler particularly encouraged by the increase in computer science enrollment last year. For one thing, not all of the new students -- particularly women -- will stay the course. In addition, almost one-fifth of all computer science students are foreign nationals, many of whom will return to their native countries after graduating.
Already, American technology companies have set up operations in India, Ireland and the Philippines to take advantage of increasingly skilled foreign labor pools. Information industry employers in the United States sponsor some 15,000 foreign professionals under Federal immigration law, which allows 65,000 professional foreign workers to come to the United States each year, and they are lobbying to raise the cap.
But some economists worry about relying on foreign workers to fill the software gap.
"There's a real danger that we'll assume the market will take care of this, and we'll be right -- only it's a global market," said Jeffrey E. Garten, dean of Yale University's School of Management and the former Under Secretary of Commerce for international trade in the Clinton Administration. "Unless we become much more deliberate in how we address this, we'll find that what could be quite good jobs for Americans will all take place abroad."
Even global supplies of technology workers are no longer as available as they once were. India's universities, for instance, turn out 55,000 students in the field each year but are not keeping pace with that nation's rapidly growing software industry.
What is more, the bidding war for software talent, in which corporations can offer stock options and salaries that universities and research institutions cannot match, makes it harder to find people who will devote themselves to the long-term research that might generate the next technological breakthroughs or to teaching the next generation of computer scientists. The number of advanced degrees granted in computer science has stayed flat, at about 1,000 a year, for the last decade, and doctoral students now often choose a dissertation project based not on whether it advances basic knowledge but on whether it represents a viable business opportunity.
"The phrase is 'eating your seed corn,' and we will pay a price for it," said Michael Garey, director of mathematical sciences research at Bell Laboratories. "So many of the bright people are being siphoned off to shorter-term opportunities that we are not doing a good job of building the foundation we're going to need for the next wave of innovation that might occur 10 or 20 years from now."
 
Filling the Void
No Experience Is Necessary
To remove some of the barriers for people who lack experience, the University of Washington has begun offering a "no background" introductory class. But even if such programs succeed in broadening the appeal of the discipline, it will take time to produce employable graduates. Meanwhile, desperate employers are increasingly reaching out to people who have not traditionally considered technology jobs.
Microsoft has set up a division to train its recruits and others who will be hired by corporate customers. The Defense Department is sponsoring a retraining program for aerospace engineers and others who have skills that could translate into computer expertise. Some technology concerns are working with two-year community colleges to train people quickly and to impart the most current skills in a field where knowledge quickly becomes outdated.
Gail Fitzgerald, director of the Computer Task Group in Buffalo, a company that provides entire staffs of information technology specialists to corporations, says she is training almost anyone she can find. After 12 weeks of intensive training, graduates will not be able to design next-generation weapons systems, but they can diagnose certain kinds of computer problems and earn as much as $35,000 a year.
"We've had an accountant, a lawyer, a high school literature teacher, a professor from the University of Alaska, several musicians," Ms. Fitzgerald said. "We find musicians typically have a very good aptitude."
Whatever the frustrations for employers, and however cloudy the outlook for national competitiveness, there is one business group benefiting in a big way from the dearth of digital talent: technology headhunters.
"The demand is insane," said Bob Jacobs, director of engineering recruiting for Interim Search Solutions in San Francisco. "It's a war. I'm on the 37th floor looking at the San Francisco skyline, and I can see 30 different empty floors where they have 20 cubicles, 2 programmers, and $2 million. They need to fill those cubicles."

The number of people earning computer science degrees in the United States each year fell in the 1980's and has been flat since then, while the field drew an increasing number of new workers from overseas.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Soar Like a Falcon . . .;
. . . Sink Like an Overextended Investment Bank

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Jan. 12

 BODY:
With the collapse of Peregrine Investments Holdings today, Asia's biggest underwriter of stocks has disappeared off the map of Asian investment banking just one decade after it was created by a swashbuckling former British racing driver and his Hong Kong partner.
The factors behind Peregrine's downfall were many and complex, and had much to do with its brash -- some would say insolent -- culture. Yet some executives at Peregrine, as well as financiers familiar with its final days, said its demise became inevitable only after First National Bank of Chicago, a unit of First Chicago NBD, its lead banker and an investor in the firm's putative restructuring, pulled out of a proposed rescue effort and canceled financing for Peregrine at the last moment. 
 The flame-out of Peregrine, the largest investment bank in Asia outside of Japan, spread panic through the Hong Kong stock market and raised further questions about the depth and duration of the economic crisis that is ravaging the fruits of more than a decade of explosive regional growth.
Yet, in many ways, Peregrine's downfall was emblematic of the fault lines in the foundations of Asia's once-vaunted economic miracle. Its headlong rush to do deals, its reliance on connections in high places and its willingness to skim the edges of legality and propriety mirrored the region's reckless economic growth and its tolerance of widespread corruption and cronyism.
But even in a part of the world where risk-taking had become the key to economic success, Peregrine stood out. It largely pioneered the market for junk bonds in Asia. After cozying up to the Chinese authorities in Beijing, it became the powerhouse behind virtually every initial listing by Chinese companies on Hong Kong's stock exchange. And it foraged markets -- North Korea, Vietnam and Myanmar -- that few others would go near because of their horrendous human-rights records.
Today, as Peregrine filed for liquidation, Hong Kong's stock market plummeted 8.6 percent, continuing a meltdown that has stripped it of more than one-quarter of its value so far this year. Even so, Hong Kong monetary authorities played down the threat the bank's collapse posed to the financial system. Donald Tsang, Hong Kong's financial secretary, turned down Peregrine's request for assistance over the weekend after a rescue package with a Swiss financial group fell apart. Mr. Tsang said a bailout would not be "in the public interest."
 The market rebounded Tuesday, with the main index rising about 5 percent in midmorning trading.
In the end, analysts here and elsewhere said, it was arrogance that did Peregrine in -- an arrogance emanating from the personality of its founder, Philip Tose of Britain, and his Hong Kong partner, Francis Pak To Leung, and that pervaded the bank's culture. That arrogance, they said, led the company to lend too much money for questionable projects and to exercise too little supervision over managers, and especially over Andre Lee, who ran its highly profitable and nearly autonomous bond department.
As a result, when Asia's financial crisis broke last summer, Peregrine was ill equipped to cope with the fallout. Indeed, it was the failure of an Indonesian taxi-cab company that fatally undermined Hong Kong's premier investment bank.
Sometime last summer, when bullishness was still the sentiment of the day, Peregrine made a bridge loan of $260 million to Steady Safe, run by one of Indonesia's flashiest wheeler dealers, Jopie Widjaya. Mr. Widjaya's dream was to move from his profitable but humdrum Jakarta taxi business, with its fleet of 4,000 cabs, to rail projects, ferries and toll roads. Mr. Widjaya had the right connections; he had even bought a stake in a toll road owned by Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana, the eldest daughter of President Suharto.
Steady Safe had all the elements of a Peregrine-style deal: access to the corridors of power, seemingly assured earnings and sweeping opportunity. The problem was that Peregrine lent the $260 million in American dollars -- fully one-third of Peregrine's capital -- against Steady Safe's revenues in Indonesian rupiah. At the time, Peregrine seemed convinced that the rupiah was sound and that it could soon resell the bonds backing the loan. Moreover, the fixed-income team that cut the deal had earned 38 percent of Peregrine's profits the previous year; this was just one more deal.
Analysts say such confidence was misplaced. Any lender entrusting the equivalent of one-third of its capital to any borrower, much less a little-known company in a country notorious for corruption, shows poor financial judgment, they say.
But far from having second thoughts after the financial turmoil that shook Thailand last July spread throughout Asia, Peregrine remained upbeat. In late October, even though the rupiah had by then lost 30 percent of its value, Peregrine's own weekly analytical reports, boldly titled Greed and Fear, argued that the rupiah's collapse "certainly looks overdone and suggests a countertrend rally may be overdue."
It was not to be.
That same month, rumors began percolating in Hong Kong that Peregrine had taken $1 billion in trading losses, rumors denied by Mr. Tose. But even as he insisted on the bank's solidity, the rupiah was slipping and Peregrine's chairman was looking for an investor to replenish the company's capital.
In November, Mr. Tose, 51, announced that he had struck a deal with Zurich Center Investments Ltd., part of Zurich Group, a Swiss financial-services company, to buy a 24.1 percent stake in Peregrine for $200 million.
But the deal never went through.
According to Zurich Group, the two companies planned to set up an Asian investment fund, called the Peregrine Direct Investment fund, with a commitment of $50 million from each partner and an expected infusion of $350 million to $500 million from institutional investors.
But the continuing financial tumult in Asia apparently made Zurich nervous. A spokeswoman declined to go into details about the group's decision to back away, saying only it was the "end result of the negotiations to rework the conditions" of Zurich's participation.
Meanwhile, events in Indonesia tumbled out of control, and its currency collapsed. Steady Safe, with its earnings in rupiah, could no longer meet payments on its dollar loans, particularly the huge loan from Peregrine. The taxi company's stock sank to a sliver over one penny and, last week, it locked its doors.
As Peregrine's stock continued to slide, trading in the bank's stock was suspended. As Zurich Group was preparing one final offer to Peregrine, there seemed little hope of a deal. "When Zurich came back last week," said a senior Peregrine official who only agreed to speak anonymously, "they were going to buy our bond portfolio for 16 cents on the dollar. The bond portfolio was $600 million plus; there's a lot of good paper in that portfolio. But when you have a situation where they say you have $260 million, $270 million worth of bad paper, they say, 'What else have you done?' It just snowballed."
At the table with Zurich was First Chicago, one of Peregrine's principal creditors. At about one o'clock in the morning on Friday, First Chicago left the negotiations. "Zurich walked away six hours later," said the Peregrine official. "It just unraveled from there."
A spokesman for First Chicago declined to comment. But executives at both Peregrine and Zurich said today that First Chicago had initially pledged $25 million for a small stake in Peregrine, then had a change of heart. First Chicago's departure from the negotiations Friday morning prompted Zurich's decision to throw in the towel, they said, in part because it did not wish to raise its stake in the company significantly beyond 24 percent.
"They did not want to go up to 35 percent and make a general offer," as required by Hong Kong law whenever a buyer's stake exceeds 30 percent, a Peregrine executive said.
Meanwhile, Peregrine executives desperately tried to salvage something from the fiasco, maintaining that the firm's brokerage and corporate-finance businesses would make good acquisitions for the right buyer. "We still have a first-class franchise and it would be highly regrettable if that was not kept intact," said Timothy Voake, chief executive officer of Peregrine Brokerage Inc., which has headquarters in New York.
After the collapse of negotiations in Hong Kong, a news conference announcing a deal was abandoned. Swiftly, the Securities and Futures Commission ordered Peregrine to stop all trading activities. Peregrine's seat on the stock exchange was also suspended.
Peregrine was bust. Scarcely six months ago, Peregrine was the enfant terrible of Asian banking, a champion of "buccaneering" as Mr. Tose put it.
"One of Peregrine's great advantages in its heyday was to commit its own capital rapidly to transactions, with bridge loans, for example," said Richard Margolis of Merrill Lynch (Asia Pacific) Ltd. "It could take decisions quickly."
Peregrine was created in 1988 on $38 million raised by Messrs. Tose and Leung -- both refugees from Citibank's foundering investment banking venture -- from some of Hong Kong's tycoons, including Li Ka-shing, a leading property and infrastructure developer; Gordon Wu, an Asian infrastructure developer, and Larry Yung, China's principal investment banker here. Peregrine grew exponentially, with Mr. Tose and Mr. Leung capitalizing on personal contacts cultivated over the previous decade. Both men enjoyed lavish life styles.
Connections, combined with speedy decision-making and a penchant for risk, catapulted the bank forward. And it rushed in where others hesitated to tread. Typical was Peregrine's response to China's massacre of civilians in Tiananmen Square in June 1989. "These events were just a hiccup," Mr. Leung said in an interview two years ago. "We decided we wanted to take advantage of depressed market conditions at the time."
Quickly, Peregrine emerged as one of the largest underwriters in Hong Kong. And while China and Hong Kong remained the core of the bank's business, it spread its wings and splashed offices across 14 countries.
Even Asia's widespread culture of corruption did not seem to trouble Mr. Tose. After all, he said in an interview with The South China Morning Post last year, it is "quite an open form of corruption."
"It is not stalling advances in Asia," he added, "but is an accepted way of life in many ways."
Unfortunately for Peregrine, though, it often ruffled the feathers of local authorities. In Vietnam, it formed Peregrine Capital Vietnam with a fast-talking nightclub owner and car dealer named Nguyen Trung Truc, for example. Shortly afterward, Mr. Truc's other businesses were raided by tax authorities, and he wound up spending most of the year in jail for tax evasion. Peregrine itself was fined for operating a business without proper licenses.
Last June, although storm clouds were rapidly gathering on Asia's economic horizons, Peregrine was buoyant. It reported hefty profits for the first six months of $82.5 million (United States) on revenues of $19.6 billion.
When the end came this weekend, however, many people were asking why Peregrine's vaunted connections with some of Hong Kong's wealthiest and most powerful people did not result in the firm's rescue.
As the day wore on today, hundreds of customers shuttled in and out of Peregrine's brokerage operations to close their accounts.
"I was very surprised," said K. Chan, a 60-year-old retiree. "I've been with Peregrine for six or seven years. I'm going to transfer my stocks to another company." But, Mr. Chan continued, Hong Kong was not to blame. "What happened to Peregrine was caused by external forces, the Southeast Asian currencies," he said. "It's not because of Hong Kong itself."

Indonesian Leader Vows Support for I.M.F. Plan
President Suharto of Indonesia committed himself to vigorous enforcement of economic reforms that his country had spurned, an apparent acknowledgment that he has little choice but to send the message that the conditions of the I.M.F.'s bailout of Indonesia will be observed.
While his comments calmed Indonesia's markets, they did little to allay concerns about his hold on power. Page A1. 

Some liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans are stepping up criticism of the Asian bailouts supported by the Clinton Administration, putting the White House under additional pressure as it prepares to ask Congress for more money. D3.
 
The Asian crisis is slowing a military spending spree that has thrown American, European and Russian arms makers into competition for billions of dollars in weapons sales. A1.
 
Wall St. Withstands Asia Pressure
United States stocks recovered from early losses set off by sharp overnight selloffs in Asia. The comeback -- the Dow industrials rose 66.76 points, to 7,647.18 -- suggested that some investors continue to bet that the Asian crisis will not have a severe impact on American corporate earnings. D8.
 
The early plunge in stocks drove investors to buy Treasuries, but the gains in bond prices were pared later in the day. The yield on the two-year note, which has fallen sharply in the last week, was unchanged at 5.17 percent, after falling to 5.02. The 30-year bond yield fell to 5.69 percent from 5.73. D8.
 
Purchases of stock mutual funds reached a second consecutive record in 1997. The growth suggested that the slump in Asia's markets that began last summer has done little so far to dull hunger for mutual funds. D9.
 
A Shortage of Programmers
Help-wanted ads for computer programmers are multiplying and often going unfilled. The talent shortage is so pronounced that the Clinton Administration announced that the Government would invest in new initiatives to encourage training of programmers. A1.

Sun Microsystems plans to overhaul its work station business, adding lower-priced machines, in response to competition from increasingly powerful PC's. D5.
 
Microsoft Broadens Bias Charge
Microsoft said it had new evidence that a court-appointed adviser harbored prejudice against the software company in its struggle with the Justice Department and that he should be removed. The adviser, Prof. Lawrence Lessig of Harvard Law School, has broad powers to help determine whether Microsoft is illegally attempting to dominate the market for Internet software. D2.

HEADLINE: AIDS GROUP URGES NEW YORK TO START REPORTING OF H.I.V.

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON 

 BODY:
The Gay Men's Health Crisis, the nation's leading AIDS service agency, is reversing its position and calling for New York doctors to report H.I.V.-positive people to the State Health Department. The same practice is used for infectious diseases like syphilis and tuberculosis.
The official statement by the organization, the most politically and economically connected group in the world of nonprofit AIDS service, signifies the collapse of a long-standing consensus by AIDS and civil rights groups against H.I.V. reporting. 
 Every state requires doctors to report AIDS cases to public health officials. But officials in New York and California and many other states have not required similar reports about patients who have the AIDS virus but do not have full-blown AIDS.
Influential groups of advocates for people with AIDS, including the Gay Men's Health Crisis, have resisted those efforts, arguing that requiring reports would keep people worried about confidentiality from being tested and treated early.
Whatever New York decides will be significant. Others states tend to look to New York in formulating their own AIDS policy, and a change in Albany could well lead to policy changes in other states.
In a policy statement to be released tomorrow, the group said clinical advances and the need for the most up-to-date information on H.I.V. infection demanded new approaches, and that a system that simply tracked people with AIDS was no longer an effective measure of the extent of the epidemic. The group said that assuring strong safeguards for privacy was as important as ever, but that the large numbers of people who are infected but who do not have full-blown AIDS make it essential that accurate tracking of H.I.V. cases begin.
The statement, an advance copy of which was supplied to The New York Times, does not explicitly oppose reporting names, but instead urges that the state consider using coded identification systems.
 "This is not a static epidemic and our position cannot be a static position," Ronald S. Johnson, a managing director of the organization, said in an interview. "It certainly is a change. We look at it more as a progression in our thinking."
The group, which is based in New York and has an annual budget of roughly $27 million, has been a formidable lobbying force in Washington and Albany, particularly in matters like quicker access to new drugs, increased government financing for AIDS services, and resisting policies viewed as a threat to the civil liberties of its constituency. Its board of directors, contributors and volunteers include a cross section of New York's business, social and professional elite.
A move to H.I.V. reporting in New York would most likely require new state law. No action in Albany is expected until the New York State Advisory Council, which advises the Governor and the Legislature on AIDS policy, makes its recommendations on H.I.V. reporting, expected by March.
Twenty-eight states, including New Jersey, now have H.I.V. reporting for both adults and adolescents. Those states, however, account for about 24 percent of all AIDS cases reported. New York, which does not require H.I.V. reporting, has the highest rate of reported AIDS cases, 69 per 100,000 people. The comparable number is 47 for New Jersey, 37 for Connecticut, and 26 for California.
H.I.V. reporting in New York State would greatly expand -- by thousands -- the number of infected people listed in Government registries, arousing concern about invasion of privacy and discrimination. As many as 150,000 people statewide are believed to be H.I.V. positive, of whom about 80 percent are New York City residents, according to the State Health Department.
A move to H.I.V. reporting would provide a more accurate picture of the epidemic and could lead to earlier treatment. But some advocates for AIDS patients suggest that the policy could open the door to more intrusive and coercive measures, such as tracking down the sexual and needle-sharing partners of infected people. The Gay Men's Health Crisis position paper said it opposes linking H.I.V. reporting to such activities.
In recent months, many advocacy groups have softened their position on H.I.V. reporting because powerful new drugs have delayed many patients' progression to AIDS-related illnesses and death. Most organizations, however, have remained publicly opposed to reporting the names of H.I.V.-positive people to health departments, favoring instead the use of coded identification.
The organization's statement is not explicit in opposing H.I.V. name reporting. The statement says a system of coded identification should be used to monitor H.I.V. infections in New York State, and cited the "unique identifier" systems used in Maryland and Texas as models.
Late last week, the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta announced that a three-year evaluation of the Maryland and Texas systems had found that tracking H.I.V. by codes did not reliably count the cases. The evaluation of the two states concluded that the codes were often incomplete, making it difficult to link them to real people.
Mr. Johnson, of the Health Crisis, said more resources needed to be spent to develop a viable coded identification system. "The Maryland and Texas approaches showed flaws, but they don't necessarily demonstrate that the unique identifier system is impossible," he said.
His organization's new position has dismayed some advocates for AIDS patients, who had hoped that the group would make opposition to the use of names the bedrock of its policy.
"It's disappointing," said Jeffrey L. Reynolds, a member of the state AIDS Advisory Council and the policy director at the Long Island Association for AIDS Care, based in Huntington. "There's so much at stake here. This is the most critical issue that the AIDS community has faced in a decade. And they've taken a middle-of-the-road position. They should have come out with guns blaring and they didn't."
Few groups now oppose H.I.V. reporting in general. The American Civil Liberties Union and the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund do not oppose the approach as long as coded identification is used. That position is also shared by AIDS Action, a national group for 2,500 community providers of AIDS service, AIDS Project Los Angeles and the San Francisco AIDS Foundation.
The New York State AIDS Advisory Council has a special work group on H.I.V. reporting, of which Mr. Reynolds is a co-chairman. The work group has reached a consensus that H.I.V. reporting is necessary. But after its meeting yesterday, Mr. Reynolds said that the question of choosing name or coded identification was still a contentious one. The work group will submit recommendations that will go to a vote before the full council in several weeks.
Even so, the outcome in New York State is inevitable, according to some AIDS policy experts.
"It will move to a system of H.I.V. reporting and ultimately it will go to name reporting," said Lawrence O. Gostin, a director of the Georgetown University-Johns Hopkins University Program on Law and Public Health and a member of the Centers for Disease Control's advisory committee. "New York is the most important state in the country in terms of the AIDS epidemic. It's a matter of time."
Mark Barnes, a health care lawyer in New York City and a former director of AIDS programs in the City Health Department, said many advocates believed that a coded identification system was not workable but that they felt they must satisfy their constituencies. Mr. Barnes said the state was likely to move to name-based H.I.V. reporting gradually, perhaps after experimenting with a coded identification system.
"This train has left the station," he said.

Asian Turmoil Putting Brakes On Arms Race

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, Jan. 12

 BODY:
The economic crisis in Asia is beginning to have an unforeseen consequence: slowing a military spending spree that has thrown American, European and Russian arms makers into a heated competition for billions of dollars in weapons sales.
In recent years, Asia, particularly Southeast Asia, had become the big growth market for fighters, missiles, tanks and other modern armaments, much to the dismay of arms-control advocates in the United States and other countries. 
 Until now, that is, when the collapse of currencies and spending constraints imposed by international bailout deals are starting to achieve in a few months what all those advocates could not do in years.
The big weapons buyers in Asia are abandoning some major arms deals and postponing ambitious plans for others.
Thailand has asked the United States to help renegotiate its purchase of eight F/A-18 fighter jets for $400 million. In the last week alone, Indonesia announced that it would put off plans to buy $1 billion in Russian weapons, while South Korea said it would delay the purchase of four Awacs, the American-made electronic surveillance jets.
While it is not clear how long the economic crisis will last, the contagion that has swept economies from Malaysia to South Korea could erode one of the few growing markets for American-made weaponry. The prospect is stirring concern at the Pentagon and among the nation's military contractors, who fear that a prolonged downturn could slash sales the Pentagon relies on to keep production costs lower for its own purchases.
"There will certainly be a hiccup of sorts in the Asian procurement," said Joel L. Johnson, vice president of the Aerospace Industries Association, a trade organization in Washington that represents aircraft manufacturers. "The question is whether it's going to be just a hiccup or an Asian flu that could last a long time."
Arriving here on the first stop of a 12-day tour of Asia, Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen pledged that the United States would do what it could to help the countries weather the storm, using its leverage with American manufacturers to help salvage weapons purchases.
"Obviously, we are interested in helping these countries who are experiencing difficulties right now also deal with their security concerns -- by either stretching out or finding some other method of payment or some deferral of payments in order to accommodate them," Mr. Cohen said today at a news conference with Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister, Anwar Ibrahim, at a resort south of here.
Mr. Cohen's trip to Asia -- particularly Southeast Asia -- was meant to underscore longstanding American security interests in the region. While security issues remain high on the agenda, the economic crises in Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea -- all of which he is to visit -- will loom large over most of Mr. Cohen's trip.
Perhaps the clearest indication of the trip's changing agenda was the last-minute addition of an official from the Treasury, Todd Crawford, to Mr. Cohen's military entourage.
For major American arms makers, the market in Asia remains relatively small compared to the Pentagon's spending on weapons procurement, which totals roughly $45 billion this year. Arms exports, which are strictly controlled by the State Department, are expected to reach $14 billion to $16 billion, of which no more than a quarter are headed to Asia.
But at a time when the Pentagon has faced budget restraints, Asia has been one of the only growing markets, except for the flurry of purchases in the Middle East after the Persian Gulf war.
After the cold war, the "tiger" economies in Southeast Asia in particular set out to use their deep financial reserves to modernize their militaries, even though they faced no immediate security threats.
Six of the seven countries Mr. Cohen will visit during his trip have spent more than $3 billion on American arms over the last three years. American law forbids the export of weapons to the seventh, China.
Advocates of arms control have sharply criticized the Asian arms buildup, as well as Washington's eagerness to supply it, saying the rush to modernize could destabilize the region by stoking lingering fears and dormant hostilities.
Caleb Rossiter, director of Demilitarization for Democracy, an arms- control group in Washington, called many of the purchases "prestige buys," meant merely to enhance the standing of one country or another in the region.
But he said countries like Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia have also been trying to expand their ability to use force beyond their borders and into the shipping lanes of the South China Sea, where there are potentially dangerous territorial disputes over several island groups.
"Everybody wants to project power," Mr. Rossiter said.
For now, at least, the economic crisis has ended that.
Malaysia, which has seen the value of its currency, the ringgit, drop by half, has revised its budget to scrap plans to spend $500 million to $600 million to buy new equipment, including American attack helicopters, armored vehicles and possibly several F/A-18 fighters.
At the news conference today with Mr. Cohen, Mr. Anwar, the Deputy Prime Minister, said Malaysia had "to defer many of our earlier commitments," although it remained committed to insuring "a sufficient modern, capable military force."
Mr. Cohen said today that he had not discussed sales during his meetings today with Mr. Anwar or the Prime Minister, Mahathir bin Mohamad. And he and his aides have tried to play down the impact the economic crisis was having on arms sales, saying the Administration's main priority was to restore economic stability generally, even if that meant a temporary retrenchment in sales.
But sales are certain to come up during Mr. Cohen's trip.
The Pentagon has already promised to help Thailand, which Mr. Cohen will visit on Friday, to renegotiate its purchase of eight F/A-18's. The deal, signed in 1996, cost Thailand nearly $400 million that it now can ill afford to pay, even as the jets' manufacturer, Boeing, moves ahead with production.
Thailand, like South Korea, has had to cut its military spending as part of the austerity measures imposed by the International Monetary Fund in exchange for a $17 billion rescue plan. While the F/A-18's are the largest single purchase, Thailand may also have to postpone plans to buy other systems as well, including armored personnel carriers.
One official traveling with Mr. Cohen said it was important to demonstrate to countries in the region, which have also been looking to buy from European and Russian manufacturers, that the United States could be a reliable, flexible seller, even in times of crisis.
Although officials declined to specify how the Pentagon and Boeing might restructure the F/A-18 deal, the United States may simply allow Thailand to delay payments on the aircraft or find another buyer.
It is a measure of the priority given to supporting American arms manufacturers and the jobs they create that there has been no talk of simply canceling the sale.

Iraq Threatens To Block U.N. Arms Inspectors
Iraq threatened to block the work of a new team of United Nations arms inspectors that has nine American members. The United Nations official in charge of the inspections said they would go on. A4 

Proposals Emerge for Belfast
The Irish and British Governments agreed on proposals that they hoped would result in a lasting settlement of its sectarian strife. The proposals include the creation of a new elected Ulster legislature and a new council, with members from Wales, Scotland, England and the two Irelands, that would meet twice a year and consult on Irish questions. A3
 
West Aids Bosnian Serb
Though candidates backed by the Bosnian Serb President, Biljana Plavsic, won only 15 of 83 seats in elections in November, her Western supporters have worked hard to block those loyal to her rival, Radovan Karadzic, from obtaining a parliamentary majority. Western diplomats say the government of the Bosnian Serb republic will soon be in her hands despite the fact that supporters of Dr. Karadzic hold 39 of the 42 seats needed for a majority. A3
 
Some Germans Fight The Euro
A prominent group of lawyers and former bankers petitioned Germany's highest court to prevent their country from joining Europe's proposed single currency, the euro. Experts gave the petition little chance of success, but its arguments showed the ambivalence in attitudes toward the idea of abandoning the traditionally strong German mark. A3
 
Official Charged in Mexico
Federal prosecutors in Mexico have accused a state police commander of helping to arm a gang of paramilitary gunmen who killed 45 Indian villagers in December. The charges were the first filed against police and state Government officials who have been under investigation in the massacre. Federal prosecutors indicated that their investigation was closing in on higher state officials who might have provided direct support to the killers. A8
 
Sex Discrimination In Mexico
The United States Labor Department, concluding a six-month review of charges of sex discrimination in Mexico, concluded that thousands of border assembly plants administer medical tests to weed out pregnant applicants and harass pregnant workers to coerce their resignation. Others dismiss pregnant workers to avoid paying maternity benefits, the Department said. A8
 
U.N. Fills New Deputy Post
A French Canadian, Louise Frechette, was named the first Deputy Secretary General in United Nations history. Ms. Frechette, who is resigning as Canada's Deputy Minister of National Defense, will help Secretary General Kofi Annan finish the job of redesigning the United Nations administration. She served as Canada's United Nations representative from 1992 to 1994. A9

Cold and Loss of Power Grip Canada and Maine
At least 15 people have died since a storm began to lash Eastern Canada on Jan. 5. Hydro-Quebec, the provincial-owned utility company, reported that 625,000 residences in Montreal and outlying areas were still without electricity. It will take up to two weeks to restore service to all customers, utility executives said. And since a brief thaw over the weekend, temperatures have dropped 25 to 30 degrees. Already, more than 10,000 people are living in 120 temporary shelters in Montreal. A1
 
Storm damage in Northern New England was expected to run in the tens of millions of dollars. Governor Angus King of Maine called the storm "the biggest disaster of this kind that has ever hit this state." A14
 
Warning on F.A.A. Computers
A set of crucial computers in the nation's air traffic control system should not be used beyond December 1999, because they may not operate reliably when the date rolls over to Jan. 1, 2000, and there is no way to predict the effect on air traffic, according to I.B.M., which built the computers. But the official in charge of that system at the Federal Aviation Administration said "it would be an extraordinary feat" to replace about 40 mainframe computers by then. A16
 
Unabom Suspect Examined
Theodore J. Kaczynski appeared to be cooperating with the court-appointed psychiatrist who arrived in Sacramento, Calif., to evaluate his competency to stand trial on Federal charges of being the Unabomber, a spokesman for the Sacramento County Sheriff said. A10
 
$1 Trillion in Health Spending
Health spending increased in 1996 at the lowest rate in 36 years, but topped $1 trillion for the first time, the Government reported. Such spending has been growing at the same pace as the economy for four years in a row, contrary to earlier projections, which showed health care eating up a bigger and bigger share of the nation's output. A15
 
Gay Rights Appeal Fails
A woman who lost a promised job as a lawyer in the Georgia Attorney General's office, after the state Attorney General learned that she was planning a marriage ceremony with her lesbian partner, failed to persuade the United States Supreme Court to hear her appeal. A15
 
More Realism for Safety Ads
Dr. Ricardo Martinez, the administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said that the Federal Government planned to help produce television advertisements that would promote safe driving by showing graphic re-enactments of automobile crashes. He also criticized Hollywood for encouraging reckless driving by failing to show the pain and suffering caused by the car crashes that so frequently occur in movies and television shows. A17

Major AIDS Group Changes Policy on H.I.V. Reporting
The Gay Men's Health Crisis, the nation's leading AIDS service agency, has reversed its position and will call for New York doctors to report people infected with H.I.V. to state health departments. The same practice is already used for infectious diseases like syphilis and tuberculosis. The official statement by the Gay Men's Health Crisis, the most politically and economically connected organization in the world of nonprofit AIDS service, signifies the collapse of a longstanding consensus by AIDS and civil rights groups against H.I.V. reporting.

Mayor Takes Aim at Jaywalking
Mayor Giuliani said he would seek an increase in jaywalking fines and might order police officers to start giving summonses to offenders. Mr. Giuliani said that he hoped that his anti-jaywalking initiatives and other measures, like the erection of pedestrian barriers at some midtown Manhattan intersections, would help reshape New York into a city where pedestrians actually obeyed "Don't Walk" signs, and tangos with cars were not considered street theater.

HEADLINE: No Need to Panic Over Social Security

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your Jan. 8 news article on Social Security was correct in reporting the wide difference of opinion among policy makers about what changes are necessary to insure its future solvency. However, solid economic evidence exists to suggest that Social Security is not heading for a crisis. 
 The projected bankruptcy of Social Security in 2029 is based on an average economic growth rate of just 1.7 percent from now until 2029. However, for the last 25 years economic growth has averaged 2.5 percent.
With a conservative growth rate of 2.2 percent annually, the trust fund shortfall would be 1.5 percent of taxable payroll, not the 2.2 percent gap projected by the Social Security trustees. This translates into a gap between input and output of $25 billion a year beginning in 2029. Such a gap is manageable. The future ratio of working-age adults to the elderly and children virtually guarantees that we will be able to finance the system in the future without cutting benefits. While minor adjustments may be necessary, it would be premature to rush to raise the eligibility age or move to privatization.

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Reduction of the $5 trillion Federal debt should be the primary use for the budget surplus (Op-Ed, Jan. 9). Interest payments consume about one-seventh of annual Federal outlays, an excessive amount. These payments are unproductive, conferring little social, political or economic benefit. In fact, many of these payments go abroad, benefiting no domestic objectives. Foreign-held bonds may be cashed in a crisis, leading to a rise in United States loan rates. 
 Reducing our interest payments reduces the need for revenue and increases the money available for worthy objectives like Social Security and Medicare.

Stocks Rally After Recovering From Overnight Selloff in Asia

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Stocks staged a muted rally yesterday, recovering from early losses that were set off by sharp overnight selloffs in Asia.
The comeback suggested that some investors continue to bet that the Asian crisis will not have a severe impact on the fourth-quarter results of many American companies, which are due in the next few weeks. 
 Large multinational companies like Caterpillar, Procter & Gamble, Pfizer and Merck, which are seen as having only a limited exposure to the Asian crisis, were among the stocks that led major market indexes higher yesterday.
But banking stocks, including Citicorp and J. P. Morgan, faltered, and technology shares were mixed -- Oracle and Compaq Computer were lower, as Intel, Microsoft and Dell Computer eked out gains -- indicating that investors still have concerns about Asia's impact on certain sectors.
"There are very mixed reviews," said Paul Rich, an equity trader at BT Brokerage in New York. "There's optimism about other markets where we have more exposure, such as Europe, but we continue to see selling."
The global wave of selling began in Hong Kong, where the main stock index fell 8.7 percent after the largest Asian investment firm outside of Japan, Peregrine Investments Holdings Ltd., collapsed. At the same time, concerns mounted about the crisis in Indonesia, while in Thailand, the currency, the baht, fell to an all-time low.
While the selling slowed on European markets, the Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 137 points in the first half-hour of trading, extending a slide on Friday, when the Dow fell 222.20 points, or 2.9 percent. Stocks soon recovered, and the Dow closed up 66.76 points, or nine-tenths of 1 percent, at 7,647.18.
The Standard & Poor's 500 company stock index rose 11.52 points, to 939.21, after falling as low as 912.83. The Nasdaq composite index rose 4.36 points, to 1,507.58.
The early selloff dropped stocks to prices that whet the appetite of bargain hunters, analysts said. Investors may also have been heartened by the comments from some market analysts who are forecasting that despite Asia's malaise fourth-quarter earnings could come in better than expected.
"It's not as if Asia doesn't matter, but we think that the impact on the U.S. will be muted," said Abby Joseph Cohen, co-chairwoman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs & Company.
Most United States companies are well diversified, Ms. Cohen said, and are benefiting from a strong domestic economy.
As a result, she said, "the fourth quarter could be a good quarter." But markets will continue to be volatile, she added, because investors will be nervous about earnings growth until companies actually report performance.
Byron Wien, a managing director and United States investment strategist for Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company, said, "The Asian situation has not been arrested yet, but it's getting worse at a slower rate."
A traditional influx of cash into equity mutual funds during January is also driving purchases when stock prices drop, said Timothy M. Stevenson, a senior portfolio manager for First Capital Group, a unit of First Union Bank in Charlotte, N.C. Many portfolio managers who did not perform as well as the Standard & Poor's 500 index in 1997 feel compelled to be fully invested, he said.
While about $917 million flowed into equity mutual funds last week, mostly into large-cap growth funds and growth and income funds, that paled compared with the $8.9 billion that flowed into such funds in the period a year ago, said Robert Adler, president of AMG Data Services in Arcata, Calif.
Last week, bond funds saw cash inflows of more than $700 million, Mr. Adler said, another sign of the mixed views of investors about the near-term outlook for United States companies.

Party Of Lincoln

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
Bring back Ralph Reed!
More than one leading Republican moderate said as much to me over the past week as the post-Reed religious right came close to pushing the party into its bloodiest civil war yet, threatening to split it on class, religious and gender lines. As long as the pragmatic Mr. Reed and his slick machine, the Christian Coalition, were the most visible G.O.P. theocrats, there was always some hope that backroom compromises or Sunday-morning-TV spin would soften or camouflage the most extreme jihads of Pat Buchanan or Pat Robertson before they scared away the center of the American electorate. 
 No more. Mr. Reed is now a hired political gun moving to the center himself; he's seen the gender gap and speaks openly of a pro-choice candidate on the Republican ticket. His old boss, Mr. Robertson, is busy counting the zillions from the sale of his Family Channel to Rupert Murdoch. The Christian Coalition is off the media screen, except as an object of ridicule in the hit movie "Scream 2"; its contributions are down, its staff downsized, its much-publicized outreach to inner cities jettisoned. Into this vacuum has stepped Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council, and Mr. Bauer, in contrast to Mr. Reed, is a religious crusader first, a P.R.-minded, deal-making pol last.
It was Mr. Bauer -- emboldened by his humiliation of Bob Dole in the '96 platform fight and by conservative press clips touting him as a plausible Presidential candidate in 2000 -- who led the charge that brought the G.O.P. to the brink this week. The weapon of his insurgency is a resolution to be voted on by the Republican National Committee at its winter meeting beginning in California tomorrow. It calls for the party to withhold money from any candidate who won't support a ban on so-called partial birth abortion -- a litmus test that would in effect cast the two most prominent G.O.P. winners of last fall, Rudolph Giuliani and Christine Todd Whitman, out of their own party, not to mention both Maine Senators, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins.
Such is the religious right's clout within the G.O.P. machinery that through last weekend the measure was thought to be a possible winner -- with no less a sage than George Will hoping on TV that it could pass. But few predict that victory now. Except for Steve Forbes, who bizarrely embraces the same religious conservatives who tried to bait him about his father's gay life style in '96, most of the mainstream Republican establishment has suddenly circled wagons against the resolution.
What prompted the about-face? The Republican Leadership Council, an organization formed by economically conservative G.O.P. donors to foster "social inclusion" in their party, spoke up big time, raising the specter that they and their rapidly growing purse would bolt the Republican National Committee if the resolution passed. But not only fat-cat and pro-choice forces balked. Knowing that another perceived party cave-in to religious-right bullying would send a disastrous signal of intolerance to moderate voters, Michigan's pro-life Governor, John Engler, and Matthew Brooks, director of the major Republican Jewish group, the National Jewish Coalition, sounded early alarms. The outcry jolted Jim Nicholson, the R.N.C. chairman, out of his studious neutrality, setting off a stampede.
Mr. Bauer isn't going away, however, even if his forces are for once slapped down. A true believer, he'll keep pushing the party not just for his religious orthodoxy on abortion, school prayer and gay civil rights but on the economic issue of free trade. His campaign to fight Christian persecution in China by restricting American business there -- and his Buchananesque contempt for the G.O.P. of "Wall Street and the Fortune 500" -- could divide the party as violently as abortion. Nor is his class and religious warfare without serious cheerleaders. William Kristol's Weekly Standard this week promotes abortion as the "central issue" of 2000 and calls for reversing Roe v. Wade; National Review has bashed Christine Whitman as much for her class pedigree as for her views.
Both sides of the G.O.P. have tried to appropriate the mantle of Lincoln, with religious conservatives equating moral opposition to abortion to opposition to slavery, and moderates likening a woman's right to choose to Lincoln's belief in individual freedom. Either way, a party divided against itself with such vehemence cannot stand.

HEADLINE: Business Travel: Who Needs Sidewalks?;
Many 'Road Warriors' Prefer Airport Hotels to Downtown.

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
Whenever Dirk Van Dongen flies here on business, as he does often, he checks into the O'Hare Hilton and rarely leaves the premises until he checks out to fly back home.
"Of 17 trips to Chicago in 1997, I've only been to downtown Chicago one time," said Mr. Van Dongen, president of the Washington-based National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, "We hold our meetings in the hotel because it's convenient, efficient and enjoyable." 
 Convenient? Obviously. Efficient? O.K. But enjoyable? At an airport hotel, where if you stroll out to see a show, it will be a ballet of landings and takeoffs?
Yet strange as it might seem, legions of travelers are making such hotels their first choice -- from business travelers who do not want to fight traffic into and out of a city to a growing number of newlyweds en route to honeymoons.
Most of the hotels in and around O'Hare International Airport, the world's busiest with almost 69.2 million passengers in 1996, are consistently filled.
The 858-room O'Hare Hilton, the only one of the 20 O'Hare airport hotels actually on the airport grounds, is perpetually one of the most crowded. "Road warriors from all over live here, and we have lots of repeat business," said Kenneth M. Smith, the hotel's general manager.
And why have so many of the lodging industry's ugly ducklings been transformed into swans? It is no mystery. As record nationwide hotel occupancies and record airline traffic have created a huge demand for hotel rooms, almost any hotel rooms, airport hotels suddenly do not look so bad. And to keep guests coming back, at steadily rising rates, hotel companies have been pouring millions into renovations and amenities. The strategy has paid off in spades.
Through the first 10 months of 1997, the 72.4 percent occupancy rate at airport hotels outperformed every other part of the hotel industry, according to Smith Travel Research. And their $77.89 average room rate, up 8.2 percent over the corresponding 10 months in 1996, is higher than the industrywide average of $75.22.
The lobby of the O'Hare Hilton, with 10 check-in desks, airline arrival and departure monitors, and an American Airlines check-in desk, could easily be mistaken for an extension of Terminal 2, less than a two-minute walk away.
But the terminal does not have private mailboxes for its most frequent guests, who on arrival need only open their mailbox to find their electronic room key, messages or packages. Nor does it have 37 conference rooms, all with fax machines, nor a busy athletic club with all the bells and whistles. A short putt from the athletic club is a simulated golf course, which, the New Jersey-born Mr. Smith said with a knowing smile, "is a huge hit during Chicago winters."
"Eighty percent of our lodging cash flow comes from 25 of the 60 hotels we own and/or manage," said Marc Grossman, corporate spokesman for Hilton Hotels, which also franchises 160 more hotels. "And 6 of those 25," he added, "are airport hotels." One of those 6, the O'Hare Hilton, is consistently among Hilton's top 10.
But there are other stellar performers. In and around San Francisco International Airport, where Hilton and almost every other national chain are represented, the lodging market is going through the roof.
"It's the most buoyant hotel market in California and the fastest-growing hotel market in the nation," said Anwar Elgonemy, a consultant with PKF Consulting. Through September of last year, he said, occupancy at those San Francisco airport hotels averaged 87.7 percent, compared with 85.8 percent in the comparable period in 1996, and rates soared nearly 20 percent, to $92.40 from $77.35.
Similar patterns exist elsewhere. Both the O'Hare Hilton and the nearby Hyatt Regency O'Hare report average occupancy rates of 85 percent and 76 percent, respectively, higher than the 72.5 percent average occupancy rate for Chicago hotels through the first nine months of 1997. And the 111-room Radisson Airport Hotel in Warwick, R.I., across from T. F. Green Airport, which serves Providence, has averaged close to 94.6 percent full since July 1.
Robert Stone, president and chief executive of Access Solutions, a software development company, stays several nights a week in the Radisson, which is owned and operated by Johnson & Wales University in Providence. "I like the layout of its rooms, its food and its service," he said. "And the executive suites make good small meeting rooms."
The Radisson also offers weekend entertainment and lodging packages. Through May it is offering discount tickets to concerts with the Boston Festival Orchestra and the Chorus of Westerly, and packages to performances of the Rhode Island Philharmonic Orchestra. And it is not alone. The Comfort Inn-Cleveland Airport Hotel recently offered a package that includes two free tickets to the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame.
For travelers of modest means, there is, of course, a downside. San Francisco airport hotels are now so popular, Mr. Elgonemy said, that the airline crews and budget-minded travelers of the early 1990's "have been pushed out and replaced by high-yielding corporate and group meeting accounts."
At Hilton airport hotels, 45 percent of guests are individual business travelers, 23 percent are attending company or association meetings, and 11 percent are airline and airport personnel. Individual leisure travelers make up 17 percent, while tour groups account for 3 percent and "other" accounts for 1 percent.
The high occupancies and high rates are igniting a race among hotel companies to acquire even more airport hotels.
Hilton, for example, already has 39 airport hotels in its portfolio and is building a $100 million, 600-room hotel at Logan International Airport in Boston. "We're basically at all the major airports in the country, except La Guardia," said Robert E. Dirks, Hilton's head of marketing, referring to La Guardia Airport in New York. "And when it makes good economic sense, we'll be there, too."
Hilton has also staked out airports in smaller markets, where full-service hotels might not make economic sense but Hilton Garden Inns might. Other hotel companies also have similar limited-service facilities at smaller airports.
The 97-room Ramada Limited Airport Hotel in Oklahoma City, which catered to truckers before its remodeling three years ago, does not have a restaurant, but it has rates between $55 and $65 and attractive Victorian decor and four-poster beds.
"We're not as big as some of the hotels around here, but we get lots of meetings and plenty of small-business travelers," said Sherry Sparks, the hotel's director of sales. "And our occupancy is regularly above 90 percent."
Marriott International added a twist to the concept of smaller, less expensive chain hotels when, at a cost of $8.5 million, it converted its 782-room hotel at the Miami International Airport two years ago into a smaller, full-service Marriott, as well as a less expensive Courtyard and Fairfield Inn -- each with its own checkout desk.
Not far from the Miami airport, on a secluded peninsula, the Miami Airport Hilton attracts not just airport hotel guests, who rarely stay more than one night, but longer-term guests who come to play tennis and water-ski or jet-ski on the hotel's 100-acre man-made lake. The Hyatt Regency Dallas-Fort Worth has an abundance of recreational facilities: a pair of 18-hole golf courses, 7 tennis courts, 10 racquetball courts and 2 health clubs. The Radisson Inn at New Orleans International Airport has four lighted tennis courts, while the New Orleans Airport Hilton, two miles away, has two lighted tennis courts and a putting green.
But even the more conventional airport hotels now offer services and amenities equal to those of their midtown brethren -- including, in some cases, soundproof rooms and ergonomically designed chairs and desks.
Expressing a sentiment seconded by many business travelers, Roger Conner, a spokesman for Marriott, said: "Our two-year-old full-service hotel at the Philadelphia airport is as nice as it gets. There's no trade-off in quality compared with our 1,500-room Center City hotel."
What they are lacking, of course, is the culture, night life and unpredictability of a downtown location.
A Westin hotel at the Philadelphia International Airport, renovated at a cost of $4.5 million, is the first upscale, all-suites business hotel in that city. The Hotel Sofitel, near the Miami airport, boasts not only a French restaurant but also a French bakery, which gives guests free baguettes as they check out.
Because there is no effective way to prevent hotels from adding "airport" to their name, and since most lie outside airports proper, plenty of dowdy, down-at-the-heels properties carry that designation. But many independent hotels and most major chains require that airport hotels be within 3 miles, or 10 minutes, of terminals.
Furthermore, they require them to offer food service 24 hours a day, free airport vans, same-day laundry and pressing service, business centers and multilingual receptionists.
Most Hyatt airport hotels have presidential suites for dignitaries or celebrities. The presidential suites at the Hyatt Regency O'Hare each have two bedrooms, a parlor, two baths, two whirlpools and a wet bar.
Diane Altman of New York was a recent guest at the Hyatt Regency O'Hare, although she did not stay in the presidential suite. The executive editor of McGraw-Hill's school division, Ms. Altman was there not to avoid the local paparazzi but for a meeting of the company's school division.
"When you only go from the airport to the hotel and the hotel back to the airport," she said, "why would you want to stay anywhere else?"

With more travelers anxious to avoid long trips into and out of crowded cities, airport hotels -- those within three miles of a terminal -- have emerged as the most popular segment of the hotel industry. One such area that has become crowded with hotel accommodations, and almost a destination unto itself, surrounds Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. Map shows sites of the following:

HEADLINE: Jean McKelvey, 89, Professor and Labor Arbitration Expert

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Dr. Jean Trepp McKelvey, who hurdled gender barriers in the field of labor-management mediation and opened the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University, died on Jan. 5 at the Kirkhaven Nursing Home in her hometown of Rochester. She was 89.
She taught at Sarah Lawrence College for 13 years until 1946, when Cornell formed the new branch on its Ithaca, N.Y., campus and appointed her as its first faculty member. She wrote the curriculum for the school and taught courses in arbitration, labor law and labor practices. 
 She assumed emeritus status in 1976 but continued to teach and coordinate the school's off-campus graduate credit courses given under extension programs in Albany, Corning, Elmira, Rochester and Syracuse. In a tribute to her and another faculty member, the school, known by its initials, I.L.R., established its first endowed chair in 1994 and named it the Jean McKelvey-Alice Grant Professorship of Labor Management Relations.
Many of her former students went on to fill influential positions as union leaders, arbitrators and jurists. The year after she arrived at Cornell, she became a charter member -- and the sole woman at the time -- in the National Academy of Arbitrators. In 1970, she was the first woman to be elected president of the academy and, mindful of the overwhelming preponderance of men in her metier, came up with an arbitration training program for women.
Outside the classroom, Dr. McKelvey was a sought-after arbitrator for the airline industry as well as other sectors of the economy. Gov. W. Averell Harriman named her to the State Board of Mediation in 1955, and she served on it for 11 years, helping settle thorny disputes like a wholesale butchers' strike in 1961.
President Richard M. Nixon appointed her to the Federal Services Impasses Panel in 1970, and she remained on it until eight years ago. At her death, she was still a member of the Public Review Board of the United Automobile Workers.
She was the author of many papers and books and edited the proceedings of several annual meetings of the National Academy of Arbitrators. Among her books were "Cleared for Takeoff: Airline Labor Relations Since Deregulation" (I.L.R. Press, 1988), "The Changing Law of Fair Representation" (I.L.R., 1985), "New Challenges to Arbitration" (I.L.R., 1977) and "A.F.L. Attitudes Toward Production, 1900-1932" (Greenwood, 1974).
She was born Jean Trepp in St. Louis and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Wellesley College in 1929. She received her M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Radcliffe College in 1931 and 1933 and joined the Sarah Lawrence faculty in the year between. During World War II, she was a hearing officer and arbitrator for the National War Labor Board.
She is survived by her husband of 63 years, Blake McKelvey, Rochester's city historian emeritus, and a brother, Richard Trepp of Springfield, Mass.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasuries Fall as Demand Decreases and Stock Prices Rise

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities fell in choppy trading yesterday as investors warily watched the Asian situation. The flight to quality that had been pushing bond yields lower abated amid rebounding stock prices.
The 30-year bond dropped 29/32, to a price of 105 23/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.73 percent, from 5.69 percent Monday. 
 Prices remained near the day's lows, as traders reported sellers in two- and three-year maturities after a benign Consumer Price Index report in the morning.
Many in the market felt the rally on Monday, caused partly by concern over the impact of the Asian crisis, was overdone.
Talk of a large hedge fund as a big seller of longer-maturity Government securities was countered by talk of a potential rate cut by the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, which helped support bonds. The lack of downward momentum in the market prompted some sellers, who had bet on further declines, to buy bonds instead.
"The lack of inflationary pressures continues to impress market observers," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management.
The Labor Department said the Consumer Price Index rose only one-tenth of 1 percent in December, bringing the annual gain to 1.7 percent last year, the most subdued inflation since 1986 and almost half of the 3.3 percent rise of 1996. The report suggested there is little reason for Federal Reserve policy makers, who are meeting Feb. 3-4, to raise interest rates despite other signs of resilient economic growth.
"This extremely favorable performance gives the Fed a good deal of latitude to keep monetary policy unchanged for quite some time," Mr. Fine said.
Marilyn Schaja, an economist with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, noted that it was the least inflationary reading of the Consumer Price Index in more than 30 years, with the core rate -- which excludes the cost of energy and food -- at its lowest since 1965.
Although an economic slowdown is widely expected, some recently released data, notably housing and labor markets, have yet to display any evidence of a slackening. Coming statistics for retail sales and industrial production are not expected to show much slowing either.
At the same time, the bond market seems to be signaling that the next Fed move on interest rates will be down, Mr. Fine said. The main evidence is that yields on two-year notes are lower than the Federal funds rate, the overnight loan rate between banks and a sensitive indicator of short-term interest rates.
Other economic news released yesterday had little influence on bond prices. The LJR Redbook Research survey of weekly retail activity showed sales up 1.9 percent for the first two weeks of January, but slightly weaker than the 2.4 percent increase reported last week, with much of the buying attributed to bargain hunting, especially in apparel and electronics.
In another report, a survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta showed that a slowdown in business activity in the Southeast continued in December. The Atlanta Fed's business activity index increased marginally, up 1.7 in December from a 2.2 decrease in November.
A rally in the stock market limited the gains in Treasury securities.
"The equity strength kept Treasuries struggling," said John Canavan, a market analyst with Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, "limiting the upside. So prices headed back toward the lows."

HEADLINE: Inflation Climbed Only 1.7% in 1997, Its Smallest Increase in 11 Years

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 13

 BODY:
Inflation, once the bane of the economy but these days only a minor irritant, barely budged last month, and for all of 1997 showed its smallest increase in 11 years, the Government reported today.
With the economic turmoil in Asia expected to drive the prices of many imported goods lower in coming months, the outlook is for inflation to remain tame, economists said. 
 Since economists believe official statistics overstate inflation, some analysts think the economy could be on the brink of widespread decreases in the prices of commodities and manufactured goods, although prices for services like medical care and entertainment are likely to go on rising.
Economists have even begun debating the possibility of deflation: an across-the-board decline in prices for everything from real estate and stocks to steel, shoes and the cost of a visit to the dentist.
"Deflation in the prices of many commodities is a reasonable prospect in the months ahead, as the Asian effects work their way through the U.S. and world economies and the strong U.S. dollar against Asian currencies causes a switch in purchases by U.S. consumers to cheap foreign goods," said Allen Sinai, an economist with Primark Decision Economics in Boston.
"With essentially open borders to imports and a consumer mentality that still looks for bargains, it should be a field day on lots of items for Americans."
Today's inflation statistics highlighted the remarkable price stability the nation has enjoyed even as the economy has remained robust and unemployment has fallen to near quarter-century lows.
The Consumer Price Index, the most commonly cited gauge of inflation, rose one-tenth of 1 percent in December, matching analysts' expectations, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. The index rose 1.7 percent in 1997, the lowest rate since 1986, when oil prices fell sharply. The rate for 1996 was 3.3 percent.
Excluding prices for food and energy, which are made extremely volatile by factors like weather and political tensions in the world's oil-producing regions, the index rose two-tenths of 1 percent in December and 2.2 percent for the year -- the lowest annual figure since 1965. The corresponding rate for 1996 was 2.6 percent.
The inflation report led many economists to conclude that the Federal Reserve no longer has to consider raising interest rates at its meeting next month. The central bank has held rates steady since March, but has maintained a policy of leaning toward higher interest rates, a clear signal of its concern that low unemployment rates might push up wages and lead companies to raise prices.
But wage gains, while accelerating somewhat, have remained relatively limited. The Labor Department said today that average hourly earnings, adjusted for inflation, fell six-tenths of 1 percent in December, the first decline in three months. Economists expect wages to rise at a faster pace this year as employers scramble to fill jobs at a time of low unemployment.
But most analysts think the Fed is still not likely to consider reducing rates to forestall deflation. Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, discussed deflation at length in a speech earlier this month, but suggested that he did not consider it a "significant near-term risk."
Investors, though, appear increasingly convinced that the Fed will reduce the short-term interest rates it controls. The long-term rates set by the markets have dropped sharply in the last month, partly fueled by a flood of money from Asia being invested in United States Treasury bonds, which are considered one of the world's safest investments.
The report showed that prices for food, gasoline and new cars declined last month, while the costs of housing and clothing rose only slightly and medical care and entertainment prices increased.
The monthly figures were roughly in line with the trends for the year. Prices for services rose 2.8 percent for all of 1997, compared with a rise of two-tenths of 1 percent for goods.
Goods prices have been held in check or pushed down by the strength of the dollar, which makes imported goods relatively cheaper, by intense competition among manufacturers and retailers and by some improvement in productivity, or output per worker. Services are more susceptible to price increases now because labor costs are their biggest component.
In one indication of the changed psychology about inflation, the National Federation of Independent Business, a lobbying group for small businesses, said today that in the 1970's more than 40 percent of its member companies called inflation their No. 1 problem. Last year, the group said, the figure was 1 percent.
William C. Dunkelberg, the group's chief economist, said 16 percent of the members it surveyed reported raising prices in December and 11 percent reduced their prices. Although 30 percent of the companies reported that compensation costs rose for the month, they said they had been unable to pass the costs along in the form of higher prices.

Bank Regulators Circulating Secret Data

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
Federal regulators are collecting normally confidential information about individual banks' loans to South Korea and are sharing the information with large banks that are leading an effort to extend payments on the loans, according to American commercial bankers.
That such information is even circulating is a measure of the sense of urgency that the Government attaches to the economic crisis gripping much of Southeast Asia. Banks disclose lending information to regulators under strict secrecy guidelines that are breached only in unusual circumstances. 
 American banks and their counterparts in Japan and Europe are trying to extend payment on, or roll over, as much as $28 billion in short-term loans to South Korean banks that come due by March 31. South Korean banks have already technically defaulted on a portion of the debt, and their inability to pay off the loans has tightened credit, threatening the entire South Korean economy.
Regulators have an understandable need for up-to-date information on American lending in South Korea in light of the current crisis. And Federal regulators have been skilled in recent years at mobilizing private sector responses to severe economic problems caused by or involving banks. For example, regulators asked for detailed information about American bank lending during the Latin American crisis of the 1980's and early 1990's, and some of that information circulated freely.
But some banks are bristling that the detailed information they are sharing with regulators is also finding its way into the hands of competitors who may be able to take advantage of the information -- particularly when it involves the identity of borrowers. Banks are typically loath to share information that would violate confidentiality agreements they have with their clients and are even more hesitant if they think the disclosure may encourage another bank to try to steal a client.
In recent days, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates and supervises national banks, has asked American banks to provide information about when their loans to South Korea come due and the identities of the borrowers. And the Treasury Department has also kept up efforts it began making at least a month ago to pressure banks to join the rollover effort.
One American bank said it was recently contacted by a large New York bank that asked it about a loan coming due in South Korea. An executive of the bank said that the caller not only knew when the loan was due but also knew the identity of the bank's client. The bank executive said that the New York bank said it had received its information from the Federal Reserve.
While the Federal Reserve declined to comment, the Comptroller's office, which shares its data with the Federal Reserve, said it had been circumspect about the information it had received.
"We have said repeatedly that we are monitoring this situation closely, and that includes getting information from the banks," said Lee Cross, a spokeswoman for the Comptroller's office. "But we would never disclose any information we receive from one bank to any of the other banks we supervise."
The International Monetary Fund is working closely with South Korean central banking officials in Seoul to gather information on loans made to the Government and the nation's corporations by foreign banks, including American ones. The lending information collected by the I.M.F. is being shared with Federal Reserve officials in Washington.
The Federal Reserve, the nation's leading bank regulator, has ample room to disclose confidential information about banks when it sees fit under guidelines that define its responsibilities.
"They clearly see this as a unique and important event, and I suspect that regulatory intervention will increase," said one American banker, who insisted on anonymity.
Meanwhile, international banks remain divided on how long their rollovers of South Korean loans will last and under what circumstances. American bankers had hoped to get all banks to commit to a 90-day rollover last week, but German banks, which make up South Korea's second-largest creditor group after Japanese banks, have not committed beyond the end of January.
United States commercial bankers say German banks want their rollovers guaranteed by the South Korean Government before they dig themselves in any deeper.
Moreover, Japanese and German banks are balking at a refinancing proposal put forward by J. P. Morgan & Company that would involve exchanging short-term South Korean loans for longer-term bonds. The Japanese and Germans are said to be considering an alternative plan that would involve rolling over their loans for one to three years if the South Korean Government guaranteed the long-term rollovers.
American, French and Japanese banks have already committed to 90-day rollovers, and Italian and Swiss banks are expected to follow suit soon.
In South Korea yesterday, four of the country's largest conglomerates accepted I.M.F.-sponsored reforms, agreeing to adopt more rigorous accounting standards and to stop allowing their subsidiaries to lend money to one another.
The four companies, members of South Korea's dominant group of Government-backed concerns known as chaebol, are Hyundai, LG, Samsung and Sunkyong. Eight of South Korea's 30 largest chaebol collapsed last year beneath the weight of enormous debts and rapid, haphazard expansions.

HEADLINE: Addressing Racial Issues On Wall St.

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
Wall Street, which is often perceived as still being a white male preserve, has generally been uneasy about openly discussing issues of race and gender.
In an effort to change that, the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson and his Rainbow/PUSH Coalition are starting a conference and fund-raiser today at Windows on the World, the restaurant atop the World Trade Center. The meetings are intended to promote economic opportunities for minorities and women. 
 The three-day gathering, which will be addressed by President Clinton, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, commemorates and coincides with the anniversary of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's birthday tomorrow, which is celebrated by a national holiday on Monday.
The events represent an effort to draw investment from Wall Street to minority businesses and to create something of a partnership between corporate leaders and minorities and women, according to the three-day gathering's sponsors, which include the Travelers Group, the huge insurance and financial services company, and the New York Stock Exchange, as well as the Rainbow/ PUSH Coalition.
The New York Stock Exchange, for the first time, will close in honor of Dr. King's birthday. While that may reflect the beginnings of change on Wall Street, the greater awareness of racial and gender issues has been driven in part by court actions. Last fall, for instance, Smith Barney Inc., which is now Salomon Smith Barney, a subsidiary of the Travelers Group, settled a class-action suit brought in Federal court by more than 20 women, both current and former employees, who contended that the firm had sat by while the workplace became an arena for gender discrimination and sexual harassment. In their long-running battle with the firm, the group's advocates invoked the rights of minorities, including women.
And while Mr. Jackson, business and political leaders and Wall Street titans may be able to agree on broadly defined goals, such as the need for more economic growth, for equality of opportunity and the need to regenerate inner cities and encourage investments that benefit the black and Hispanic population, the best jobs on Wall Street remain almost exclusively a white male province, and the nation's fund managers rarely direct large sums at projects that benefit minorities.
"The theme of this conference is expanding the marketplace," Mr. Jackson said in a telephone conference with reporters last week, to achieve stronger economic growth and opportunity through the "inclusion" of minorities and women.
"The two largest emerging markets are the black and Hispanic markets in this country," Mr. Jackson said, arguing that it is in Wall Street and corporate America's "enlightened self-interest" to invest in these markets to insure a prosperous economy. David C. Wilhelm, a senior managing director with Everen Securities Inc. in Chicago, who is flying to New York today for the conference and has consulted informally with Mr. Jackson in recent years, said: "I really think he believes this is the next stage of the civil rights movement: civil rights in the workplace and expanding access to capital for minorities.
"He views this as very much in the tradition of the struggle for economic justice that Martin Luther King began. This is a new Jesse Jackson. Jesse Jackson the capitalist."
Most big Wall Street firms are participating in this week's meetings. Sanford I. Weill, the Travelers chairman and chief executive, has been the most active Wall Street figure in organizing and backing the events, according to Mr. Jackson's aides. Despite such support, preparations for the gathering have not been entirely smooth. Both Mr. Greenspan and Arthur Levitt Jr., the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, recently distanced themselves from a fund-raising letter sent by the event's sponsors that mentioned their names.
At the request of the Fed and the S.E.C., the event's sponsors sent out a corrective letter saying that Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Levitt would be there simply to address the meeting, and were not in any way connected with fund-raising for it, according to an S.E.C. spokesman.

HEADLINE: A Road-Building Scandal Forces a Governor's Hand

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: RALEIGH, N.C., Jan. 13

 BODY:
Seeking to stem damage from a fusillade of disclosures about patronage and political influence in North Carolina's road-building program, Gov. James B. Hunt Jr. dismissed his Transportation Secretary today, acknowledged mistakes and promised change.
Governor Hunt and his top transportation appointees have figured in months of punishing news accounts about the department's penchant for building roads and bridges that benefit political insiders, often by overriding the recommendations of state highway engineers. 
 But the popular and long-serving Democratic Governor suggested at a news conference today that governors from both parties were responsible for creating a corrupt system.
"Over many decades and through many administrations -- Democratic and Republican, mine and others -- a system has evolved that no longer gives citizens and the taxpayers confidence in how priorities are set and decisions are made," he said.
He also was contrite. "We made some mistakes," Mr. Hunt acknowledged. "Now I want to fix it."
Mr. Hunt has weathered lesser ethical storms during his four terms but none that have touched him so closely: he personally lobbied the state highway administrator to replace a bridge over a reservoir near his Wilson County farm, a decision that contradicted a decision by state engineers.
And in the most sensational disclosure of the transportation mess, a contractor wrote to Mr. Hunt to express his anger that he was not appointed to the Board of Transportation despite raising the nearly $25,000 he claims he was told was the price for a seat.
"We are very disappointed," the contractor, James A. Cartrette of Columbus County, wrote to the Governor last year, "and feel that our money should be returned."
Investigations by the state's newspapers and by public policy groups have revealed that appointments to the 26-member transportation board most often went to political donors and that many board members used their influence to win approval for low-priority projects that benefited themselves, their family members and their friends.
Since the newspaper articles began appearing last fall, two members have resigned under pressure, a third pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of conflict of interest, the state auditor has ordered a full review of policymaking, and legislative committees have opened hearings.
After months of reports about the growing scandal, Mr. Hunt today removed the Transportation Secretary, Garland Garrett, and made him a staff lobbyist. The Governor named Norris Tolson, who had been the Commerce Secretary, to the post and asked him to restructure the department in a way that would curtail the power of the state highway administrator, Larry Goode.
The rapid-fire disclosures about the transportation board, whose members, appointed by the governor, oversee the department, have provided the most embarrassing moments of Mr. Hunt's 13 years in office, his supporters and opponents agree. And in a capital where Democrats and Republicans are waging an intense war for control of state government, the scandal has gift-wrapped an issue for the Republicans in a legislative election year.
North Carolina Republican leaders have been quick to link the conflict-of-interest cases here to the investigations of Democratic fund-raising practices in Washington. They have pledged to use the ethics issue in their efforts this fall to expand their two-seat majority in the State House and to take control of the State Senate, where Democrats hold a 10-seat advantage.
Mr. Hunt, 60, who served his first two terms from 1977 to 1984 and then was elected again in 1992 and 1996, is one of the South's most enduring politicians. Considered a national authority on education issues, he spent $10.4 million in his 1996 campaign, a record for a governor's race in the state, and cruised to victory with 56 percent of the vote.
Because he is known for his political nimbleness, Mr. Hunt has mystified political analysts in the state by waiting nearly four months before taking action to restore public confidence in the Department of Transportation and its policy board.
But he suggested today that the Board of Transportation, which is by far the largest of its kind in the country, should be smaller, and that politicians and their appointees should not be able to promote road projects through back-channel lobbying and discretionary funding.
Last week, The Charlotte Observer reported that Mr. Hunt's intervention helped persuade the Department of Transportation to approve the replacement of a bridge over the Buckhorn Reservoir, an infrequently used crossing about four miles from his farm that was slated for closure. The $7.7 million project was approved despite an opinion from department engineers that it could not be justified on economic grounds. Six hundred cars crossed the bridge daily, and without it there is a two-and-a-half-mile detour.
Mr. Hunt originally defended his support for the project, saying he had spoken to Mr. Goode on behalf of neighbors who would be cut off from their community without the bridge. But several days later, he ordered the department to put a hold on the project, and today he said that his involvement had been improper. "I understand now that wasn't the way to do it," he said.
The reports about the bridge followed the revelations about Mr. Cartrette's letters, which were first reported by The Star-News of Wilmington. In a letter to Jim Bennett, Mr. Hunt's 1996 campaign finance director, Mr. Cartrette said he had spoken with the Governor about an appointment to the Board of Transportation. Mr. Cartrette quoted Mr. Hunt as responding, "If you will send the money, I will look out for my friends, and you are my friend."
Mr. Hunt said that any suggestion of a quid pro quo appointment was "totally untrue."
But research by Democracy South, an advocacy group that studies the role of money in North Carolina politics, found a strong link between political fund raising and appointments to the Board of Transportation.
The 34 board members who have been appointed by Mr. Hunt since 1993 contributed more than $2 million to state and national campaigns, said Bob Hall, research director of Democracy South. Mr. Hunt, the largest beneficiary, received a total of $652,428 from those donors for his 1992 and 1996 campaigns, Mr. Hall said. Board members appointed by Mr. Hunt have included the fund-raising chairman of his 1996 campaign, a treasurer of the state Democratic Party and the chairmen or finance chairmen of at least 15 county campaign committees. Mr. Garrett, the deposed Transportation Secretary, also was a Hunt fund-raiser.
Several board members have been accused of using their positions to influence road projects that benefited their businesses.
One of them, Carroll Edwards, resigned in October after it was revealed that the state had paved a dirt road leading to his wood products plant, had widened and resurfaced a second road leading there and had agreed to build a third road, which was to provide a shortcut for trucks traveling to the plant.
A month later, a second board member, Odell Williamson, resigned after The News and Observer of Raleigh reported that he had backed construction of a bridge and road-widening projects that would enhance the value of properties owned by him and his family.
Another board member, Charles Grady, pleaded guilty to conflict of interest last year because he used his position on the board to push a land sale to the Department of Transportation that earned his real estate firm a $45,000 commission.

HEADLINE: Blocking Money for U.N. Harms U.S. in Iraq Crisis, Albright Says

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 13

 BODY:
As a new crisis built with Iraq, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright sharply accused Congress today of undermining American foreign policy during a tense situation with Iraq late last year by failing to pay American debts to the United Nations.
She criticized "legislative blackmail" on the part of lawmakers, who she said created "a truly ridiculous" impasse that hurt the American people. 
 "The failure to pay our U.N. debts undermines our leverage just as Saddam Hussein was challenging the authority of the Security Council, and it damaged our credibility just as the General Assembly was voting on a plan that could have reduced by roughly $100 million a year the amount we are assessed by the U.N. system," Ms. Albright said in a speech here.
It was a very pointed attack by the Secretary, who began her tenure about a year ago by pledging to work with Congress to advance American foreign policy. She spent much time wooing the conservative Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jesse Helms of North Carolina. She negotiated the United Nations package, which included many reforms, with Mr. Helms's committee.
But the impasse was caused largely by House members who blocked the money for the United Nations, as well as associated money for the International Monetary Fund, over American participation in international family planning programs.
These members, led by Representative Christopher H. Smith, a Republican of New Jersey, are deeply opposed to abortion and want to stop any "U.S. subsidies to foreign organizations that perform or promote abortions," Mr. Smith said in a statement today. American financing for any foreign organization that performs abortions is already banned.
Representative Smith, traveling in Russia, rejected Ms. Albright's criticism. "I have too much respect for Secretary Albright to believe that she seriously intended to suggest," he said, that if the United States had resolved its dispute with the United Nations over arrears, "Saddam would have let our inspectors look at his chemical and biological weapons."
"This is about as reasonable as blaming Congress for El Nino," the Congressman said.
The United Nations debt has been "around for years," he continued, and "has never prevented the United States from protecting its vital national security interests" or forming an international coalition to fight the Persian Gulf war.
Members of Senator Helms's staff said the family planning issue remained an important obstacle to providing money for the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund, even as Washington is relying on the fund to manage the sweeping Asian economic crisis.
Ms. Albright, in a speech to the Center for National Policy, an organization she used to head, appealed to lawmakers to be more responsible this year, urging them to support the Clinton Administration on NATO expansion, Bosnia and new, targeted aid to Africa.
The Czech-born Ms. Albright said the prospect of NATO expansion had already produced a trend toward peaceful reconciliaton of ancient ethnic and national conflicts in Central and Eastern Europe. "The currents of history are shifting in directions that will make us all more secure," she said.
Ms. Albright used the speech to summarize her first year as Secretary of State, a year, she said, in which "I was included on a national magazine's list of the 25 most intriguing people alongside a cloned sheep." She threw out the first ball of the season for the Baltimore Orioles and sang to Asian diplomats last summer in Malaysia as the first signs of the economic crisis there emerged.

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 13

 BODY:
No longer worried about losing her job, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman offered a series of modest proposals today that may not be politically popular but that could ease the property tax burden and improve public schools.
Mrs. Whitman devoted much of her speech to education, saying she wanted to reduce spending on public schools, which receive the bulk of local tax revenues, but also strengthen educational programs. 
 While some of her ideas -- extending the school day, for example -- won immediate praise, legislative leaders were careful not to embrace three of her most contentious proposals: eliminating tenure for principals, merging school districts and letting students choose which public school they attend.
Almost immediately after she narrowly won re-election last November, Mrs. Whitman said she wanted to be remembered as a governor who improved educational opportunities for children statewide. Her speech today was an attempt to start carving out such a legacy, with proposals that had the potential not only to change education policy but also to reduce the cost of education significantly.
At a time when education reform is the subject of widespread attention, the proposals could also shore up Mrs. Whitman's national reputation, which suffered when she almost lost to her Democratic opponent last fall. But the two most powerful legislative leaders, who are considered to be the leading Republican candidates in the next gubernatorial race, suggested they might make things difficult for the Governor.
The proposals on tenure and school regionalization are sure to anger New Jersey's powerful teachers' unions and suburban voters, whose support is crucial to gubernatorial and legislative candidates. Both Donald T. DiFrancesco, the Senate President, and Jack Collins, the Assembly Speaker, said they were against merging school districts unless residents agreed to it.
"I think it would be disastrous to try and mandate that," said Mr. DiFrancesco, who was reserved in his applause during the speech and did not clap when Mrs. Whitman proposed allowing school choice and eliminating tenure. "I think she needs to provide incentives, work slowly and take one step at a time."
Mr. DiFrancesco reminded reporters and fellow legislators that he, too, had an agenda, giving a speech of his own in the Senate chambers several hours before the Governor's address. He touched on education but spent far more time announcing plans to preserve open space and improve the state's public transportation system. Mrs. Whitman did not mention either subject in her speech.
"I thought those were areas she wouldn't talk about," Mr. DiFrancesco said. "So I needed to make it a high priority."
One educational issue that was missing from Mrs. Whitman's speech was a recent order by the New Jersey Supreme Court to end disparities between the state's richest and poorest school districts. The court ordered the Governor last spring to send $248 million more to 28 urban school districts and to provide more programs to help urban students overcome disadvantages.
Mrs. Whitman submitted a list of potential programs last fall, and a Superior Court judge will decide by next week whether they are acceptable. If they are not, the Supreme Court could force the state to send millions of additional dollars to the urban districts this year.
A spokesman for the Governor, Pete McDonough, said it would have been inappropriate for her to discuss the programs in advance of the judge's decision.
But Mayor James E. McGreevey of Woodbridge, Mrs. Whitman's Democratic opponent last fall, said she should have discussed school financing because it was the most important educational issue in New Jersey. "The Governor's absolute silence on the educational funding question relegates the entirety of the question to the courts," he said.
But by avoiding the issue of school financing and focusing on new proposals instead, Mrs. Whitman was perhaps trying to make a fresh start in the area of education.
During her first term, her most significant education policies came in response to orders from the Supreme Court to improve the quality of educational programs in urban schools. Her proposals today could affect all 600 school districts and 1.2 million schoolchildren in the state, which could indeed give Mrs. Whitman a reputation as an "education governor."
"She's talking about things in education that have not been talked about before," said Frank Belluscio, a spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards Association, which has long called for eliminating tenure for principals. "It's a good start in making a real impact."
But Democratic leaders said that while the ideas behind Mrs. Whitman's education proposals were bold, the proposals themselves were not bold enough. She left too much up to legislators, many of whom will be up for re-election in 1999 and therefore too skittish to take on issues like regionalization of school districts and elimination of principal tenure, they said. "It was a lateral pass to the Legislature," Mr. McGreevey said.

Korea Steadies Itself on the Road to Recovery

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Wednesday, Jan. 14

 BODY:
What stock market around the world has performed the best so far in 1998?
Remarkably enough, the answer is the South Korean market, which rose 2.37 percent earlier today for a total leap of 26.55 percent so far this year. This buoyancy, however precarious and tentative, underscores a rare bit of good news from Asia these days: After a near-death experience last month, South Korea may have stabilized for the moment. 
 Many investors, diplomats and government officials are far more cheery about the nation's prospects than they were just a couple of weeks ago. While the shift may prove fickle, it is striking.
"Soon, South Korea will be again on an ascending trend," Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said at a news conference here on Tuesday at the end of a two-day visit. Referring to an improvement in the balance of payments and some other economic indicators, Mr. Camdessus added, "All of that signals a beginning of recovery."
Tremendous challenges lie ahead, and recovery -- even under the best of circumstances -- will involve a surge of unemployment, bankruptcies and labor unrest. Nonetheless, South Korea is now viewed more positively than almost anybody expected a couple of weeks ago, partly because President-elect Kim Dae Jung has seemed far more serious about revamping the economy than many people had thought possible.
The I.M.F. strategy could use a success story because most of the news out of Asia has been bleak. Moreover, good tidings from South Korea, if they are sustained, are particularly important. South Korea's economy is far bigger than those of Indonesia and Thailand combined, and it is much more integrated than the others with the global economy and the business world of Tokyo and New York.
It is not that the worst is over, for most of the pain of unemployment is yet to come, but rather that it is now possible to see a path that the nation can follow to escape the crisis.
"In contrast to a month ago, when there was so much tension and so much stress that it was difficult to see the way out, now I think more and more people can see that there is an end to this," said Stephen Bosworth, the American ambassador to South Korea. But he added that there would be many trials ahead and that the sting of unemployment would get worse.
Mr. Camdessus echoed the warning. "You shouldn't cry victory prematurely," he said. "You have won the first battle. You have not won the war."
Investor confidence in South Korea has improved in part because the nation has appeared far more committed carrying out the terms of the I.M.F. bailout package than many analysts had predicted. Many investors had worried that Mr. Kim , a populist with close ties to labor unions, would shy away from any moves that would result in layoffs and deep economic pain.
In fact, Mr. Kim has used his political leverage aggressively to carry out the I.M.F. package and to make it easier for companies to lay off unneeded workers. He has also put pressure on large companies to mend their ways, and on Tuesday he reached an agreement with heads of the nation's conglomerates that will lead them to pay more attention to the market and to adopt more modern accounting methods.
Most striking, Mr. Kim is no longer criticizing the terms of the I.M.F. bailout, as he did during his campaign for president, but is praising the agreement as the best way to reinvigorate the national economy.
"This is a blessing in disguise," Mr. Kim said in a talk with his aides this month. "The reforms that the I.M.F. requests are things we should have done long ago."
The rise in the stock market in South Korea -- it has risen 11 of the last 12 trading sessions -- reflects in part its tumbles late last year. But the rise is still surprising because it bucks the trend that since Jan. 1 has sent stock indexes tumbling 18.82 percent in Singapore, even as stocks jumped 7.39 percent earlier today; 13.80 percent in Hong Kong, where stocks rose 6 percent, and 2.62 percent in Indonesia, where stocks were 2.37 percent higher. The Dow Jones index has also fallen, by 2 percent.
In dollar terms, the Singapore market has fallen 22.66 percent this year; the Hong Kong market is down 13.75 percent, and Indonesia has declined 35.08 percent. Because the South Korean currency, the won, is worth less than half what it was a year ago, the South Korean market has risen only 14.91 percent in terms of the dollar.
But the won appears to have stabilized for the moment, and the cheap currency has helped turn around the nation's trade accounts, creating surpluses in the last couple of months. That has helped bolster confidence.
South Korea's foreign debt remains a critical uncertainty, but the sense of crisis seems to have eased slightly. Western banks seem mostly prepared to give South Korea until the end of March to work out a resolution of the problem, and several possibilities are under discussion that would repackage the short-term loans owed by South Korean banks and turn them into longer-term debt at a higher interest rate.
"The imminent fear of default has disappeared," said Ben Q. Limb, a lawyer from New York who is an adviser to Mr. Kim.

HEADLINE: Better Rules for Bailouts

 BODY:
Top officials of the International Monetary Fund rushed off to Indonesia this week to stanch an economic hemorrhage that the fund now concedes it worsened itself. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, representing a worried Clinton Administration, followed close behind. Americans are understandably wondering whether the fund can be trusted to put together these kinds of bailouts and whether taxpayer dollars ought to be turned over to the fund so that it can indirectly repay Western banks that made foolish loans.
The truth is that the monetary fund is the only organization that can organize an international response to financial crisis. Left alone, currency crises can bounce from one country to another, leading to needless turmoil and economic contraction. If the fund stepped aside, the United States might have tried to prop up South Korea on its own, hardly an enviable prospect. 
 The existence of financial turmoil in Asia is not surprising. Every region suffers some economic turbulence, including the United States in the 1980's. What is surprising is the speed with which some of the world's fastest-growing economies disintegrated. Recent events prove that the prosperity in Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea was built in part around a core of financial rot.
Asian corporations ran on large amounts of loans, which can flee when business turns down. In the West, corporations rely more on shareholder equity, which does not so easily evaporate. Worse, bankrupt corporations were propped up by loans from banks responsive to political leaders, as in the case of Indonesia, or beholden to corporate conglomerates, as in Korea. Corporate failures in Thailand triggered a currency devaluation, spreading Thailand's turmoil to Korea and other trading partners. Once investors grew fearful that Korea's banks would default, they fled and left corporations starved for the loans they needed to survive.
The monetary fund has correctly focused on excising the rot. Its bailout conditions require Korea, Indonesia and Thailand to clean up their banks and, more important, to adopt rigorous accounting and auditing systems that give investors an accurate appraisal of financial health. The fund would also put a stop to crony capitalism, the practice of making loans for political purposes.
Indonesia added to its problems by stalling on the fund-imposed reforms. But the fund erred too, as critics charged and the fund's internal report now admits, by precipitously closing 16 banks, a rash action that alarmed investors. It also cracked down too hard on the fragile Korean and Indonesian economies by requiring them to tighten fiscal and monetary policies, the opposite of what was needed in economies sinking into recession.
There may be ways to prevent, or at least better predict, future crises. The more than 180 countries that are members of the monetary fund should agree, for example, to disclose the true state of their financial institutions according to the open and exacting standards common in the West.
But it is also important that the fund itself be more open. Though it plays a powerful role in Latin America, Asia, Africa and nearly everywhere else, its policy prescriptions and analytical assessments remain largely secret. Had it initially disclosed more about its approach to Korea and Indonesia, some mistakes might have been avoided or identified more quickly. That could have spared millions of innocent workers throughout Asia needless pain.

HEADLINE: Baghdad's Hall of Mirrors

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 13

 BODY:
After all the drama of last November, the Clinton Administration finds itself back where it started with Iraq: in another annoying and potentially explosive confrontation with Saddam Hussein over United Nations weapons inspectors.
It is the same dispute as last time, when all the permanent members of the Security Council agreed that Mr. Hussein could not dictate the makeup of the weapons-inspection teams. 
 "It does simplify things," a senior White House official said.
But since that last crisis, Iraq has at least succeeded in shifting the debate among the Security Council members toward when and whether to offer Baghdad some "light at the end of the tunnel" of sanctions. And it has so far succeeded in keeping the arms inspectors out of sites it has ruled off limits.
Mr. Hussein backed down last time, allowing the inspectors to return to Iraq and withdrawing his objection to American participation in inspections teams, and officials suspect that he will do the same now. But he had agreed only after the Russians, acting on behalf of the Security Council, convinced him that Moscow would work to ease the sanctions if Iraq complied.
For Mr. Hussein to renege on that agreement now only makes it harder for the Security Council to show Baghdad that "light," American and NATO officials said today, expressing puzzlement as to why Mr. Hussein had chosen to challenge them again on this same issue.
But the officials agreed that the main argument over Iraq is still to come, and it is not about composition of the inspection teams. It is about where the inspectors can go and how long they should pursue each category of banned weapons, and then about how long strict economic sanctions should remain on Baghdad.
And in that battle America's real negotiations, as usual, will be with the other permanent members of the Security Council, where Mr. Hussein is testing the endurance of the coalition against him.
As Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright called British, French and Russian counterparts, an Administration official said, "The question is not whether the situation is different today, but whether the willingness of Saddam's erstwhile friends to stand up for their own resolution is going to fade over time."
The presumption among White House and State Department officials is that the French and Russians, who have been most critical of Washington's unbending policy toward Iraq, will stick with Washington, as Britain has always done, on the question of the makeup of the inspection teams.
The French Foreign Ministry issued a statement in Paris today "profoundly" regretting the Iraqi decision to obstruct the inspectors and reminding Iraq of its obligations to cooperate with the United Nations "fully, immediately, unconditionally and without restrictions."
And senior Administration officials said they expected the Security Council to issue a strong statement condemning Iraqi noncompliance in the next couple of days. They said there was general annoyance with Iraq in the Security Council, which only seems to undermine Iraq's longer-term aim of dividing the permanent members over the larger sanctions policy itself.
"We've had many crises," said James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman. "We've had many times in which Saddam Hussein has sought to dictate terms. And each and every time, he's backed down in the face of the united view of the British, the French, the United States, the Russians and other members of the Security Council. And on this issue, they are united."
But they are divided on other questions, like how to treat Mr. Hussein's claims of presidential immunity over numerous sites in Iraq and how to inspect "presidential palaces," if allowed to do so.
More important, the French and Russians explicitly say they want to give Mr. Hussein some sense of "light at the end of the tunnel" after nearly seven years of sanctions and to help ease the plight of ordinary Iraqis.
These are the harder issues for Washington to manage, and they will come up this month, too, as the Security Council debates Iraqi sanctions.
Last week in Paris, senior American and NATO officials said, Under Secretary of State Thomas R. Pickering and French officials spoke about French ideas to give Mr. Hussein and the Iraqis some sense of progress.
The French are proposing that the United Nations "close the files" on Iraqi possession of missiles and nuclear weapons, and move on to so-called "long-term monitoring" by the United Nations, which is somewhat less intrusive. The French would keep the files open on Iraqi possession of biological and chemical weapons, about which much less is known and more Iraqi cheating has been discovered.
The French and Russians would also like to begin easing the strict economic sanctions on Iraq -- beyond allowing them to sell more of their oil for food, drugs and other nonlethal relief needs -- as an acknowledgment of progress on missiles and nuclear weapons.
The Americans are considering whether it makes sense to close a file or two, officials said. But Washington is not convinced that a period of confrontation with Iraq is a good time to do it. And Washington is adamantly opposed, the officials said, to any "gradualism" in easing sanctions in response.
"The French idea is to show the Iraqis that there's light at the end of the tunnel by checking off on a file," one official said. "But we insist on full compliance before any sanctions are lifted."
The chairman of the United Nations inspection effort, Richard Butler, is due to go to Iraq on Jan. 19, and return to report to the Security Council around Jan. 23. "A lot depends on what he finds and does," a senior official said. "What we choose to do is dependent on Saddam's degree of defiance."
While American spokesman refused to rule out a military attack on Iraq if necessary, the White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, repeated that "it is always better to act in concert with others when we can."
"The use of force is not ruled out," another senior Administration official said, adding that "an extremely unpopular use of force" would risk breaking up the sanctions effort.

HEADLINE: Whitman Restates Pledge On Taxes and Insurance

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 13

 BODY:
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman used her first major speech since her narrow re-election victory last fall to reassure New Jersey voters today that she would address their concerns over paying the country's highest property taxes and auto insurance rates.
In her annual address to the State Legislature, Mrs. Whitman set a March 30 deadline for passage of a bill that would reduce auto insurance rates, but she offered no specifics. On property taxes, she proposed requiring municipalities to win voter approval for tax increases above the rate of inflation. She also called for major changes in the Civil Service system, including giving cities and towns the option of abolishing Civil Service rules. 
 But she cautioned that New Jerseyans would have to consider giving up the state's cherished tradition of local control in exchange for lower property tax rates. She called for a statewide referendum for voters to determine whether they wanted New Jersey to consolidate and merge some of the state's 616 school districts to help reduce the biggest part of property tax bills: the cost of public schools.
"I have long opposed the forced regionalization of schools," Mrs. Whitman said. "Regionalization won't work if the people of New Jersey don't want it. So it's time to find out how New Jerseyans feel about it. We need to discuss whether we're willing to give up some degree of local control of our school districts for significantly lower property taxes."
She also urged that parents and taxpayers get more for their money from public schools. The Governor proposed a pilot project that would allow parents to send their children to public schools outside their school districts. She called for the elimination of tenure for principals. She also suggested extending the amount of instructional time that the state requires from four to six hours a day.
Mrs. Whitman's 34-minute address outlining her legislative priorities for the year is the first of three major policy speeches that she is to deliver in the coming weeks. She is expected to offer her vision for a second term during her inauguration ceremony next week and her spending priorities for the year when she unveils her proposed budget next month.
She drew the loudest applause from the hundreds of supporters and politicians who packed the ornate chambers of the General Assembly when she referred to the court battle with New York State over Ellis Island. She said that New Jersey has been shaping the future of the country since its earliest days, at "the entrance to America, Ellis Island, New Jersey."
There were also loud cheers when she reiterated her commitment to bringing down the cost of auto insurance and property taxes. Mrs. Whitman nearly lost her re-election bid to James E. McGreevey, a Democrat, last fall because voters said they did not think that she had done enough in her first term to address both problems. A turning point in the campaign came in the final days, when she appeared on television and told viewers that she heard their complaints, and she promised to do something about both problems, if re-elected.
But Democrats, including Mr. McGreevey, said her proposals did not go far enough.
"On auto insurance, she tossed the issue into the laps of the State Legislature," Mr. McGreevey said. "And on property taxes, the Governor basically did not recognize any responsibility and said she will allow voters to vote when the property tax levy exceeds a certain limit. It doesn't address the issue."
He said Mrs. Whitman should have considered providing more state money for school districts to help reduce the property tax burden.
Just hours before Mrs. Whitman's speech, the newly elected and re-elected members of the State Legislature were sworn into office.
Assembly Speaker Jack Collins and Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco, the two Republican legislative leaders, offered broad praise for the Governor's speech, but they showed little enthusiasm for some of her proposals, such as merging school districts.
Both Mr. Collins and Mr. DiFrancesco are considering running for governor when Mrs. Whitman's second and final term expires, and the politics of the next gubernatorial contest are already under way. The indications are that Mrs. Whitman, who received strong support from Republican lawmakers for much of her agenda in her first term, might have to work harder to win their votes in her second term.
"I know how people feel about their local school districts," said Mr. DiFrancesco, a Republican from Scotch Plains. "I know how my district feels about their home rule and their ability to have some influence in a district. People won't react favorably to that. Is it worth talking about? She said yes." He said he thought that forcing school districts to merge would be disastrous.
Instead of focusing on a single issue in her annual address to the Legislature today, as she did last year with auto insurance, Mrs. Whitman chose to offer lawmakers a grab bag of bold and contentious proposals. As a result, some plans could face a difficult time in the Republican-controlled Legislature, particularly those that involve changing the Civil Service system. Public employee unions have already said they would fight.
On Civil Service, Governor Whitman said job performance, not seniority, should determine which public employees keep their jobs when layoffs are made, and that local public employees should not be able to accumulate unused sick time. She said that compensation should be determined by merit, not seniority.
John Loos, chief lobbyist for the Communication Workers of America, expressed concern about the Governor's Civil Service proposals, saying that the elimination of seniority and other provisions opens the door for "patronage and cronyism" in state and local government.
"Our members will fight very hard to preserve the seniority system in Civil Service," he said.
William G. Dressel Jr., executive director of the New Jersey State League of Municipalities, praised the Governor for trying to change Civil Service. "It is almost impossible for mayors and elected officials to hire the person most qualified for the job," Mr. Dressel said.
Mr. Dressel said he wanted to hear more about what the Governor might say about property taxes before taking a position on whether property tax increase should be subject to voter approval.
Since the turn of the century, school budgets have been subject to voter approval in New Jersey. School spending represents about two-thirds of most property tax bills.
State law limits the amount municipalities and county governments may increase spending in a year. The state sets the limit, after determining the cost of goods and services local governments use. This year, the limit on the increase is 2.5 percent.
But the state does not limit the amount of property taxes cities and towns may raise. The Governor's plan would require municipalities to put budgets up for voter approval when the property tax rate increase exceeds the rate of inflation. For the last four years, the average property tax rate increase was 4 percent.
Democrats criticized Mrs. Whitman's plan, saying that she was "passing the buck to the people."
"We are elected to represent the people," said the Assembly minority leader, Joseph V. Doria. "The Governor was elected to be a leader, not a follower. The speech was basically one in which the Governor said let us talk to everybody and figure out what we are going to do and I will do what everybody says I should do."

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS: THE MARKETS -- STOCKS;
Intel Earnings Push Stocks Up Sharply

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
Stocks rose sharply yesterday in anticipation of strong fourth-quarter earnings from the Intel Corporation. Investors were hopeful that Intel's results would be a sign that Asian economic turmoil was not battering the nation's high-technology companies.
Although Intel did not report its earnings until after the markets had closed, the results from the world's leading maker of computer chips did prove better than expected. The Nasdaq market, where Intel and many other technology companies trade, rose 34.05 points, or 2.26 percent, to 1,541.63. 
 The eased concern about Asia's impact on high-technology stocks spilled over into other stocks as well. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 84.95, or 1.11 percent, to 7,732.13, and the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks advanced 12.91, or 1.37 percent, to 952.12. Intel shares rose 1 1/4, to 76 7/8.
"Intel was the key for the markets today," said Jonathan Joseph, an analyst for Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, "because its performance is the broadest and surest measure of the direction of the personal computer industry worldwide and it has a big Asian business."
The company received good news from Washington as well yesterday, when the Federal Trade Commission announced that at least for the time being it would not try to block the company's $420 million purchase of Chips and Technologies Inc., a leading producer of graphics chips.
An Intel rival, Advanced Micro Devices Inc., also reported its fourth-quarter results after the close of the markets yesterday. Its numbers somewhat surpassed Wall Street estimates, but the company still lost $12.3 million, or 9 cents a share, on revenues of $613.2 million, under heavy pressure trying to keep with Intel.
In the 1997 fourth quarter, Intel reported revenues of $6.51 billion, up from $6.44 billion in the fourth quarter a year earlier. Profits for the quarter were $1.74 billion, or $1.07 a share. That profit level was down from the 1996 fourth quarter, when the company earned $1.16 billion, or $1.06 a share.
The slippage compared with the quarter a year earlier was mainly a result of Intel's shifting production to a new generation of microchip, the Pentium II, which accounted for 25 percent of production at the end of last year and is expected to reach 50 percent of production by mid-1998. Until a new generation of chip reaches high-volume production, the transition is a slight drag on Intel's extraordinary levels of profitability.
Intel reported its results as "basic" earnings. Reported as fully diluted earnings, its profit would have been 98 cents a share, still above the Wall Street consensus estimate of 90 cents a share on a fully diluted basis. The estimate was from 32 analysts polled by the First Call Corporation, a research firm. It was even slightly above the so-called whisper number of 95 cents. Whisper numbers are the last-minute adjustments Wall Street analysts informally mention to clients and traders just before companies report results.
After Intel's earnings announcement and a conference call with the company's executives, Wall Street analysts viewed the results as undoubtedly positive but with a hint of caution about the future.
"It was a solid quarter, but not a blowout quarter," said David Wu, analyst for the ABN AMRO Chicago Corporation.
Some of the caution related to the uncertain outlook for business in Asia. Intel executives said the company's business in Asia had weakened because of the financial troubles in countries like South Korea, Indonesia and Malaysia. In the fourth quarter, business in its Asia-Pacific sales region fell to 17 percent of total sales, compared with 20 percent of sales a year earlier.
That regional falloff would have been even sharper were it not for record sales in the fast-emerging PC markets of China and India. "Thankfully, Asia-Pacific is a very broad region," said Paul S. Otellini, executive vice president for sales and marketing.
The Asian weakness, Mr. Otellini added, was offset by steady sales in North and South America and a strong rebound in European sales.
Because Intel's microchips serve as the electronic brain in 85 percent of the world's PC's, the company tends to have an early reading on the future demand for computers. Mr. Otellini was cautiously optimistic in his assessment yesterday. He noted a recent 1998 forecast by Dataquest, a market research firm, which predicted a 17 percent increase in the number of PC's shipped.
"I wouldn't argue with that number," Mr. Otellini said, while noting the "lack of visibility we have about what will happen in the Asia-Pacific region."
Intel also signaled its intention to push even more forcefully into the new market for PC's priced below $1,000. This market has been viewed as an opportunity for rival chip makers to possibly gain a strong position by undercutting Intel's prices.
But Mr. Otellini said Intel was "committed to serving the market for sub-$1,000 machines."

HEADLINE: Albany Likely To Get Names Of People With H.I.V.

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON 

 BODY:
Leaders of New York's legislative health committees said yesterday that the state was likely to begin reporting people with H.I.V. to confidential registries of the State Health Department, and that the practice could be in place by the end of the year.
The legislative leaders said that the fact that the Gay Men's Health Crisis, the nation's largest AIDS service agency, has reversed its position and is now calling for H.I.V. reporting has altered the terms of debate on the sensitive issue. 
 "It makes it easier to explore these things," said a Republican State Senator, Kemp Hannon of Garden City. "If people felt all the advocacy groups were against it, they may feel it would be futile to pursue it."
In an official statement to be released today, the Gay Men's Health Crisis, the most politically and economically connected group in the world of nonprofit AIDS service, calls for New York doctors to report H.I.V.-positive people to the state's Health Department, following the same practice used for infectious diseases like syphilis and tuberculosis. The organization's statement does not explicitly oppose the reporting of names, but instead it urges the state to consider using coded identification systems.
Every state requires doctors to report AIDS cases to public health officials. But officials in New York and many other states have refrained from the similar reporting of patients who are infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, but do not have full-blown AIDS. Prominent advocacy groups, including the Gay Men's Health Crisis, have resisted those efforts in the past, arguing that requiring reports would deter people from being tested and treated early.
By reversing its position, the organization shattered a consensus among AIDS and civil rights groups against H.I.V. reporting. It said clinical advances and the need for more accurate information on H.I.V. infection demanded new approaches, and that the system of tracking people with AIDS was no longer an effective gauge of the epidemic's extent.
To move to a system of H.I.V. reporting in New York State would require either a regulatory change or legislation. But health observers said any administrative change of a Health Department regulation might invite an immediate lawsuit, so legislative action is more likely.
Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried, a Manhattan Democrat, said recommendations due out in early March from the state's AIDS Advisory Council, which advises the Governor and the Legislature on AIDS policy, will be influential. Both he and Senator Hannon said they would press for an H.I.V.-reporting system that uses coded identification instead of the names of infected people.
The Assemblyman said he could envision legislation being introduced early this summer. "In the calendar year 1998, it could be up and running," Mr. Gottfried said.
But Assemblywoman Nettie Mayersohn, a Queens Democrat, said she would not be satisfied until the names of H.I.V.-positive people are reported to health officials. She already has introduced such a bill that would also seek to notify the partners of the infected persons.
Many advocates for people with AIDS are angered that the Gay Men's Health Crisis did not make an explicit statement against revealing names in H.I.V. reporting. They said it is particularly dismaying because the public appetite may be stronger for more coercive and intrusive measures, in light of incidents such as the Nushawn Williams case, the H.I.V.-positive man who is accused of infecting a trail of young women and girls in New York.
"Politically it has hurt us," said Jeffrey L. Reynolds, the policy director of the Long Island Association for AIDS Care and a co-chairman of the AIDS Advisory Council group now reviewing H.I.V. reporting.
"There are real world implications when the world's largest AIDS service organization comes out in tacit support of name reporting. It plays out in all different ways. It opens the door to divide and conquer. It gives the government an opportunity to do it their way. That doesn't reflect the concerns of the community."
Jeanne Bergman, a senior policy analyst with Housing Works, a service agency that finds housing for people living with AIDS in New York City, said she was outraged.
"That is an organization that has always been willing to compromise in order to serve its institutional interests," Ms. Bergman said. "The Federal funding agencies that support name reporting like the Centers for Disease Control, as well as funders in New York State and New York City will look very kindly on them for being very compliant with a relatively conservative agenda. And they will benefit financially in grant awards."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
I.M.F. Now Admits Tactics in Indonesia Deepened the Crisis

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Jan. 13

 BODY:
A confidential report by the International Monetary Fund on Indonesia's economic crisis acknowledges that an important element of the I.M.F.'s rescue strategy backfired, causing a bank panic that helped set off financial market declines in much of Asia.
In minute detail, the report describes how political paralysis in Indonesia was compounded by misjudgment at the I.M.F.'s Washington headquarters as to how the Indonesian people would react to bank closings. 
 Instead of inspiring confidence, as hoped, the closings helped bring Indonesia's banking system to the brink of collapse, sending depositors fleeing even from relatively healthy financial institutions and hastening a plunge in an already battered currency.
The report, distributed to I.M.F. members last week, did not imply that the agency bore any responsibility for worsening Indonesia's crisis. It traced most of the blame to President Suharto's Government, which it castigated for failing to enact promised reforms in exchange for the $40 billion international rescue effort.
Mr. Suharto's resistance to the economic changes demanded by the I.M.F. resulted in warnings from the Clinton Administration and the lending agency last week that aid might be cut off. That, in turn, helped cause the nation's currency, the rupiah, to fall steeply and raised fears of political and social ferment in Indonesia, the fourth-most-populous nation.
That was one reason President Clinton dispatched a team of top officials to meet with Mr. Suharto earlier today, in hopes of stabilizing Indonesia's finances before the country's troubles spread further.
I.M.F. officials declined today to comment on the report, which came as the agency's Asian remedies are put under increased attack, particularly from political leaders throughout the region.
Newspapers and television programs are filled with accusations that the remedies prescribed by the I.M.F. -- tight budgets, bank closings, high interest rates -- are worsening the pain just when businesses need loans and Government funds to avoid mass unemployment and bankruptcies.
I.M.F. and Clinton Administration officials say publicly that the only way to truly clean up Asian economies is to dive into market reforms, however painful this may be in the short run. But the fund's report on Indonesia suggests just how hard it has been for governments and international organizations to turn that philosophy into specific policies and to apply them to the fast-moving Asia crisis.
The I.M.F.'s report -- formally the Indonesia Standby Agreement: Review Under the Emergency Financing Procedures -- describes a turning point in the country's financial deterioration in November, when officials here were forced by the lending agency to close 16 insolvent banks, including at least one controlled by a son of President Suharto. The I.M.F.'s economists thought that some bank closings would restore confidence in the rest of the country's banking system, by eliminating the bad apples.
Instead, the closings caused panic, the report acknowledged, in language that showed that the I.M.F. hardly expected consequences opposite those intended.
"These closures, however, far from improving public confidence in the banking system, have instead set off a renewed 'flight to safety,' " the report said.
Indonesians withdrew their money, taking $2 billion out of the banking system and shifting further funds from private banks that they feared would be the next ones ordered closed. Some of that money was transferred to state-owned banks -- institutions that many here believe guarantee greater safety.
By the end of November, the report said, two-thirds of all the country's banks "had experienced runs on their deposits."
The problem grew so critical, it added, that the Indonesian central bank had to pump money into the private banks "equivalent to about 5 percent of G.D.P. over the past two months," meaning Indonesia's gross domestic product, or output.
The harried effort to keep the banking system afloat undermined efforts to deal with Indonesia's other major financial problem, the plummeting value of its currency, the report said.
The main mechanism any government or central bank uses to defend a currency's value is to raise interest rates. But pumping more money into a banking system -- making the currency more plentiful -- is a form of interest-rate reduction. So the central bank quickly found itself torn between two contradictory goals, and swayed back and forth between them.
"This situation has led to an uneven monetary policy, in which the central bank has shifted its focus from one objective to another, depending on the one which seemed most pressing," the report said.
The requirements imposed on Indonesia by the I.M.F., including the closing of insolvent banks, were similar to those demanded of Thailand and South Korea, other Asian nations that have needed enormous international bailouts in recent months.
Neither of those two seems to have experienced a bank run of the magnitude of Indonesia's. Still, these countries' financial markets have remained volatile; their currencies seem vulnerable to further declines, and few economists or politicians will venture a guess as to when the crises in those countries might pass.
This is not the first time an I.M.F. order to close banks resulted in panic. When some banks were closed early in the Mexican crisis in 1995, depositors reacted by hastily withdrawing money.
Banking officials who went through the Mexican experience say there is always a risk that when regulators close one group of banks, the public will conclude that they are making a broader statement about the health of the entire system. Less experienced regulators -- like Indonesia's -- can frequently compound this problem by failing to make their intentions clear, and by failing to separate troubled banks from healthier ones.
In this case, one of the banks shut down, which was owned by a son of Mr. Suharto, reopened under a different name a few days later after the son challenged the Indonesian Finance Ministry's right to close his bank at all.
While the I.M.F.'s acknowledgment that the bank closings went awry is sure to provide new ammunition to critics of its austerity-driven approach, that miscalculation was only one element of a report that chiefly finds Mr. Suharto's Government responsible for the worsening crisis by failing to take required economic reforms seriously.
In language far more direct than officials have used in their meetings over the last two days with the 76-year-old leader, the I.M.F. concluded that within days of the signing of the $40 billion accord, "economic reforms seemed to disappear from the Government's agenda."
President Suharto reconfirmed his commitment to the I.M.F.'s prescriptions today in a meeting at his residence with the American Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, Lawrence H. Summers. But the terms are clearly being revised, and changes are expected to be announced on Thursday when the I.M.F.'s Director General, Michel Camdessus, is expected here.

HEADLINE: For Many Americans, Nothing but Blue Skies

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Jan. 13

 BODY:
Lashed by freezing rain and pummeled by wicked gales roaring off Lake Michigan, Henry Hoornweg trudged doggedly toward the rattling El train in the city's Loop, entitled to feel a bit miserable.
Instead, his eyes were dancing. 
 "These are wonderful times," said Mr. Hoornweg, a 51-year-old legal secretary, exulting over an American decade that might be called The Good News 90's: anticipated Government budget surpluses, falling crime, galactic stock prices, low unemployment and puny interest rates.
To people like Mr. Hoornweg and his wife, a nurse, the national economic numbers translate into real personal gain: "We're buying a house for the first time -- four bedrooms, three bathrooms, out in the suburbs," said Mr. Hoornweg, standing at the el platform one recent evening. "When working folk like us can live like that, it says something."
To be sure, not everyone is riding the A train to Blissville. On the street below the el platform, a homeless man without a coat begs for money as he shivers. In burned-out, dispirited urban pockets unknown to most prosperous Americans, sirens still wail and gunshots ring. Many blue-collar workers feel threatened by a market that smiles on companies that cut wages and workers. And while experts warn that the good times will not last forever, on balance, Americans see an economy that is humming, judging from dozens of interviews, from San Francisco to Boston, from South Dakota to New York, and here in this straight-talking capital of the industrial and agricultural heartland.
Looking for a new job recently, Jennifer Thomas, a 26-year-old Chicago office worker, needed less than a month to find a better position, and promises of advancement, a triumph for a woman without a college degree and a background that was scarcely affluent.
"I felt pretty dismal in high school, assuming that I would be stuck in the same lower-middle-class life I grew up in -- and that the only way out was to get married young and depend on a man," said Ms. Thomas, who is single and not eager to settle down. "But now, there are so many opportunities out there. It's especially great for independent women."
Ms. Thomas said she was making enough money to lead a life she once thought out of reach: an apartment of her own, and enough spare income to travel a bit and dine at places like the trendy Clark Street Bistro.
"Today," she said, "I was calling around for tickets to 'Rent,' " a play that charges up to $67 a seat, "and tonight I'm going shopping."
Views about the general economy tended to follow the same trajectory as personal economic circumstances. Not surprisingly, people who had found new jobs, bought big houses and earned big raises saw nothing but blue skies from now on. But those struggling mightily to survive saw little relevance in the Government statistics, other than a familiar pattern of the rich getting richer.
 Edna Juette, for one, a 52-year-old personnel department clerk, weary after a hard day's work, said she had noticed little improvement in her life as she headed home to a Chicago west side neighborhood that is thick with gangs.
"My salary's not going up," she said, "but my rent is. They say crime is down. But there's still plenty of shooting in my neighborhood. And gangs, they're everywhere."
When it comes to Government surpluses, people are predictably split about what to do with the extra money: cut taxes, promote more social programs or reduce the $5 trillion national debt. In true American spirit, of course, some people say they would like to do all three.
But if liberals and conservatives, and those in between, agree on anything, it is a lack of faith in Washington to wisely use the windfall.
"They're already fighting over it like a bunch of hyenas," said Fred Kawas, 59, who runs a grocery store in the Mission District of San Francisco. "They'll find a way to spend it, and it'll probably be to bail out Indonesia or Korea or somebody."
President Clinton gets a 62 percent approval rating for his handling of the economy in most polls but many people interviewed in the past week said the credit for the prosperity goes in many directions, to Mr. Clinton and Alan Greenspan, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, to technological advances and to a growing sense of personal responsibility. Doin Cummings, a 26-year-old statistical analyst who grew up the son of a janitor in a rough-at-the-edges South Side Chicago neighborhood, said that the credit has to go to the people pulling the weight.
"I grew up lower-middle class, and now I guess I'm middle-middle class," said Mr. Cummings, who plans to marry a nurse soon and take a wedding trip to the Virgin Islands.
Ms. Thomas, the young woman who has tasted prosperity after growing up without much, agreed, saying, "Are the good times going to continue? For me, they will."
Whatever the state of the economy, many of those interviewed said there should be more to the nation's health than money.
In suburban Atlanta, Joan Rasputin said she could not see how life was getting any better, only more expensive. But more than that, she lamented, whatever the size of the nation's economy these days, its spirit seemed to have taken a beating.
"There are no heroes anymore, nobody to tell my children about," said Ms. Rasputin, an artist. "In sports, all we see is people who bite off somebody's ear or beat up their coach."
The nation's reputed moral decay comes up in almost any conversation about the future of the country. It is difficult to find anyone over age 30 who does not complain about a youth culture -- too many drugs, too many videos, too many possessions -- that they believe is morally slack.
But Marty Shanahan, a 47-year-old certified public accountant in Riverside, a Chicago suburb, said people who shudder at the private pecadilloes of politicians should look back to history. And he said that people his age could hardly throw any stones at the excesses of young people.
"I lived in the 60's and 70's," he said, with a sheepish wince. "I think the moral fiber today is better than it was then."
To Frank Schwerin, a 58-year-old Chicago lawyer, there is simply too much anxiety in American life, even among the prosperous, who seem to be chasing goals that appear unattainable.
"The average work month is something like 20 hours more than it was a generation ago," he said. "Everywhere you look, both parents are working, usually because they think they need to."
What has happened, Mr. Schwerin surmised, is that people now have more money than time, and that means more stress.
"There are more activities than ever, especially where kids are involved," he said. "It's just getting harder to keep up."
Renata Kocho, a 32-year-old bank teller who moved to Chicago from the former Soviet Union six years ago, said she, too, was struck by the "busy, busy, everybody busy" nature of life in this country. She questioned why Americans worry about money, when they seem, at least by comparison to the people of her home in the Republic of Georgia, to have so much.
She said she looks at Americans and often thinks: "You are healthy, handsome, you have jobs, nice houses, nice cars, money in the bank."
And then she paused, with a puzzled expression. "So why are you all taking depression pills?"
But to other Americans, the emergence of antidepressants is simply one more indication of a nation conquering its problems, a belief that life is good.
Even Mr. Schwerin, the lawyer who voiced concerns about the focus on economic prosperity, noted that if affluence did not mean nirvana, it certainly was better than a stick in the eye.
"Money may not buy happiness," he said. "But lack of money buys a lot of unhappiness."

I.M.F. Acknowledges Misjudgment in Indonesia
A confidential report by the International Monetary Fund concedes that an important element of its rescue strategy for Indonesia backfired and helped cause a bank panic that contributed to other financial market declines in Asia.
Though the report cites failures by the Indonesian Government, it acknowledges a misjudgment over how the Indonesian public would react to bank closings. Page A1. 

Surprise: Comeback in Korea
After suffering a near-death experience in the waning weeks of 1997, the South Korean stock market has enjoyed a remarkable comeback so far in 1998, with a gain of nearly 24 percent. However precarious, the revival provides a rare bit of good news from Asia. D10.
 
Federal regulators are collecting normally confidential information about individual American banks' loans to South Korea and are sharing it with large banks leading an effort to extend payments on the loans, according to commercial bankers. D10.
 
Thailand recorded the biggest current-account surplus in 20 years in the fourth quarter, reversing three years of trade deficits. D10.
 
Inflation Still Largely Dormant
Inflation remained tame as last year ended. The Consumer Price Index rose one-tenth of 1 percent in December, matching analysts' expectations, and only 1.7 percent for all of 1997, the lowest rate since 1986. D2.
 
Treasury securities fell, despite the benign inflation news. The 30-year bond yield rose to 5.73 percent from 5.69. D12.
 
Jackson Begins Wall St. Drive
The Rev. Jesse L. Jackson and his Rainbow/PUSH Coalition have begun an effort to promote economic opportunities for minorities and women, both in finance and beyond. D4.
 
Cable Deregulation Delay Possible
Cable television customers are paying more for the service because there is no serious competition, the F.C.C. said. The agency's findings, which confirmed what many cable TV subscribers may have suspected, could result in a delay of the planned deregulation of the industry next year. D6.
 
ABC Keeps Football Rights
ABC retained the rights to "Monday Night Football," joining CBS and Fox in paying staggering sums to broadcast National Football League games. NBC now finds itself without N.F.L. broadcast rights. C1.
 
Madison Avenue is sending a message to the television networks that will broadcast N.F.L. games: If they think they are going to recoup the far higher payments they now face by sharply raising ad rates, fuhgeddaboudit. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. D4.
 
Profit Rises at Ameritech
Ameritech said that its earnings rose 7 percent in the fourth quarter, in line with estimates, as demand for new phone lines lifted sales. D11.
 
Nasdaq to Offer New Trade System
Nasdaq intends to offer a high-technology trading system being backed by mutual funds and other professional investors, even though many Wall Street dealers are lukewarm about the system, in part because it could eat into their profits. Market Place. D11.
 
Work Force Cut at J. Crew
J. Crew, the retail and catalogue company, dismissed about 100 employees, or about 10 percent of its work force, as it struggles to meet profit expectations. D2.

HEADLINE: Iraq Bars Arms Inspectors Again, Saying American in Charge Is Spy

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 13

 BODY:
Iraq carried out its threat today to block an arms inspection by an American-dominated team, instantly provoking calls for action in Washington and foreign capitals, and forcing the Security Council to look again for an effective way to condemn Baghdad without threatening force.
The Council, which was the focus of today's action, reacted with a unity born of despair that Iraq had thrown another crisis in the way of accounting for its weapons of mass destruction. But today no one was "making excuses for Iraq," said a diplomat who attended the meeting. 
 United States officials reiterated earlier warnings but did not suggest what the Security Council should do.
"It's completely unacceptable, and we would expect that the Security Council will take the issue up and issue an appropriate condemnation of the action on the part of the Iraqis," the Secretary of Defense, William Cohen, said.
In Washington, Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman, said, "I am not going to speculate on what fashion an appropriate response will take."
"It is always better to act in concert with others when we can," he added, "but there is never any reluctance to act alone if we must."
The Council is expected to issue a statement, possibly on Wednesday, after diplomats have had time to consult their Governments.
Mr. Cohen said President Saddam Hussein of Iraq "should not and is not in a position of being able to dictate who can conduct inspections," adding, "It's the equivalent of a parolee deciding who his parole officer is going to be."
Nevertheless, when William Scott Ritter Jr., a former Marine captain, set out for work in Iraq today, leading a team of about 33 inspectors from 12 nations, he was turned back, as the Iraqis said he would be because they are refusing once again to allow Americans to take part in weapons inspections. This morning an Iraqi newspaper called Mr. Ritter a "hyena." Usually Mr. Ritter, who served in the 1991 war against Iraq, is merely branded a spy.
In Baghdad today, Mr. Ritter noted that the inspection team included scientists and technicians with expertise in chemical and biological weapons as well as missiles. He would not say whether he had requested entry at what Iraq calls "sensitive" sites.
In Washington, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, discussed Iraq in a telephone conversation with the Russian Foreign Minister, Yevgeny Primakov, and planned to speak with Hubert Vedrine, the French Foreign Minister, American officials said.
In the past, France and Russia have urged the Council to ease the sanctions that have frozen the Iraqi economy for more than seven years. But both Russian and French representatives at the United Nations said today that there is no question of allowing Iraq to evade its responsibilities under the accord that set up a plan for eliminating Iraqi weapons.
In Moscow the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Valery Nesterushkin, said Russia "was taking active steps to find a way out of the situation." In November Mr. Primakov persuaded the Iraqis to drop an earlier ban on American inspectors, apparently in return for Russia's best efforts at speeding up the inspections and tinkering with the United Nations Special Commission, which was created to disarm Iraq. The Russians were rebuffed.
The Russians did raise a number of questions today about the functioning of the investigations. After the Security Council meeting, Sergey Lavrov, the Russian representative, said his questions were about "arithmetic."
Bill Richardson, the United States representative, acknowledged late in the day that the Russians had raised questions. But earlier he had described the Council as "very, very united in viewing Iraq's actions as unacceptable."
Iraq was able to make some points during this standoff, however, among them that the commission has become heavily weighted with American and European experts, especially Britons.
To counter this trend, Richard Butler, the executive chairman of the commission, has taken commissioners from a variety of countries with him on visits to Baghdad. In December he was accompanied by commission members from Russia, France and Britain. On a trip next week he plans to take commissioners from China, Canada and Italy.
China has offered for the first time to send full-time arms experts to the commission. In the past the Chinese have refused, apparently because of the cost. The financial ability to lend experts to the commission, coupled with the reservoir of expertise needed, have largely created the situation in which Americans dominate inspection teams.
It has been evident for nearly a year that the Special Commission, first under Rolf Ekeus, a Swedish diplomat and disarmament expert, then under Mr. Butler, that the investigators were closing in on President Hussein's most closely guarded secrets. Repeated Iraqi claims that it had shown the inspectors everything were dismissed as unacceptable.
NBC News reported tonight, for example, that a prison the inspectors asked to see on Monday was thought to be the site of human tests of chemical and biological weapons. United Nations officials said tonight that they had long suspected that Iraq was testing such weapons on animals. They added that there was an outside chance that humans, too, had been used for testing, but said they had no specific information.
Against that background, Baghdad began its campaign to deepen splits in the Security Council about how to proceed if sanctions were ever to be lifted. At the same time, Iraq has continued to expand areas it declares off limits to inspection, a tactic that Russia, France and China have joined in condemning.
Mr. Butler, who briefed the Security Council today, was asked by reporters whether Mr. Ritter's team may have been getting too close to a significant discovery. "I know that the reasons Iraq gives for objecting to Ritter are false," he said. "Logically there must be some other reason."
Iraq has also stepped up a campaign to convince the world that its people are suffering unacceptably from the sanctions. American and British officials counter with charges that from 1991 to 1996 President Hussein refused to accept an offer to sell oil to buy food and medicines. The plan was finally adopted a year ago, but contracts have been delayed and deliveries of civilian goods have been slow.
This week Iraq expects to resume exporting oil after a delay while a new food-distribution plan was drawn up.

HEADLINE: Brooklyn Academy Bets on the Borough

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
After 15 years of making and (mostly) winning courageous bets on artists at its Next Wave Festival, the always bold Brooklyn Academy of Music is entering an ambitious new phase, a next wave of the institution itself.
By almost any measure, the Brooklyn Academy is one of New York City's success stories. Back in 1967, when Harvey Lichtenstein became president and executive producer, there was talk of turning the elegant 135-year-old opera house into tennis courts. 
 Today its audiences, overwhelmingly from Manhattan, stream there to see and hear cutting-edge artists from around the world, and the academy has become a sparkling if idiosyncratic lure on the southern fringe of what had long been a deteriorating downtown Brooklyn.
Now the academy has taken on a new challenge, one calculated to connect it with its home borough and neighborhood in an unparalleled manner. The heavily subsidized institution famous for avant-garde programming and short seasons is plunging into a for-profit movie and restaurant business on a 14-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week schedule. Further, it is buying nearby real estate to foster an arts-fueled night life that Bruce Rattner, the academy's chairman, predicts will become "the Left Bank of New York City."
Mr. Lichtenstein said: "We put an anchor in this area and helped save it from going down the drain. Now we're ready to help it build." The idea is to use infusions of city money and a little help from state agencies to accelerate the economic development of an area that for decades suffered decay.
The price tag is considerably less than the $180 million spent in Newark to build a new performing arts center as a magnet for urban development, but the effort is part of a national trend from Pittsburgh to Cleveland to Oakland, Calif.
Indeed, the expansion in Brooklyn directly emerged from a 1996 study by the Regional Plan Association on how to revitalize the downtown neighborhood, which was once home to dozens of theaters. The report urged steps to encourage a "vibrant 24-hour community with an exciting mix of activities." The path may be easier in Brooklyn than Newark in the sense that the immediate neighborhood is already bouncing back. But success is hardly guaranteed, not least because some nearby residents and business owners regard the academy as essentially an island of Manhattan elitism in a working-class, mostly black neighborhood, a place many visit only on round-trip charter buses from midtown.
The people who run the academy "need to understand that just because they're the big guys doesn't give them the right to walk all over other people," said Selma Jackson, co-owner of 4-W Circle, a gift shop in a nearby strip of Afrocentric boutiques and cafes.
The academy's first initiative, expected to be completed in September, is the reconstruction of major features of the opera house by Hardy Holzman, Pfeiffer Associates, the firm that renovated the academy's Majestic Theater and the New Victory Theater in Times Square. The opera house project, under way for more than a year, includes the conversion of the Carey Playhouse and Lepercq performance space into a cafe, a bookstore and a multi-screen theater showcasing independent films not regularly shown in Brooklyn.
The second, bolder venture is to reach out into the surrounding neighborhood to jump-start smaller arts organizations, restaurants and night clubs, in some cases by actually buying buildings and leasing them to others. The academy has revived a local development corporation that had been dormant for a decade.
 
Cultivating The Neighborhood
The city has put up $18 million for the academy's internal expansion, and the state is selling it a vacant building at 2 Lafayette Street, across from the opera house, at the low price of $185,000. The Mark Morris Dance Group, long one of the academy's most popular attractions, will make the building its permanent home, along with at least one restaurant, perhaps a branch of Sylvia's of Harlem or the New City Cafe in neighboring Fort Greene.
H. Claude Shostal, president of the Regional Plan Association, a strong backer of the academy's initiative, cautioned that success depended on the careful cultivation of neighborhood relations, among other factors. He pointed out that it took more than a decade for Lincoln Center to spark its neighborhood.
When Mr. Lichtenstein, now 68, came to Brooklyn three decades ago, after serving as an executive at the New York City Ballet, part of the opera house was rented to a martial-arts school, and there was talk of selling the building. Then came new artists, Next Wave and even a $15 million endowment. The academy's current operating budget is $17.2 million.
"Harvey never runs out of new ideas," Mr. Shostal said. "He is one of the most remarkable innovators in the arts and community arts. The institution has taken risks like nobody else in the city, but successful risks."
Mr. Lichtenstein said risk was necessary for the sort of institution he and a small cadre of dedicated aides have created. "We want to be five steps ahead of everybody else," he said. "That's our role."
Borough President Howard Golden saw the Brooklyn Academy as an initial entertainment lure for a wider area that could benefit from its 300,000 annual visitors. He appropriated $5 million, and the city followed with $13 million from its general coffers.
Mr. Rattner characterized the effort as the opposite of Newark's top-down approach of creating something from nothing through government fiat. He said the academy's new district was intended to "percolate up" as the result of numerous local initiatives. "In a way, it's kind of like Brooklyn," he said, a reference to the borough's reputation for scrappy independence.
The academy hopes to create a buzz, a sense that the corner of Brooklyn where the city tried and failed to persuade the fleeing Dodgers to move is now the place to be. "One thing leads to another," Mr. Lichtenstein said. "With Mark Morris, we'll have other arts organizations that want to move in."
Michael Ayoub, who operates two restaurants in Park Slope, Cucina and Mike and Tony's, about a half-mile from the academy, draws crowds from its events. Partly as a result, Mr. Ayoub was chosen as operator of Cafe BAM, which opened in October, quickly expanding to 200 seats from the initial 120. It has so far been open only during the Next Wave Festival.
Mr. Ayoub is planning to open yet another place. "This whole area is hotter than a pistol," he said. "I'm putting my money where my mouth is."
Other factors have contributed to what some call a Brooklyn renaissance: Metrotech, an office complex, opened a dozen blocks north six years ago, and Atlantic Center, a shopping mall five blocks to the south, opened in 1996. Both are projects of Mr. Rattner's company, Forest City Rattner. Downtown Brooklyn's first new major hotel in more than 60 years is scheduled to open this summer.
Education is another shot of energy to the area. Enrollment at Long Island University nearby on Flatbush Avenue has doubled to 9,000 in six years. Other Brooklyn institutions are also thriving only a few miles away, including St. Francis College, Pratt Institute and Brooklyn Polytechnic.
This is not the academy's first expansion. A decade ago, it took the shell of a once grand theater on Fulton Street, the Majestic, several blocks from the opera house and fashioned a darkly whimsical space that has become a major stage for the academy's eclectic theater productions. The activity at the Majestic has stimulated other developments, particularly at the neighboring Strand Theater, which is not part of the academy but houses several arts organizations, including Urban Glass, a glass-blowing studio. The Strand may soon become a production site for theater productions by Brooklyn groups.
Linking with the emerging strip of black businesses on nearby Fulton Street is a particular goal of Mr. Lichtenstein and other academy officials. Called by the merchants the Bogolan District, for the Mali word for mud cloth, the six-block district has boutiques, shops and cafes, including the Brooklyn Moon Cafe, which features art shows and poetry readings.
"What appears to be happening is that area is becoming an African SoHo," said Jonathan Rose, an academy board member who was one of the earlier developers of Atlantic Center until it was taken over by Mr. Rattner's company.
Not a few business owners in the Bogolan District see the academy as a big, impersonal entity that has little to do with them. They note that Sylvia's, which the academy is courting to move into the neighborhood, was the exclusive caterer at its concerts in Fort Greene Park last summer, not local restaurants, and that the academy held a reception to honor the poster of its Dance Africa series at a Manhattan gallery.
"There is no connection with businesses in the neighborhood," said Ms. Jackson, the gift shop owner.
 
Polarized Responses
Local focus groups convened for the academy have also underlined a potential racial divide. "The black audience was very, very vocal," said Socrates Nicholas of Nicholas Research Associates International Inc., which organized the focus groups. "They don't want to be left out and pushed out. The white audience said it's wonderful, because they won't have to go to Manhattan."
Mr. Lichtenstein and others respond that they plan film series of black directors and other programs with African-American themes and will particularly reach out to Spike Lee and other Brooklyn-based filmmakers. They also say they have greatly expanded their educational programs, serving predominantly minority children in the area.
And with the opening of the movie theater next fall, complete with Dolby sound and $8 tickets, anyone will be free to lounge in comfortable chairs in the informal part of the cafe, whether they buy anything or not.
At Cafe BAM recently, on the evening of a performance of the Brooklyn Philharmonic Orchestra, the future looked bright. The cafe preserves the feeling of spaciousness in what was the Lepercq performance space, but now features huge vaulting red arches, each lined with silver-tipped light bulbs. Every seat was filled.
 
'It Took The First Week'
"I was astonished by how quickly people were there," said Hugh Hardy, who designed the cafe and cinema. "I thought it would take the first year, and it took the first week."
Next month, the cafe will hold its first culinary event, a Hungarian festival. George Lang, who owns Cafe des Artistes in Manhattan and the Grundl restaurant in Budapest, will present two Hungarian chefs using spices generally unavailable in the United States. Mr. Lang will create the menu.
The 850-seat movie complex is expected to be an even bigger draw when it opens next fall. Sales of 100,000 tickets are projected for the first year. George Wachtel, president of Audience Research and Analysis, said two-thirds of Brooklynites who now travel to Manhattan for independent films say they will switch to the new theater.
If all these projections come true, the academy may face an odd new challenge, maintaining its cutting-edge, nonconformist stance even as its empire swells.
"We're still on the outskirts," Mr. Lichtenstein insisted. "We're still the outsider." As for himself, Mr. Lichtenstein does not predict when he will retire. He says the current projects will take a year or two. "Then I'll see," he said. "It depends on how I feel my strength. I feel good now, and my energy's good."

HEADLINE: DuPont Prize for 'Frontline'

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
"Frontline," the public television documentary series produced by WGBH-TV in Boston, won the highest award, the Gold Baton, last night at the annual Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Awards.
The series was among 12 winners chosen by a seven-member jury from 626 submissions of radio and television programs that were broadcast between July 1, 1996, and June 30, 1997. 
 "Frontline" was cited for remarkable quality and sustained commitment to controversial and sensitive stories, investigative reporting and political coverage as exemplified by four programs.
They included "Murder, Money and Mexico," an investigative report on the rise and fall of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico and his brother Raul; "The Choice '96," a two-hour film portrait of the Presidential candidates Bob Dole and Bill Clinton; "Secret Daughter," a two-hour autobiographical film on racism by June Cross, and "Innocence Lost: The Plea," about charges of sexual abuse in a day care center in Edenton, N.C.
Of the 11 Silver Batons, one went to CBS News for "Enter the Jury Room," which showed jurors in the process of deliberation. Another went to WABC-TV, New York, for "Room 104: The Overcrowding Crisis," which focused on a first-grade classroom in Brooklyn.
ABC News won for "Prime Time Live: Debt Reckoning," a report on the Associates Corporation, a subsidiary of the Ford Motor Company that used manipulative practices to sell mortgage loans to unsophisticated borrowers. Another Silver Baton went to KCET, Los Angeles, and the BBC for the series "The Great War and the Shaping of the 20th Century," broadcast on PBS.
Also honored were Wisconsin Public Television for "Welcome to Poverty Hollow," which followed three families in an innovative anti-poverty effort that responded to the state's welfare reform; and the Center for New American Media for "Vote for Me: Politics in America," a PBS mini-series that focused on local campaigns and candidates. The PBS presentation of "An American Nile," about the Colorado River, won a Silver Baton for the filmmakers, Jon Else, Sandra Itkoff and Marc Reisner.
NBC News and Scripps Howard New Productions won for "Why Can't We Live Together?," an hourlong documentary that examined the self-fulfilling prophecies of race relations in Matteson, Ill., a Chicago suburb.
KTCA in St. Paul won for "News Night Minnesota: Unisys," a series of reports on the impact of downsizing on long-term employees of the Unisys Corporation.
Blowback Productions received a Silver Baton for "CIA: America's Secret Warriors," a three-hour series on the Discovery Channel that coincided with the 50th anniversary of the Central Intelligence Agency.
And KUSC Radio, in Los Angeles, was honored for "Marketplace," a half-hour nightly program on economic issues, broadcast on Public Radio International.
With Christiane Amanpour, the senior international correspondent for CNN, as host, the awards ceremony in the rotunda of Low Memorial Library at Columbia is to be broadcast nationwide today on PBS.
The awards were established in 1942 by Jessie Ball duPont in memory of her husband, Alfred I. duPont.

HEADLINE: $2.8 Million for Tiny Site Vital to Tower

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Only after Reuters American Holdings and the Rudin Organization signed a deal last October to build a 32-story headquarters in Times Square did the two partners realize that the site for the project was not quite big enough.
The subsequent shortfall touched off a contretemps among those involved in the redevelopment of the square and lots of movement in the jigsaw puzzle that has become Times Square, according to those involved in the deal. 
 Reuters, the giant British media company, and the developer have now agreed to pay $2.8 million to buy the extra space it needs, a small four-story building and alleyway on West 43d Street that sits next to their site at the northwest corner of 42d Street and Seventh Avenue.
The building, which is to be demolished, is owned by the New 42d Street, a nonprofit group established by the state to oversee six theaters in the area. The extra space will enable Reuters and Rudin to build the 855,000 square-foot tower they had originally planned.
The small white building on 43d Street currently serves as office space and a back entrance for the New Victory Theater on 42d Street. The Rudin Organization has agreed to provide the theater with office space and an entryway in the new tower, known as the Reuters Building.
The New 42d Street, in turn, plans to use the money to help pay for a new 10-story, $18.5 million building on the north side of 42d Street that will house rehearsal studios, workshop space, offices and a 199-seat theater.
The group's plans for the rehearsal space suffered an unexpected blow shortly before Christmas, when the terra cotta entrance to the Selwyn Theater, which was to have formed the entrance, collapsed along with a six-story building. New 42d is now redrawing its design.
Charles Millard, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, confirmed that the deal was in the works.
"This helps the New 42d serve the needs of Broadway," Mr. Millard said, "and it helps the Rudin-Reuters team develop a better site."
John J. Gilbert, chief operating officer of the Rudin Organization, declined to comment, as did Cora Cahan, president of the New 42d.
State and city officials are now remeasuring the site and the proposed building to be certain that Reuters and Rudin can legally build the tower. Complicating matters is the fact that measuring square-footage is more of an art than a science in New York City real estate, where landlords, tenants and city officials frequently use widely differing yardsticks.
The latest deal did not come without some hard bargaining.
The Rudin Organization and Reuters had been upset about the problem after buying the development site from the Prudential Insurance Company of America in a deal that the insurance company valued at $90 million. Reuters needed as much space as it could get for several 20-foot-high trading floors.
Not wanting to build a smaller, less lucrative tower, the developer asked Prudential to remedy the situation by transferring development rights from another nearby site controlled by the insurance company, according to executives close to the talks. Prudential balked, suggesting that the buyer got what he paid for.
In recent weeks, Rudin opened talks with the New 42d Street about buying the four-story building at the back of the New Victory Theater. In the early 1980's, the parcel had been part of the office development site now owned by Reuters and Rudin. But in 1988, the state pushed Prudential to give up the parcel so that the New Victory Theater would have a delivery entrance.
Now, the New 42d Street is selling the same parcel.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Stability in Technology Stocks Seems to Bolster Markets

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
After months of drifting lower, technology stocks are beginning to show some signs of stability.
While many technology issues are still trading well below levels reached in October, there are indications that the selloff might have been overdone and that company profits could be surprisingly solid. 
 One early indication came from Intel, which reported strong fourth-quarter earnings after the market closed Tuesday, easing some fears that technology stocks would suffer enormously from the crisis in Asia.
More good news, which had been expected, came yesterday, when Apple Computer said after the market closed that it had posted its first quarterly profit in a year.
Yahoo Inc. -- an Internet search engine -- also reported a profit after the market closed, raising hopes that some companies selling products and services related to the World Wide Web might find a way to generate profits.
"The outlook for the industry remains extremely strong," said Alec Ellison, a managing director at Broadview Associates, a technology banker. "But the growth in certain segments has come down from extraordinary levels to simply strong levels."
That kind of sentiment has lifted an array of technology stocks this week, and perhaps even helped strengthen the broader market. Yesterday, the Nasdaq market, where many technology issues trade, rose 7.13 points, to 1,548.76. The Dow Jones industrial average rose for the third consecutive session, gaining 52.56 points, to 7,784.69.
Although concerns persist about fierce pricing competition at home in the computer business and slower growth in Asia, some analysts say the evidence emerging this week indicates things are more complicated than investors had thought.
"The positive factor is the Internet is growing strongly, and that's helping a lot of technology sales," said Mary Meeker, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company. "The negative factor is weakness in Asia, and that could impact other countries and have a rolling effect that could affect us."
Because of slowing growth in Asia, a number of Wall Street analysts have sharply cut earnings estimates, which has eroded the value of many technology stocks, including titans like Intel and Microsoft.
"Technology investors were expecting Asia to be a plus," said Frederick Taylor, chief investment officer at the U.S. Trust Company. "Instead of being a plus, it's at best a neutral and probably a negative."
Mr. Ellison at Broadview suggested that technology stock prices would vacillate because the industry was known for sudden growth spurts and slowdowns. "These are inherently volatile stocks because everyone is trying to figure out what their growth rates are," he said. "Intel is down 25 percent from its high, and yet its prospects are growing."
One big test might come next week, when Compaq Computer, I.B.M., Microsoft and Seagate Technology report earnings.
Among the bright spots are Internet companies, vying to make the Web into a profitable electronic playground. While a large majority of Internet companies continue to do poorly in the stock market, sinking far below their offering price years after going public, a few have seen spectacular gains.
Part of the reason is that a few companies are beginning to show signs of profitability. A few weeks ago, E-Trade, an on-line discount brokerage firm, posted a strong fourth-quarter profit. A number of other hot young Internet companies are showing improved prospects, including @Home, America Online and Amazon.com. Shares of those companies have soared in the last year.
 Keith Benjamin, a technology analyst at BancAmerica Robertson Stephens, said that Internet companies, unlike semiconductor equipment makers with operations overseas, were somewhat inoculated against the current slowdown in Asia.
"That's because the single-biggest driver of stock prices has been E-mail," he said. "And a majority of corporate America doesn't even have it yet."
Still, analysts insist that investors have become increasingly skeptical about some Internet products and services.
"The market has become viciously selective," said David Simons, a managing director at Digital Video Investments, a technology research firm in New York. "There's been this enormous tiering of the market."
That might be why fewer Internet companies went public in 1997. Twelve companies had initial public offerings in 1997, down from 22 in 1996, the Securities Data Company said.
Lise Buyer, an Internet analyst at the DMG Technology Group, said investors cared less about a prospective company's vision and more about its business model.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Increased 0.7% in December

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 14

 BODY:
Retailers rang up their biggest sales gain in half a year during December, helped by last-minute holiday shoppers as well as strong demand for cars, and analysts and retailers said consumers were likely to continue fueling economic growth early this year.
The Commerce Department said today that retail sales rose seven-tenths of 1 percent last month, meeting analysts' expectations and more than double November's revised increase of three-tenths of 1 percent. 
 "For shoppers, this is the best environment in more than a decade," said Ira Silver, chief economist at the J. C. Penney Company. "People will take advantage of that -- when they have money, Americans spend it."
The unemployment rate is low and incomes are rising. Moreover, said Christopher Low, an economist at HSBC Markets Inc., further consumer spending could be prompted by a spate of mortgage refinancings resulting from lower interest rates and by early income tax refunds.
"The conditions for consumer spending in the first quarter are phenomenal," he said.
During all of last year, retail sales rose 4.2 percent, slower than the 5.2 percent gain in 1996 and the worst showing since 1991. In part, analysts said, the slowdown reflected the fact that inflation was at its lowest rate in a decade, which kept the cost of goods low as the volume of sales rose. The Government report measures the amount spent, not volume.
Peter Kretzmer, an economist at the Nationsbank Corporation in New York, said the slowing sales growth also indicated that consumers were spending more on services and other goods that were not included in the retail sales report.
December's gain was led by sales of autos, furniture and apparel. Auto sales rose 2.3 percent as car makers continued to use rebates and low-cost financing plans to lure customers.
Excluding vehicles, December sales rose two-tenths of 1 percent.
Sales of durable goods -- big-ticket items like autos, appliances and furniture -- rose 1.9 percent. Orders for nondurable goods, ranging from groceries to clothing, decreased one-tenth of 1 percent.
Sales at apparel stores rose eight-tenths of 1 percent, while those at department stores increased two-tenths of 1 percent.
Analysts said rising retail sales would not necessarily lead to higher prices because shoppers were buying discounted items and retailers were keeping prices low to compete with inexpensive imports from depressed Asian economies.
Last week, retail stores reported strong December sales, aided in large part by purchases made during a few days immediately before and after Christmas. The Goldman, Sachs & Company same-store sales index, which compares the results of stores open at least a year, showed a 4.4 percent gain in sales during December, up from only 2.9 percent in December 1996.
Because the wave of shopping came so late in the month, today's report may have understated the size of December's gain. The Government measures actual sales for the first half of the month but estimates sales for the second half.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Outbid on Pro Football, NBC Retains 'E.R.' in Record Pact

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER 

DATELINE: PASADENA, Calif., Jan. 14

 BODY:
NBC agreed today to a deal to pay Warner Brothers, the studio that owns the drama "E.R.," about $13 million an episode over the next three years for a total of more than $850 million, making the medical series the most expensive television show ever.
The deal came a day after the National Football League concluded the richest television deal in history, a $17.6 billion deal with three networks, not including NBC. 
 Taken together the deals showed how the television networks, weakened by losses of viewers to cable channels, feel compelled to pay once- unheard of prices to retain the few programs that generate consistently large audiences. The NBC agreement comes close to tripling what the network had agreed to pay earlier this year for what turned out to be the last season of its hit comedy series "Seinfeld."
Many network executives said in interviews here that the crushing programming costs were likely to lead networks to increase their efforts to own or control every program they put on the air.
NBC announced it had concluded negotiations with Warner Brothers to hold onto television's most popular show without giving any financial details. But several executives on both sides of the negotiations said the price was $13 million an episode, a figure that exceeded even early predictions that it could go as high as $10 million.
The show features an attractive cast of young doctors and nurses working in a Chicago hospital emergency room. It is the most valuable property in television for numerous reasons, beginning with its high ratings and the attractive makeup of its audience, which includes a high percentage of the adults between the ages of 18 and 49 that most advertisers seek to reach.
The show has also proved to be television's best lead-in in decades to local news on affiliated stations, and it helped rebuild NBC's "Tonight" into television's dominant late-night franchise.
Don Ohlmeyer, the president of NBC's West Coast entertainment division, said NBC had factored all those things into its bid to retain "E.R.," although he added that NBC was confident "we won't lose money" on the deal, even without considering those ancillary benefits.
Still, the per-episode price of $13 million towers over anything previously paid for the rights to broadcast a television series.
Most series cost networks between $1 million and $1.5 million. "E.R" itself now costs about $2 million. This season NBC agreed to paid a then-record $5.5 million an episode for "Seinfeld."
But the star of that series, Jerry Seinfeld, announced last month that he was shutting down production on the comedy in May. That only increased the pressure on NBC to keep possession of its other ratings leader, "E.R."
Mr. Ohlmeyer acknowledged that the imminent loss of "Seinfeld" helped force more millions out of the NBC treasury.
"Obviously the loss of 'Seinfeld' increased the importance of making sure we kept 'E.R.,' " he said.
Robert Daly, the chairman of Warner Brothers Inc., agreed that the timing of Mr. Seinfeld's decision "certainly didn't hurt our negotiations."
Indeed, NBC acted rather swiftly to lock up "E.R." as its Thursday night anchor at 10 P.M., Eastern standard time, after it learned it would no longer have "Seinfeld" as its 9 P.M. centerpiece. Mr. Ohlmeyer said the "E.R." deal was "basically concluded" even before NBC entered the final phases of its National Football League negotiations, during which it lost the rights to the American Football Conference games, which it had held for more than 30 years.
NBC was long aware that its competitors had publicly stated their intention to bid for "E.R." and Mr. Daly acknowledged that while Warner Brothers could not negotiate with any other party, "Everybody talked to us."
NBC's exclusive negotiation period was not set to begin until February, but Mr. Daly said he received a call from Mr. Ohlmeyer soon after the holidays seeking to initiate the "E.R" discussions.
"The whole process only took four or five days," Mr. Daly said. "NBC made a very fair offer that we felt reflected the show's market value."
That market value is enormous. One senior executive from a competing network said NBC had made about $200 million a year in profit on the series.
Mr. Daly noted that NBC had reaped these enormous profits during the first four years of "E.R." when it held an exclusive contract for the show and did not have to increase the license fee it paid to Warner Brothers, which is a subsidiary of Time Warner Inc.
"It was time for that to change," Mr. Daly said.
Warner Brothers had actually made an effort to change the terms in the show's second year. Several current and former Warner Brothers executives said the studio had asked NBC, which is owned by General Electric, to increase the license fee to $4 million a year in exchange for a two-year extension on the initial four-year contract. When NBC declined, the executives said, Warner executives were upset and refused subsequent NBC efforts to extend the "E.R" deal before it reached the crisis point this year.
Mr. Ohlmeyer noted that Warner Brothers had sought to open up the "E.R" deal at the same time it was looking for better terms for its comedy "Friends."
"We accepted the proposal on 'Friends' and not on 'E.R'," Mr. Ohlmeyer said.
Mr. Daly said that Warner Brothers had preferred all along to keep the show at NBC, where it has thrived on Thursday night, and where Warner Brothers has placed several other shows including "Friends" and "Veronica's Closet."
"E.R." will remain on Thursday at 10 P.M. and will include all members of the current cast, at least for next season. After that, George Clooney is free to leave, but a Warner Brothers spokeswoman said the rest of the show's ensemble cast was under contract for two to four more years.
With "Seinfeld" which is also under the Warner Brothers banner, the studio controls four of the five shows now on NBC's powerhouse Thursday night lineup.
"We really have good relationships at NBC," Mr. Daly said. The studio already had commitments from NBC to put at least two other Warner Brothers shows on its schedule next fall.
One prominent Hollywood business executive said the most likely impact of the deal was heightened pressure on the networks to own everything they put on the air.
He added, "I think you might hear NBC executives say: 'We had to pay for "Frasier," for "Seinfeld" and we got it stuck to us by "E.R." Never again.' "
One outcome may be much longer initial deals for series, the executive said, or perpetual options to insure that a series could not be offered to an outside network.
Trying to put the scale of the "E.R." deal and the N.F.L. deals in context, one senior network executive said, "We're in a period of great desperation in television."
But Mr. Ohlmeyer argued that the "E.R" deal, big as it was, was chiefly a reflection of how the television economy has traditionally worked, with a studio waiting for an initial four-year license period with a network to run out so that it can seek huge increases for renewals of hit shows.
"If you look at the history of television," he said, "When you have an enormous hit the network benefits for the first four years it's on the air. After that, the studio takes advantage. There's no real difference here."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Prices of Treasury Securities Retreat After Bouncing Around

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities fell slightly yesterday after bouncing around as investor attention shifted among a variety of factors, from the Asian turmoil to the United States stock market to the economy and inflation.
The 30-year bond fell 1/8, to 105 19/32, with the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, unchanged at 5.73 percent. 
 The stock market's weak opening surprised bond market participants, forcing those who had expected strength in stocks -- and thus, weakness in bonds -- to retreat from their bearish positions in the bond market, lifting prices.
Talk of foreign central banks buying Treasury securities with two- and three-year maturities gave the bond market support, as did some futures purchases by hedge funds.
The Government reported yesterday that retail sales in December were stronger than expected, rising seven-tenths of 1 percent, which might have been expected to cause fears of inflation, hurting the bond market.
But a number of economists said the underlying trend was really weaker than the number indicated after auto sales were excluded. As a result, the report had little impact.
Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of the fixed-income department at J. W. Charles Securities Inc. in Boca Raton, Fla., said investors were still focusing on international news.
Worries about fallout from the Asian financial crisis have driven bond yields to their low levels. "We will probably stay within this range another two to three weeks," he said.
"If you look at day-to-day trading at this time, there are green lights in all directions for interest rates," Mr. Pugliese said.
"The bull market wish list has all the ingredients for low rates and higher prices and people are coming to the realization that rates are down to stay for the foreseeable future and likely to go lower."
The low interest rates are prompting municipal and corporate borrowers to come to market for new cash or refinancing of old debt to lower debt service payments.
Among the more notable deals this week were Tuesday's $650 million bond offering by New York City's Transitional Finance Authority through underwriters led by Bear, Stearns & Company, and yesterday's $1.25 billion corporate financing by the General Motors Acceptance Corporation through Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter.

HEADLINE: Environmentalists and Hearst Heirs Locked in Battle at San Simeon

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: SAN SIMEON, Calif., Jan. 14

 BODY:
It spreads like a rolling green and brown blanket from the mountains to the sea, 77,000 acres of pristine ranch land crowned by the private castle of treasures that William Randolph Hearst called La Cuesta Encantada, his Enchanted Hill.
The house and grounds have been a state park since 1958 and now draw nearly a million visitors a year. But Hearst's heirs still own the bulk of this spectacular 15-mile stretch of the central California coastline, and their proposal to build a 650-room resort complex and a 27-hole golf course overlooking the ocean has sparked a colossal battle among environmentalists, ranchers, unions, pro-development groups and local officials over the future of land that has remained virtually unchanged since Spanish colonial days. 
 "It's probably the coastal issue of the 90's," said Peter Douglas, executive director of the state's powerful Coastal Commission.
The commission will hold an unusual daylong hearing on the plan, and perhaps a vote, in nearby San Luis Obispo on Thursday. Indeed, the Embassy Suites hotel there, where the members have been meeting all week, resembles nothing else so much as a state legislature at budget time, with dozens of lobbyists haunting the hallways and overflow crowds of more than 1,000 people expected.
The issue has shaped up as a classic fight over private property rights and environmental concerns in a state where the environmental movement and coastal protections have long been strong but where population growth and economic recovery are putting new development pressures on once-sleepy locales.
The Hearst-built resort would take up a small part of what has been a working cattle ranch ever since the family patriarch, the mining magnate George Hearst, began buying land here in 1865. The idea is not new, having languished in one form or another for three decades as the Hearst Corporation, the family-controlled media conglomerate, tried in vain to win final approval for a project large enough to justify what it now estimates could be a $100 million investment to build a world-class resort complex in several phases over the next 15 years.
Now the plan is up for review again, as part of a broader coastal planning revision that San Luis Obispo County was required to submit to the state. The county's plan would allow a broader range of development along its coastline stretching southward from the rocky cliffs of Big Sur, by relaxing rules that insure rural character with strict limits on the scale of buildings in scenic areas and the retention of agricultural land.
The county's Board of Supervisors approved that relaxation, and the incorporated Hearst proposal, by a 3-to-2 vote last year, after two seats changed in the 1996 elections, making for a pro-development majority.
"It's good for the county, it's good for the economy," said the board's new chairman, Michael P. Ryan, a rancher. "We have a beautiful county here, growing slowly, and I like that. But it has to grow, and this is a slow, planned, sensible way to do it."
Spokesmen for the Hearst Corporation emphasize that the county's plan is only a broad zoning overview and that each proposed project, from the golf course to a dude ranch and two other proposed hotels, would have to face the usual gantlet of building permits and environmental review before a brick could be laid or a hole dug. They have undertaken a major lobbying campaign that might have made the old tycoon smile, sending direct mail to every registered voter in the county, running full-page newspaper advertisements and buying time for a promotional videotape on local cable television.
"We feel the phase-in is the built-in protection," said Philip M. Battaglia, a Los Angeles lawyer who has represented the Hearst Corporation for 20 years.
But it is precisely because the county's plan would set so broad a framework that environmental groups are worried. They fear that development on the Hearst land would put pressure on ranchers up and down the coast to sell off to developers, so as to meet rising property taxes.
As a result, the Hearst plan looms as a "drop-dead, save-it-or-lose-it" issue, in the words of Susan Jordan, a volunteer with the League for Coastal Protection, one of a broad coalition of environmental groups that has fought the project -- especially the golf course, planned for the bluffs above San Simeon Point.
Last month the Coastal Commission's executive staff recommended denial of the Hearst plan, especially the golf course, on the ground that it would be inconsistent with the state's Coastal Act by obstructing views and public access, converting agricultural land to recreational uses and intruding on sensitive wildlife habitats and scarce water resources, including streams that are home to the threatened steelhead trout.
The staff recommended cutting the total number of hotel rooms to 375 and concentrating virtually all new development around the coastal village of Old San Simeon, which consists mostly of some 19th-century warehouses where Hearst stored some of his vast collection of art during the 30-year construction of the castle, begun in 1919.
The Hearst Corporation contends that the resort would be economically unfeasible at that size, with per-room development costs rising to $24,000 from $15,000 for the larger complex.
Today, in a misty winter rain, the 12-member commission, together with lobbyists for both sides, took a field trip around the site. They stopped for lunch at the Hearst Castle visitors' center, where members of the commission's staff complained that it had been hard to keep some advocates from buttonholing commissioners on the bus. Sara Wan, the commission's vice chairwoman, said she expected the hearing on Thursday to be the most contentious in her memory, because of what was at stake.
"This is California," she said, gesturing toward the majestic coastline outside the door.

HEADLINE: Thomas J. Stanton, 69, Banker; Restored Jersey City Waterfront

 BODY:
Thomas J. Stanton Jr., a Jersey City banker who helped turn his hometown's waterfront from a moldering stretch of rotten piers and rusty rail yards into a sleek corporate district that came to be known as the Gold Coast, died on Jan. 6 at his home in Montclair, N.J. He was 69.
The cause was a heart attack, family members said. 
 It was Mr. Stanton's devotion to Jersey City that led him in 1967 to build the corporate offices of First Jersey National Bank, a company he ran for more than 20 years, in a ramshackle part of town that could have been plucked from the set of "On the Waterfront."
The decision, considered foolhardy in a summer of urban strife, eventually ignited commercial and residential building along the Hudson River from Hoboken to West New York.
Mr. Stanton was born and reared in Jersey City. In 1954, he began his long banking career there when he joined First Jersey as a business loan officer. Within six years, he was promoted to vice president and in 1967, at the age of 39, he became president and chief executive officer.
Under his control, the bank mushroomed from a local lending agent into a statewide operation with assets of nearly $5 billion and a staff of more than 4,000.
Mr. Stanton retired in 1990, two years after First Jersey was acquired by National Westminster Bank P.L.C., but he remained active in urban renewal projects like the Liberty Science Center and served as a trustee for numerous corporations and educational institutions.
Of the myriad projects that Mr. Stanton undertook as president of one of the state's premier banks, the restoration of Jersey City's brownstone district was perhaps his favorite.
In the early 1970's, when the middle class was fleeing the grubby neighborhood, Mr. Stanton stepped forward with the financial might of First Jersey and began to offer countless trailblazing mortgages that eventually helped turn the area into a redoubt of young, stroller-pushing professionals.
Properties auctioned off by the Federal Government for as little as $7,500 in 1977 were selling for nearly $300,000 just 10 years later.
Mr. Stanton is survived by his wife, Jean Emily Maloney; four sons, Thomas J. Stanton 3d of Verona, N.J., Charles A. Stanton of Jersey City, John M. Stanton of Washington, and Robert J. Stanton of Bloomfield, N.J.; three daughters, Louise Lynch Stanton of Trenton, Patricia B. Stanton of Portland, Ore., and Katherine A. Stanton-Paule of Bloomfield; two sisters, Katherine Kramer of Ocean Grove and Louise Longhurst of Morristown; two brothers, Reginald Stanton of Morristown and John M. Stanton of Carlisle, Pa., and five grandchildren.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Cheaper Oil Propels Import Price Drop

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Competitive pressure, a drop in oil prices and the financial turmoil in Asia helped knock the prices of imported goods down six-tenths of 1 percent in December and 4.9 percent last year, the largest decline since the Government began collecting such data in 1983.
The drop in the price of petroleum imports was the biggest -- 5.4 percent in December and 25.5 percent last year -- and it reflected a sharp fall in 1997 in the price of crude oil, which pushed it below $17 a barrel. 
 But economists focused on the prices paid by importers for commodities other than petroleum, in an effort to gauge how much Asian currency devaluations and the strengthening dollar might restrain inflation in the United States. In December, the prices of imports from Japan dropped four-tenths of 1 percent and those from other Asian nations fell five-tenths of 1 percent.
"Asia already did contribute to a substantial import price decline, and we can expect that much more significant declines are on the way," said Richard Berner, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.
Robert A. Brusca, chief economist of Nikko Securities, added: "I would have thought we would have seen a bigger impact. The currency declines have been very severe, and they date to July. But we should see some more."
There is hot debate over the effects from Asia because of growing talk about deflation, which occurs when prices decline rather than increase. Prices have already been falling on some goods, like computers. But the discussion has expanded to the possibility of a more general price decline that could be disruptive to the economy, in part by cutting corporate earnings while wage levels remain fixed.
The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, made the debate more visible when he discussed deflation in a speech earlier this month, though he did not indicate that there was any imminent threat.
But the recent rally in the bond market shows there are many investors who believe that the restraint on growth and prices because of the economic slowdown in Asia will be sufficient to force the Fed to cut its short-term interest rates to spur growth and prevent prices from falling.
The price declines in oil are important for a separate reason. If they hold, they could be a stimulus to the economy. Economists think of drops in oil prices as being like tax cuts because they can directly put money into consumers' pockets. Such a stimulus could help offset the decline in purchases of American exports resulting from the slowdown in Asia.
The restraint on prices from lower import costs shows up in several ways: Products like television sets and cars that are made abroad cost less because the American dollar buys more. In the case of Asia, foreign companies may also be cutting prices to gain sales that they are losing at home as their own economies slow down. Imported components for products assembled here cost less, and mean that American companies may be able to hold current prices. And competition from lower-priced imports is expected to keep American producers from raising prices on their rival products.
But in addition to the impact from Asia, the import price data, from the Department of Labor, show that there was a separate, longer-term competitive force pushing down prices before the Asian turmoil was touched off in July. In the first half of 1997, for example, import prices from South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan -- the four original "Asian tigers" -- had already fallen 1.7 percent. For all 1997 they were down 4.7 percent, while the price of imported goods from Japan dropped 5 percent. In 1996 they fell 2.9 percent.
Joel Popkin, the head of his own research company in Washington, said a lot of these earlier price cuts reflected growing industrial overcapacity that had developed in Asia in the last few years. In addition, the decline in computer prices has brought import prices lower.
One reason that the statistics have not reflected the full impact from Asia is that the Government, when calculating a certain month's import prices, uses the previous month's foreign-exchange figures. The exchange figures used to calculate the December import prices are averages for November. Because the dollar rallied much more against Asian and other currencies in December, this month's data -- which will be adjusted based on December's foreign-exchange values -- should show further downward pressure.
For example, the dollar rose 11.4 percent against the South Korean won in November and then jumped 44.3 percent in December.
Bill Alterman, an economist with the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said that in the past there has been a six-to-eight-month lag between changes in currency values and the resulting adjustment in import prices. One of the reasons for the lag is the fact that many Asian imports are priced in dollars and these prices are set months ahead in contracts.
This means that currency changes do not affect the prices immediately and will not change until the contracts are revised.
But Mr. Berner of Mellon Bank said he thought that the lag would be shorter this time because Asian companies would be scrambling to offset poor sales at home by cutting prices of their exports.
The report showed that the prices of American exports also declined, falling four-tenths of 1 percent last month and 1.1 percent for the year. This decline reflected a sharp drop in other American commodity prices, like wheat, and the pressure on American producers to cut prices to keep them competitive as the strong dollar made them more expensive abroad.

Poor Credit? Rent-to-Moan Is Wooing You

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES 

DATELINE: UNION CITY, N.J.

 BODY:
THE brown velvetlike sofa in the window of the Rent-A-Center on Bergenline Avenue has puffy Michelin Man arms, wood trim and a matching love seat. The other day, a young couple with two toddlers, two elderly women in dressy church hats and Justina Tomas, a waitress at a local restaurant, were all gazing at this sofa as though it were an exotic creature.
"It would fit in the apartment," Ms. Tomas said, giving it the once-over. "It would look really good in that apartment." 
 It would cost her, though. The price of owning the set is $26.99 a week for 91 weeks, or $2,456.09. That doesn't include the wood coffee table and end table, which would add another $8.99 a week for the same period, or over $800.
Ms. Morris said she asked a salesman what the interest rate amounts to, but he wouldn't say. "He pointed to the cash up front price and the other price," she said. "I know you end up paying at least twice as much as what it's worth. But once you got it in the house, you don't think about it."
This is precisely why rent-to-own stores appeal to people like Ms. Tomas, a 41-year-old single mother of three (and custodial grandmother of two) from the Dominican Republic, who has no credit cards or checking account. They may be unheard of in the suburbs, but in neighborhoods where check-cashing stores act as banks and owning a home is a lottery dream, rent-to-own stores are springing up like pawnshops in Atlantic City.
THE stores charge higher than most retail outlets for basic household items like furniture, appliances and electronics. Then they add much more to the price when the item is paid by the week, the selling point for most of its customers.
In New Jersey, according to a state Public Interest Research Group study done in June, interest rates for products bought with weekly payments average 88 percent, with one store in Elizabeth charging an interest rate of 140 percent.
Consumer groups have been lobbying for at least 10 years for laws that would regulate the industry, which has grown to 7,500 stores throughout the country with nearly three million customers. In New Jersey, though, consumer groups are celebrating the defeat of a bill this week that would have sanctioned the industry practice of charging more than market value for merchandise and then doubling that amount under the installment plan.
"In this legislative session, we'll be looking to support a bill that would force the industry to abide by basic consumer protection laws, like the criminal usury law that caps interest rates at 30 percent," said Benita Jain, a field coordinator for N.J.-PIRG's Citizen Lobby.
Industry representatives said the rent-to-own stores do not charge interest rates at all, but a fee for services -- namely, renting an item, with little money down, to people without credit whom regular stores would turn away.
But the bill's defeat marks the second significant loss for the industry here in recent months. In Camden, Judge E. Stevenson Fluharty of Superior Court, deciding a class-action lawsuit filed against Rent-A-Center on behalf of 78,000 customers, found last year that the company violated consumer protection and fraud laws and ordered it to pay partial refunds to all its customers going back to 1988. The company is appealing.
UNLIKE many rent-to-own stores, the Bergenline Avenue Rent-A-Center here lists the price if the item is paid in full next to the price under the weekly plan. A used basic model RCA videocassette recorder is listed for $503.64 if paid for at once, and $839.40 if rented to own at $13.99 a week for 60 weeks. Viewing the two prices side by side, it is easy to see why many stores refuse to list them.
Ms. Tomas studied the two prices of the sofa set: just over $1,400 if paid for at once, some $1,000 under the installment price. A friendly salesman told her he would throw in the tables for $5 a week and give her four weeks free. If she referred a friend to the store, she'd get $25 or a free week.
But she has heard some stories. A neighbor paid $20 a week on a 32-inch television every week for more than a year, but missed one payment when her disabled son became sick. The set was repossessed the next week. "That's money down the drain," Ms. Tomas said.
She was staring at the sofa set. "You know," she said, "I wouldn't pay $1,400 for this if I had it. I wouldn't even pay $500. I don't even really like it."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Export, Asia's Key to Survival, Could Crash Into U.S. Barriers

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF with SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Jan. 14

 BODY:
It is one of those embarrassing things that executives are forced to do these days to try to save their companies.
Kim Jong Deuk, the scholarly president of a small pharmaceuticals company here, will travel to the United States later this month to sell antibiotics. But if he cannot find buyers for antibiotics, he will try to sell ginseng. Or bowls and plates, made by a friend's company. Or toys, made by other friends. Or anything. 
 "The most important thing for a company is to survive," Mr. Kim said glumly as he sat in his office, near a world map with pins stuck in the cities abroad where he has trading contacts. "So, when we see a business opportunity, we're ready to jump into a fire to get it."
Mr. Kim's company is trying to do what thousands of other businesses across Asia are aiming to do: increase exports to the United States. Yet as Asia gazes adoringly at the American consumer, one of the great economic and political uncertainties of 1998 is whether this love will be requited.
The risk is that a rush of exports to the United States, bolstered by falling currencies in Asia, could lead to a historic collision. The danger arises because Asia is counting on saving itself with a surge of exports to America just as the 50-year American consensus in favor of free trade and internationalism shows signs of wearing thin.
Some diplomats and scholars fear that a tidal wave of Indonesian lingerie, Thai jogging clothes and Malaysian clock radios could inflame the United States trade deficit, anger American workers and provoke growing protectionism in the United States. Many speak of the risks of a severe economic downturn around the world and recall that protectionist moves in the United States and Europe contributed to the Great Depression.
"You're going to be able to buy a Hyundai car at $8,500; you're going to get your teddy bear at F.A.O. Schwarz at 35 percent cheaper," said Kenneth S. Courtis, chief economist for Deutsche Bank Group Asia-Pacific. "It's going to drive the U.S. trade numbers crazy, and that obviously is going to create a political problem."
The collision between Asian hopes and American fears, if it happens, still lies ahead, for Asian companies are only now gearing up to shift exports to the United States. But it is remarkable how many executives in Asia are working the phones, keeping the fax humming and rummaging through directories, all in search of the Holy Grail of an open market for goods now that demand in Asia is shrinking.
"Exports in the region are the only hope," said Neil Saker, a Singapore-based economist at SocGen-Crosby Securities. "The more exports they send out, the better."
With buyers at home sitting on their hands and most other export markets around the world weak, the vast American market beckons as if with neon lights that glitter across the battered economic landscape of Asia. On the factory floors and in cramped trading offices in Asia, America's affluent consumers are seen as the last, best hope.
At the headquarters of Hyundai, South Korea's largest conglomerate, 1,000 top executives gathered for a pep rally, and as a brass band played they chanted slogans like "Double Exports!" Hyundai has raised its export targets and plans to move staff to its export division and hold a special series of meetings to monitor overseas sales.
Exports can be the salvation of some Asian economies because of their economic structure. While exports account for just 8 percent of the economic output in the United States and 10 percent in Japan, they make up 79 percent of the total economic output in Malaysia, 29 percent in Thailand, 27 percent in South Korea and 25 percent in the Philippines.
"All of these countries are export-led economies," said Linda Tsao Yang, the United States envoy to the Asian Development Bank in the Philippines. "They need to export, export, export. As long as the U.S. economy stays on an even keel, the U.S. can absorb these exports and our consumers can benefit from much cheaper toys and clothes."
Yet for all the benefits to consumers, is the American political system really prepared to accept a deluge of Asian goods?
The defeat in Congress last year of "fast track" trade legislation -- which would have made it easier for the President to negotiate trade agreements -- was one sign that the internationalist consensus that has prevailed in the United States since the era of Franklin D. Roosevelt may be in trouble. A pillar of that consensus, faith in free trade and open markets, may be sorely tested if the United States is flooded with Asian products just as Congressional candidates are looking for good campaign issues.
Though the gap between imports and exports would be much smaller as a share of the overall economy, increased imports of Asian products and a falloff in United States exports to Asia would add to the United States current account imbalance, which may soon surpass its record of $168 billion, set in 1987.
"The U.S. trade deficit will expand at a rapid pace and drag down the domestic economic growth in the U.S.," predicted C. H. Kwan, an economist at Nomura Research Institute in Tokyo.
One result is apprehension in Asian capitals.
As Lee Hong Koo, a former Prime Minister of South Korea who lived in the United States and has had close ties with Americans for four decades, put it: "The U.S. in a way has become isolationist, or a selfish nation, and it doesn't have its old sense of mission. Americans are a bit tired. But when you become a superpower, with all that wealth and power of America, this is something that you cannot avoid. If you do, then you risk your own future."
To be sure, it is not clear that Asian companies will be as successful in exporting as they hope. Several countries are competing against one another, so that one's success may partly displace the business of another. Faced with a profusion of Asian-made televisions, for instance, American consumers may benefit from a broader selection and cheaper models. But they will not buy five more television sets.
Moreover, the financial crisis has, for now, gummed up the trade system from Malaysia to Korea. Working capital is scarce, letters of credit and other trade finance mechanisms are more difficult to arrange, and imported raw materials are more costly now that local currencies have been devalued.
Chung Youn Goo, a clothing manufacturer in Seoul, said his business was suffering because Korean consumers "have just stopped buying clothes." But he said that exports are not now a feasible solution for his company, because of the domestic consequences of the crisis.
"This is a bit embarrassing to say, but we haven't received payments on time from our customers," Mr. Chung said. "Exports require money to plan, and we don't have it. We don't have the luxury of planning for the future. We're just fighting to survive."
Japan in particular faces difficulties increasing exports, because it exports more than twice as much to the United States as any other country in the region, and its rising trade surplus with the United States is again beginning to cause tension.
Japanese officials insist that they will not try to increase exports to resolve their economic difficulties.
"We don't think exports will be a solution," said Osamu Moriya, director of the trade research division at Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry. "Politically, it's not going to be a solution."
He and other Japanese officials say their trade surplus with the United States will not soar. But already, as the falling yen makes Japanese products more competitive, Japanese exports are rising again. And if that continues, it is not clear what Tokyo will offer but empathy.
"Although we can't do so much about our trade balance directly, we care," Mr. Moriya said.
Indirectly, of course, Japan will also contribute to the trade imbalance because its own economic troubles mean that Japanese will be buying fewer goods from other Asian countries, forcing them to sell their products elsewhere.
With much of the region obsessed with exports, one risk is that countries will engage in competitive currency devaluations to get a bit more edge in overseas markets.
Over the last few years, the currencies of China and Japan had both effectively declined against other Asian currencies. That made Thai and Korean goods less competitive in world markets and helped precipitate the Asian crisis. But now that Thai and Korean currencies have collapsed, China and Japan face pressures to respond. A result could be a new round of devaluations.
China has repeatedly said that it will not devalue its currency, and Japan has said that it does not want the yen to fall. But in fact the yen keeps falling, bolstering Japanese exports and making everyone nervous about the economic and political repercussions.
"The worst scenario is clearly, I think, everyone trying to depreciate their currencies ahead of the others, with everyone trying to export to the U.S.," said Minoru Makihara, the president of the Mitsubishi Corporation, the huge Japanese trading company.
"The U.S. won't like that," he added, "so it'll go protectionist."

HEADLINE: U.S. Strikes at Smuggling Ring That Exploited Foreign Nurses

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 14

 BODY:
More than 500 nurses were smuggled into the United States from the Philippines and South Korea over the last several years by an illegal ring that capitalized on the nationwide nursing shortage plaguing hospitals and nursing homes earlier in the decade, Federal prosecutors said today.
Federal officials said this was the first time that the law-enforcement authorities had uncovered a smuggling network involving so many people with such high professional skills. 
 "We've never found a case of this magnitude," said Paul E. Coggins of Dallas, the United States Attorney for the northern district of Texas, where many of the nurses worked.
Apart from the numbers involved, the case is extraordinary because the workers were brought into the United States not under blankets in trucks coming across the Mexican border but on major airlines with fraudulently obtained visas.
The nurses were funneled to at least 35 states and cost American nurses an estimated $13 million in lost salaries by taking jobs at substandard wages, according to Mr. Coggins's office.
Five Americans pleaded guilty to fraud charges today in connection with the smuggling ring. The five, one in New Jersey, one in Texas and three in California, lured the foreign nurses into their smuggling ring by promising them specific jobs in the United States.
Under a Congressionally approved program from 1989 to 1995 to alleviate the nursing shortage, a foreign nurse who indicated that a specific position was promised could obtain a special visa to the United States.
The defendants admitted that they had lied to the Government by saying they were first unable to find nurses in the United States to fill the positions. Congress ended the program more than two years ago because foreign nurses were supplanting so many American workers.
The foreign nurses, many of whom were unable to arrange specific jobs on their own, paid the American operatives $1,500 to $7,500 to obtain the special visas fraudulently and to bring them to the United States, where they were often sent to jobs different from those they had been promised, Federal prosecutors said.
Although nursing homes and hospitals were charged $1,000 for each foreign nurse, Mr. Coggins said they were probably not aware of the scheme. Prosecutors said 570 nurses had been illegally placed in positions, paid substandard wages and lived in crowded, unsanitary conditions. They said they not aware that any of the nurses had delivered substandard care to patients.
The nurses could be charged with fraud and deported, said Lynn Ligon, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Dallas.
Officials said sophisticated smuggling rings were becoming increasingly prevalent as more people around the world sought to enter the United States, particularly when the economy is so strong and companies seek cheaper labor.
Such operations are also increasingly complex, officials said. It took officials from several Federal agencies more than 33 months to uncover the nursing ring, and the investigation is still going on.
The first clue was picked up by a consular officer at the United States Embassy in Manila, who detected an unusually high number of petitions for special visas filed by nursing homes in Texas and Oklahoma. They were all signed by the same person, Billy Denver Jewell of Lubbock, Tex., whom officials identified today as the ring leader.
In a two-year period, Mr. Jewell submitted more than 1,100 fraudulent petitions to bring in registered nurses, said Mr. Coggins, the United States Attorney. More than 20,000 visas were issued to foreign nurses from 1993 to 1996.
Complicating Mr. Jewell's operation was the fact that the nursing shortage turned to a glut. This was largely because of shifts in the health care system but also partly because of the influx of foreign nurses, at least in Texas.
Many of the foreign nurses were registered nurses, who in Texas make up to $14 an hour. But the foreign nurses were employed as nurse's aides and paid as little as $5 an hour.
The authorities said that in August 1993, Mr. Jewell made an agreement with Haesook Kim, also known as Clara Kim, owner of International Nurses Exchange of Wayne, N.J., in which Ms. Kim would furnish 20 South Korean nurses to be employed at the Southern Manor Nursing Home in Lubbock. Ms. Kim, who also pleaded guilty today, paid Mr. Jewell $1,000, for a total of $19,000, for each nurse who obtained a visa through a petition filed by the nursing home.
The others who pleaded guilty were Holly Arthur Estreller of Los Angeles and Sidney and Veronica Hewitt of San Diego. Officials are still seeking Nelson Alomajin Sin of Sugar Land, Tex., who is believed to have fled to the Philippines.
Each count of visa fraud carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and fines of $250,000. Sentencing by Judge Sam R. Cummings of Federal District Court in Lubbock is expected in two months.

All Those Billions (and It Sounds So Reasonable)

BYLINE: By Richard Sandomir 

 BODY:
Who's nuts now? Four years ago when Fox overturned the sports economy by paying $1.58 billion to get into the National Football League, many snickered at the insolence and imprudence of Rupert Murdoch's broadcast weblet. They wondered if Bart Simpson would diagram plays with a crayon. But the expectations of folly never came true.
If Murdoch -- who did have to write off $350 million in losses early on -- was deemed harebrained, how do we judge what happened this week: CBS signed on to pay $4 billion to get back into pro football; Disney committed $4.4 billion to keep "Monday Night Football" on ABC (ousting NBC from the N.F.L.) and $4.8 billion to put the entire Sunday night cable package on ESPN (kicking TNT out), and Fox agreed to spend $4.4 billion to keep what it had. 
 CBS is considered the looniest for paying monumentally more than NBC did for the American Football Conference package -- renting a nice house in a very expensive neighborhood. The confidence of its executives is astounding.
"Michael Jordan, Mel Karmazin and I won't let us lose money on this deal," said Sean McManus, the president of CBS Sports, referring to promises by his bosses of herculean sales and promotional efforts to make the A.F.C. deal pay.
Chase Carey, the co-chief operating officer of News Corporation, Fox's parent company, knows what it's like to be isolated by criticism.
"A lot of the statements made about CBS were made about us," he said. "In a television world that is more and more fragmented, the N.F.L. will keep rising in value. But the ability to capture value depends on your execution."
The harshest critic has been Dick Ebersol, the president of NBC Sports. He would not renew his A.F.C. deal, then offered too little to take "Monday Night Football" away from ABC. He said CBS's deal is an invitation to annual losses of at least $175 million.
"We made a cold, calculated decision that these losses are intolerable," he said. "In a tough economy, like in '86 or '91, we're talking about doubling those losses. We decided it was reckless folly."
He added: "As businessmen, we're winners. Absolutely."
McManus of CBS objected. "Maybe at these numbers, it doesn't make sense for Dick, but the numbers make a whole lot of sense for us," he said.
Ebersol joked that during NBC's final N.F.L. game, the Super Bowl on Jan. 25, he would add a corner score box -- something he has refused to do -- and an informational crawl to the bottom of the screen to detail estimates of his rivals' coming losses.
What will NBC do to fill the football gap? This fall, movies. For the 1999 season, he said he's cooking up a plan to create programming with NBC News.
Carey of the News Corporation suggested that Ebersol's projections of doom should be taken "with a grain of salt," that they are statements "made by someone left out of the process."
Carey admitted that the $550 million-a-year deal was more than he expected to pay, but the presence of CBS forced all prices up.
Nonetheless, he confidently labeled Fox's new deal -- up 39 percent from $395 million a year -- better than the previous one. His reasoning was that every part of Fox is stronger than it was four years ago; all games now carry three extra advertising spots; and Fox can reap the benefits of selling two Super Bowls through 2002, plus a third in the last three years of the contract if the league does not reopen it for renegotiations after the fifth year.
A search for prudence, at least in a relative sense, among the N.F.L. winners leads to Disney, where Robert Iger, the president of ABC, retained "Monday Night Football" for $550 million a year.
"I believe we wouldn't have gone a penny higher," Iger said.
With the network deals done, the announcer deals start. The biggest question involves John Madden. He hasn't voiced public loyalty to Fox, but has made known his yen to work on Monday nights. It makes sense. He could plan his bus trips months in advance and he would co-star in the league's biggest showcase.
"If he wants to stay here, great; if he wants to go to 'Monday Night,' he'll go with our best wishes," said David Hill, the president of Fox Sports.
Fox may not scrap to keep Madden. He has delivered what they wanted: credibility, star power and football savvy. He is not needed as a network centerpiece as he was in 1994. ABC or CBS will have to pant heavily for his services if his salary is to stay at its current $7.5 million. "We'll know what he will do in the next 48 hours," said Sandy Montag, his agent.
If Madden goes to ABC, then Dan Dierdorf is out, headed to a less prominent role, and Frank Gifford has probably called his final game. Fox could slip Matt Millen into its No. 1 analyst slot, but Hill has talked to NBC's Phil Simms.
If Simms goes to Fox as the top analyst, Millen could be miffed enough to jump back to CBS. NBC's Greg Gumbel could return to CBS. Certainly, Fox and CBS would covet NBC's Cris Collinsworth, the best studio analyst around.
McManus has plenty of stocking up to do. He has play-by-play voices like Jim Nantz, Sean McDonough and Tim Ryan on staff, but he needs analysts. Verne Lundquist could return from TNT. NBC's Randy Cross and Paul Maguire should be in demand at CBS and Fox. But no one can snare Terry Bradshaw from Fox; he signed a five-year deal on Tuesday to stay as co-host of Fox's studio show.

HEADLINE: Corruption Charges Irritate a Tiny Town Battling Obscurity

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

DATELINE: WEST NEW YORK, N.J., Jan. 14

 BODY:
This tiny blue-collar town, situated just across the Hudson from Manhattan's Upper West Side, has always had something of an identity crisis.
"Every time I say it, I say West New York, New Jersey," said Oscar Miqueli, who has lived here for 37 years and is still pointing out that he does not live somewhere within the great Gothic skyscape across the river. 
 Now, Mr. Miqueli, the coordinator of West New York's Urban Empowerment Zone, and other local officials say they must overcome an even darker image: the characterization of the town as perhaps the most corrupt in the state. On Monday the former police chief and eight other former or current members of the Police Department were indicted on Federal charges that they extorted and accepted money in exchange for protecting illegal gambling, prostitution and after-hours liquor sales.
For West New York, which like other working class towns has suffered tremendously as manufacturing jobs have disappeared in recent years, the corruption scandal is a large bump in the already-difficult road to economic recovery. And yet, with news of the Federal investigation swirling about since early last spring, the arrests also brought a certain sense of relief.
"The public was almost expecting this," Mayor Albio Sires said in an interview today at his office in Town Hall. "I think they wanted this to take place to clean up this mess that we had here." Noting that the indicted officers had been immediately suspended without pay, he said, "We are already moving forward to say, 'Hey, this is over.' "
To say it is over, even to wish it so, will not be so easy. "Our work in West New York is not yet done," William C. Megary, the special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in New Jersey, said at the news conference announcing the arrests of the police officials and 11 others. Investigators said they expected additional arrests of both police officers and civilians, as well as additional plea bargain agreements with potential witnesses.
The arrests come just as signs of economic recovery have begun to emerge in West New York. The real estate developer K. Hovnanian recently started the first phase of construction of what is expected to be 4,100 new housing units on a long-vacant riverfront site, including rental apartments and town houses expected to sell for $200,000 to $500,000. As part of the project, a new soccer field and an accompanying parking lot are also being built on the waterfront.
Prospects of a redeveloped riverfront and increased tax revenues from a growing population has offered a flash of hope to the town, whose 40,000 residents, many of them Latin American immigrants, are some of the poorest in New Jersey.
But across the town's neat grid of treeless streets, with bodegas and go-go bars peppered among the aging houses and small apartment buildings, residents said this afternoon they were stung by the arrests, and they expressed a growing sense of suspicion of public officials. "It hurts me because you want to live in a good place," said Miriam Robles, 43, who has lived in West New York for five years. "This is terrible. You don't know who to trust."
Louis Beeber, a 77-year-old crossing guard, who has lived in an apartment building on Boulevard East for 23 years, said the case had made him suspicious of political complicity in the bribery scheme. "I wonder if the old mayor wasn't connected to this," he said, referring to the late Mayor Anthony M. DeFino, who was in office when many of the police officials now under indictment were being promoted through the ranks.
Mr. DeFino, who after 24 years in office decided not to run for re-election in 1995, died in December 1996, three weeks after suffering a heart attack. A lifelong resident of West New York, Mr. DeFino was a mammoth-sized man, who often salted his public remarks with phrases in Italian that reflected the heritage he shared with so many of the immigrants that populated the town throughout its early history.
In the 1960's, as Italian and other European immigrant groups began to move away, West New York experienced a huge influx of immigrants from Cuba. Mr. Sires, the current mayor, was born in Cuba and came to West New York with his parents 37 years ago at the age of 10. Like other longtime residents, he says the town does not deserve its new unflattering label as a crime haven.
According to the indictment filed in United States District Court in Newark, the former police chief, Alexander V. Oriente, led a band of colleagues in a racketeering operation that earned them at least $600,000 in bribes and payoffs between 1989 and 1997. Investigators said they believed Mr. Oriente began accepting bribes long before he became chief of police in 1994.
"I love this community," Mr. Sires said. "I grew up here. It just hurts that this is such a nice community and it should get such a black eye."
Echoing some of the warnings by Federal investigators that small, tightly knit towns of New Jersey may by nature face serious risk of municipal corruption, Mr. Sires said West New York was long overdue for a change when he took office in May 1995. As the Federal investigation mounted, Mr. Sires urged the Hudson County Prosecutor's office to take control of the Police Department.
"The problem with these communities is that everything is done from within," he said. "You have to break a cycle. Sooner or later, you have to bring in new blood, new people from the outside, new ideas. You need to have a different approach. For too many years it's always the same thing."

U.N. Vote Rebukes Iraq For Blocking Inspectors
The Security Council voted unanimously to rebuke Iraq for blocking United Nations arms inspectors and said Iraq must honor its earlier promise to allow the inspectors "full, unconditional and immediate access" to sites suspected of concealing biological, chemical and nuclear weapons. But it did not say what it would do if Iraq did not comply. A1 

Israel Adopts Guidelines
The Israeli Government adopted sweeping guidelines on what it would regard as vital interests in any future negotiations regarding the West Bank. After long and inconclusive debate in recent weeks over alternative maps, the Cabinet drew up only general principles, saying the broad approach avoided a showdown in the Cabinet and would give Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu more room to maneuver in his impending meeting with President Clinton. A8
 
Quid Pro Quo for Iran?
An adviser to President Mohammed Khatami of Iran said the Clinton Administration should respond to Mr. Khatami's public overture to the American people with a gesture of its own. The adviser suggested three possibilities: a review of the American sanctions against Iran, an easing of visa regulations for travel to the United States and an investigation of frozen Iranian assets. A8
 
Jews Recall Swiss Camps
A report prepared for the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles said that many of the more than 22,000 Jewish refugees in Switzerland during World War II were kept in unheated barracks and forced to sleep on straw. Men were put to work in fields, forests and factories while women and girls cleaned homes. A3
 
A Thousand Mourn in Belfast
A crowd of 1,000 people joined the funeral procession in Belfast for Terry Enright, a 28-year-old Roman Catholic shot by Protestant gunners. Mr. Enright, a nightclub bouncer and community worker, was apparently not involved in politics or paramilitary violence. A3
 
Chinese Dissident Stays Put
Qin Yongmin, a longtime democracy campaigner in China, has defied the powerful Ministry of State Security by publicly refusing to leave China for the United States. Mr. Yongmin, who recently called for free labor unions, said security agents had instructed a friend to tell him he should immediately seek a passport and move to the United States. A6
 
Algeria Rejects Mission
Algeria's military-backed Government said it would reject a mission that the 15-nation European Union wanted to send to learn how to stop the killings of civilians there, which number in the tens of thousands in a six-year civil war. The Europeans had received indications earlier that officials from Luxembourg, Britain and Austria would be welcome in Algiers, but only if they limited their discussions to the Government's efforts to combat terrorism.

Homicide Rates Are Rising In Some Midsized Cities
Some cities with populations of several hundred thousand are experiencing increases in killings, contrary to trends that show homicide rates falling in many big cities since 1994. Police officials and other experts point to evidence of a rising, more violent drug trade in medium-sized cities, and the fact that some of these cities are just catching up with the latest trends in crime-fighting. A1
 
A Nurse-Smuggling Operation
More than 500 nurses were smuggled into the United States from the Philippines and South Korea over the last several years by an illegal ring that capitalized on the nationwide nursing shortage that plagued hospitals and nursing homes earlier in the decade, Federal prosecutors said. A14
 
Courting Youthful Smokers
Internal records from one of the nation's largest cigarette companies, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco, provide new evidence of the extent to which the company courted young smokers, including some as young as 14, for decades, regarding them as the future of its business. A12
 
Disparate Views on Race
President's Clinton's advisory board on race heard from a panel of experts about the reasons for disparities in employment, income and poverty between whites, and later from ordinary citizens, many of whom wanted to vent their frustrations over acts of discrimination they said they had suffered. A15
 
Musical Welcome to the World
Gov. Zell Miller of Georgia proposed as part of his $12.5 billion state budget to spend $105,000 to make a cassette tape or compact disk of classical music available to each of the approximately 100,000 children born in Georgia each year. Mr. Miller is convinced that Bach and Mozart can stimulate brain development at very early ages. A12

HEADLINE: Clinton Race Panel Hears Emotional Tales at Phoenix Forum

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: PHOENIX, Jan. 14

 BODY:
President's Clinton's advisory board on race made its first foray outside the Washington area today and was subjected to two sides of the national conversation on race: erudition and emotion.
After listening to a sometimes dry and academic discussion by a panel of experts about the reasons for disparities in employment, income and poverty between whites, six of the seven panel members later heard from ordinary citizens, many of whom wanted to vent their frustrations over acts of discrimination they said they had suffered. 
 A late afternoon forum held at a middle school near downtown featured a long line of speakers who, among other things, urged the board to help maintain affirmative action, investigate police brutality, and recommend the spending of Federal money for whites to undergo psychological counseling to rid themselves of racism.
All of the speakers, including the chairman of the Arizona Democratic Party, could be described as political liberals, or at least supporters of affirmative action or other policies for helping minorities. No one spoke out against such programs.
Members of the advisory board said they had tried to entice people with more conservative views to attend the forum. None showed up.
Those who spoke instead poured out emotional tales of personal travails of what they described as instances of discrimination. A Federal worker showed the advisory boarda sheet of paper that included a racist message that she said she had found in her desk drawer at work. Many complained that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission did not enforce laws against job discrimination. One waved pictures of her elderly parents who she said were beaten by police officers evicting them from their home.
"Please listen to my story," said Darlene Lopez Spahn, who is part Hispanic. "If you don't, nobody will. God sent you."
While many said they supported the advisory board's work, some expressed skepticism that it would amount to much.
"I pay taxes," said Wade Henry, a black real estate agent from Phoenix. "I want value for my dollar. I appreciate you being here, but I want something done. If not, then stop wasting my money."
A number of recent racial incidents have taken place in the Phoenix area, setting nerves on edge and, perhaps, contributing to the emotion of the late afternoon session.
In October, at a trial involving a discrimination suit filed by Jesus Torres, a Scottsdale police officer who was dismissed from the force, Mr. Torres testified that he had overheard some white police officers discuss the imposition of a zone barring blacks in a wealthy section of the city. Mr. Torres said any black or Latino found in that section of town after dark would be searched.
Scottsdale police officials deny that such a policy had been established.
The State Attorney General's office also found fault with some sweeps conducted by the local police in Chandler, a nearby suburb, and Federal immigration officers. During the sweep, officers stopped several American citizens of Hispanic origin and demanded that they provide prove of citizenship.
Several of the local residents speaking in the late afternoon session referred to the two incidents.
"There are pockets of bigotry and there are pockets of hate," said Ruben Noel, a white public relations specialist from Phoenix who referred to the Chandler police as "jack-booted street thugs."
The site of the first of a series of sessions to be held by the race panel nationwide, Phoenix was chosen because the board hoped the region's large Hispanic and American Indian population would permit more of a discussion of issues involving them.
The late afternoon session was a marked contrast from the board's morning program, which featured racial issues in the workplace. Much of that session revolved around of how much the lagging performance of black and Hispanic people was the result of discrimination or a gap in the level of education and skills.
"It's clear that American employers are more reluctant to hire blacks than any other ethnic group in the United States, especially black men, especially younger black men," said Henry J. Holzer, a white professor of economics at Michigan State University. "That's true even when people have comparable credentials, education, comparable work experience and the like."
James Smith, a white economist at the Rand Corporation, urged the panel to concentrate on the disparities between blacks and whites.
"If you look at the aggregate data, you do not see large wage difference in all these other ethnic groups with the white majority, except for blacks," he said. "There is something quite different going on here."
But others challenged that notion.
"The best way to get the high-paying job as a lawyer in Texas is to be born white," said Jose Roberto Juarez Jr., who is Hispanic and the associate dean for academic affairs at St. Mary's University Law School in San Antonio.
"It doesn't matter how well you did in school. The best predictor I can give you for your achieving a high salary is to happen to be born white. Those are the realities."

HEADLINE: As Asia's Economic Turmoil Deepens, Pentagon Chief Reassures Indonesia

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Jan. 14

 BODY:
As financial crises continued to rumble across Asia, Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen met here today with President Suharto to discuss expanding security ties with the beleaguered Indonesian Government.
Though Mr. Cohen's public statements avoided any talk of Mr. Suharto's political future, American officials said the meeting and the Secretary's comments afterward were intended as a gesture of support. 
 Mr. Suharto, who took power in a coup 32 years ago that left a reported 500,000 people died, has recently faced rare calls from opponents to step down.
Mr. Cohen's statements, the officials said, were part of a two-pronged strategy to press Mr. Suharto to make the economic concessions that will insure an international bailout of his country's economy, while trying to prevent the crisis from sowing political instability.
Should Mr. Suharto's position become tenuous, American officials said, the Clinton Administration, particularly the normally cautious military, does not see any clear or easy line of succession.
Mr. Cohen therefore focused on talk of continuity and stability in military relations, and his 40-minute meeting dealt with military matters rather than economics.
"I am not here as any sort of financial expert," Mr. Cohen said at a news conference after the talks. "I am here to talk about security issues and ways in which we can expand upon our security relationship."
Officials here and those traveling with Mr. Cohen on his 12-day tour of Asia have repeatedly expressed concern that any further erosion of Indonesia's economy could lead to widespread unrest and even, in the worst case, the disintegration of a country, the world's fourth-largest, with scores of ethnic groups spread over 13,677 islands.
"You can't have an Indonesia that becomes destabilized without security concerns arising in the region," a senior United States official said before Mr. Cohen's meeting with Mr. Suharto.
Administration officials have said they fear that a prolonged economic crisis could revive regional rivalries that have remained largely dormant while Asia's "tiger" economies flourished.
During his tour, which was planned before the financial crises, Mr. Cohen visited Malaysia and plans stops in Singapore and Thailand, trying to rebuild a military presence that was vastly reduced after the Vietnam War and the loss of American bases in the Philippines.
The Pentagon hopes to increase its presence in Indonesia and elsewhere in Southeast Asia, not through permanent bases but through joint exercises and periodic visits by American warships.
Along those lines, Mr. Cohen announced today that the United States and the Philippines had reached a tentative agreement to resume military contacts, which were cut off a year ago when the Philippines removed legal protections for visiting forces.
The United States has not had forces stationed in the Philippines since 1992, when the sprawling base at Subic Bay was closed at Manila's request. The agreement -- signed in Manila today by Ambassador Thomas C. Hubbard and Foreign Minister Domingo Siazon -- should lead the way to a resumption of exercises, joint training and port calls.
"Today, amidst the uncertainty we are currently facing in the Asia Pacific, the United States and the Government of the Philippines have taken an important step to reassure the region and promote peace and stability," Mr. Cohen said at a news conference at the American Embassy here.
Mr. Cohen and his aides also dismissed speculation, rampant only a few days ago, that the Indonesian military might seek to topple President Suharto. Instead, the officials said, any threat to Mr. Suharto's rule would very likely come from riots between ethnic or religious groups, or protests in the streets. In the past, displays of unrest have been met with harsh military crackdowns.
A senior American official here also expressed the fear that the economic crisis, if it persisted, could lead to "a rise in Islamic radicalism" in Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim nation.
Mr. Cohen said he took pains to avoid any discussion of Mr. Suharto's future as Indonesia's ruler. He said Mr. Suharto, who is 76, raised and dismissed rumors that he was ill. "And those rumors, he felt, were contributing to the lack of stability in the region," Mr. Cohen said.
Short of outright collapse, there are also concerns that the economic austerity imposed by the I.M.F. could lead to a backlash against the United States if Washington is seen as the enforcer. There have already been small protests here against the I.M.F. and its backers.
Mr. Cohen, who also met with the Minister of Defense, Gen. Edi Sudradjat, emphasized the role Indonesia had played "in maintaining regional stability" through its leadership in the Association of South East Asian Nations.
Mr. Cohen did not reach any concrete agreements with the Indonesians on increasing military contacts, but he received assurances, his aides said, that Indonesia supported the idea generally.
Mr. Cohen said he did not discussion arms sales to Indonesia, which last July canceled the purchase of at least nine F-16 fighter jets after becoming frustrated with opposition in the United States Congress over Indonesia's record on human rights.
But General Sudradjat pointedly said that when Indonesia's economy recovered enough to allow it to purchase weaponry, it would not necessarily turn to the United States.
"We buy from everywhere, what we need and what we judge as good quality," he said in a news conference with Mr. Cohen outside the President's home, "but there are no links or commitments whatsoever."

HEADLINE: Initiative to Save Theaters May Drive Out Artists

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Peter Stone (Op-Ed, Jan. 10) exposes only part of the sham of a rezoning plan that will allow Broadway theaters to expand the sale of their "air rights" (giving new buildings in midtown their nonexistent upper floors). 
 As the proposal stands, special residential protection in Hell's Kitchen will be stripped away to allow the development of larger high rises. A neighborhood that houses a huge number of people involved in theater will be prey to real estate speculators and sudden price inflation.
If theaters must float air rights beyond adjacent properties, as is currently allowed, let them sell to locations in the city where zoning already permits it. There is no need to link Broadway to the obliteration of zoning protection for the residents of Hell's Kitchen.

HEADLINE: Forest Plan Leaves Too Many Trees at Risk;
Preserve Our Heritage

 BODY:

To the Editor:
I applaud the Clinton Administration's effort to protect the last remaining American wilderness areas (editorial, Jan. 14). Subsidies to the timber industry once made sense as a way to grow the economy by increasing exports and providing low-cost lumber to home builders, pulp for paper products and livable wages to those in remote regions. However, given the economy's current strength, the growth of alternative resources and recycling practices, and the desire of most Americans to protect our few remaining wild areas, we must re-evaluate outdated Federal policies that pour millions of dollars each year in support of privately held timber concerns. 
 While it takes only a few years to harvest timber from a forest, it takes hundreds of years for that forest to return to its natural state. Are we willing to deny so many future generations the chance to experience the beauty and diversity of America's wilderness? These forests serve not only as a reminder of our rich natural heritage, but also as a reminder that there are still some things in life that money cannot buy.

HEADLINE: Civic Parties Of Pageantry And Pledges;
It's Swearing-In Season For Council Members

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
By the time City Councilman Angel Rodriguez raised his hand to take the oath of office, the 300 people gathered in a Brooklyn grade school auditorium had already sat through the singing of "The Star-Spangled Banner" and the Puerto Rican anthem, "La Borinquena." They had witnessed a colorful lion dance performed by the Latin American Chinese Association Cultural Dancers and a presentation of flags by a Boy Scout troop -- followed by an invocation by a Roman Catholic priest, translated from English into Spanish and then Mandarin.
After taking the oath to thunderous applause, Mr. Rodriguez, a newly elected Democrat from ethnically diverse Sunset Park, led the crowd of neighborhood residents, campaign workers, friends and relatives upstairs to a reception in the library of Public School 314. There they enjoyed a feast of rice and beans, boiled yuca and pasteles, the Puerto Rican plantain and beef turnovers, made by Mr. Rodriguez's 63-year-old mother. 
 It mattered to no one that Mr. Rodriguez had officially been a member of the City Council for nearly two weeks or that he was administered the oath of office by the City Clerk at City Hall last month. From a political standpoint, this was the real swearing-in ceremony -- on his home turf, before his constituents and fellow politicians, with all the pomp of civic spectacle.
This is New York City's season of the swearing-in ceremony. While the Mayor's inauguration draws broad news coverage and Borough Presidents command some attention, the ceremonies are no less important to the 51 members of the City Council (and, in odd-numbered years, to state lawmakers). Part pageant, part inaugural ball, part political conclave, the events are a bedrock of the city's governmental landscape, a ritual practiced by both the newly elected and the veteran.
They bring together masses of ordinary neighborhood voters to celebrate the victory of their candidate. At the same time, the events offer fellow politicians a perfect venue for some subtle campaigning of their own among hundreds of the most politically active voters.
"Next to funerals and weddings, the public event that politicians have the most emotional investment in is the swearing-in ceremony," said New York City's Public Advocate, Mark J. Green, who is a candidate this year for United States Senate. "They are a great art form."
No matter that the oratory might not match the history-book cadences of Presidential inaugurals. Or that the effort to drape an essentially parochial event in the trappings of grandeur can sometimes carry a hint of absurdity.
"It's very important to the elected official, because it enables supporters to remind themselves that they had a great cause and that they succeeded in getting the official elected," said Mr. Green, who has already attended nearly a dozen ceremonies for other politicians in the last two weeks, and plans to fit in as many more in the next few weeks.
This January, the ritual has been enacted in an ornate library in the University Heights section of the Bronx, a spacious Roman Catholic church in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, a high school on the south shore of Staten Island and a hall on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.
While the motivations are similar, the form of the events varies widely. The ceremony for City Councilwoman Una Clarke, a six-year Democratic incumbent in Brooklyn, seemed patterned on a Westminster Abbey coronation. Walking at the rear of a procession of red-robed choir members, a string of clergymen and a line of judges, Ms. Clarke, dressed in a white gown, made her way down the aisle of an East Flatbush Episcopal church as a solemn hymn was played on a pipe organ.
For Margarita Lopez, a Democratic newcomer to the Council from the Lower East Side, grass-roots participation was the watchword. She took a series of oaths, administered by neighborhood residents, pledging to devote herself to a range of positions, from reaching out to minority-owned businesses to supporting community cultural centers. Ms. Lopez, a longtime advocate for the homeless, held her event at the Great Hall at Cooper Union, where she was arrested years earlier at a demonstration.
For Adolpho Carrion Jr., a recently elected Democrat from the Kingsbridge section of the Bronx, the event was something of a family affair. Standing in the marble-filled rotunda of a library at Bronx Community College, Mr. Carrion's father, a Pentecostal minister, offered the invocation, and the Councilman's 8-year-old daughter, Raquel, sang the national anthem before a crowd of about 400. Mr. Carrion himself sang "La Borinquena" in a resounding tenor before offering an address of which brevity was not the most striking attribute.
Not surprisingly, a lengthy speech from the officeholder is a focal point of most swearing-in ceremonies. Newcomers tend to focus on qualifications and promises; old-timers are quick to recite a list of youth centers opened or parks renovated under the Council member's auspices. Sometimes, swept up in the moment, the speaker ventures into broader themes. "We must diversify our city economy," Walter L. McCaffrey, a Queens Democrat entering his 12th year on the City Council, told a crowd of 300 at the P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center in Long Island City. "The success of Wall Street is filling our tax coffers and employing hundreds of thousands. But a downturn could once again happen."
For campaign workers, party loyalists and friends, the events serve as both reunion and victory party."It was touching," said Udelka Tapia, a 34-year-old accountant who collected petition signatures, worked telephones and put up posters for Mr. Carrion. "His family was there, the community was there. For many of us who had volunteered for him, this was a great, great program."
Of course, the events invariably attract a large number of other elected officials. "It's an occasion when elected officials can come around some of the most politically active citizens," said Ludovic J. Blain, a lobbyist with the New York Public Interest Research Group. "It's a good time for politicians to seek the support of a particular constituency."
And in this, an election year, swearing-in ceremonies are magnets for candidates running for everything from United States Senate and Governor to the Assembly. Mr. Green and Representative Charles E. Schumer, another candidate for the Democratic primary for Senate, have often run into each other crisscrossing the city to attend them, sometimes several in one day.
They also provide a vantage point to determine which politicians are aligned. "They are an important way to demonstrate the strength of not only the newly elected person, but the strength of the people who helped him get elected," said Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez, the Bronx Democratic chairman who devoted much of his energy last year to Mr. Carrion's election.
The occasions can also be the venue for political adversaries to try to heal rifts. Mr. Rodriguez, for example, invited all four of his opponents in the Democratic primary -- three of whom attended, including one, Robert A. McDermott, who helped serve the food.
Martin J. Golden, a newly-elected Republican Councilman from Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, invited his Democratic predecessor, Sal F. Albanese, who stepped down to run for Mayor and vigorously supported Mr. Golden's Democratic opponent. "I attended because I believe in orderly transitions," said Mr. Albanese, now a lawyer in private practice. "Even though I didn't support him, he is my successor and he is my representative."
Then, Mr. Albanese, who served in the Council for 15 years, added that he was considering running for Mayor again in 2001. "Swearing-in ceremonies attract a lot of people and there is a lot of community activism there," he said. "So, it was my way of assuring them that I'm not going anywhere and that I plan to remain involved politically."

HEADLINE: ANTIQUES;
Furniture Of Frontier New England

BYLINE: By Wendy Moonan 

 BODY:
In the 1600's, when America's early colonists said, "Go west," they meant western Massachusetts. Today, it's hard to think of the Connecticut River Valley as a frontier outpost, but that's what it was: 48 were killed in Deerfield, Mass., during a 1704 French and Indian attack. The town rebuilt itself continuously.
The settlers' indefatigable spirit is evident in a loan exhibition of decorative arts from the house museums of Historic Deerfield at the Winter Antiques Show, at the Seventh Regiment Armory (Park Avenue at 66th Street) through Jan. 25. As a result of 50 years of restoration, Deerfield intentionally looks like a New England village that time forgot. 
 Founded in 1669, the rural hamlet still has only one street. It is lined with tall elms and 18th- and 19th-century wooden houses and barns. Behind them stretch acres of protected fields, meadows and woodlands. Two miles away, the Deerfield River runs into the Connecticut, the Great River, which is also the title of a seminal 1985 book of essays edited by William N. Hosley Jr. covering the area's history, architecture and the decorative arts (published by the Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford).
At first sight, Deerfield's houses seem simple. Then you notice the Baroque doorways, with overscaled broken-scroll pediments and fluted pilasters, glass fanlights and distinctive hardware. This is no ordinary village. It had 18 feet of top soil to nurture wheat, corn and tobacco. It harvested and sent timber to market down the river, and raised oxen that went to Boston to slaughter.
"Of all the interior settlements, the Connecticut Valley was the richest," said Mr. Hosley, executive director of the Antiquarian and Landmarks Society in Hartford. "The valley was the dominant artistic culture and economy in the interior of the colonies in the 17th and 18th century." Several of these historic houses are still occupied by the Bement School and Deerfield Academy, founded in 1797; some are privately owned, and 14 constitute the house museums of Historic Deerfield.
"The golden age of the Connecticut River Valley was from 1750 to 1820," Donald Friary, executive director of Historic Deerfield, said. "Deerfield was a crossroads. It was on the main road to Albany and up the river from Hartford." Houses were furnished with objects from the urban centers, and local furniture was made with native woods, which were less popular in other regions: red and white oak, yellow pine, ash and maple. By 1750, cherry was the favored wood, and it was often stained to look like imported mahogany.
As Roger Gonzales, a furniture restorer and dealer in Kent, Conn., put it, "Don't forget, Connecticut Yankees were cheap." They were also into style, their own style. "The furniture makers interpreted British designs, but their emphasis is more on form than decoration," Mr. Hosley said. "They did not emphasize uniformity. For them, pizazz is achieved through exaggerated lines and robust motifs." They were not trying to copy the high style of Newport, Boston or New York.
One of the finest pieces in the loan exhibition is a four-drawer cherry chest with a scallop top made in Deerfield in 1786 by Benjamin Munn 3d. Philip Zea, the Historic Deerfield curator, said the scallop top was a popular motif. "These undulating symmetrical tops provide visual excitement in an inexpensive, two-dimensional way," he said.
Mr. Hosley emphasized that these furniture makers were doing custom work. "So they had to reinvent the wheel with every commission. You see deeply carved rosettes, undulating vines, serpentine tops, scallops and complex curves: the frontier spirit in furniture design."
Several Connecticut River Valley antiques will be auctioned at Sotheby's and Christie's this week. Christie's sale of the Bertram D. Coleman collection today includes a Queen Anne mahogany tray-top tea table from Connecticut, circa 1740. Very light in weight, it looks a bit like a yearling, with tall, spindly, elegant legs (estimate: $15,000 to $20,000). There is also a tall, exuberant Connecticut Chippendale-style cherry chest-on-chest from 1785-1800. The pediment has maple inlaid pinwheel rosettes above an inlaid patera. There is an inlaid fan above its reverse-serpentine drawers, and each of the 10 drawers is bordered with an inlay of a lighter wood, perhaps maple. (Estimate: $12,000 to $18,000.)
"In Connecticut, there is an interest in ornament and decoration to an extent you don't see in more sober centers like New York," said Dean Failey of Christie's.
Arthur Sack, a Manhattan dealer, said: "These small-town cabinetmakers were high-spirited and individualistic. Everything they do is different and experimental, sometimes even humorous." Zeke Liverant, a Colchester, Conn., dealer in business for 65 years, added: "The cabinetmakers were very imaginative. They had regional style."
And Wendell Garrett of Sotheby's said: "The exaggerated shells and acanthus leaves are almost a caricature of high-style, urban taste. In the rural translation, furniture takes on funny colloquialisms. It's artisan mannerism. It uses the same architectural motifs one sees in the doorways, mantlepieces, pilasters and pediments. There's an echo between architectural decoration and furniture decoration."
Many collectors prize such idiosyncratic interpretations. Last year, in the James Keene sale at Sotheby's, a Queen Anne cherry dressing table, circa 1770, with an undulating top set a record for a Connecticut piece: $387,500.
"Connecticut River Valley furniture has great personality," said Leslie Keno of Sotheby's. "It has human qualities. It looks as if it's walking toward you. It makes you smile."
In its Americana sale today, Sotheby's is offering a Queen Anne cherry bonnet-top chest of drawers from Connecticut, circa 1760. It has a swan's neck crest with three finials, a pinwheel in the tympanum and carved pilasters that end in fish scales and pinwheels. The fish-scale capitals have been decorated with punchwork that looks like polka dots. (Estimate: $60,000 to $80,000.)
Sotheby's is also auctioning an elegant Chippendale cherry armchair, circa 1785, attributed to an Eliphalet Chapin of East Windsor, Conn. The front legs have exaggerated cabriole legs; the rear legs are straight but round. The talons in the claw-and-ball feet are thick, "like Tootsie Rolls" said Mr. Keno, who added that this was a Chapin characteristic. (Estimate: $50,000 to $80,000.)
Stella Show Management has organized two affordable antiques shows this weekend. "Americana at the Piers" will be tomorrow and Sunday, with 400 dealers, at the Passenger Ship Terminal, Piers 90 and 92 (Hudson River at 50th Street). It includes a loan exhibition, organized by the Manhattan dealer Laura Fisher, featuring quilts made from pictorial ephemera. "Antiques at the Other Armory" is today through Sunday, with 100 dealers, at the Gramercy Park Armory (Lexington Avenue at 26th Street). Information for both shows: (212) 255-0020.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
The Peal of Horns Aplenty From a Big-Band Cornucopia

BYLINE: By BEN RATLIFF 

 BODY:
Oblivious to economics and cultural trends, the big band plays on.
You can trace the death of the big-band era, circa 1945, to social and financial realities. Gas and rubber shortages during World War II made travel expensive for touring bands; once the war ended, the un-hip suburbs sprouted, leaving live jazz behind in urban pockets. Many of the great bands broke up, spilling musicians into a thousand small groups that found it easier to survive. 
 So how come the 18-piece band led by Maria Schneider drew a capacity crowd a few weeks ago for the last Monday night of a five-year weekly engagement at the club Visiones, in the West Village? How come, at last count, there are 14 big bands in regular weekly slots at New York City jazz clubs, playing music from swing to free jazz? And how come the most accurate cross section of the city's jazz world, both players and listeners, is found at these shows?
You can theorize: Wynton Marsalis and the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, and Jon Faddis with the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band, have toured extensively for the last 10 years, filling a near-total vacuum, inspiring young musicians' big-band dreams. Another theory is essentially the reverse of what happened 50 years ago. Touring is so expensive and difficult -- except for bands supported by a record label, or, in the case of the Lincoln Center orchestra, by corporate sponsors -- that even small groups find it hard to stay together, freeing players to spend one night a week in a club's house orchestra.
The last decade has also seen enrollments rise in university jazz programs. The products of that surge have graduated and descended upon New York looking for work. And a musician can make great strides, as well as great contacts, by playing in a regular weekly gig with a 10- to 18-piece group, even if the pay is less than cab fare.
"I've always been in one," said Steve Wilson, a saxophonist with a considerable reputation of his own, who often plays with the Mingus Big Band at the Fez, in the East Village. "People forget that even Coltrane and Bird were in big bands. It's a personality-forming experience. You're not in the spotlight all the time, and it teaches you to control your sound."
Big bands are also about having a good time. But the ritual of jazz big bands -- even without a dance floor -- is inherently social. You hear jokes and shouting, grumbles of dissent or encouragement, from both musicians and listeners. If the group performs in a small club, you're at close quarters with the band, with no fourth wall separating players from audience.
But most of all, big bands have persisted because musicians love them. "Jazz musicians have a very elemental need for groups to play in and original music to play," said Bill Kirchner, a composer and historian of big bands. "You have to create these opportunities yourself, and it's usually against all odds. Big bands are always going to be there, as long as there are jazz musicians."
Here's a look at some of the big bands you can see in and around New York over the next few weeks.
 
Vanguard Jazz Orchestra
The cornetist Thad Jones and the drummer Mel Lewis formed a big band in 1966, and it started playing Monday nights at the Village Vanguard that year. Max Gordon, then the Vanguard's owner, gave them a three-week commitment. "We're still negotiating the same contract," John Mosca said on Monday, from the trombone section of what is now called the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra.
Jones left the group in 1979 to lead the Danish Radio Big Band. (He died in 1986.) But in his 13 years of big-band writing at the Vanguard, he created a body of work that has become a jazz subculture for baby-boom cognoscenti. And you can still hear his music each Monday night at the club, as well as pieces written by the band's current composer in residence and pianist, Jim McNeely.
The Vanguard band became incorporated some years ago, which enabled it to seek grants; that's how it was able to finance the recording of "Lickety Split," an album of Mr. McNeely's compositions on the New World label that is likely to raise the band's stock and gain it some new listeners. The group likes to telescope a long chord across the brass section, luxuriating in tone; the blocks of sound that make up this big band are distinct; the harmonies and arty dissonances are articulated with beautiful clarity.
Mr. McNeely brings the entire band book, a distressed accordion folder with nearly 100 arrangements, to work with him each week, and the 15 other musicians cart along nearly as much sheet music. They could always agree on the set list earlier in the day, but that's a little too businesslike, and sort of un-jazz.
"It's like when the quarterback calls an audible," said Mr. McNeely, a large man in his late 40's who looks more like a blocker. "Sometimes you want to change your mind about what you want to do."
 
The Incubators
Mr. McNeely also teaches a seminar in orchestration at New York University and is the co-leader of the BMI Orchestra Workshop, a group of 25 or 30 New York players who convene once a month to rehearse new work written by its members. The musicians give the composers feedback, and the band plays a few concerts every year. This is one of the ways that musicians surmount the logistical difficulty of creating big-band music: rounding up 18 players with 18 schedules.
Another big-band workshop, the Composers Big Band, run for the last year in Montclair, N.J., by the pianist Diane Moser, offers more frequent public concerts. Ms. Moser, an unfazable booster for improvised music, cultivates a collection of New Jersey musicians and invites a different composer once a month to bring in new work. A local church gives her free rehearsal space (she writes church-service music in return); the band then performs the work at Tierney's Tavern, in Montclair.
One of Ms. Moser's regulars is the saxophonist and composer Oliver Lake. "I hadn't done a big band in a while," said Mr. Lake, whose last performance with one was five years ago at Town Hall in Manhattan, "and this got me back into writing." But he needed help.
Ms. Moser explained: "He had written a lot of this stuff a long time ago, and he wanted to revise it. There were sections that needed to be opened up, and other sections where he really needed to be more concise. And we let him know!"
 
Oliver Lake Big Band
With his big-band book redeveloped, Mr. Lake approached the Knitting Factory, which signed him on for every Monday this month.
The modern big-band sound funnels directly back to the Count Basie band from the 1950's, with its pinpoint blending of reeds and brass and dynamic drumming. Not Mr. Lake's. He mixes blues and gospel, funk and free; but his free jazz is never maundering. He likes players with a sense of humor and style; his pieces explode with bursts of chaotic energy but don't lose direction. Two weeks ago, his trombonist Frank Lacy took a terrific solo during which he took apart his trombone, continuing to play through the various bits of hardware.
 
Next Legacy Orchestra
Similar in style, with a lot of collective improvisation and exploratory solos over funk and swing grooves, is one of New York's best overlooked bands, the Next Legacy Orchestra, led by the saxophonist Benny Russell.
The band, in a previous incarnation, had been led for a number of years at the Knitting Factory by the saxophonist David Murray, who recently moved to Paris. Mr. Russell gave the group its present name and started focusing more on his own writing. He now leads it every Sunday night at the Brooklyn Conservatory of Music, a brownstone in Park Slope, where he is also a teacher and director of the jazz department.
"We have to struggle," Mr. Russell said before starting a sparsely attended concert last week, in the conservatory's large front room. "But, as Frederick Douglass said, if there's no struggle, there's no progress."
It's gratifying to stumble across New York's better players in supporting roles in these groups. The Next Legacy band includes some excellent musicians, like the pianist Roberta Piket, the trumpeters Eddie Allen and Derrick Gardner, and the alto saxophonists James Spaulding and Jorge Sylvester. These are musicians with records and other bands and careers to pursue, yet here they are, unadvertised, getting knowledge and giving it.
 
Make-Believe Ballroom Orchestra
Mr. Russell spends his Thursday evenings in the saxophone section of a different world. Swing music of the 1940's has created a little youth scene in Los Angeles for about a decade, with the musicians fitted out with suspenders, vintage shirts and cigarettes behind their ears. But I was surprised recently to walk into Swing 46, a new club on Restaurant Row, and see the same rituals being enacted in the cynical capital of the world. This is where swing dancers go, and where the jazz audience doesn't.
The segregation is a shame, because swing people are the least predictable music fans I've seen. There is absolutely no pattern or stereotype of race, age, sex, dress or affectation.
"Awright cats, on the dance floor, on the double!" yelled George Gee, a short man with thick glasses and a fedora (doffed repeatedly to reveal a buzz cut), grinning madly, completely aware of his cornball talk but also in a bit of a euphoric delirium. Mr. Gee runs the club's house band, the Make-Believe Ballroom Orchestra.
"Swing 46, where the hip meet the hep," he crowed. "Get hip, get hep, get right in step."
An out-of-practice bassist, Mr. Gee prefers to be unencumbered by an instrument. He leads the band in a Cab Calloway sort of way: as figurehead, chanter and cheerleader. He was inspired to head a big band in 1979, when as a college radio disk jockey in Pittsburgh he interviewed Count Basie. Ten years later, he sought out the Basie band's chief arranger, Frank Foster, who shared arrangements with him.
Mr. Gee then connected with the New York Swing Dance Society, which now holds its dances every Sunday night at Irving Plaza, and his band began to build a reputation. He's busy with weekly engagements, parties and national battle-of-the-bands tours.
Playing tunes like Basie's "Broadway" and Benny Goodman's "Roll 'Em," the band is unself-consciously retro with no ironic spin. The surprise for a fan of new jazz is that the band is full of good musicians seen elsewhere around town, not just Sunday duffers.
 
Ghost Bands
There are three bands in regular rotation now that exclusively play the music and style of deceased band leaders: ghost bands as they're called.
The Mingus Big Band, a success from its six years of weekly appearances at the Fez in the East Village, is perhaps the best embodiment of a band flourishing on the existing pool of talent in New York. Its players frequently tour and follow other commitments, but Sue Mingus, the widow of the composer and bassist Charles Mingus, has assembled a pool of substitute players large enough to make eight big bands. She has also organized several recordings; the most recent is "Que Viva Mingus" (Dreyfus).
The group has been an important force in New York's jazz scene during this decade; some of the younger musicians who have gotten a boost out of playing with the band include the star saxophonists James Carter, Mark Shim and Chris Potter.
Also at the Fez, on many Sunday nights, is the 18-piece Sun Ra Arkestra. (Its next appearance is set for Feb. 1.) Sun Ra died in 1993, and the band, once a Philadelphia-based collective, is now mostly New Yorkers. But it's run by the Arkestra's long-standing alto saxophonist, Marshall Allen, whose Johnny Hodges-like smeared glissandos embody the eccentric dreaminess that the band is all about. The 90-tune repertory is full of the band's old numbers like "Interstellar Low Ways," as well as untraditional (for a jazz group) choices of standards like "Ol' Man River" and "Over the Rainbow."
Much else is untraditional about the band: there are three percussionists and two baritone saxophonists. On a recent Sunday, Art Jenkins sat in the trumpet section, but had only a megaphone in his hands, through which he howled his parts. And at one point, he transformed himself into a baritone crooner, belting out "When You Wish Upon a Star."
A benign raggedness is the band's latter-day trademark, though not an indispensable element of the music; I hope some better-known New Yorkers might drift into its ranks, a la Mingus band, and change the formula a little. It's easy to imagine, for instance, the saxophonist James Carter and the pianist Rodney Kendrick bolstering its wild sound, although Mr. Allen apparently has no desire to have another pianist replace the departed leader.
Upon the death of Mercer Ellington last February, his son, Paul Mercer Ellington, a 19-year-old high school senior, became the leader of the frequently touring Duke Ellington Orchestra. Paul learned to conduct by watching videotapes of Duke Ellington, his grandfather, and later studied composition, conducting and piano with the pianist Tommy James, who has been with the band for 10 years.
Starting this week, the group plays on Tuesday nights at Birdland, and Mr. Ellington will mix his own compositions into his grandfather's repertory.
"I'm concerned a little bit with fulfilling expectations," Mr. Ellington said. "But it's not that hard. I do write like my grandfather when I write for the big band."
The band, which I haven't heard at Birdland, respects the audience's frequent calls for "Take the A Train" and "Sophisticated Lady," but its book also includes some of Duke Ellington's lesser-known work, like his sacred music and parts of the "Far East Suite," his mid-1960's masterpiece.
 
Other Bands
Birdland has invested heavily in big bands, settling regular Mondays for Toshiko Akiyoshi's excellent 70's-era modernism and Sundays for Chico O'Farrill's group.
The 76-year-old Mr. O'Farrill is the living symbol of Afro-Cuban music's marriage to jazz in the be-bop era. He wrote music for Benny Goodman, Dizzy Gillespie and Machito, including the famous "Afro-Cuban Suite." With his son, Arturo, at the piano, Mr. O'Farrill conducts the band through his own intricately structured compositions, as well as idiosyncratic arrangements of tunes like "Perdido" and "Chicago." He revived his big-band career a few years ago, and this is the first time he has had a regular engagement.
The city's tiniest clubs are even following suit. Chuck Clark's 10-piece band takes up a third of the Internet Cafe, in the East Village, on many Monday nights; its next appearance is on March 9. Across town, Jason Lindner, a 25-year-old pianist with a clean and swinging style, has led a big band on Monday nights at Smalls in the West Village for three years.
Though Mr. Lindner writes most of the group's music, like the best band leaders, he encourages its players to contribute pieces. Mr. Lindner enrolled in an orchestration course while studying at the New School but ditched it after a couple of classes. Accordingly, his band doesn't have a studied sound but seems to arise more naturally from the capabilities of its individual voices.
It's a soloist's band, dense with promising new talent like the tenor saxophonists Jimmy Greene, Greg Tardy and Charles Owens; the bassist Omer Avital, and the percussionist Khalil Kwame Bell. The sound of the band has been captured on a new Impulse records sampler, "Live at Smalls."
"I guess the bumper stickers are right," said Jim McNeely, laughing. "The big bands are back."
The point is, they never left.

Poor Old Mister Money

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER 

 BODY:
The excesses associated with Sodom and Gomorrah, the last days of Pompeii and the administration of Ulysses S. Grant are now visible in New York.
Nowhere is the grossness of the age more obvious or more loathsome than in New York's real-estate market. This isn't surprising. Real estate is to New York what the after-dinner orgy was to Rome. 
 Nothing lights a fire in the New York eye or makes New York blood pound faster than news of a real-estate desperado extracting the wealth of the Indies from some hapless customer. Nothing makes the New Yorker roar with pleasure more surely than a ghoulish tale of competing apartment hunters racing the undertaker over a threshold where the lone occupant of a decent apartment has just wheezed his last.
Such was the stuff that passed for Manhattan dinner conversation even in the not-so-good-old days before the new barbarianism burst out of Wall Street. Now that the gutters are awash in money, real-estate stories reflect a state of depravity too advanced to be expunged by a mere 40 days and 40 nights of rain.
Just last week The New York Times carried a story that must have repelled every civilized reader. That The Times was willing to print it testifies to the integrity with which the paper pursues its obligation to keep the public fully informed.
The subject was the rental price of Manhattan housing for the well-to-do. Disgusting though it be to read about, landlords are now charging $25,000 a month for their fancier digs.
That's $300,000 a year after taxes, which, in New York, can strip the conscientious citizen of nearly 50 percent of his paycheck. It is dizzying to go on. A $300,000 rental requires $600,000 in pre-tax earnings, and doesn't even yield equity.
That's not rent, it's a bank heist. What's more, the tenant still doesn't have any groceries, car insurance, tip money for the doorman, skis for the slopes at Aspen, or the scratch needed to put his youthful produce into Manhattan's private schools.
Public school would be madness. Once word got around the playground that the youngster's father was paying $300,000 in rent, somebody, possibly the principal, would be tempted to try his skill at kidnapping for ransom. Private schools know this, and charge accordingly.
But enough with arithmetic. We are talking obviously of people who have transcended normal humanity's money problems.
There have always been such fortunate souls, but except for buying Rembrandts and building castles in Newport they have generally hewn wisely to the theory that flaunting it is not only vulgar, but also bad economic policy.
Provoking the envy of the impecunious may bring churls into the streets with sticks and stones and -- worse! -- result in a hike in the tax rate on capital gains. Better to reassure the poor devils that money can't buy happiness.
The great bull market of the Clinton Age has done for conspicuous consumption what free agency has done for baseball players. It has made excess a way of life.
In some ways the worst of it is what has happened to money's reputation. Once, money was a thing to be respected. Now it's a trivial thing created with a piece of plastic at an A.T.M.
It's a blip on a computer screen, it's a meaningless tonnage of paper shipped to real-estate agents in boxcar lots. This is a terrible thing that has happened to Old Mister Money.
All the dignity has been squeezed out of him. Anyone nowadays who referred to the dollar as "the iron man" or praised something for being "sound as a dollar" would be considered a lunatic.
Can you still be corrupted by love of money now that money is no longer lovable, but only laughable, like the Ralph Bellamy character too laughable to get the girl?
The Times story on rentals reported that 60 properties each fetched over $300,000 in rentals last year. One agent, Beatrice Ducrot, told of offering a rental on Central Park West at $27,000 a month: nine rooms "and a handful of terraces."
She had "people lined up, three or four deep. . . . it rented in a day. These tycoons do not just wait around," she observed.
Indeed, why should our tycoons wait around? Dawdle too long and angry Vesuvius may catch you disgracefully long on cash.

HEADLINE: On Wall St., Fervent Plea For Minorities

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
The Rev. Jesse L. Jackson exhorted Wall Street and the nation's business managers yesterday to offer decent investment and job opportunities to blacks and other minorities. The call came on the first day of an unusual gathering of business, political and labor leaders at the World Trade Center to discuss issues of race and opportunity in America.
The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. "understood that equal opportunity required entry into the marketplace and access to jobs, education and private investment," Mr. Jackson said, invoking his mentor, whose birthday will be celebrated on Monday. The purpose of the Wall Street conference, Mr. Jackson said, is "to expand the marketplace to offer opportunity to all." 
 Mr. Jackson yesterday drew support from President Clinton and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, who both came to New York City to address the meeting. "Our economy is going to fall far short of its potential unless it is for all of us," Mr. Rubin told the conference in his speech yesterday morning, arguing that offering more opportunities to minorities is good for profits. "Inclusion," he said, "is critical to the bottom line."
Such words seemed to echo Mr. Jackson's own themes. "We'll pay for not investing; we're in one big tent," Mr. Jackson told reporters earlier this week, as he discussed the Wall Street conference, arguing for a fairer allocation of resources that would direct more toward inner cities, blacks and other minorities.
Mr. Jackson also said this week that his coalition was acquiring small stockholdings in a number of big companies, allowing it to monitor, and lobby, on minority hiring and procurement practices to insure the companies paid sufficient attention to minority interests. He did not identify the possible companies.
"Rikers Island is a more expensive university than N.Y.U.," Mr. Jackson said, referring to the cost of running New York's crowded state jail. "What's missing in this dialogue has been corporate America. They must lead the way on making the case, as educators and in skills and training. There is this wealth gap here. The biggest since 1929."
The conference, at Windows on the World atop the World Trade Center, is the first annual gathering of the Rainbow/PUSH coalition that Mr. Jackson leads. The coalition opened an office on Wall Street a year ago to draw attention to minority issues and to lobby the country's financial leaders on their home ground.
This week's gathering attracted hundreds of businessmen and financiers, including many blacks, and several top Wall Street executives and corporate leaders, including Jacques Nasser of the Ford Motor Company; John S. Chalsty, the chairman and chief executive of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, a unit of Equitable and James Dimon, the chairman and chief executive of Salomon Smith Barney Inc., a subsidiary of Travelers Group.
Mr. Dimon, whose firm is one of three co-sponsors of the conference along with the New York Stock Exchange and Rainbow/PUSH, addressed executives during the conference's morning session, commending his own firm's approach to diversity and its stated intention to reward those managers who seek out and hire sufficient numbers of women and minorities.
These new policies resulted from the settlement of a class-action lawsuit brought by more than 20 Smith Barney women employees, which contended that the company had frequently shown gender bias and that there had been substantial sexual harassment in the workplace.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasury Securities End Mixed After New Inflation Warning

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities ended mixed yesterday after bouncing around a bit on weakness in the stock market, an inflation warning from a senior Federal Reserve official, new evidence of an economic slowdown and a glut of corporate bond offerings.
The 30-year bond fell 4/32, to a price of 105 15/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.74 percent from 5.73 percent. Short-term maturities rose in price. 
 Bonds initially advanced in reaction to a sharp selloff overnight in the Hong Kong stock market on resilient anxiety about the impact of the financial crisis in Asia. Concerns about Asia also contributed to weakness on Wall Street and sent some investors into the safe haven of the bond market.
But prices declined after Susan M. Phillips, a Fed governor, said in a speech that labor shortages could contribute to higher wages, "which can then turn into inflation."
Her remarks were interpreted as a sign that the central bank has not ruled out an increase in interest rates to thwart inflationary pressure, despite prevailing evidence that inflation remains benign and that the financial crisis in Asia is likely to mean steady or lower rates.
John Canavan, a markets analyst with Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, said bonds were also pressured lower by a regional Philadelphia Fed survey, a barometer of broader trends, that showed an unexpected surge in manufacturing.
But other evidence of a possible economic slowing also emerged. The Commerce Department reported the 17th consecutive monthly increase in business inventories during November, and the Labor Department reported an unexpected rise in weekly jobless claims to a five-month high. Even in the Philadelphia Fed survey, manufacturers reported sharply lower inflation pressure and their outlook for the the next six months was pessimistic.
Nearly $4 billion in new corporate debt also contributed to weakness in long-term bond prices. Many companies are rushing to sell debt to take advantage of the lowest long-term financing costs in years.
Doug Burtnick, a managing analyst at Technical Data in Boston, said the absorption of this new corporate debt had made it more difficult to interpret the market's behavior.
"When you add in the continuing evolving situation in Asia and what looks like a strong inverse tick-for-tick correlation with the stock market," Mr. Burtnick said, "bonds promise to be more of a technical beast than a real read on the economy."

HEADLINE: Dun & Bradstreet Spinoff Will Split in Two

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WESTPORT, Conn., Jan. 15

 BODY:
The Cognizant Corporation, one of three companies created by a breakup of the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, said today that it would split into a separate television ratings business and a provider of health care information.
Cognizant said the breakup would enable each business to focus on its core operations. 
 One company will be Nielsen Media Research, which collects television ratings, and the other will be IMS Health, which gathers health care information.
"These two operating businesses have fundamentally different growth outlooks, operating characteristics and customer requirements," said Robert E. Weissman, the chairman and chief executive of Cognizant. He said they would be more valuable to shareholders as separate companies.
Shares of Cognizant gained $1.125, to $46.
Cognizant shareholders will receive a tax-free dividend of one share of IMS Health stock for each Cognizant share. Once the breakup is completed this summer, Cognizant plans to call itself Nielsen Media Research.
The split is subject to approval from the Internal Revenue Service and Cognizant's board.
In January 1996, Dun & Bradstreet announced a three-way split into Cognizant, a reorganized Dun & Bradstreet and A. C. Nielsen, which tracks consumer retail buying.

HEADLINE: Korea Opposes Plan by U.S. Banks to Repackage Loans

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
In a blow to American banks, the South Korean Government opposes a debt refinancing plan put forward by the banks, which will meet on Wednesday with Korean officials to discuss how to repackage as much as $28 billion in short-term loans that are smothering the beleaguered nation's economy.
American commercial bankers said prospects had dimmed that South Korea would accept a plan devised by J. P. Morgan & Company to exchange private-sector loans for longer-term debt guaranteed by the Government. 
 "Things don't look good for us," said one American banker involved in the negotiations.
The apparent failure of the J. P. Morgan proposal to find immediate favor with the Government does not mean South Korea is shut off from considering other refinancing options. In fact, the country must consider other options because its economy remains on life support with assistance from international lending agencies like the International Monetary Fund. Without such aid, and temporary loan-forgiveness from international banks, South Korea's Government and corporations would be in default.
And with South Korean officials set to arrive in New York next week to meet with international bankers from Europe, Japan and the United States, the Government's hardened stance toward the J. P. Morgan proposal may be nothing more than a pre-negotiating ploy.
Nonetheless, American bankers believe the South Koreans' thinking has turned against them.
With South Korean financial markets showing renewed vigor and many international banks supporting a plan to extend payment on, or roll over, most of South Korea's short-term loans until March 31, the South Korean Government has every reason to believe it has a stronger hand to play with the banks.
"I certainly think they've gotten more comfortable over the last week," an American commercial banker said.
The J. P. Morgan plan, which the Chase Manhattan Corporation and Citicorp also support, has had many variations since it was first presented informally to South Korea at the end of December. The current plan, known as Version 3.0, as if it were a software title, is valued at approximately $25 billion. It calls for a new $10 billion bond offering to replenish Government reserves, while a remaining undetermined portion would be split between a debt exchange and longer-term debt extensions, or rollovers, guaranteed by the Government. New bonds would be issued in a public auction.
Long-term rollovers were not originally part of the plan but are now included because Japanese and German banks, South Korea's two largest creditor groups, prefer them as a way of maintaining relationships with South Korean clients. Nonetheless, the revisions are still not entirely in keeping with how the Government perceives its interests.
Although the South Koreans would like to refinance their debt as soon as possible, they are wary of a bond auction that could require them to pay onerous interest rates should there be a lack of investors willing to buy the bonds. In previous meetings with the banks, the South Koreans have expressed a desire for a negotiated, or fixed, rate on the bonds. That stance, however, also might make the bonds less attractive to investors who consider the interest rate to be be too low for the risk.
The South Korean delegation meeting at Citicorp's headquarters next week will include Kim Yong Hwan, director of President-elect Kim Dae Jung's emergency economic committee; You Jong Keun, an economic adviser to Mr. Kim; Chung Dok Ku, vice minister of finance for the outgoing Government, and Chung In Yong, the ambassador for international financial affairs.

HEADLINE: Nation's Biggest Atomic Utility to Shut 2 Units

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Jan 15

 BODY:
In the biggest retreat from nuclear power to date, Commonwealth Edison said today it would close 2 of its 12 nuclear generators because they were too expensive to operate now that the industry was being deregulated.
Commonwealth Edison, the nation's largest private operator of nuclear plants, said closing the two plants, which sit side by side on Lake Michigan in Zion, Ill., 40 miles north of Chicago, was purely economic. 
 But anti-nuclear advocates noted that Zion's woes had been compounded by a long history of labor and safety problems. Last fall, the nuclear industry's own watchdog organization issued a scathing review of operations at Zion and other Commonwealth Edison plants.
The case for closing Zion rather than trying to upgrade it and return it to service was "overwhelming," said James J. O'Connor, chairman and chief executive of Commonwealth Edison's parent, the Unicom Corporation of Chicago.
Nuclear power accounted for about 20 percent of the nation's electricity output last year, down slightly from 21.9 percent 1996.
Although some states, including Illinois, will remain highly reliant on nuclear power for years, analysts expect the overall share to decline steadily in the next two decades because no new plants are under construction in the United States.
The decision to close Zion came just one day after Northeast Utilities, the owner of the three Millstone nuclear plants at Waterford, Conn., said it had indefinitely suspended efforts to reopen Millstone 1, the smallest and oldest of the units. Many utilities are also shutting down aging or heavily polluting coal-fired plants to prepare for stiffer price competition.
The Zion generators, each capable of producing 1,000 megawatts, were the largest nuclear plants in the nation when they came on line in 1973 and 1974. Safety and maintenance problems had led the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to put them on its watch list of troubled plants. One has been idle since September of 1996 and the other since February 1997.
The enormous cost of closing Zion will be reflected in an accounting charge of $515 million, or $2.38 a share, against Unicom's fourth-quarter earnings. But Wall Street, which had been anticipating and urging the Zion closing, was undisturbed. Unicom's shares dipped 25 cents to close at $30.6875.
"It shows they are evaluating all their resources in the context of a competitive market, which is what we expect," said Samuel Brothwell, who follows the company for Merrill Lynch in New York.
The closing is not expected to affect the reliability of service in northern Illinois, where Commonwealth Edison serves 3.4 million customers. The generators at Zion will be replaced with equipment to help Commonwealth Edison manage its network more efficiently. The utility is also investing in transmission lines and energy efficiency programs to adjust its capacity and the demand. Spent fuel will be stored on site until 2014, the year final decommissioning is scheduled to begin.
Mr. O'Connor, Unicom's chairman, insisted that the closing did not mean that Commonwealth Edison could not safely manage its 12 nuclear properties.
Critics were skeptical.
"They've done the right thing, but they didn't have any choice," said Howard Learner, executive director of the Environmental Law and Policy Center, a Chicago research group.
Mr. Learner said the Zion closing was only the first step needed to convince Federal regulators that the company could break away from its dismal track record of having new problems crop up in its nuclear portfolio just as it was attacking old ones. In addition to Zion, 4 other Commonwealth Edison plants are on the nuclear commission's watch list, and only 4 of the 12 are now generating electricity.
Mr. Learner predicted that at least two of the other troubled units, those near LaSalle, Ill., would also have to be closed in the next year or two to allow Commonwealth Edison to better focus its oversight efforts. He cited reports this week that poor management of the Quad Cities nuclear plant near Moline, which was shut down late last year after violating safety procedures, could land it on the commission's watch list just as the two improving Dresden units near Morris, Ill., come off the list.
Commonwealth Edison admitted at a meeting with regional commission officials on Wednesday that it had lost its focus on safety at Quad Cities.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Earnings Reports Push Major Stock Market Indexes Down

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Uncertainty about the outlook for corporate earnings pushed investors toward the exits yesterday as major stock market indexes posted their first declines of the week.
As the pace of quarterly earnings reports begins to quicken, investors are not getting a clear picture of how expectations of slower economic growth in the United States and the financial crisis in Asia will affect American companies. A mild euphoria brought about by positive earnings surprises from companies like Intel and Apple Computer earlier this week was tempered yesterday by mixed results from companies like Eastman Kodak and Unisys. 
 "There's this feeling from investors that they don't know which way to go," said Alan Bond, chief investment officer at Bond Procope Capital Management in New York.
"Some companies are saying we've made it through the battle, but the war is not over," Mr. Bond said. Intel, for example, recorded strong fourth-quarter revenue, which fueled Tuesday's market rally, but the company warned that first-quarter 1998 earnings may be flat and that profit margins could shrink this year.
The reports yesterday from Unisys and Eastman Kodak -- both companies' results were hurt by big one-time charges, though operating earnings were generally in line with expectations -- helped drag blue-chip stocks lower. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 92.92 points, or 1.2 percent, to 7,691.77. The index had gained 204.27 points earlier in the week. The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index slipped 7.21 points, to 950.73. It had gained 30.25 points in the previous three days.
But the Nasdaq composite index fared much better, closing at 1,547.06, down 1.70 points, hardly denting the week's 45-point advance. The technology-laden index was buoyed by a better-than-expected quarterly earnings report from Sun Microsystems.
Earlier, Wall Street was rattled by further volatility in Asian markets. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell more than 7 percent yesterday on fears that a large commercial property company could face financial problems, while Indonesia's benchmark stock index fell 4.1 percent. But South Korea's main index gained 6.5 percent.
In the United States, the Government reported further signs of slowing economic growth. Business inventories rose four-tenths of a percent in November, to a seasonally adjusted $1.04 trillion, the 17th month without a decline, while business sales slipped two-tenths of a percent, to $758.1 billion, the Commerce Department said.
Also, the Labor Department said first-time claims for unemployment benefits rose by 3,000 last week, to 335,000, the highest since mid-August. Economists had expected a slight decline.
With economic output showing signs of moderating, investors are grappling with the prospects of slower earnings growth at the same time that some stocks are still considered to be expensive, said Richard Cripps, chief investment strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc.
When fourth-quarter earnings are released, it is common for companies to give investors a view about the coming year. This year, corporate officers seem less sanguine about growth prospects. "In the past they were a bit more optimistic," Mr. Cripps said.
However, a bright spot for stock market investors can be gleaned from the recent decline in long-term interest rates, shown by the 30-year Treasury bond yield's decline from 5.92 percent at the end of 1997 to 5.74 yesterday, said John Ballen, chief equity officer at Massachusetts Financial Services.
"Lower interest rates have made stocks look cheaper despite the declining earnings," Mr. Ballen said. "But it's confusing people, because lower interest rates are good, but declining earnings are not good. If you were a purist, with interest rates lower, stocks should go up."
The uncertainty continues to aid companies whose businesses are largely domestically focused, analysts said. One indication of this is the modest decline this year in Morgan Stanley's index of consumer-oriented companies, which is down 1.1 percent. That compares with a 2.6 percent decline in the firm's index of 30 cyclical, or economically sensitive, stocks, which includes companies like Allied Signal, Citicorp and Motorola.
Analysts anticipate that health care companies, drugstore chains and food retailers should do well in this environment.

HEADLINE: Officials, Fearing Falling Masonry, Close Sidewalk

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
The police blocked off the sidewalk in front of a Times Square hotel yesterday after building inspectors determined that masonry on the facade was in danger of falling.
Guests were not forced to leave the hotel, the Carter, at 250 West 43d Street, but those who chose to leave were told by the city that they could not return until the building owner had installed a construction canopy to protect passers-by. The canopy was completed last night, and officials began to let guests return.
 The Buildings Department issued a violation against the owner last month, giving him until Feb. 2 to repair defects like cracks, chips and bulging lintels and to hire an engineer to assess the building's stability. But officials decided that they could not wait after an inspector returned to the 24-story hotel on Tuesday and found that no work had been done, said the Buildings Commissioner, Gaston Silva. 
 On March 4, an engineer inspected the facade and issued a report in which he "strongly recommended that the brickwork, which can become loose in the not-too-distant future, be replaced as soon as possible." The report, by Alan D. Marcus of the Rand Engineering Company, described many defects and said that most of the windows on the top six floors had "cracked, bulged lintel line brickwork and joints."
But Mr. Marcus concluded that "no unsafe conditions were detected," despite the need for "precautionary repair work."
On Jan. 9, security officers at The New York Times, across the street from the hotel, found a brick chunk on the sidewalk outside the newspaper and complained to the Buildings Department that the hotel was performing masonry work without netting to protect pedestrians.
Mr. Silva said yesterday that the city could not determine whether the brick had fallen from the hotel.
Neither the hotel owner, Truong Tran, nor his lawyers at the firm of Levy, Boonshoft & Lichtenberg responded to telephone calls yesterday.
The announcement of an "emergency condition" was the latest of several alarming incidents around the city, including falling masonry at a midtown building on Madison Avenue, the collapse of a building near Times Square and the death of a 16-year-old who was struck by construction debris that fell from scaffolding at a school in Brooklyn.
In November, lawyers for the Hotel Carter complained that the demolition of a row of buildings on 42d Street to make way for a new entertainment and hotel complex was causing vibrations and cracks in the rear wall of the hotel, forcing some residents to leave. The hotel obtained a court order to halt the demolition. But that was lifted two days later, after an inspection by the Buildings Department.
The department has not found any evidence that the excavation intensified the problems with the facade, a spokeswoman, Ilyse Fink, said.
Richard M. Keilar, senior vice president of the Tishman Realty and Construction Company, the developer of the complex, said his company had observed cracks in the hotel facade before the excavation began. "We have not caused any damage to his building," Mr. Keilar said.
The Building Department, Ms. Fink said, has not determined whether the excavation caused a vacant building at 231 West 42d Street to collapse on Dec. 30, the day before 500,000 thousand people gathered nearby to ring in the new year. Ms. Fink said officials expected that investigation to take several weeks.
Mr. Marcus's report was submitted to the Buildings Department under a 1980 law that requires buildings six stories or higher to be examined by an engineer every five years. Had Mr. Marcus described the building as unsafe, instead of needing precautionary work, the department would have taken immediate action against the owner, Ms. Fink said.
Mr. Marcus was out of town yesterday. The operations director of Rand Engineering, Stephen Varone, said the building would have been designated as unsafe only if the inspector believed that the masonry was in immediate peril of falling.
Because the emergency involved only the exterior, residents were not required to leave, and no figures were available on how many remained. The Housing Preservation and Development Commissioner, Richard E. Roberts, said 23 guests went to a makeshift center a block away, including two who needed help in finding temporary housing. One other person, a tourist, was referred to a hotel, said Chris Wood, a spokeswoman for the Red Cross.
Maureen LeRoy said she had been at the Carter for two weeks because she was unemployed and "between apartments." As Ms. LeRoy left to move in with friends, she said she was not going to miss the hotel.
"Nothing works," Ms. LeRoy said. "There's no hot water, no heat, and the sink doesn't work. I feel like I should get my money back."

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Sun Microsytems Earnings Are Stronger Than Expected

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 15

 BODY:
Sun Microsystems Inc. reported stronger-than-expected earnings for its fiscal second quarter today as the company continued to evade the Asian economic crisis and the Microsoft Corporation's relentless assault on its core market.
Sun executives said that major corporations were still choosing their work stations and servers, running their Solaris version of the Unix operating system, over Microsoft's Windows NT for the most critical tasks.
During the quarter ending last month, Sun, which is based in Palo Alto, Calif., announced plans to create a version of Solaris that would run on the Intel Corporation's forthcoming 64-bit microprocessor, and that Tele-Communications Inc., or TCI, would incorporate Sun's Java programming into its cable TV set-top box specifications. 
 "Reasonably soon, this taint of the assumption that NT is the tidal wave that will drown them is going to go away, and the second quarter is a good indication of that," said Daniel Kunstler, an analyst with J. P. Morgan. "Sun could very well be the star of this quarterly earnings season."
For the quarter, Sun made $149.4 million, or 38 cents a share, down 16 percent, from income of $178.3 million, or 46 cents a share, in the comparable period a year earlier. Earnings in the quarter reflected charges of $110.1 million related to acquisitions.
Without the charges, Sun had earnings of $223.2 million, or 57 cents a share, up 24 percent from a year earlier. Securities analysts had expected the company to earn 54 cents, according to First Call, the research firm. Revenue grew 17.7 percent, to $2.45 billion, from $2.08 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 1997.
"It was really a very, very solid performance all around," said Stephen Smith of Paine Webber. "They basically did very well at the high end of the server market, but they've just launched a new desktop product line, and yet that business held up well during the quarter as well."
Sun Microsystems stock closed today at $43.0625, up 75 cents, in Nasdaq trading of nearly nine million shares. The company reported its results after the market closed.
Two other computing companies, Digital Equipment and Unisys, reported mixed results, with Digital modestly above Wall Street expectations, and Unisys about 2 cents short, not including a one-time charge that resulted in a loss.
For its second quarter, which ended on Dec. 27, Digital reported earnings of $74.8 million, or 44 cents a share, more than double the $31.9 million, or 15 cents a share, in the comparable period a year earlier. Revenue for the quarter dropped slightly to $3.32 billion, compared with $3.36 billion reported in the similar quarter the previous year.
Analysts expected Digital to earn 43 cents a share, according to First Call. The company's shares rose $1.875 to close at $39.375 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Unisys reported a net loss of $965.7 million, compared with net income of $43.6 million, or 14 cents a share, in the comparable period the year before. Revenue rose 4.8 percent, to $1.90 billion, from $1.81 billion in the fourth quarter of 1996.
The Unisys results reflected a one-time charge of $1.1 billion, including the write-off of $884 million in good will related to the 1986 merger of Burroughs and Sperry; $127 million mainly related to personal computer operations, and $42 million related to the conversion of $271 million in debt. Without the charge, Unisys earned 25 cents a share; analysts had expected 27 cents, according to First Call. Its shares declined 68.75 cents to close at $15.375.

HEADLINE: Arabs Want Israel to Feel U.S. Pressure

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: DAMASCUS, Syria, Jan. 15

 BODY:
With the Israeli Government taking a tougher stand on Middle East peace, Arab leaders are making clear their hope that President Clinton will use a meeting in Washington next week to take unparalleled steps to persuade Israel to change course.
In private conversations, President Hafez al-Assad of Syria in particular has become increasingly blunt, according to Western diplomats, in saying that Washington must turn up the heat on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel if it does not want the quest for a broader peace to collapse altogether. 
 And even in public, the usually circumspect Syrian leader has suggested that the position on any broader peace with the Palestinians that was adopted this week by the Israeli Government should have demonstrated even to Mr. Netanyahu's supporters in Washington that he has no real commitment to peace.
"It is clear that the Arabs are not the ones who kill peace and the peace process, but the Israelis," Mr. Assad said here late Wednesday night after an unexpected meeting with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. "The whole world knows and says that the Arabs cling fast to the peace process; others do not."
The Egyptian Foreign Minister, Amr Moussa, has publicly warned that the situation has become so fragile that the peace effort is in danger of disintegration unless American intervention next week can produce some kind of confidence-building reconciliation between Israel and the Palestinians.
Noting that the Clinton Administration has voiced disappointment at the position taken by the Israeli Government, some prominent Syrians have even suggested in interviews that the meeting next week should serve as an occasion for Washington to use financial pressure.
They hope that Mr. Clinton will threaten to withhold some of the $3 billion in military and economic aid that is provided by the United States to Israel each year unless Israel shows a willingness to reconsider its peace stands.
The talks here between Mr. Assad and Mr. Mubarak, which were announced only as they began, were the clearest sign of a widening Arab alarm over the new Israeli stand.
Mr. Assad's spokesman, Jubran Kourieh, said today that the main focus of the talks had been "the peace process and the dangerous situation it reached because of the negative attitude of the Israeli Government."
The meeting scheduled for next Tuesday between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Netanyahu is to be followed by another on Thursday between the President and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader.
The sessions have been widely expected to focus on the perilous relations between Israel and the Palestinians. But in private meetings in Damascus with American members of Congress and other visitors in recent days, Mr. Assad has also suggested that Mr. Clinton use his time with Mr. Netanyahu to try to salvage negotiations between Israel and Syria, which have not held peace talks at all since Mr. Netanyahu took office 18 months ago.
Mr. Netanyahu has refused to resume talks under a framework worked out between Syrian negotiators and his Labor Party predecessors, which would have seen Israel withdraw fully from the Golan Heights in return for security assurances and a full peace.
The hard line that Mr. Netanyahu has taken in his separate talks with the Syrians has left Mr. Assad to publicly despair of the prospect that peace talks with Syria could ever be restarted while Mr. Netanyahu remains in office. In the past, the Syrian Government has consistently disparaged Mr. Arafat for his decision to make a separate peace with Israel, and until now Damascus has insisted that it will now take its own steps toward any peace with Israel without respect to what happens between Israel and the Palestinians.
But the sympathy felt across the Arab world for Mr. Arafat in the face of Mr. Netanyahu's treatment of him is now resonating so deeply in Syria that one Western diplomat said, "It is an open question at this point whether Assad would engage now in the absence of real progress on the Palestinian track."
At the same time, however, diplomats say Syrian officials are bristling over the neglect shown by Washington toward the Israeli-Syrian track over the last year as Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and the American special envoy, Dennis B. Ross, have devoted the bulk of their efforts in the Middle East toward trying to salvage prospects of a permanent peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
The diplomats said that Mr. Assad told a visiting American Congressional delegation last week that next week's meeting should serve as an occasion for Mr. Clinton to urge Mr. Netanyahu to be more open to the prospect of resuming talks with the Syrians in a way consistent with the conditional assurance provided by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin as early as July 1994.
It was at that time, American and Israeli officials have said, that Mr. Rabin told Secretary of State Warren Christopher that Israel would be willing to withdraw from the Golan Heights to the lines that were in place before the 1967 war in return for security assurances and the full normalization of relations between the two countries.
That assurance was the basis of talks between Syria and Israel that reached their peak at the Wye Plantation, a conference center in Maryland, in early 1996. The talks were halted after a series of bombings in Israel.

Seagate Technology Inc., the world's largest maker of disk drives for personal computers, said yesterday that it would dismiss 10 percent of its employees, or about 10,000 workers, as it struggles to cope with pressure from its competitors and a cooling market for its products.
The company announced last week that it would take $250 million in charges against its earnings for the quarter ended last month as it tried to streamline its operations. It said yesterday that the charge, equal to about 98 cents a share, would help cover the cost of the layoffs. 
 The company, which is based in Scotts Valley, Calif., did not announce how much it expected to save as a result of the cuts, saying only that it intended to explain more of the financial implications of the move when it releases its latest quarterly financial results on Tuesday.
A Seagate spokeswoman said that 1,350 of the layoffs would occur in the United States, 1,120 in Europe and the remainder -- about 7,530 -- in Asia. Most of the cuts in this country will be in California, Minnesota and Oklahoma. Ireland will bear the brunt of the European dismissals. The Asian cuts will be concentrated in Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand.
The Asian countries are already reeling from financial crises. Seagate said that a weakening of demand for its products in Asia had made a minor contribution to the need for the layoffs.
"This is necessary to realign our operation with the decline in revenue that we've experienced over the last nine months," said Donald L. Waite, Seagate's chief financial officer.
"There's been really intense competition and some oversupply in the industry," Mr. Waite said, "resulting in intense pricing pressure and a softness, particularly in what we call the high end of the business, the high-performance drives which are used for high-performance systems, work stations, mainframes."
Hard disk drives made by Seagate and other companies, such as I.B.M., the Quantum Corporation and the Western Digital Corporation, are used by computers to store large amounts of information even when the machines are turned off. Hard disk drives generally cannot be removed as easily as the small disks that most computer users can insert into the front of a personal computer.
The disk drive industry in general has been battered since around the middle of last year because of severe overcapacity.
Yesterday's announcement was the third bit of bad news from Seagate in the last five weeks.
Twice since early December the company has warned Wall Street analysts that results for its second fiscal quarter would be disappointing. Analysts polled by Zacks, a financial research firm, estimated that Seagate would post an operating loss of 17 cents a share for the quarter.
But the price of Seagate's stock has tumbled since May, when it traded as high as $54.25. The company made the announcement yesterday after major financial markets closed. Earlier, Seagate shares rose 50 cents, to $19.625, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Analysts say many of the industry's woes are a result of aggressive expansion earlier this decade, when it appeared that the market for personal computers, and hence for disk drives, would continue to blossom.
But the PC market has not grown as quickly as anticipated, and many corporations are now directing their information technology budgets toward faster communications networks rather than toward more capable desktop machines.
Quantum announced yesterday that its quarterly earnings were 10 percent below those of the comparable period a year ago. The company said that before special charges it had earned $47 million, or 29 cents a share, down from $52.4 million, or 36 cents a share, in the comparable period of 1996.
"Demand has been just a bit softer than people had originally expected," said David Takata, an analyst for Gruntal & Company in Beverly Hills, Calif. "That alone shouldn't have thrown the industry into such a tailspin, but it coupled with the fact that everyone overbuilt in trying to capture market share."
Mr. Waite, Seagate's chief financial officer, said that the company got about 17 percent of its sales in the Far East during the quarter that ended last September. As much of Asia has careered into currency crises, slower sales there have hurt the company.
Some analysts said yesterday that job cuts could be an important step in returning Seagate to financial health.
"I'm not sure this is a blow," said Joel Pitt, a financial analyst for Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. "You've got oversupply, and under those circumstances you really have a couple of choices. One is that companies pull back and try to align themselves with the demand they're seeing. The other is that they rush headlong over a cliff trying to beat each other's brains out."

HEADLINE: An Ethnic Morass Is Returned to Croatia

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: VUKOVAR, Croatia, Jan. 15

 BODY:
There were two ceremonies today in this scared and neglected corner of Croatia.
One saw dignitaries celebrating, under heavy police security, the peaceful transfer of the last Serbian enclave in the nation to Croatian control after two years of United Nations administration. 
 The second ceremony, in a farming village called Grabovac, saw a small group of neighbors solemnly bury Emil Dragicovic, 78, a Serb who was shot to death by a Croat who had recently returned home.
The suspect is not unknown to the police: Martin Cerda, 61, was arrested in connection with the killing of another Serb on Dec. 9 with a hand grenade. Inexplicably, and despite protests by United Nations officials, Mr. Cerda was freed by Croatian authorities the day after the first attack. He was arrested again when he was found shooting at the inert body of Mr. Dragicovic.
"It is up to the Croatian authorities now," said Milos Vojnovic, a senior Serbian leader. "If they sit by as ethnic Serbs are murdered and harassed, everyone will flee. Zagreb has promised not to force Serbs from their homes, to prevent attacks against us and to let those who have homes in other parts of Croatia return. The test begins today. I am worried."
The Serbian enclave in eastern Slavonia saw some of the most savage fighting of Croatia's war to secede from Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav Army shelled Vukovar into rubble in 1991. Today, whole neighborhoods are eerily silent. Jagged walls are pock-marked with bullet and shell holes, and the city's edge resembles a lunar landscape, with craters filled with brackish water.
By the time the Serbs took control of the enclave, they had killed some 10,000 Croats, hundreds of them unarmed, and expelled another 80,000.
The return of eastern Slavonia to Croatian control was a rallying cry for the nationalist Government led by President Franjo Tudjman for six years. Zagreb was poised to seize eastern Slavonia by force in the fall of 1995, but accepted an agreement brokered by Peter W. Galbraith, then the United States Ambassador, to permit a gradual reintegration during two years of United Nations administration.
The enclave, which has some of the richest farmland in the country as well as an oil field, absorbed 60,000 Serbs who were driven out of two other enclaves taken over by the Croatian Army in early 1995. These Serbs have not, however, been allowed to return to their original homes in Croatia. Most are camped in the homes of Croats who are expected to return.
Ostoja Buncic, 66, and his wife stood forlornly outside the small city hall in the town of Ilok.
"Our papers to return came through," he said, unfolding four sheets, "but our village was burned to the ground when it was taken by the Croats. We have been given permission to return to a house that does not exist. We are scared. The owner of the house we are in is coming back. We have nowhere to go."
The Serbs who are in their own homes also worry that Zagreb will exert pressure on them to leave.
Today Marija Klajic, 48, was putting a padlock on the front of the restaurant she has owned since 1986. A painted message in the window bore greetings for the new year.
"We applied for a license to operate from the Croats and they refused to give us one," said the woman, a Serb. "This is the only way we can make a living. If these incidents continue, combined with this kind of economic pressure, Serbs will gradually pack up and go."
United Nations officials estimate that 10,000 of the 120,000 Serbs here have fled in the last few weeks.
"The dichotomy is not between ethnic groups," said Mr. Galbraith, who attended today's ceremony, "but between the urban and the rural population. The Croats from the urban areas are less likely to return. There are no jobs here; the apartments are ruined and these Croats have established a new life. The people who will come back are the peasants who have spent the last six years in miserable conditions in run-down hotels on the coast. Their farms are often intact and occupied by Serbs from other parts of Croatia. This will be the thorniest problem."
Many Croats who returned today appeared too overwhelmed to consider such complexities. "I took tranquilizers before coming back to Vukovar," said Ljubica Kubalek, 53, as she stood near the gutted city center. "I spent three months in the basement of that building over there. I can still hear the shells."

HEADLINE: McCaughey Ross Receives $2 Million From Husband

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
Lieut. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross has received a $2.25 million contribution to her gubernatorial campaign from her multimillionaire husband, giving a boost to her effort to transform herself from spurned sidekick to avenging giant-slayer by ousting Gov. George E. Pataki from office.
Ms. McCaughey Ross's campaign reported yesterday that it had $2.3 million in the bank, including the single $2.25 million donation from her husband, Wilbur L. Ross Jr., senior managing director of the New York investment bank, Rothschild Inc. The disclosure filing also showed that Ms. McCaughey Ross and Mr. Ross had paid for nearly $55,000 in campaign expenses with their own money. 
 Ms. McCaughey Ross, who switched from the Republican to the Democratic Party last fall after Mr. Pataki dropped her from his re-election ticket, now has more money in her campaign account than any of her Democratic rivals, all of whom are more seasoned. The candidate with the next highest amount, Peter F. Vallone, the City Council Speaker, has raised $2.2 million and has $1.8 million in the bank.
The $2.25 million contribution is likely to lend new credibility to Ms. McCaughey Ross's candidacy, allowing her to set up an extensive campaign apparatus and finance television commercials. Ms. McCaughey Ross, who was a political neophyte when Mr. Pataki selected her as his running mate in 1994, has been criticized as unpredictable and politically naive.
Mr. Ross has suggested in the past that he was willing to spend even more on his wife's campaign. His donation recalls other candidates who tried to bolster their campaigns by dipping into family money, including Lewis E. Lehrman, who spent more than $8 million of his own funds in the 1982 gubernatorial race. Mr. Lehrman, a Republican, narrowly lost to Mario M. Cuomo.
Under state law, candidates and their spouses are allowed to make unlimited contributions to their own campaigns, said Lee Daghlian, a spokesman for the State Board of Elections.
Ms. McCaughey Ross's spokesman, Kevin Lembo-Frey, said the $2.25 million contribution demonstrated the couple's "strong personal commitment to a campaign that would talk about how New York can do better." Mr. Lembo-Frey also noted that the campaign had received about $100,000 in other contributions.
Mr. Ross did not respond to telephone messages seeking comment. He and Ms. McCaughey Ross married in 1995.
An aide to one of Ms. McCaughey Ross's Democratic rivals, Jim Larocca, a former state transportation commissioner, attacked the contribution. "We don't believe the nomination of the Democratic Party should be up for sale," the aide, Ron Foley, said.
Mr. Pataki's office did not respond to requests for comment.
None of the Democrats have raised as much as Mr. Pataki, whose campaign formally reported yesterday that it had collected $11.8 million and had $11.2 million the bank. Mr. Pataki is believed to have taken in more money for his campaign at this point in the election cycle than has any other gubernatorial candidate in state history.
The Pataki campaign's disclosure records showed that he had received scores of donations of $5,000 or more, and several of $25,000. Individuals are allowed to give a maximum of $28,000 to a gubernatorial campaign, a ceiling far higher than the one governing most Federal and New York City elections.
Mr. Pataki received $27,500 from Carroll Petrie, the wife of the late philanthropist and retail magnate Milton Petrie; $20,000 from Ivan Seidenberg, the vice chairman of the Bell Atlantic Corporation; $25,000 from Bell Atlantic's political action committee, and $25,000 from Hushang Ansary, a former Iranian finance minister who is now a United States citizen and an oil industry executive.
Several real estate developers gave $20,000 each, including Donald J. Trump, Daniel Brodsky, Bernard H. Mendik, Burton P. Resnick, Stephen M. Ross, Larry A. Silverstein and Donald Zucker. Mr. Trump, Mr. Brodsky and Mr. Ross are separately trying to buy the New York Coliseum site, which is owned by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, an agency controlled by Mr. Pataki.
The state Republican Party, whose fund-raising operation is closely linked to Mr. Pataki's, reported similar success yesterday. The Republicans collected close to $10 million in 1997 for their various campaign funds, said Terry O'Brien, a party spokesman.
That dwarfed the amount taken in by the State Democratic Party, which has struggled to raise money since Mr. Pataki defeated Mr. Cuomo in 1994. The state Democratic Party reported raising a total of about $630,000 in 1997, said David L. Cohen, its executive director.
Among the other Democratic gubernatorial candidates, Mr. Larocca has raised $725,000 and has $365,000 in the bank. Richard Kahan, a former state economic development official, has collected $1.5 million and has $1.2 million in his account. The $1.5 million includes a $1 million personal loan that Mr. Kahan made to his campaign. Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn District Attorney, said he has $150,000 in the bank and has just begun fund-raising.
In the state comptroller's race, the incumbent, H. Carl McCall, a Democrat, has raised $3.9 million and has $2.8 million the bank. No Republican challengers have entered the contest so far.
Dennis C. Vacco, the State Attorney General, a Republican, has collected $2.2 million for his re-election campaign and has $2.1 million in the bank.
Among his Democratic rivals, Eliot L. Spitzer has raised $1.3 million, including $1 million of his own money, and has $1.27 million in the bank. G. Oliver Koppell, who was Attorney General in 1994, has raised $515,000 and has $361,000 in his campaign account. State Senator Catherine M. Abate of Manhattan has raised $357,000 and has $306,000 on hand. And Evan Davis, who served as Mr. Cuomo's counsel, has raised $202,000, with $176,000 in the bank.

HEADLINE: Chase's Global Pit Boss;
Executive Leads Bank Into High-Stakes Markets

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
Donald H. Layton doesn't have a desk job.
On hectic days -- and there have been plenty of those lately -- Mr. Layton, the vice chairman of Chase Manhattan for global-markets business, can be found stalking the trading floor of the country's largest bank, peppering his staff with questions. As an electronic pager feeds him information about worldwide movements in currency, stock and bond prices, Mr. Layton rapidly makes what he describes as "buy-versus-dump decisions" on millions of dollars worth of financial products. 
 "What are those days like?" Mr. Layton, 47, asks rhetorically. "I don't worry about the paperwork in my in box. They consist of lots of time on the floor talking to people and late-night phone calls into Asia. Then the next morning, you're getting up early to talk to Europe -- and they're not waking me up."
Large commercial banks can no longer survive on the once-cushy, predictable business of lending to companies. Much of that business has disappeared or is only marginally profitable. As the legal wall separating traditional commercial banking from investment banking has eroded in recent years, America's big banks are staking claims in the real meat of modern financial services -- selling stocks and bonds, providing advice on mergers and acquisitions, concocting newfangled financial products and trading.
At the center of the storm are bankers like Mr. Layton, who oversees one of the most lucrative trading operations in the world.
"We tell our people around here: 'Don't say you're a banker. Say you're a businessman who works for a bank,' " he said. "We are in a highly competitive financial-services business, and we have to be tough competitors."
And as financial markets worldwide have cartwheeled in recent months, primarily because of wrenching economic problems that are still sweeping across Southeast Asia, executives like Mr. Layton have played crucial roles in determining the level of international confidence in far-flung places like Thailand, Argentina and the Czech Republic. For example, Chase is a key player in international bankers' attempts to repackage a mountain of short-term debt threatening to topple the economy of South Korea. The latest proposal, however, is meeting with resistance. Page 4.
Entering the high-octane world of securities has been difficult for many banks, not only because it is uncharted territory but also because giant firms that have been in these rich fields for decades are quite able to defend their turf. At the top of the heap are firms like Merrill Lynch, Goldman, Sachs and Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company. Meanwhile, the globalization of financial services, and the often precarious financial links this creates among dozens of countries, makes the challenge much more complicated.
Chase's ability to remain competitive, and profitable, in such unpredictable markets will continue to test the bank -- and Mr. Layton.
In an industry dominated by large egos and hardball tactics, Mr. Layton has drawn praise for his easygoing nature and accessibility. "He's very, very capable," said David Berry, a banking analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. "He's common-sensical, straightforward and not caught up in his own rhetoric and pomposity."
He has also made a name for himself by making his department a nimble exception in a bank that despite its vast resources is still regarded in many ways by analysts as an elephant that can't dance. Chase's corporate banking business -- made up of Mr. Layton's trading business and the syndicated-lending operation overseen by James B. Lee -- was nearly twice as profitable in 1996 as consumer banking, which was roughly equal in revenue. And it had pretax earnings that were nearly three times greater than all of the profits of international giants like France's Societe Generale S.A. and Japan's Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd.
Mr. Layton talks openly about the strategic directions he would like Chase to take. He says that Chase intends to expand its presence in stock underwriting and sales but that the bank can afford to wait for the right opportunity. He cited Paine Webber Inc. as a brokerage firm Chase might consider buying.
But that is for another day. For now, trading is similar to riding a roller coaster, and the going has not been easy for Chase recently. It suffered a $160 million trading loss in October, primarily related to a battering it took in Brazilian and Russian markets, where the value of bonds issued by those nations nose-dived sharply and unexpectedly. As of late September, the bank also had about $4 billion in loans to Korea, the most of any American bank.
Part of Chase's exposure to South Korea includes highly volatile derivatives -- financial products that derive their value from an underlying asset like a stock or a currency -- which fall under Mr. Layton's purview. He declines to talk specifically about the economic problems in South Korea, other than to say that he thinks they represent a crisis of confidence that will soon pass and, if contained, do not represent a serious threat to Chase's well-being.
It is a testament to the strength of the business Mr. Layton has built that a $160 million trading loss, while extremely painful, can still be absorbed. When the bank reports its fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday, analysts are expecting much lower trading numbers than Chase has been used to in recent years but no great surprises.
Even so, the results are likely to contrast with the performance of Chase's global-markets business in the first nine months of this year, when it earned $898 million, or 32 percent of Chase's overall profits -- evidence of how much the once-staid banking business has changed.
Trading in three categories -- foreign currencies, interest rate contracts and bonds, especially emerging-markets bonds -- contributed $1.91 billion of the $2.59 billion in revenue that Chase's global-markets business brought in during the first three quarters of 1997. Mr. Layton refers to this troika as his "gorillas" and says he wants to bring other trading lines into their company. This includes underwriting United States bonds.
Mr. Layton predicts that Chase will break into the top tier, or the "bulge bracket" as it is known on Wall Street, of American bond underwriters within two years. Chase is already the eighth-largest underwriter of investment-grade bonds and the fourth-largest underwriter of highly lucrative junk bonds. But the bank's goal is to be among the top three companies in any business it is in because that is where most of the profits are.
"Don has had a very consistent view of how he wants to build that business at Chase," said Judah Kraushaar, a Merrill Lynch banking analyst. "It starts with a commitment to Chase's customers. He approaches it like a solid businessman and not like a gunslinging trader."
Of course, trading will always involve a certain amount of gunslinging. In 1994, Victor Gomez, a currency trader working for Mr. Layton at what was then Chemical Bank, lost $66 million through unauthorized and erroneous bets on the direction of the Mexican peso. Mr. Gomez was sentenced last year to 37 months in prison for conspiring to defraud Chemical by falsifying records.
Despite episodes like these, Mr. Layton is regarded as a sober-minded and cautious executive who carries out his duties with far less flamboyance than another heavyweight at the bank, Mr. Lee.
As Chase's vice chairman of investment banking, Mr. Lee runs the bank's enormous syndicated-lending business, which arranges loans for big companies and then parcels out the pieces to other banks. The two men, both of whom are driven and ambitious, compete in the same markets. For example, while Mr. Layton's currency traders may be making money on the volatility in Asia, even as his bond traders may be taking losses there, Mr. Lee oversees Chase's large loans to Asian conglomerates.
With neither executive ready to concede turf to the other, the two executives have struggled to get along. But Mr. Layton dismisses the friction between them as "normal differences of opinion."
Mr. Layton thinks the surest path to power in a big company is to take charge of a growing business -- the reason he chose trading even though it was just a small part of the banking business when he entered the industry more than two decades ago.
Mr. Layton received bachelor's and master's degrees in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1972 and then earned an M.B.A. from Harvard University in 1974. He joined the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation in 1975, which merged with the Chemical Banking Corporation in 1991. When Chemical merged with Chase in 1996, Mr. Layton, already Chemical's chief trader, was put in charge of the combined trading operation.
Although Mr. Layton is among a core group of senior Chase executives who are considered front-runners to succeed Walter V. Shipley, Chase's chief executive, current and former Chase employees say the fact that Mr. Layton is Jewish may hurt his chances. Large commercial banks have been known historically as hotbeds of anti-Semitism. Although that has changed in recent decades, Chase employees say a less pronounced bigotry still informs decisions about top jobs at many banks, including Chase. For his part, Mr. Layton brushes off the topic.
"I think in this day and age it's not an issue," he says.
Mr. Layton, ever the number cruncher, is more at ease emphasizing the profitability of his business. Chase has made a habit of comparing its profitability with that of J. P. Morgan & Company, because, more than any other former commercial bank, J. P. Morgan has made the most complete transformation into an investment bank.
J. P. Morgan makes for an easy target right now. While it has made admirable gains in the investment-banking business over the last decade, it still lags behind all of the securities giants both in terms of market share and profitability. J. P. Morgan's expenses have swelled as the bank has provided the fat salaries demanded by merger-and-acquisitions specialists and paid heavily to compete with the Merrills and Goldmans of the world in helping corporations issue stock.
Although Chase is big in bonds, it has yet to make its mark in the equities business and, at some point, will certainly pay the price of doing so. Aside from speculation about Paine Webber, bank advisers say Mr. Shipley, the chief executive, has a strong desire to merge with Merrill Lynch. Neither institution would comment on that point.
Still, Mr. Layton remains hungry.
"I'd like to be a gorilla," he says, "in every business known to mankind."

Chart: "Placing Its Bets"
Chase Manhattan has become one of the most aggressive American banks by going beyond traditional corporate lending to take greater risks in issuing foreign debt, trading in currencies and concocting newfangled financial products. Much of this rish-taking has paid off handsomely; sometimes it has not. Here are a few examples of Chase's 1997 deals.
1. The bank rang up heavy trading losses in Brazil when the price of Government-issues bonds fell sharply. It led a $4 billion bond deal in Venezuela, the largest global bond offering ever.
2. It handled several big bond offerings in Britain, Turkey and Greece, some for more than $500 million.
3. In Russia, the bank handled a $200 million bond offering for Vneshtorgbank but also suffered millions of dollars in trading losses.
4. The bank will not talk about its trading exposure in Asia, but it is the largest American lender in South Korea, with about $4 billion outstanding.

HEADLINE: Public Still Backs Abortion, But Wants Limits, Poll Says

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG with JANET ELDER 

 BODY:
Twenty-five years and nearly 30 million abortions after the Supreme Court's landmark Roe v. Wade decision, the American public still largely supports legalized abortion but says it should be harder to get and less readily chosen, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows.
At base, the country remains irreconcilably riven over what many consider the most divisive American issue since slavery, with half the population considering abortion murder, the poll found. Despite a quarter-century of lobbying, debating and protesting by the camps that call themselves "pro-choice" and "pro-life," that schism has remained virtually unaltered. 
 But beneath that basic divide, public opinion has shifted notably away from general acceptance of legal abortion and toward an evolving center of gravity: a more nuanced, conditional acceptance that some call a "permit but discourage" model.
Almost half of those polled said it was too easy to get an abortion these days. Public support for legal abortion plummets from 61 percent if it is performed in the first three months of a woman's pregnancy to only 15 percent in the second three months. And a few reasons sometimes given for choosing abortion have become less persuasive.
In 1989, for example, when people were asked whether a pregnant woman should be able to get a legal abortion if her pregnancy would force her to interrupt her career, 37 percent said yes and 56 percent said no; in 1998, only 25 percent said yes and 70 percent said no. Similarly, in 1989, 48 percent thought an interrupted education was enough to justify a teen-age girl's abortion; that dropped to 42 percent this year.
Support remained overwhelming, however, for women who sought abortions because they had been raped, their health was endangered, or there was a strong chance of a defect in the baby.
The survey, which was the first New York Times/CBS News Poll devoted to abortion since 1989, was based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 10 to 12 with 1,101 people around the country and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Overall, since 1989 supporters of generally available legal abortion have slipped from 40 percent to 32 percent and the ranks of those who say it should be available but stricter have increased to 45 percent from 40 percent. The contingent who said abortion should not be permitted comprised 18 percent in 1989 and is now at 22 percent.
The public's attitude toward abortion largely lines up with President Clinton's phrase that abortions should be "safe, legal and rare," said Elizabeth Adell Cook, a professor of government at the University of Maryland and co-author of "Between Two Absolutes," (Westview Press, 1992), an analysis of public opinion on abortion.
Studies indicate an emerging consensus that "it should be allowed under some circumstances but it isn't to be taken too lightly," Dr. Cook said in an interview Wednesday. "People think if there's a serious enough reason, it's O.K., but if they don't think the reason is compelling enough, they think it's wrong."
That willingness to judge applies even close to home, the poll found. Among the 58 percent of respondents who said someone they knew well had undergone an abortion, 30 percent said they thought it was the right thing to do, but 24 percent said they believed it was wrong.
At work is the search for a compromise between two views -- that abortion is murder and that it is a woman's right -- that seem absolutely contradictory and yet so powerful that they often coexist within the same person.
In responses so paradoxical that they astound even experts like Dr. Cook, one third of the poll's respondents who said they considered abortion to be murder also agreed that abortion is sometimes the best course in a bad situation.
As the 25th anniversary of Roe v. Wade approaches, 60 percent of the poll's respondents said they thought the ruling, which established a woman's constitutional right to abortion, was a good thing.
But many had to be told first what the decision entailed. Despite the decades-old fervor surrounding the abortion debate, nearly 45 percent of those asked the status of abortion law either gave the wrong answer, said they did not follow the issue enough to know, or simply gave no answer.
That could be in part because the picture has become more complicated since Roe v. Wade. In 1989, another Supreme Court decision permitted states to whittle away at the edges of Roe v. Wade by passing restrictions on abortion like a 24-hour waiting period. More than 30 states have passed such laws.
The Times/CBS News Poll indicates that those new state laws tap a significant vein of public opinion. Nearly 80 percent of respondents supported both parental consent and waiting periods.
In general, however, the abortion issue seems to have only limited political resonance these days. Just over half the respondents said they did not think it necessary to know a public official's position on abortion.
Such indications that abortion is becoming less of a political issue and more of a private, moral one jibe with the belief expressed by nearly 60 percent of those polled that the Government should stay out of decisions on whether abortion should be legal. And the idea of a constitutional amendment banning abortions appears supremely unpopular: more than three-quarters opposed it.
Roger Rosenblatt, an essayist who distilled the "permit but discourage" idea in his book, "Life Itself: Abortion in the American Mind," (Random House, 1992) said it was to be expected that the American public would move toward limiting abortion -- but only in the moral arena, not the political one.
"Sooner or later you're going to have a system where you say, 'One simply doesn't do that, one simply doesn't cavalierly have an abortion,' " he said in an interview yesterday. "It's not against the law, but one simply doesn't do it, or if one does it, one recognizes the moral digression."
The question of whether women often have abortions "cavalierly" appears to be having a powerful influence on changes in attitudes.
Among people polled who offered a reason for why most women have abortions, 49 percent said that reason was not serious enough to justify an abortion, up from 41 percent in 1989.
Along those same lines, sympathy has dwindled for women who seek an abortion because they do not want to marry the father. In 1989, 50 percent said they did not think such a woman should be able to get a legal abortion; now, 62 percent hold that position.
Those and other findings appear to indicate that the country's growing experience with legal abortions -- more than 1 million are performed each year -- is not leading to growing sympathy or acceptance.
"It's too easy an out for these women," said Sharon Paasch, 44, a records clerk in Caledonia, Wis., in a follow-up interview after the poll. "I don't think they're accepting the responsibility of sex before they have it. If you're going to have sex, you better prevent having a baby if you don't want it. I think you should accept the responsibility and the consequences of your actions, and not look to being bailed out by having an abortion afterwards."
Neither age nor a person's sex appeared to have an effect on people's current views on abortion.
In contrast, people's attitudes toward abortion appeared to depend so profoundly on the circumstances surrounding it that for some, the circumstances even determine whether it is murder.
"A teen-ager who is unable to take care of the child, that would be a reason for it -- she's still a child herself," said Stephanie Mendez, a 25-year-old student in Brooklyn. But "if it's an adult in that situation, then I think it's murdering a child."
Motivation is a nebulous thing, however; it was about timing that Americans expressed their clearest sense of a hierarchy of sin.
Sixty-one percent said they thought abortions should be permitted during the first three months of pregnancy, up from 50 percent in 1982; but that support dwindled to 15 percent in the second three months and just 7 percent in the third.
That looming gap helps explain why the opponents of abortion have chosen a form of abortion they refer to as partial-birth abortion as a rallying point in Congress.
While the emphasis on partial-birth abortion has worked as a political tactic, however, it does not appear to have penetrated far into the national consciousness. A majority had heard nothing or not much about the partial-birth debates.
As for the current effort by some anti-abortion Republicans to convince the party that only candidates who support a ban on partial-birth abortions should receive campaign money, Republicans who were polled appeared split. Forty-nine percent opposed the idea while 43 percent supported it.
In general, Republicans were likelier to think the party should oppose legal abortion than support it. Thirty-seven percent endorsed its opposition while 26 percent thought the party should support legal abortion.
Democrats who were polled, meanwhile, strongly backed their party's support for legal abortion.
But about one-third of both Democrats and Republicans thought their parties should take no stand on the issue, once again showing unwillingness to turn abortion into a political issue. And even a politician with President Clinton's approval ratings -- generally well above 50 percent on issues like the economy and foreign policy -- gets caught in the divide on abortion: only 38 percent approve of his handling of abortion, while 29 percent disapprove.
The importance of timing also appeared to bode well for public acceptance of new techniques that allow a woman to end a pregnancy much earlier than before.
People know little about "morning-after pills," hormones that women can take up to 72 hours after sex to prevent a fertilized egg from developing, the poll found. But 65 percent of respondents said they would be likely to consider them a form of birth control rather than abortion. Less than one-fifth said they would consider use of the morning-after pills to be a form of abortion.
Similarly, respondents appeared receptive to the idea of a drug-induced abortion, now possible in the first seven weeks of pregnancy using a combination of drugs called RU-486, as an alternative to surgical abortion. Though nearly 70 percent said they had heard little about RU-486, 50 percent said they would favor its use as an alternative to surgical abortion, while 36 percent said they would oppose it.
Several aspects of American popular thinking on abortion appear to directly defy the work that advocates on both sides of the issue have been doing for so many years. Neither side of the fight has capitalized on the public's concern with the timing of an abortion -- abortion rights advocates because they focused mainly on the sanctity of a woman's right to choose, and abortion foes because they focused on the sanctity of the life of a fetus of any age.
If advocates on both sides have made little progress, it could be partly because of their image. Forty-four percent of respondents said they thought the anti-abortion advocates in their states were extremists, the same level as in 1989. Their image of abortion rights advocates, always somewhat better had slightly improved. In 1989, 57 percent said they thought most abortion rights advocates in their state were reasonable; that rose to 66 percent in 1998.
The closest thing the American public comes to a consensus on abortion is in its predictions on the intractability of the conflict. A whopping 88 percent said they did not believe the disagreements between supporters and opponents of legal abortion would ever be resolved.
"It's not an issue that's necessarily based on black and white facts," said Rick, a 41-year-old engineer in Blue Rock, Ohio, who asked that his last name be omitted. "It's a moral decision and I don't think the two sides will ever come together."
 
How the Poll Was Conducted
 The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 10 to 12 with 1,101 adults throughout the United States.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges across the country.
Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
For smaller subgroups the potential sampling error is larger. For example, for women as a group it is plus or minus four percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variations in question wording or the order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat different results.

China's Central Bank Vows to Hold Yuan Rate

BYLINE: Agence France-Presse 

 BODY:
The governor of China's central bank pledged today to hold the exchange rate of the Chinese currency stable amid the crisis sweeping other Asian currencies. The governor, Dai Xianglong, also said that while interest rates would be adjusted sometime this year, there were plans for an immediate cut in rates. 
 The Chinese currency, the yuan, is used only for trade, and is thus not freely available to investors. That, and the fact that China's markets are relatively small, have insulated the country from the cash outflows that have rocked Asian markets. Mr. Dai said China would overcome the effects of the Asian crisis to maintain economic growth of around 8 percent this year, down from 8.8 percent in 1997. Mr. Dai's comments echoed those of Deputy Prime Minister Zhu Rongji on Wednesday. Mr. Dai also said that China would continue to support the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the United States dollar.

Hire Foreign Workers

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Software Jobs Go Begging, Threatening Technology Boom" (front page, Jan. 13) explores the United States' woefully inadequate supply of computer professionals. Demand far outstrips the supply of talent, and unless we can fill all the positions, our industry and economy will be stifled. There is an immediate solution to the problem. Employers can hire qualified foreign nationals on temporary work visas. 
 But Congress must raise the artificially imposed cap of 65,000 of such visas issued each year. This cap was reached last year months before the fiscal year ended. If our Government recognized the value such foreign workers bring to our economy, it would eliminate the cap entirely and allow American businesses and industries the human capital they need to keep growing.

HEADLINE: TELEVISION REVIEW;
Squeezing Companies For Profit

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
Hedrick Smith begins "Surviving the Bottom Line," his four-part report on the American economy, with an incisive look at the way a few Wall Streeters go about making enormous profits at the expense of many Main Streeters. "Running With the Bulls," which can be seen at the uninviting hour of noon tomorrow in the New York area, focuses on big players whose single-minded goal is to extract the most money from the companies they take over regardless of what that means for workers, communities and business ethos.
What it means is seen through the tactics of two multimillionaires, Michael Price, a mutual fund operator who forced the merger of Chase and Chemical Banks, and Albert J. Dunlap, a hired gun who has made fortunes for himself and stockholders by downsizing businesses, cutting wages and dismissing workers. They say they are compelling stodgy corporate managers to bring investors higher returns, which as they see it is what capitalism is all about. 
 Critics of such high fliers note that most Americans have not benefited from the booming market, that the truly big gainers are the richest 1 percent of investors, like Mr. Price, seen playing polo, and Mr. Dunlap, seen living it up in his mansion. These men are not bothered by being called predators. Their strategy -- "a cut-and-run technique," Mr. Smith calls it -- is to turn as quick and big a profit as possible, never mind the consequences for those who can't afford to play the game or are left stranded by it.
A cautionary if untypical tale is offered about one company that apparently pushed cost-cutting past the danger point. The program says that Valujet, a bare-bones airline, became a Wall Street favorite while it scrimped on service, experience, maintenance and safety. A 1996 accident in which 110 people died brought improvements, but by then the speculators had cashed in and turned to new opportunities.
In the second hour, "Living on the Fault Line," Mr. Smith draws attention to the problems of workers in once-booming San Diego who have lost full-time careers and had to settle for temporary jobs. And the series ends with happier examples of educational reforms and cooperative efforts to make the economy work in more humane ways. Mr. Smith's hope is that capitalism need not be a fang-and-claw operation.
As for the prospects for serious journalism on public television, being consigned to noon on Sunday is nothing to be bullish about.

HEADLINE: Industrial Production Ends the Year Strong

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 16

 BODY:
Industrial production increased half a percent in December, the 14th consecutive monthly gain, and 5 percent in the full year, the Federal Reserve said today.
December's gain, which followed an increase in November of eight-tenths of 1 percent, reflected "widespread increases among most major market and industry groups," the Fed said. However, "the overall gain in output was held back a bit by a decline in motor vehicle production, which had been quite high in November." 
 Auto and truck production decreased 3.4 percent in the month. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, industrial production rose seven-tenths of 1 percent in December.
The 5 percent increase in 1997 exceeded 1996's 3.5 percent gain and was the strongest annual showing since 1994.
The plant-use rate, which measures the amount of industrial capacity in use, increased to 83.4 percent in December, its highest level since September 1995. November's rate was revised to 83.3 percent from the 82.2 percent reported initially.
Despite the healthy production figures, Asia's financial crisis "should eventually cool off the manufacturing sector" in 1998, Anthony Chan, chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation, said in a recent research report. Demand for exports will decline in Asian countries, and American producers will have to contend with inexpensive imports and the strong dollar.
In another measure of the economy, the University of Michigan's preliminary index of consumer confidence in January rose to 104 from 102.1 last month.
