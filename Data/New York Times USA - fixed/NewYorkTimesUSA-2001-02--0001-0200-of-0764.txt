HEADLINE: A New Way of Verifying Old and Familiar Sayings 

BYLINE:  By KATIE HAFNER 

 BODY:
THE power and reach of online reference materials are a boon to today's scholars and researchers. One intellectual gumshoe who is especially grateful for the advent of electronic resources is Fred Shapiro, an expert on quotations who is compiling the forthcoming Quotations: The Yale Dictionary.
 The volume is intended to compete with Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, the longstanding reference work of choice when it comes to checking the sources of writings and remarks. 
 Mr. Shapiro, who is an associate librarian at Yale Law School and works on the project in his spare time, has been at it for a year. He said the book would be published sometime in the next few years by Yale University Press. 
The book will take a long time to compile, but not nearly as long as it would take without the electronic databases Mr. Shapiro has come to depend on. 
For years, Mr. Shapiro, 46, carried out his work the old-fashioned way. 
As an expert not only on famous quotations but also on words, phrases and legal citations, he used to spend hours and days at a time in research libraries, poring over books, journals, newspapers and periodicals for the origins of particular words and phrases. "Now it's done in a few seconds," he said.
Mr. Shapiro relies mainly on a database called Jstor, a digitized, searchable collection of scores of scholarly journals that go back to 1665.
"They have the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London back to the beginning," he said, "so you can see Isaac Newton's original papers. You can search a quotation and will see hundreds of years of material, and will see when it was first used."
Mr. Shapiro has been preoccupied with quotations since he was 10, when his father gave him a copy of Bartlett's. As an undergraduate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he gravitated toward language and literature and edited a quotation page in a student newspaper.
Although he received a law degree from Harvard, he practiced law only briefly before pursuing a master's degree in library science at Catholic University of America. In 1993 he edited the Oxford Dictionary of American Legal Quotations. 
Mr. Shapiro's current project is by far his most ambitious effort. He appears to take particular delight in using electronic resources to correct Bartlett's, his tome's archrival. Using Jstor, for example, Mr. Shapiro tackled the famous quotation "There's no such thing as a free lunch," which Bartlett's attributes to the economist Milton Friedman, who used the saying for a book of his that was published in 1975.
Mr. Shapiro's research unearthed a 1952 mention in the journal Ethics, which referred to Professor Alvin Hansen's "famous TINSTAAFL formula -- 'There is no such thing as a free lunch.' "
Justin Kaplan, the general editor of Bartlett's, reacted with equanimity toward his new competitor. "Isn't that interesting," Mr. Kaplan said upon hearing of the misattributed "free lunch" quotation. "Well, that's a valuable correction." 
Mr. Kaplan's own research methods remain decidedly low-tech, he said, even as he prepares the 17th edition of Bartlett's, scheduled for publication in 2002.
Aside from movie databases, which he uses to check quotations from films, Mr. Kaplan said he relied mostly on printed sources.
In addition to Jstor, Mr. Shapiro uses a free service called Making of America, which is maintained by Cornell University and the University of Michigan; a service called Literature Online; a database of legal quotations called HeinOnline; and Lexis-Nexis.
Mr. Shapiro is also a frequent visitor to a Usenet newsgroup called alt.quotations. 
"You can see what the popular stuff is," he said. "By using these state-of-the-art methods, I can be more thorough about reaching into this popular culture of things that might not be familiar to literary people and academics but are out there and very popular."
Many popular quotations these days are related to the computer culture, Mr. Shapiro said. 
Consider the quotation "information wants to be free," a rallying catchphrase for the computer-adept and copyright foes. Mr. Shapiro traced the phrase to Stewart Brand, creator of The Whole Earth Catalog, who said it at the first Hackers Conference in 1984.
Mr. Shapiro has also explored the origin of the term "personal computer." The Oxford English Dictionary says the term originated in 1976, but using Jstor, Mr. Shapiro found a 1968 Hewlett-Packard advertisement referring to some of the company's calculators as personal computers.
The computer world is also rife with apocryphal quotations and lore, Mr. Shapiro said. 
For instance, Kenneth Olsen, the founder of the Digital Equipment Corporation, is often cited as having once made a remark that is now considered scandalously shortsighted: "There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in their home."
And when talking about requirements for PC memory, Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, is often cited as having said in 1981 that "640K ought to be enough for anybody." PC's now routinely contain at least 64 megabytes of memory, thanks in large measure to the huge amounts of memory required to run most Microsoft applications.
But Mr. Shapiro said he suspected that both quotations were fabrications. "From what I know about quotations, there are just some that smell of apocryphalness," he said. "You can almost tell without looking into it that some of them are phony."
Mr. Shapiro conceded that the ease with which he could do his job now occasionally felt like cheating. "In my youth I was an expert at traditional types of research," he said. "Now there's an element of it being a little too easy. You feel it's not your own talents as much as the talents of the databases."
Mr. Shapiro has also put up a Web site for the book (www.quotationdictionary.com). People can go there to contribute quotations, in the unlikely event that Mr. Shapiro overlooked one.

HEADLINE: Clorox Profit Fell 7.5% in Quarter as Sales Sagged 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., Jan. 31 

 BODY:
The Clorox Company said today that its second-quarter profit fell 7.5 percent because it sold fewer Glad bags, Brita water filters and other consumer products.
 Profit from operations fell to $74 million, or 31 cents a share, compared with $80 million, or 33 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales fell 6 percent, to $899 million from $954 million. 
 Analysts had expected the company to earn 30 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
A charge of $10 million, or 4 cents a share, to write down the value of some inventory resulted in net income of $64 million, or 27 cents a share. A charge of $4 million, or 1 cent a share, related to restructuring resulted in net income of $76 million, or 32 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier.
Shares of Clorox, based here, rose 60 cents, to $33.75.
Sales of water filters fell 25 percent as a slowing economy hurt demand and prompted retailers to cut inventories, Clorox officials said in a conference call. Sales of plastic bags and wraps fell 8 percent when some people switched to cheaper brands, while STP and other auto products fell 11 percent as higher gas prices prompted drivers to cut purchases of fuel additives, they said.
"Consumers are tightening their belts," said Franklin Morton, director of research for Ariel Capital Management, which owns about 850,000 shares of Clorox. "Growth in sales in a lot of the household-product categories has slowed."
Clorox said in December that profit would fall for the first time in more than a year and that earnings for its 2001 fiscal year ending June 30 would not increase.
G. Craig Sullivan, the chief executive of Clorox, said sales were also hurt by marketing mishaps after the $2 billion purchase of the First Brands Corporation, whose lines included Glad and STP. The purchase two years ago was the largest in Clorox's 88-year history.

HEADLINE: Tokyo Journal; 
The Japanese, It Seems, Are Outgrowing Japan

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 31 

 BODY:
Using marble friezes, colorful tiles, ubiquitous elevators and reputedly earthquake-proof design, the builders of the Oedo-sen, Tokyo's newest subway line and the pride of the system, would seem to have thought of everything.
 Everything, that is, except the comfort of Yohei Kawana and the swelling ranks of young riders like him whose height make the subway's cars, whose ceilings are about two inches lower than Tokyo's other subways, a bit uncomfortable. 
 "The Oedo-sen is so small that practically all I can see is the ceiling, and that is really annoying," said Mr. Kawana, a junior at Waseda University. "I heard that for some reason they made the doorways a little taller than in the other subways, and the ceilings a little lower, and that was a big mistake. It just takes a second to get on, but your ride can last for several minutes." 
At 6 feet 3 inches, Mr. Kawana has spent his young lifetime adjusting, often painfully, to things made for people much shorter than he. "I was so tall in junior high school that the desks and chairs were way too small for me," he said. "This caused such bad backaches that I often had to go to the nurse for massages."
Japan has been compulsively measuring itself against the West in economic, military and social terms at least since 1853, when Commodore Perry sailed into Edo Bay to demand that the closed country open itself up to foreign trade. For the last decade this habit has been a relentlessly depressing experience, as the economy pf Japan has stagnated while that of the United States has boomed. 
Just this month came the news that Japan's long-forecast demographic implosion has finally begun to materialize in the form of the smallest class entering elementary school since the statistics were first kept, in 1946.
But lost in the gloomy news, and even ignored by many here, is one measurement by which the reputedly diminutive Japanese have been closing the gap impressively with Westerners: height. In 50 years, according to statistics kept by the Ministry of Education, the average height of Japanese 11-year-olds has increased by more than 5 1/2 inches. The height of girls, who grow faster at that age, meanwhile, has increased even more. 
So far, there has been no definitive explanation for the increased growth, but it is widely believed to be caused by improvements in diet and the elimination of once-common infectious diseases, both expressions of Japan's swift postwar economic rise. According to one recent study, for instance, intake of animal protein has doubled to 60 grams a day since 1960.
The ultimate implication of these statistics -- much taller Japanese people -- is borne out in the experience of Mr. Kawana and many other young people seen these days on the streets of Tokyo. It is also corroborated by a variety of government and private studies that not only show Japanese people to be growing much larger than before, but also indicate changes in people's conceptions of beauty and ideal body type.
"In the past 20 to 30 years, the average height has increased by 5 centimeters, based on the much faster growth of people born between 1940 and 1960," said Makiko Kouchi, an anthropologist who is research group leader at the National Institute of Bioscience and Human Technology. "The body weight of men has stayed the same as the height, meaning that physiques of men have remained pretty much the same. Women's body weights have not increased in pace with their heights, though, with the result that women have become much, much slimmer."
The vogue for thinness among Japanese women has clearly caught on, as even a quick glance at the twiggy women who appear on popular television variety shows will attest. But taller young people here complain that the Japanese idea of themselves as a short people has not kept pace with reality, resulting in a frequently inconvenient mismatch.
"The old Japanese industrial standards no longer fit Japanese life," said Matsutaro Yoshioka, research and development director of the Research Institute of Human Engineering for Quality Life, a quasi-governmental group that sells data about the characteristics of consumers to industry. "The standard cooking table, for example, only fits the older generations. We are trying to measure the younger generation so as to advise Japanese corporations how to meet their needs."
The most obvious area where this mismatch is encountered is in clothing. Japan's clothing manufacturers still tend to offer few goods to those on the taller end of the scale. The problem goes well beyond clothes, though, and extends to furniture, automobile design and train seats, too. (A disclosure: at 6-foot-4, this reporter is familiar with the issue.)
"The way my house was built, everything is very low," said Akiko Ikeguchi, another Waseda University student who, at about 5-foot-7, is roughly two inches taller than average for her age. "The kitchen counter is so low I have to bend over all the time to do the dishes. I've got the same problem on the train or on airplanes: the seating space is too small."
But for many of today's taller young Japanese, the envy of others compensates nicely for such inconveniences.
"I used to have a real complex about my height, but I don't feel that way anymore," said Asami Shikano, a 19-year-old freshman at Kagawa Nutrition University. At nearly 5-foot-8 1/2, she said, her striking height is often a source of attraction for men and wonder for women.
"Sometimes, in a crowd, people will turn back to stare at me from top to bottom, and that can be a bit annoying," Ms. Shikano said, laughing. "But men and women are always telling me how jealous they are. They ask me what my secret is, whether I ate a lot of meat, or whether it was sleeping a lot that helped me grow."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
Seven lessons about Super Bowl ticket prices.

BYLINE:  By Alan B. Krueger; This column appears here every Thursday. Alan B. Krueger is the Bendheim Professor of Economics and Public Affairs at Princeton University and editor of The Journal of Economic Perspectives. E-mail: akrueger@princeton.edu

 BODY:
 YOU can learn a lot about economics just by studying the price of Super Bowl tickets. Here is what I learned from attending Super Bowl XXXV with my father, Norman, and conducting a small survey with the help of four interviewers.

LESSON 1 -- If the price is set artificially low, there will be excess demand. The face value listed on most Super Bowl tickets this year was $325. This price was much too low to balance demand with the limited supply.
 The National Football League held a lottery for 500 pairs of tickets and was flooded with 36,000 applicants -- the odds of being admitted to Princeton are better. On game day, hundreds of frustrated fans displayed "Ticket Wanted" signs and offered $1,500 and up for tickets outside the stadium.

LESSON 2 -- If the price is set artificially low, a secondary market will develop. The secondary market in this case involves scalpers, licensed ticket brokers and online auctions. About half the states regulate the resale of sports tickets in some way. Still, tickets are often resold. A week before the Super Bowl, tickets on Yahoo Auctions traded for $1,500 to $3,500.
To economists, scalping creates value, as Steven Happel and Marianne Jennings of Arizona State eloquently argue in the Cato Journal. Although people sometimes make mistakes, those who voluntarily buy and sell tickets do so only because they feel they benefit from the transaction. Scalpers facilitate such trades. Fans seem to agree: two-thirds of the 316 fans we surveyed said ticket scalping should be legal.

LESSON 3 -- Ticket prices in the secondary market vary widely. One fan we spoke to paid a scalper $1,000 while another paid $3,500 for tickets in the same section of the upper deck. Even tickets in Web auctions sold for varying prices on the same day.
This phenomenon has been observed in many auctions. For example, Orley Ashenfelter, a Princeton economist, found that identical lots of wine sell for lower prices in later rounds of an auction.
At the Super Bowl, however, the supply of tickets dried up a few days before kickoff. The fear of this happening might explain why prices often decline in auctions: those who want something the most buy early in case it will not be available later, and pay a premium to avoid the risk.

LESSON 4 -- The N.F.L. could increase short-term profit by charging more, but probably at the expense of long-term profit. In view of the excess demand, many economists wonder why the league does not charge more for tickets. Although the face value of Super Bowl tickets has increased -- almost quadrupling since 1987, adjusted for inflation -- tickets on the secondary market still sell for $1,000 to $4,000 more than the list price. By charging a market price, the N.F.L. could increase revenue by perhaps $150 million.
Ticket prices are set by the N.F.L. commissioner's office and a group of team owners. The league keeps 25 percent of tickets, which it distributes to the media, advertisers and others; the rest go to the teams and host city to distribute, usually by lottery to season-ticket holders.
Why doesn't the N.F.L. charge more? Greg Aiello, the league's vice president for public relations, said it tries to set a "fair, reasonable price" to maintain an "ongoing relationship with fans and business associates." The N.F.L. does not want only rich aristocrats to attend the Super Bowl.
All this poses a puzzle for conventional economics. Wouldn't it be better for the N.F.L. to sell tickets at market value and give season-ticket holders and business associates some of the cash, which they could spend on whatever they wanted? Moreover, if a basic economic principle known as the Coase Theorem held, allocating tickets in a lottery at a below-market price would not determine who is in the stands -- those who want tickets the most and have the wherewithal would buy them from lottery winners. And why should the N.F.L. care who is in the stands, anyway?
But the N.F.L. knows what it is doing. In our survey, 28 percent of the fans attending the game received tickets in a lottery; 11 percent received them from the N.F.L.; and 40 percent received tickets as gifts from a company or friend. Only 20 percent paid more than face value. George Akerlof, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, has argued that many economic transactions involve "gift exchanges," and the Super Bowl is no exception.
Nearly everyone we interviewed thought it would not "be fair for the N.F.L. to raise the face value to $1,500 if that is still less than the amount most people are willing to pay for tickets." Sixty percent of the N.F.L.'s $4 billion of revenue comes from television, so image is (almost) everything.

LESSON 5 -- People are willing to keep tickets they win in a lottery, even though they would not have bought them at a market price. We asked fans who won the right to buy tickets for $325 in a lottery whether they would have been willing to pay $3,000 a ticket had they lost in the lottery, and whether they would be willing to sell their ticket for $3,000. Ninety-three percent answered no to both questions.
Richard Thaler, an economist at the University of Chicago, calls this phenomenon an "endowment effect" -- the value people place on a good increases once it is added to their possessions.
But the profile does not always fit. Before kickoff, I asked Karen McClearn, an exuberant Ravens season-ticket holder from Baltimore, whether she would have sold the tickets she and her husband obtained in the lottery if someone had offered her $4,000 apiece. She said no. She added that she might have been willing to pay up to $5,000 if she had not been selected in the lottery. When the Ravens took a 17-0 lead -- and she led the crowd in the Raven's bird dance -- however, she volunteered that her ticket was now worth much more than $5,000.

LESSON 6 -- Although football fans are subject to biases in judgment (like everyone else), they still take account of tax rules. Some of those auctioning tickets on eBay and Yahoo promised to donate the proceeds to charity, which makes the purchase price above the face value tax-deductible for the buyer. In these cases, tickets sold for a premium.
For example, two seats auctioned for the Boomer Esiason Foundation to fight cystic fibrosis sold for $7,300, which is an after-tax price of $4,667 at the top 39.6 percent marginal rate -- close to the typical price for a pair of tickets in the secondary market.

LESSON 7 -- Even after the game, Super Bowl tickets are valuable. Several people offered $20 for my ticket stub as we left the stadium. I could not sell. I paid too much to a licensed broker to part with it. Besides, I planned to give the stub to my children as a gift.

HEADLINE: Study Links Malnutrition to Stunted Growth of Tibet's Children 

BYLINE:  By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Jan. 31 

 BODY:
Half of all children in the Tibetan region of China suffer from stunted growth, medical problems and potentially impaired intellectual development as a result of malnutrition, according to a new study by American and Tibetan doctors. 
 The often small stature of Tibetans and others living in isolated mountain areas of Asia has sometimes been attributed to the effects of high altitude, and scientists have debated whether it signals broader health problems. But the new study, of 2,078 Tibetan children up to 7 years of age, drawn from a cross section of cities, villages and nomadic communities, found that stunting was linked to malnutrition rather than altitude and was often accompanied by bone disorders, depigmented hair, skin disorders and other diseases of malnutrition. 
 "Our data show that Tibetan children are not 'small but healthy,' " concluded the study, by researchers from the Public Health Institute in Santa Cruz, Calif., the University of California at Berkeley and the Tibet Medical Research Institute in Lhasa. "They have clinical signs of malnutrition as will as high morbidity and mortality."
The study is published in the Feb. 1 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine. 
Tibet remains one of the world's poorest places, and the medical findings call into question the Chinese government's proclamations of great economic and social progress. 
The official Tibet Daily, for example, declared on Jan. 18: "We have become a society of adequate food and clothing and have started marching towards one of relative comfort. This is a fantastic historical advance."
In recent years, China has promoted investment in Tibet and started antipoverty programs, but progress has been spotty, and Tibetans have resented the influx of ethnic Chinese, who often reap the greatest benefits. 
In the new study, 56 percent of children aged 2 to 7 had moderate or severely stunted growth, compared with international standards.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Blue Chips Manage Modest Gains After Fed Cuts Rates

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
Faced with additional signs of a weakening economy, the stock market retreated yesterday after the Federal Reserve, as expected, cut short-term interest rates by half a percentage point in an effort to revive growth.
 Blue-chip stocks managed to hold on to modest gains after trading higher earlier in the day, but technology stocks dropped. Financial stocks, which are sensitive to interest rates, also fell, in a sign that the Fed's half-point cut was already reflected in their prices. 
 "Today's number was totally baked in, so the market's snoozing after that," said John F. Powers, director for institutional sales at Robertson Stephens. "I think the Fed would be perfectly happy with a market that trended sideways to modestly up." 
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 6.16 points, to 10,887.36. But the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 7.72 points, to 1,366.01.
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 65.62 points, or 2.3 percent, to 2,772.73.
The Fed's move came as new economic data provided additional evidence of a slowdown. The government reported yesterday that the nation's gross domestic product expanded 1.4 percent in the fourth quarter, its slowest rate in five years. On Tuesday, a closely watched report showed a steep drop in the confidence of American consumers. 
There had been some speculation that the weakening economy might force the Fed to cut rates by more than half a percentage point, and some money managers and analysts said they thought the central bank would act again in the months ahead.
"The feeling is that there'll be more cuts behind this," said Jonathan Glaser, a hedge fund manager at JMG Capital Partners, a money management firm.
"Only time will tell," Mr. Glaser said, "whether the rate cuts will have the intended effect of turning the economy around and in turn strengthening corporate earnings."
The Fed said yesterday that it was cutting its target for the federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for overnight loans, to 5.5 percent from 6 percent. This is the second half-point cut in four weeks.
But the rate cuts were not enough to ignite investors interest in financial stocks. 
Citigroup fell 23 cents, to $55.97; Merrill Lynch lost $2.15, to $72.50; and American Express dropped 81 cents, to $47.10. --------------------

Treasuries Move Higher
By Reuters
Treasury bond prices rose yesterday after the Federal Reserve lowered key interest rates by a half-point for the second time this month.
The move, in line with market expectations, accelerated a rally in Treasury issues that began earlier in the session after the government reported sluggish economic growth at the end of 2000.
Members of the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee, in cutting their key overnight bank lending rate to 5.50 percent, cited eroding consumer and business confidence, weakening manufacturing and higher energy costs.
They also signaled further rate cuts were ahead, saying excessive economic weakness rather than inflation posed the pre-eminent risk to the economy in coming months.
"The Treasury market got pretty much what it was expecting with the 50 basis point cut and a statement pointing to further weakness," said Michael P. Maurer, a fixed income strategist at A.G. Edwards & Sons. (A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.) 
The 10-year Treasury note rose 26/32, to a price of 104 26/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.11 percent from 5.22 percent on Tuesday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 1 12/32, to 110 27/32. The bond's yield fell to 5.50 percent from 5.59 percent on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Coca-Cola Earnings Gain But Sales Are Lackluster 

BYLINE:  By GREG WINTER 

 BODY:
Capping off a trying year marred by layoffs, lawsuits and a tougher consumer market for sodas, the Coca-Cola Company announced a sharp rebound in fourth-quarter earnings yesterday, but its sluggish sales raised questions about whether it has enough momentum to accomplish the full turnaround it has pledged for 2001.
 Given Coke's lackluster growth of little more than 1 percent last year in soda sales in the United States, the company will have a hard time pulling off the 6 percent to 7 percent gains it has promised Wall Street, analysts said. 
 Emanuel Goldman, an analyst with ING Barings in San Francisco, expressed skepticism about whether Coke could reach the peak of its estimates. "To do seven is not exactly like climbing Mount Everest," he said, "but it is Kilimanjaro." 
For the fourth quarter, Coke's earnings met analysts' expectations, which have been tempered by patience over the wholesale revamping that it has just finished. With Coke now freed from distractions, analysts say it needs to return quickly to the type of results that drew investors like children with a sweet tooth for much of the last decade.
Yesterday's announcement suggested that a reversal in the company's fortunes may take a little longer than hoped.
Persistent weakness in foreign currencies like the euro, the South African rand and the Australian dollar caused Coke revenues -- most of which come from outside the United States -- to fall to $4.9 billion for the quarter, a drop of about 1 percent from 1999.
Despite the stagnation in sales, operating income for the quarter rose to $839 million, more than twice what it was in the year before, when the company endured a huge write-off of its assets in India.
With fewer such exceptional charges, and a somewhat unexpected lift from investments in its bottlers, Coke's net income for the quarter reached $242 million, compared with a $45 million loss for the similar period the previous year. The company met analysts' revised earnings expectations of 38 cents a share, up from 31 cents a share in the fourth quarter of 1999.
In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the value of Coke's stock rose 9 cents a share yesterday, to $58. 
Though an improvement over the company's performance earlier last year, the results signaled a slowing of the momentum that Coke began to build in the third quarter of 2000, when net income rose 26 percent. 
But by December, it became apparent the company's sales volume, a critical measure of how much soft-drink makers persuade consumers to buy, would rise only 4.4 percent for the year, falling short of the 5 to 6 percent target Coke officials steadfastly defended for much of 2000.
"We almost delivered on that," Gary Fayard, Coke's chief financial officer, said in a conference call with analysts and reporters yesterday. "And we did it in the face of restructuring the business, putting a new management team in place and settling a discrimination lawsuit."
Eager to put the turmoil of 2000 behind them, Coke officials said that they would concentrate this year on "getting Coke in the right place," principally through the kind of assertive marketing campaigns that Coke was once known for, but has been failed to stage in recent years.
In the last two months, Coke has turned to a single collection of agencies, the Interpublic Group of Companies, to bring coherence to what had been a diffuse, and often confusing, advertising strategy. Investors have been eagerly anticipating the next wave of commercials, hoping it will help end the inertia in soda sales. But the beginning of the campaign is still several months away.
"We're going at 180 miles an hour to get it out there," Jack L. Stahl, Coke's president, said.
Coke officials also said that they would continue to pursue their forays into noncarbonated beverages, which grew 11 percent last year, more than twice as fast as sales of Diet Coke and Coke around the world.
Given the slowdown in the American economy, few Coke followers expect to see much improvement in the current quarter. But by midyear, many anticipate a significant upswing in the tempo of Coke's sales and profits.

HEADLINE: Text of the Fed Statement on Rate Cuts 

 BODY:
Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's monetary policy panel, decided to lower interest rates by 50 basis points, or hundredths of a percent:
 The Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting today decided to lower its target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 5 1/2 percent. 
In a related action, the board of governors approved a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate to 5 percent. 
 Consumer and business confidence has eroded further, exacerbated by rising energy costs that continue to drain consumer purchasing power and press on business profit margins. Partly as a consequence, retail sales and business spending on capital equipment have weakened appreciably. In response, manufacturing production has been cut back sharply, with new technologies appearing to have accelerated the response of production and demand to potential excesses in the stock of inventories and capital equipment. 
Taken together, and with inflation contained, these circumstances have called for a rapid and forceful response of monetary policy. The longer-term advances in technology and accompanying gains in productivity, however, exhibit few signs of abating and these gains, along with the lower interest rates, should support growth of the economy over time. 
Nonetheless, the committee continues to believe that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future. 
In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas and San Francisco.

HEADLINE: Economy Grew at Slowest Rate in 5 Years in 4th Quarter 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
The United States economy grew at its slowest rate in more than five years during the final quarter of 2000, as businesses abruptly cut their spending on new equipment, the government said yesterday.
 American consumers continued to increase their purchases, albeit more slowly than earlier in the year, allowing the gross domestic product to grow at an annual pace of 1.4 percent during the quarter. Government spending, particularly on the military, also rose, while economic weakness around the globe caused foreign countries to trim their purchases of American goods. 
 The Commerce Department's quarterly report depicted the $10.1 trillion United States economy verging on a slowdown or a recession. Growth remained faster than it had been in the first half of 1995, when the country avoided a recession and the economy then entered one of its best five-year periods in history. 
But over the final three months of 2000, personal consumption was the only part of the private sector that expanded, and in the early weeks of this year consumer confidence has plummeted, according to two major surveys.
"Momentum has collapsed," said Jay Feldman, an economist at Credit Suisse First Boston. "It's definitely not just a manufacturing story anymore."
In response to the rapid turn-around since early last year, the Federal Reserve yesterday announced its second half-point cut in interest rates this month. Last week, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, in a report on the economy, told the Senate that "as far as we can judge, we have had a very dramatic slowing down, and indeed we are probably very close to zero at this particular moment."
Overall growth for 2000, compared with 1999, was 5 percent, its strongest showing in 16 years. But the economy slowed sharply in the second half of the year, growing at 2.2 percent in the third quarter.
Business inventories, one of the most closely watched parts of yesterday's report, offered mixed signals. The value of inventories rose $67 billion in the three-month period, or $6 billion less than in the third quarter.
The deceleration suggests that the economic slowdown did not cause a huge pileup in goods that will overwhelm companies early this year.
On the other hand, inventories are still growing more quickly than they did in the months leading up to the 1990-91 recession. "There's a lot of room for a big correction," said Edward McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs.
Throughout much of the report, in fact, there was fodder for both sides in the widening debate about whether the economy is destined for -- or even already in the early stages of -- a prolonged contraction. 
Pessimistic economists, emboldened by yesterday's weaker-than-expected numbers, argue that debt-laden and increasingly jittery consumers will be unable to make up for a fall-off of corporate investment. Capital spending by businesses fell 1.5 percent last quarter, its first decline since 1991. Spending on equipment and software fell 5 percent, while investment in new buildings rose.
In the near future, analysts say, business investment seems unlikely to reach the double-digit growth rates of the late 1990's, when companies were building Internet sites and trying to avoid year 2000 computer problems.
The fourth quarter report, said Robert Gordon, a professor of economics at Northwestern University, "shows the economy staggering, with the consumer holding up the other actors."
"A recession is now almost inevitable," he said.
Most optimists agree that the first quarter of 2001 will be a weak one, but they believe the economy will begin returning to health by the spring. They note that a stock-market rally, in response to interest-rate cuts, could reverse the decline in consumer confidence.
Even now, amid the turmoil, spending continues to grow modestly, and sales of new homes actually rose 13.4 percent in December, more than reversing a drop during the previous month, the Commerce Department said in a separate release yesterday.
And even if corporate inventories are growing, they remain slimmer than in the past, and companies will need less time to empty their warehouses. Recession skeptics also said that because of the importance of technology, most companies would also decide they must keep investing in new equipment.
"The fourth quarter was a soft landing, and we're likely to get a hard landing in the first quarter," said Edward Yardeni, the chief investment strategist at Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown. In the second quarter, however, Deutsche Bank expects gross domestic product to rise about 1 percent.
Most economists define a recession as two consecutive quarters of economic decline. The National Bureau of Economic Research, a private firm in Cambridge, Mass., officially decides when one begins.
Yesterday's release offered further evidence of the tough times that the manufacturing sector, particularly the auto industry, is experiencing. 
Consumer purchases of motor vehicles and their parts fell $11 billion, to $331 billion, in the quarter. Corporate purchases of transportation equipment fell $21 billion, to $170 billion. Had the two categories remained flat, the economy would have grown twice as fast as it did.
Separately, the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago said yesterday that manufacturing activity in the Chicago area had fallen this month to its lowest level in 18 years. Another industry association will release national manufacturing data today.

HEADLINE: Slowdown Doesn't Discourage Rosy Forecast for Economy 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 

 BODY:
The American economy has hit a snag, no doubt about it, but that has not deterred the nation's most influential economic forecaster, the Congressional Budget Office, from issuing a much more promising projection of the economy over the next decade than it had offered in the past.
 "The dip in the economy is expected to be short-lived," Barry B. Anderson, deputy director of the budget office, told Congress today. At the same time, Mr. Anderson said, the office's professional forecasters believe the economy will grow faster over the next 10 years than they had previously thought because they now expect greater growth in worker productivity and business investment. 
 As a result, the official forecast published today showed a projected budget surplus of $5.61 trillion over the next decade, about $1 trillion more than the forecast published last July and $600 billion more than the Clinton administration's final forecast issued last month.
Politicians and economists differed over the implication of the new forecast. Republicans saw it as the final piece of evidence that large tax cuts are in order. Democrats said the chances of forecasting error were such that the wise course would be to move slowly. But no one in authority treated the new forecast as anything but the most responsible possible stab at a notoriously difficult target: the long-range economic outlook.
"This is not money in the bank, but neither is it pie in the sky," said Robert D. Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute, who was director of the budget office when the Democrats last controlled Congress. 
Evidence that the economy is flagging mounted today. The Commerce Department reported that from October through December the economy grew at an annual rate of only 1.4 percent, the slowest quarter in five and a half years. The Federal Reserve lowered key interest rates by another half a percentage point, reflecting the view of the chairman, Alan Greenspan, that the economy is at a standstill. 
A survey reported this week by the Conference Board, a business research concern, showed that consumer confidence in the economy's health had taken its biggest monthly plunge in more than 10 years.
The budget office took account of these developments. It said the tax revenues would be $6 billion less and government expenditures $7 billion more in the current fiscal year than they would have been if the economy had not turned down.
But that was more than offset by estimates of vastly increased revenue because of strong long-term economic growth. The forecast was that the economy would grow 2.4 percent in this calendar year and that lower interest rates would cause it to rebound to 3.4 percent next year. Then the growth rate is expected to level off at an average of 3.1 percent through 2011. 
That average is three-tenths of a percentage point higher than the long-range average expected just last July. Over 10 years, that means an $800 billion increase in projected revenue to the government.
The average, Mr. Anderson said in testimony before the Senate Budget Committee, "takes into account a range of scenarios, including both a recession and the continuation of strong growth."
One reason the projected long-range budget surplus is so much larger than was forecast in July is that the new 10-year estimate does not count this fiscal year, when the surplus is expected to be $281 billion, and includes instead the 2011 fiscal year, when the surplus is forecast to be $889 billion.
But that was expected. What was not expected was the budget office's conclusion that the economy would grow so much faster than it had previously thought.
Mr. Anderson presented the forecast to Congress because the director of the budget office, Dan L. Crippen, is in the hospital after a boating accident. 
Mr. Anderson was careful to emphasize the unreliability of 10-year forecasts. Experience shows, he said, that budget projections one year in advance are quite accurate. Discrepancies become "more substantial" in five-year projections, he said. 
The budget office has been making 10-year forecasts only since 1992, so their accuracy cannot be assessed. "But 10-year projections are likely to be less accurate than five-year projections," Mr. Anderson said.
With that in mind, the budget office showed what would happen if circumstance prove more or less favorable than expected. 
If the increase in worker productivity, the most important variable in predicting the state of the economy over the long term, averages only 1.5 percent a year over the next decade instead of the 2.7 percent expected in the budget office forecast, then the surplus not counting Social Security would disappear after 2003 and the annual budget would show a deficit that would rise to more than $140 billion by 2011. 
But if average productivity grows by 3.2 percent, then the 10-year surplus would be nearly $9 trillion, more than 50 percent higher than the budget office is projecting.
Productivity is a measurement of the efficiency of workers. From 1974 until the mid-1990's, productivity grew an average of 1.5 percent a year. But since then, productivity growth has averaged nearly 3 percent, and it was 5 percent from the summer of 1999 to the summer of 2000.
Robert J. Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University and an expert on productivity, said that he thought the budget office had overestimated the likely influence of computers on productivity and that the growth in productivity would therefore be lower than the projection. But even then, he said, he did not believe the forecast of an average of 3.1 percent growth in the economy over the next decade was out of line.
Democrats today seized on the uncertainty of long-range projections to argue against the large tax cut President Bush is proposing. 
The surplus, said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, "evaporates if the C.B.O. is off by one half of one percent over a 10-year period."

HEADLINE: New President Inherits a Paralyzed Congo 

BYLINE:  By NORIMITSU ONISHI with IAN FISHER 

DATELINE: KINSHASA, Congo, Jan. 28 

 BODY:
When Congo's new president, Joseph Kabila, delivered his much anticipated first address to the nation on state television last Friday, he seldom raised his eyes from the 17-page speech on the desk before him. 
 Still, Mr. Kabila, 29, who is not fluent in Congo's official language, French, tripped over certain words, whose meaning he did not seem to grasp. The lighting and camera angle changed several times, suggesting that cuts were stitched together in the 30-minute videotaped speech. "He was reading like a robot," said Dr. Jean-Baptiste Sondji, who was health minister under the slain president, Laurent Kabila, until he was fired for criticizing the government. "You could sense the strong hand of those who really hold power." 
 Since President Kabila was gunned down in his office on Jan. 16 and replaced by his politically inexperienced son, the control over the capital here -- and the entire country -- seems to have slipped further into the hands of those real powers: Congo's neighbors and a hard-line inner circle that surrounded the late president and now surrounds his son. 
Unless Joseph Kabila, who arrives in Washington on Thursday to meet Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, somehow asserts authority over his handlers and can negotiate with the rebels who have already captured half of this country, the two-and-a-half-year war here will continue in a stalemate. 
At the moment, no outside power -- Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia on the side of Mr. Kabila and Uganda and Rwanda behind several rebel groups -- seems to have the military might or political will to destroy the others and tip the scales of the war. 
In the absence of peace, none of the five outside armies in Congo is likely to leave on its own, so as not to jeopardize its security, pride and interests in Congo's diamonds, gold, timber and coffee. 
"We can say without hesitation that the war suits a lot of people, here and outside Kinshasa," said Mabi Mulumba, an economist at the University of Kinshasa and a former prime minister under Mobutu Sese Seko, the dictator who ruled this country for 32 years.
For most Congolese, the stalemate is a nightmare that continues the effective partition of their country.
An exhaustive report on the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, often called the D.R.C., by the International Crisis Group, an independent research organization, raised the central question: "Should the D.R.C. remain a single state?" the report asks. "And given its current occupied, exploited and fragmented condition -- can it?"
It was Mr. Mobutu himself who predicted that Zaire would cease to exist after him. The prediction turned out to be true in many ways: since he was driven from power in 1997, the country has not only changed names, but in many ways it also ceased to exist as an independent nation. 
Although the Congolese rebel groups fighting Mr. Kabila nominally control the country's north and east, the Ugandan and Rwandan commanders call the shots. 
In the government-held territory, the late Kabila always tried to maximize his wiggle room despite his dependence on his allies. As power now shifts uncertainly to his son -- a political unknown -- the presence of foreign powers here in Kinshasa is expected to grow. 
In recent days, Zimbabwe and Angola have reportedly sent more than 6,000 fresh troops to the Congo, and the soldiers patrolling both the state funeral and the inauguration in the capital were mostly from Zimbabwe and Angola. 
At the funeral, Joseph Kabila sat with President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe on his left. Few were surprised to see the seat to his right, the most important diplomatically and symbolically, given to President Jose Eduardo dos Santos of Angola, widely regarded as the real powerholder in Kinshasa.
Angola, which saved the late Kabila in August 1998 when the Rwandan- and Ugandan-backed rebels appeared close to seizing Kinshasa, had grown impatient with the president, perceived as the main obstacle to negotiating an end to the war, military and political officials here said. Many here believe that the Angolans encouraged the assassination, or did nothing to stop it.
More than anything, Angola wants a stable and loyal government in Kinshasa that will back it in its own 25-year civil war against the Unita rebel force -- or at least a government here that does not support Unita, as Mr. Mobutu did. 
"The Angolans are the protectors of power -- they have their hands everywhere," a Congolese colonel said in Kinshasa. "They are waiting to see if Joseph Kabila governs in their interests. If not, he will disappear like his father."
It is not clear, though, whether the other foreign powers with a presence in the Congo want peace.
Rwanda will not leave until it feels secure -- that is, until it can achieve the practically impossible task of defeating or disarming the ethnic Hutu extremists who carried out the genocide against at least half a million Rwandan Tutsi in 1994 and who have sought refuge in Congo. 
Uganda, in the midst of a presidential campaign, is unlikely to leave without evidence that the war and the lives it cost bought some concrete benefit. 
In Zimbabwe, President Mugabe faces growing opposition to his involvement here. But the war has greatly enriched top officers in his military, who have had access to Congo's diamonds. 
Rwanda and Uganda are largely believed to be paying for their war through diamonds, coffee and gold -- and many individual commanders, along with their Congolese counterparts, are also getting rich.
On the broader international stage, Congo had become isolated under Laurent Kabila. Now, his son, by traveling abroad so soon after his inauguration, seems intent on reconnecting his country to more distant powers, particularly Washington, which counts Rwanda and Uganda among its closest African allies.
But it is not certain that the tight circle of hard-liners that had surrounded the new president are themselves interested in peace. Even under Laurent Kabila, they were said to regard peace -- and the consequent need for political openness and, ultimately, elections -- as a certain loss of their power. 
It is too soon to tell whether Joseph Kabila will retain that circle. His televised address contained few hints of change. Yet he has shown some signs of breaking away from the hard-liners, according to a high-ranking military official.
One day last week, the justice minister, Mwenze Kongolo, one of the most powerful men under the slain president, visited Joseph Kabila at the presidential palace and was told to wait in his own office until the new president summoned him, the official said.
"But he insisted he wanted to see the president," he said. "The president then sent back a handwritten note with only one word: 'No.' "

ADOBE FALLS AFTER SALES WARNING

BYLINE:  By Chris Gaither 

 BODY:
 Shares of Adobe Systems Inc. tumbled more than 17 percent yesterday, a day after the software publisher warned that the weakening economy could bite into its quarterly sales. In a statement released late Tuesday, Adobe, based in San Jose, Calif., said business had slowed in some markets, particularly in the United States, and that the softness in the United States could affect its revenue outlook for the quarter. 
After dropping as low as $42.38 yesterday, Adobe shares rebounded slightly to close at $43.69, down $9.06 from Tuesday. The company said it will spend cautiously in an effort to achieve its earnings goals for the quarter, which ends March 2. The consensus Wall Street forecast calls for a profit of 30 cents a share.

 The Buffalo-Niagara Falls area has tied with Miami as having the highest big-city unemployment rate in the country, according to data released yesterday by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
The jobless rate in both areas in December was 4.9 percent; the New York City area ranked third at 4.8 percent. It could be worse: in Yuma, Ariz., a small city on the border with Mexico, the unemployment rate is 15.8 percent. Connecticut continued to dominate the list of places with low unemployment. Danbury and the Stamford-Norwalk area registered jobless rates in December of just 1 percent, the lowest of all metropolitan areas; Hartford, at 1.6 percent, was second-lowest among big cities, after San Jose, Calif.

Federal Reserve Cuts Rates To Revive Slowing Economy
The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point for the second time this month, making clear that it intends to wage an aggressive battle against the growing possibility of a recession.
 While offering some reassuring words about the economy's prospects over the long run, the Fed also signaled that it would probably cut rates further in coming months, saying that "the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future." Page A1. 

The stock market retreated after the rate cut. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 6.16 points, to 10,887.36. But the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 7.72 points, to 1,366.01. The Nasdaq composite index fell 65.62 points, or 2.3 percent, to 2,772.73. C10.

AOL Time Warner Reports a Loss

HEADLINE: Democracy Needs Many Voices 

BYLINE:  By David Hoffman; David Hoffman is president of Internews, a nonprofit organization that supports independent news media.

DATELINE: ARCATA, Calif. 

 BODY:
In a historic speech in Prague in 1990, as Communism in Eastern Europe was crumbling, Secretary of State James Baker called for international support for independent broadcasting in the emerging states of the collapsing Soviet Union. Since then, the need for independent news outlets of all kinds has become even more urgent -- in fledgling democracies and old regimes alike.
 That is why President George W. Bush and policymakers at the State Department and Pentagon should put American support for uncensored news outlets -- and unfettered access to the Internet -- at the top of their foreign policy agenda. 
 Nothing raises more fear in a repressive regime than challenges to the control of information. And nothing is more important to the development of a civil, democratic society. Free elections may be a first step in establishing the rule of law, but there can be no multiparty elections without a multiplicity of news outlets. Yet press freedom, especially in broadcasting, remains threatened in many former Soviet and East Bloc countries, while in China the democratizing power of the Internet is stalled.
In Russia, the recent government prosecution of Vladimir Gusinsky -- whose influential television network has criticized the war in Chechnya and President Vladimir Putin's handling of the Kursk submarine tragedy -- is an ominous sign of what may be in store for the hundreds of smaller independent TV stations now in Russia, many of which have benefited from American aid. 
In the Czech Republic, meanwhile, about 100,000 protesters recently took to the streets of Prague to support the striking journalists who have barricaded themselves in the newsroom of state-owned Czech Television since late December. The "rebels," as the journalists have been dubbed, are demanding that public television be an impartial broadcaster of news, not a tool of the party in power.
Not so long ago, state television was just such a tool in the hands of Slobodan Milosevic, the former Yugoslav president indicted for war crimes by the international tribunal in The Hague. When anti-Milosevic protesters filled Belgrade's downtown, they stormed not only the parliament but also the state television center, to protest the network's virulent anti-Western and anti-Muslim propaganda. The independence of Serbian television in the months and years ahead will be a crucial measure of Serbian democracy.
China's rhetoric about democratization will also be tested by citizens' access to mass media -- especially the Internet. With 17 million Internet users, China faces a dilemma: Its Communist leaders have suppressed Internet content in a few highly publicized instances -- for example, when the Falun Gong religious sect demonstrated that the Internet can be a remarkable organizing tool. But these leaders also know that if they are to modernize their economy, they must open the country to the power of online information and communication. As Secretary of State Colin Powell noted in his confirmation testimony, "The rise of democracy and the power of the information revolution combine to leverage each other." 
Given the long history of Republican advocacy of First Amendment rights abroad, the Bush administration should insist that any partnership for prosperity be built on the condition that news media operate independently, that citizens have access to information and that the right of freedom of expression is guaranteed.

HEADLINE: Instead of a Tax Cut, Send Out Dividends 

BYLINE:  By Richard Freeman and Eileen Appelbaum; Richard Freeman is professor of economics at Harvard. Eileen Appelbaum is research director at the Economic Policy Institute.

 BODY:
Imagine arriving home at the end of the workday to find a $500 check from the government waiting for you in the mail. Even better: Imagine a prosperity dividend, paid to every American man, woman, and child, thanks to a record budget surplus.
 This may sound far-fetched, but it's a plausible way of applying an immediate stimulus to the economy while at the same time giving something back to taxpayers and their children, as President Bush wants to do. 
 The sudden slowdown in economic growth has rattled the financial markets and caused consumers and businesses to rein in spending. The Bush administration is right to look for a quick way to stimulate the economy and lessen the risk of a recession. Business and consumer debt levels are high relative to income, and the country has accumulated a large foreign debt. A recession, if it develops, could turn nasty. Preemptive action can make a difference. 
But revising the tax code is the wrong way to go. A tax cut enacted this year won't have much effect until next. That's likely to be too late. Even Alan Greenspan, who supports a tax cut, pointed out in Congressional testimony, "Such tax initiatives . . . historically have proved difficult to implement in the time frame in which recessions have developed and ended."
The tax code is also too important to be tampered with in haste. The consequences of any changes will be felt for years.
Our current surplus is America's return on 10 years of good economic performance, to which all of us have contributed. The government should declare a dividend -- a one-time payment that would give a quick lift to the economy, spur consumer spending and help fight off a potentially deep recession.
A dividend payment from the government to the people is not unprecedented. Alaska has a fund through which the state distributes the economic rewards of its ownership of land and mineral resources. In 2000, Alaska sent a check for nearly $2,000 to every man, woman and child who was a permanent resident and had lived in the state for all of 1999.
But for this kind of stimulus to work, it should meet three criteria.
First, it should be large enough to matter in an economy as large as ours. A tax-free $500 check to every permanent resident would transfer roughly $140 billion from the government to the private sector -- enough to make a difference.
Second, the stimulus should automatically end once the economy is back on track. The prosperity dividend meets this criterion because it is a one-time payment from the government to the people.
And third, the stimulus should be targeted to people who need it. The prosperity dividend would be distributed equally to everyone living permanently in the United States. But it would mean the most to low- and middle-income families with young children. (A married couple with two children would receive a total of $2,000). These families would be likely to spend all or most of the dividend on goods and services. If they were in financial distress, they could use it to pay down credit card debts.
With a projected surplus of $5.6 trillion over the next 10 years and the national debt already below 35 percent of our gross domestic product, we can afford to meet the needs of our communities and families. But neither increased public spending nor tax cuts can be carried out quickly enough to prevent a recession. And either would have long-lasting effects that need careful consideration.
A prosperity dividend check to every person in America is a fair and efficient way to spend a part of the surplus that all Americans helped produce while stimulating the economy quickly without tying government's hands for the future.

HEADLINE: THE LOCKERBIE VERDICT: THE LIBYANS; 
Homeland Sees Political Motive in Guilty Verdict

BYLINE:  By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: TRIPOLI, Libya, Jan. 31 

 BODY:
Libyan television broadcast a rare live report of the split verdict in the Lockerbie trial today, telling a confounded nation that one of its own had been found guilty of bombing the Pan Am jumbo jet.
 The most common reaction among those paying attention was a nagging suspicion that the fix might have been in from the start against the Libyan defendant who was convicted, Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi, given the decades of tense ties with the United States. 
 "We are sure that if the cases are purely a legal case, then Megrahi would have been found innocent," said Bassam Mustapha, a writer for the journal of the doctors' union. "But it is a political case." 
The government moved rapidly to express its dismay, trying to walk a fine line between saying it respected the court deliberations and distancing itself from a 12-year issue that it hoped the case would close. 
"We respect the judgment of the Scottish judicial system and also the verdict announced today," said Hassuna Shawash, the assistant secretary of information, culture and mass mobilization, speaking at a news conference. "But we repeat that Libya was not involved at all in the commission of this act." 
Mr. Shawash said the judge's ruling meant it was time to end the United Nations economic sanctions. He added: "We believe President Bush now has an opportunity to reassess relations. We are prepared to move forward in a much more positive light in a framework of equal respect."
The United Nations sanctions, currently suspended, carry with them several conditions for their removal, including payments to the families of victims, an idea that Libyans bristle at. "If anyone should be compensated, it should be the people of Libya for living through seven years of sanctions," Mr. Shawash said.
Mounir Shermit, secretary of the Society for the Victims of American Aggression, said at a news conference that it is the relatives of Libyans killed in an an American bombing raid on Tripoli in 1986 who deserve to be compensated. 
Diplomats said the issue of compensation would surely be decided by the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, who made no immediate public comment on the case. He wants to put the dispute behind him because it is impeding attempts to build a United States of Africa, the diplomats said, and there is a lot of grumbling about economic conditions here. "They are tired of it," a diplomat in Tripoli said. "When you say 'they,' it is only one person here. They want to get it over with."
A Libyan judge pointed out on the television news that the case could be appealed. "We won 50 percent of the case, and we could say the trial is not over yet," said Ahmed Al-Zawi, a senior judge on the High Court.
The only visible reaction to the verdict was a brief rally of a hundred students in a downtown square, but it seemed perfunctory, with demonstrators echoing official views.
Not all Libyans seemed convinced that the outcome was momentous. "Sanctions? What sanctions?" asked a man who only wanted his first name, Muhammad, printed. "They have been selling oil all along and we are still in a bad situation. This country hasn't changed in 20 years."

HEADLINE: Market Place; 
Greenspan has acted quickly in cutting rates, but whether he can prevent a recession is unclear.

BYLINE:  By Jonathan Fuerbringer 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan the gradualist is now Alan Greenspan the quick.
 With the Federal Reserve's half-point cut in its benchmark short-term interest rate to 5.5 percent yesterday, Mr. Greenspan has engineered a reduction of a full percentage point in less than a month. 
 Never before has this central bank chairman moved this fast to rescue the economy from a slide. 
In 1990, when the country was slipping into its last recession, the Fed took almost five months, with cautious quarter-point reductions, to get the federal funds rate down a percentage point. In 1998, in the middle of a global financial crisis after Russia defaulted on its debt, the Fed cut short-term rates only three-quarters of a point in just under two months.
What has made Mr. Greenspan more aggressive is a virtual collapse in economic growth, from about a 7 percent annual rate in the last half of 1999 to a 1.8 percent annual rate in the last six months of 2000. In the fourth quarter, the rate slowed to a meager 1.4 percent, the lowest since the second quarter of 1995, the government reported yesterday.
But Mr. Greenspan's haste may also be traced to his own criticism of how the Japanese handled their economy after the stock market crash of 1990. 
In testimony before Congress in June 1999, Mr. Greenspan said: "The bursting of the Japanese bubble a decade ago did not lead immediately to sharp contractions in output or a significant rise in unemployment. Arguably, it was the subsequent failure to address the damage to the financial system in a timely manner that caused Japan's current economic problems."
More and more analysts are referring to last year's plunge in technology and Internet stocks in the United States as a bubble that burst.
Richard Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said: "Alan Greenspan tailors monetary policy to fit the circumstances. The question is if he can do it in a way that always produces a Goldilocks outcome. The jury is still out on this one."
The widely expected rate cut yesterday at the regular meeting of Fed policy makers came after a surprise cut of the same size on Jan. 3 between scheduled meetings. And it is clearly positive for the stock market, although the major indexes fell after the Fed made its announcement around 2:15 p.m. The bond market rose before the announcement and rallied afterward, as it interpreted the Fed's statement to mean more rate cuts will come.
"The market is looking over the trough in the economy and in profits and forward to the recovery that will be engineered by the Fed," said Jeffrey M. Applegate, chief United States strategist at Lehman Brothers. "But in the near term, the stock market is saying the Fed is not going fast enough." 
Mr. Applegate also said some of the disappointment yesterday may have come from speculation in the last day or two that Fed policy makers might approve a cut of three-quarters of a point.
Investors and analysts do not expect the Fed to be as fast in cutting rates in the months ahead. Based on the federal funds futures contract for July, many investors anticipate the central bank cutting the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks, the Fed's benchmark, by an additional three-quarters of a point by summer. Mr. Berner forecasts a move of a full percentage point, reducing the Fed funds rate to 4.5 percent. But he believes the economy is in a recession, still a minority view among economists.
Even with additional cuts, it is not necessarily time for equities to return to their performances in the last five years of the 1990's, when annual returns of 20 percent or more were taken for granted.
Bonds, which have sold off since the beginning of the year, with rates moving higher, probably got too far ahead of the Fed at the end of last year. To rally more, that means they will need more negative economic news.
Rate cuts take time to work their magic, meaning the economy could still stumble into a recession. The plunge in consumer confidence, looking six months ahead, that was reported on Tuesday, is the kind of change in outlook that Mr. Greenspan said could push the economy from slowing growth into a decline. And the rise in corporate layoffs will not help consumer confidence.
A recession would hurt worker productivity and cut into corporate profits, giving investors little reason to rush back onto the equity bandwagon.
Mr. Greenspan has said that he was not targeting the stock market or a stock market bubble when the Fed was raising interest rates in 1999 and early 2000. Many analysts have pointed to his repeated references to the links between high stock prices, the wealth effect, consumer spending and the Fed's difficulty in slowing growth in late 1999 and early 2000 as evidence that Fed officials were indirectly targeting the stock market.
Mr. Greenspan has said that he is not averse to pricking a market bubble, as long as it is done in the context of an anti-inflationary policy. 
"While bubbles that burst are scarcely benign, the consequences need not be catastrophic for the economy," he said in June 1999 testimony.
So now he is coming to the rescue quickly. Whether he can keep the economy from falling into a recession is unclear. And if there is a recession, Fed critics will say that the central bank acted too slowly in cutting rates, even with the quick action in January.
Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig & Company who also believes the economy is in a recession, said, "It remains to be seen whether it will be as easy for the Fed to counter the effects of a bursting stock market bubble as Mr. Greenspan suggested in 1999."

HEADLINE: Bush Calls Putin, Who Brings Up Kremlin Figure Held in U.S. 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 

 BODY:
In what appears to be the longest and most substantive of his conversations with foreign leaders, President Bush initiated a 15-minute telephone call to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia today. Mr. Putin raised the case of a former Kremlin aide now under arrest in New York on charges of money laundering, Russian officials said.
 White House officials said little about the telephone call -- less, in fact, than the Russians did -- and would not say whether the two men had talked about Mr. Bush's hopes of building a national missile defense. Mr. Putin has been leading an international campaign to persuade other nations to oppose the program. 
 But Mr. Putin did raise the case of Pavel P. Borodin, who is being held in New York under a Swiss arrest warrant on charges that he took tens of millions of dollars in kickbacks from Swiss contractors renovating the Kremlin. Russian officials have demanded his release.
Under President Boris N. Yeltsin, Mr. Borodin was the head of Kremlin administration, the equivalent of a chief of staff for property and building management. This week he was replaced as state secretary for the union between Russia and Belarus.
According to a Russian statement, Mr. Putin "expressed the hope that a solution will be found for this problem which will correspond both to legal and humanitarian principles." The Russians said the appeal was "met by G. Bush with understanding." A White House official said the United States considered the case a "legal issue," meaning that Mr. Bush did not plan to interfere.
The White House also said Mr. Bush had responded on Tuesday, in writing, to a recent letter from Mr. Putin. American officials described the Putin letter as a call for engagement, but without any new proposals.
In the discussion today, the two leaders agreed to a rough schedule of contacts between their top officials, and agreed to meet soon thereafter. Under the current schedule, however, Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin would not come face to face until a meeting of major industrial nations in Italy early in the summer.
That may suit the White House, which has quietly indicated that it wants to move slowly in dealings with Mr. Putin while it sorts out both the political and the technological challenges of missile defense. The Kremlin, in its statement today, said only that the two leaders had agreed to "find mutually acceptable solutions to problematic questions." 
Building a missile defense would require amendments to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile agreement. Mr. Bush's defense secretary, Donald H. Rumsfeld, said last week that if necessary the United States could abandon the treaty. But that might open a breach in relations with Russia that Mr. Bush is unlikely to want to risk so early in his presidency.
China has also expressed objections to a missile system, and President Jacques Chirac of France criticized the plan several days ago. 
While the two leaders duel over missiles, Mr. Bush may soon face the problem that plagued the Clinton administration: Russia's reluctance to enact economic reforms.
Officials from the International Monetary Fund are in Moscow this week to review Russia's compliance with reforms that it agreed to during its 1998 financial crisis. With the exception of some tax reforms, Mr. Putin has moved on few of those issues. In an interview earlier this month, President Bush expressed doubt that the monetary fund had given Russia the right advice. He suggested that he might want to review the economic relationship.

HEADLINE: Ex-Regulator Hired to Advise Bertelsmann 

BYLINE:  By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK 

 BODY:
The German media company Bertelsmann has hired Joel I. Klein, the former head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, as a strategic adviser. He brings a prodigious set of connections at a time when the concern is poised for acquisitions.
 The efforts by Mr. Klein to strengthen the Justice Department's antitrust enforcement and its lawsuit against the Microsoft Corporation made him a high-profile figure in the Clinton administration before he resigned in September. 
 Over the last three years, he also developed a close personal friendship with Thomas Middelhoff, the chief executive of Bertelsmann, as the media company expanded its holdings in the United States.
Mr. Klein said he never handled any matters involving Bertelsmann while working for the government. In fact, media companies fall under the jurisdiction of the federal government's other antitrust regulator, the Federal Trade Commission.
Bertelsmann's most high-profile recent deal -- the acquisition of Random House, the largest English language publisher, and its merger with Bertelsmann's Bantam Doubleday Dell -- was reviewed by the F.T.C., not Mr. Klein's division.
Bertelsmann will have ample use for Mr. Klein's antitrust expertise. In addition to his connections in the United States, Mr. Klein also worked closely with European antitrust regulators, who are often a bigger issue for Bertelsmann.
Bertelsmann is currently in talks to acquire the record company EMI, a deal that is likely to face the scrutiny of European regulators. Those regulators are also investigating the possibility of collusion on compact disc prices among European record music companies.
But Mr. Middelhoff said he hired Mr. Klein for his advice on strategy and for his public image as a vigorous regulator. "Joel is deeply connected with the Internet economy, and it is great to have him representing Bertelsmann's face to American society," Mr. Middelhoff said.
In addition to Random House, Bertelsmann owns the record labels Arista and RCA through its BMG music division along with many other book and music companies in the United States and overseas. In addition, the company owns book and music manufacturing companies, book and music clubs, the magazine publisher Gruner & Jahr, trade journals, and European newspapers and television stations.
It has embarked on an ambitious plan to sell its own books and music over the Internet, including starting the Internet retailer Bol.com, buying a 40 percent stake in the BarnesandNoble.com and investing in the digital music sharing Web site Napster.
The company is currently shopping for new acquisitions with a $12 billion war chest left over from the sale of its shares in America Online and other Internet investments.
Mr. Klein, 54, who was born in the Bronx, will assume the title of chief United States liaison officer to the parent company, Bertelsmann A.G. He will also become chairman and chief executive of Bertelsmann Inc., which handles real estate, financing, and other services for the company's North American divisions. He will not be responsible for Random House, BMG or any of the company's other operating divisions.
The new post is Mr. Klein's first job as a businessman after a career as a lawyer. After being a clerk for the Supreme Court, he became a public interest lawyer focusing on cases involving the mentally ill. He then practiced as a trial lawyer at a small, well-connected Washington law firm specializing in appellate and Supreme Court cases.
He took a leave in 1992 to help the Clinton administration nominate a justice of the Supreme Court and then worked in the White House counsel's office for about 15 months before moving to the Justice Department in 1994.
But Mr. Klein said his experience as an antitrust regulator educated him in business issues involving the convergence of digital technology and media. Some of those issues arose in the Microsoft case. "Joel has developed pretty good insights into the businesses he was regulating and a point of view on them, and I am pretty sure he will offer those up," said Steven Rattner, an investment banker who knows him. 
Mr. Klein also brings to Bertelsmann extensive connections with executives like Mr. Middelhoff at many of the companies he regulated. He met Mr. Middelhoff about three years ago, at a Washington dinner party at the home of the lawyer Vernon Jordan.
Mr. Middelhoff, a German who had recently been promoted to Bertelsmann's chief executive, immediately hit it off with Mr. Klein, both said. They began meeting for breakfast about twice a year at downtown Washington restaurants like the Four Seasons. "He was interested in learning about the U.S. and learning, obviously, about antitrust and competition policies in a general sense, although he didn't have anything before us," Mr. Klein said. "I found that learning from him about technology and e-commerce was very helpful." He said they never discussed specific regulatory issues.
In May 1999, Mr. Klein attended Mr. Middelhoff's 46th birthday party at the restaurant Daniel on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. In December, Mr. Klein also attended a meeting of Bertelsmann executives at its headquarters in Gutersloh, Germany, followed by a Christmas party at Mr. Middelhoff's home.
"Everyone loved him," Mr. Middelhoff said. "Late in the evening, when we made some funny jokes and so on, he was joking with us and he got it immediately -- I am very confident that he will fit it with Bertelsmann's corporate culture."

CORRECTION-DATE: February 2, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about the appointment of Joel I. Klein as United States liaison officer at the Bertelsmann media company misstated the name and location of a restaurant in Washington where he had breakfast with Thomas Middelhoff, the company's chief executive. It is the Seasons restaurant at the Four Seasons Hotel, not the Four Seasons restaurant. And it is in Georgetown, not downtown.

HEADLINE: Medicine for the Economy 

 BODY:
It has been a rough few weeks economically. Americans have been receiving their sobering year-end 401(k) statements in the mail and reading about energy crises and layoffs at companies ranging from DaimlerChrysler to Amazon.com. Somber-looking politicians have taken to the airwaves to worry about a potential recession, a malady that the much-hyped "new economy" had supposedly rendered obsolete. It is no wonder that the index tracking consumer confidence in the economy's future has taken its steepest single-month nosedive in a decade. 
 Yesterday Alan Greenspan, worried about consumer expectations' nasty way of becoming self-fulfilling, delivered a needed pep pill to the nation in the form of a half-point cut in the key federal funds interest rate. His message: Relax, don't worry, and go out and spend some money so we can keep this economy growing. 
 With inflation no longer a threat, the Federal Reserve said it was engaged in a "rapid and forceful" response to the erosion in consumer confidence and stagnation in economic growth. The central bank had already cut rates by a half-point in early January. Mr. Greenspan hinted last week during his Congressional testimony that further cuts would be forthcoming when he noted that the economy may have ceased growing. Consumers and businesses can expect to borrow money more cheaply because of the move. 
Concerns about the economy were heightened yesterday when the Commerce Department reported that the economy grew in the final quarter of 2000 at an annual rate of 1.4 percent, the slowest in five years, and the Congressional Budget Office lowered its previous estimate of 3.1 percent growth for 2001 to 2.4 percent. Yet even as the short-term estimates worsened, the Budget Office boosted estimates of the federal government's likely budget surplus over the next 10 years by $1 trillion, increasing the threat that Congress will relax the fiscal discipline that played such a big role in generating the economic boom of the 1990's. 
Already Congressional Republicans are using the projected surplus to press for George W. Bush's 10-year, $1.6 trillion tax cut, and some Republicans believe the cut should be even larger. The Democrats are falling back, with some talking of accepting a cut as high as $1 trillion. But it would be a mistake to embrace deep, irreversible tax cuts on the basis of shaky surplus projections that may not pan out a decade hence. Recent history teaches that while monetary policy is the most effective short-term economic stimulus, fiscal discipline, and not an excessive tax cut, is the most effective long-term stimulus government can provide. 
Congressional Democrats should stand up for continued fiscal discipline by seeking to trim the scope of tax cuts and by insisting that they be phased in over the 10-year period, so that if the annual surpluses fall short of projections, the tax cuts can be curtailed. 
The projected surplus, it must be remembered, is not all that large compared with the demands that will be put upon it. Walling off the Social Security and Medicare components of the $5.6 trillion projected surplus over a decade brings the total of money potentially available down to $2.7 trillion. It would be reckless to commit well over half of this amount to a tax cut before Congress begins to address the host of important issues that will require new spending.

HEADLINE: FED CUTS KEY RATE BY HALF A POINT, CITING SLOWDOWN 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve today cut its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point for the second time this month, making clear that it intends to wage an aggressive battle against the growing possibility of a recession.
 Citing deteriorating conditions across the economy, the central bank's policy-setting committee voted for what it called "a rapid and forceful response of monetary policy" to breathe new life into the decade-long expansion. 
 "Alan Greenspan was blamed for one Bush recession," said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Bank One, referring to the economic downturn from mid-1990 to early 1991, when the current president's father was in the White House. "He doesn't want to be blamed for another."
While offering some reassuring words about the economy's prospects over the long run, the Fed also signaled that it would probably cut rates further in coming months, saying that "the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future." 
Earlier today the Commerce Department reported that the economy expanded at a 1.4 percent annual pace in the last three months of 2000, well below what most economists had expected. Page C1. 
The Fed's rate cuts are traditionally aimed at stimulating economic growth by making credit less expensive, thus encouraging people to borrow and spend, particularly for homes, cars and appliances, three pillars of the economy. 
The central bank said it had reduced the main interest rate it controls, the federal funds target rate on overnight loans among banks, to 5.5 percent from 6 percent. It also reduced its discount rate on loans to banks from the Federal Reserve system to 5 percent from 5.5 percent.
"The message from this and the previous action is that the Fed is ready, willing and able to do what's necessary to head off a rapid decline in economic activity," said Richard D. Rippe, an economist at Prudential Securities.
The move led to an immediate reduction in the rates paid by consumers and businesses for some types of loans. Many of the nation's largest banks immediately cut their prime lending rate to 8.5 percent from 9 percent, a move that will affect some small business and consumer loans, including some adjustable mortgages. But borrowing costs for fixed-rate mortgages may not fall much in response to the move, since they are less affected by changes in short-term interest rates and they had already declined considerably in recent months.
In cutting its key rate by half a point, the Fed matched the expectations of most analysts. Mr. Greenspan, the Fed chairman, had signaled in testimony to Congress last week that a substantial rate cut was likely, saying that economic growth had declined to near zero.
But some investors had been hoping the Fed would cut rates by three-quarters of a percentage point, especially after a widely watched gauge of consumer sentiment, the Conference Board's index of consumer confidence, tumbled on Tuesday at a pace not seen since the last recession a decade ago.
As a result, investors did not respond today with anything like the exuberance that followed the Fed's last rate cut, on Jan. 3, when the central bank stunned the markets by cutting rates by half a point between scheduled meetings.
Stock prices fell in the minutes after the Fed's announcement at 2:15 p.m., but then steadied. The Dow Jones industrial index finished at 10,887.36, up 6.16 points. The Nasdaq index fell 65.62 points, to 2,772.73.
In explaining its action, the Fed described an economy that was slowing across the board. It noted that businesses appeared to be adapting faster than usual to slowing demand and dwindling profits because technology allows them to keep a finger on the nation's economic pulse with greater precision than ever before.
"Consumer and business confidence has eroded further, exacerbated by rising energy costs that continue to drain consumer purchasing power and press on business profit margins," the central bank said in a statement issued after the completion of its two-day meeting. 
"Partly as a consequence, retail sales and business spending on capital equipment have weakened appreciably," the statement continued. "In response, manufacturing production has been cut back sharply, with new technologies appearing to have accelerated the response of production and demand to potential excesses in the stock of inventories and capital equipment."
Economists said the statement showed that the Fed saw some glimmers of hope. Rising energy prices are likely to be less of a drag on the economy after winter ends. 
Capital spending, while down from its extremely high levels of the past few years, is not likely to collapse, given the pressure in nearly all industries to cut costs and improve quality. And the sharp, painful inventory adjustment being undertaken by many companies is likely to be completed relatively quickly, analysts said, allowing a return by mid-year to something approaching business as usual.
"It feels bad because it's so fast, but because it's so fast, it won't last that long," said William C. Dudley, chief economist at Goldman, Sachs in New York.
Economists at Credit Suisse First Boston said the economy appeared to be in a V-shaped cycle in which a stomach-churning downturn could well be followed by a rapid recovery.
In cutting rates twice this month by a total of one percentage point, the Fed put rates back where they were a year ago, when it was partway through a campaign to squelch what it saw at the time as growing inflationary pressure.
Analysts said any further signs of weakness would bring more rate cuts, perhaps even before the Fed's next scheduled meeting on March 20. 
"They're going to be driven by the data," Mr. Dudley said.
Among the indicators the Fed will be watching are consumer confidence and the stock market. Mr. Greenspan told Congress last week that the difference between a short period of painful adjustment to slower growth and a recession is often determined by how consumers respond.
Because the market's ups and downs can have a psychological impact even on people who are not investors, the Fed has a tricky job in dealing with Wall Street. A year ago, Mr. Greenspan suggested that interest rates might have to rise because the market was creating so much wealth that the economy was overheating. Now he would no doubt like to see the market rise gradually without getting out of hand.
There are also confusing signals about the degree of the economy's weakness.
Although consumer confidence is down, spending has held up relatively well. Declining long-term interest rates, driven by expectations that the threat of higher inflation has disappeared, have made mortgages more affordable, giving a boost to the housing industry. The Commerce Department reported today that sales of new homes jumped 13.4 percent in December, the biggest increase in eight years.
Yet manufacturers say business has stalled, and companies in many industries are laying off workers for the first time in years. Analysts expect the unemployment rate to begin creeping up from its current level of 4 percent.
"The G.D.P. numbers show a two-tier economy, with the manufacturing sector in recession and industrial production still declining, but the rest of the economy holding up reasonably well," said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers.
The economy also seems likely to benefit later this year from the stimulus of a tax cut, particularly after Mr. Greenspan put his weight behind one last week. Economists said the combination of monetary and fiscal stimulus should ensure that the downturn, however steep it turns out to be, remains relatively short.

HEADLINE: This, It Appears Sure, Is the Year of the Tax Cut 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 

 BODY:
After years in which Democrats blocked Republican tax-cutting efforts, President Bush now seems all but certain to shepherd a substantial tax cut through Congress this year.
 It is still unclear whether Democrats can contain the tax cut to something less than the 10-year figure of $1.6 trillion proposed by Mr. Bush, or whether it might grow even larger as some Republicans have suggested it should. 
 The composition of the tax cut is still very much up in the air as well, with Democrats intent on directing its benefits more to lower- and middle-income people than the Bush plan would. 
But the focus has shifted from whether to how much, how quickly and with how much bipartisan support.
"Clearly there will be a tax cut, and it will be a significant tax cut," said Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. "There should be a broad-based tax cut that affects all taxpayers."
Like most other Democrats, Mr. Baucus said any tax cut had to fit within a budget that provided sufficient money to deal with other needs, especially education, the long-term financial stability of Social Security and Medicare, and repayment of the national debt.
Moreover, Mr. Baucus said, the central element of Mr. Bush's plan, a reduction in all income tax rates, will have to be modified to make sure that the primary beneficiaries are not the wealthiest taxpayers but instead "working families, because they are hurting in many parts of the country."
But nearly all the defenses that allowed Democrats to hold back the Republican tax-cutting tide in recent years have been washed away.
With a Republican in the White House, Democrats in Congress no longer have a presidential veto to back them up; last year President Bill Clinton vetoed two tax cuts, both of which had passed Congress by comfortable margins.
In stating last week that the government could afford a large tax reduction without endangering its ability to pay off the national debt, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, undermined the Democratic position that a tax cut would be fiscally irresponsible.
The Congressional Budget Office's new, upwardly revised surplus projection to $5.6 trillion over the next decade makes it particularly hard for Democrats to sustain their argument that there is not room for a broad-based tax cut.
And the jitters over the nation's economic health -- which were underscored again today by the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates for the second time in three weeks -- make it politically difficult for Democrats to oppose tax cuts that Republicans have artfully packaged as recession insurance.
"We now have what looks like pretty uniform agreement that we should have a tax cut and that we should have marginal-rate reductions," Paul H. O'Neill, the treasury secretary, told reporters this week. 
The size of the tax cut, Mr. O'Neill said, is "a legitimate question," but not, he added, one that should unduly slow progress in getting legislation enacted. 
Should they choose to, Democrats could no doubt slow the tax-cutting effort. The party's more liberal members in particular find it hard to contemplate supporting anything like Mr. Bush's plan, which among other things would also repeal the federal estate tax.
But the changing landscape facing Democrats can be traced by looking at the tax cut proposals they have backed over the past year.
At the start of the presidential campaign, Al Gore proposed a tax cut of $250 billion over 10 years. By last summer, Mr. Gore was up to $500 billion.
This week, Democrats have been talking about a range between $750 billion and $1 trillion, and signaling that they are open to a deal with the White House. When Republicans in Congress sought a tax cut of that scale several years ago, it was derided by Democrats as fiscal folly.
Seeing their advantage, some Republicans in Congress have been trying to cast Mr. Bush's $1.6 trillion figure as a floor in any negotiations. 
The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, said he would like to add tax cuts for business and a reduction in the capital gains tax. Members of both parties are eager to expand the popular individual retirement account and 401(k) savings programs. An array of expiring tax breaks for individuals and corporations are likely to be extended.
With things going his way, Mr. Bush has indicated in the last several days that he would not object to Congress's taking the tax plan up in pieces if that would speed the passage of its main components.
As a first line of defense, Democrats are pushing to allocate the available portion of the federal budget surplus in equal thirds: to tax cuts, additional spending and a reserve that could go to debt reduction and shoring up Social Security and Medicare. They are also considering ideas like making any tax cut dependent on the surplus's actually materializing.
But they have yet to find the kind of roadblock to tax cuts that Mr. Clinton came up with three years ago when he challenged Congress to "save Social Security first" and keep the surplus off limits until then.
"It would be a mistake to play the game on Bush's terrain," said Will Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy Institute, a research group for centrist Democrats. "It's not fiscally responsible and certainly not a progressive way to go. If Democrats can't coalesce around a progressive alternative, that will provide opportunities for the White House to play divide and conquer, and will leave some Democrats fearful of missing the tax-cut train."

HEADLINE: Bush, in Outreach Bid, Meets Black Caucus 

BYLINE:  By MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 

 BODY:
During his first 12 days in office, President Bush has swayed and prayed at a black church, stopped his motorcade at two predominantly black schools and advocated policies intended in part to rehabilitate black communities.
 He has surrounded himself with black advisers, talked with the Rev. Jesse Jackson and considered whether to make permanent President Bill Clinton's temporary appointment of the lone black judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, Va. 
 Mr. Bush received 8 percent of the African-American vote in November, the lowest level of black support for a Republican presidential candidate since Barry Goldwater ran in 1964. Several African-American members of Congress stormed out of the House chamber in early January when electoral votes giving Mr. Bush the presidency were tallied. 
But the new president has made a concerted effort to improve his standing among the nation's roughly 35 million blacks, an ethnic outreach effort that continued today as he met with a deeply suspicious Congressional Black Caucus.
"It was a freewheeling, blunt meeting," said Representative Melvin Watt, Democrat of North Carolina. "He spent 95 percent of the time listening."
During the campaign, and particularly at the Republican convention in Philadelphia, Mr. Bush showcased black supporters and advisers, which did little to attract African-American votes in November, but was seen as a signal of reassurance to white moderates that he intended to govern from the center.
Karen P. Hughes, a counselor to Mr. Bush, said he intended to be the president of all Americans, whether they voted for him or not.
"He's aware that he did not do well with the African-American vote but he's not going to let that stop him," Ms. Hughes said. 
Before Mr. Bush sat down in the Cabinet Room with about 30 black members of Congress this afternoon, Ms. Hughes acknowledged, "There are not a lot of supporters of his in that group."
But Mr. Bush's target audience extends well beyond the people in any given meeting.
"What Bush is doing is aimed as much at white people as black people," said David Bositis, an analyst of minority voting at the Joint Center for Economic Studies. "Bush is conservative, more conservative than the American public. By doing the things he's doing, he makes himself appear more moderate."
Mr. Bush opened the meeting with the black caucus, all Democrats, by saying he wanted to discuss his education proposals, some of which are intended to bring greater accountability to schools in poor urban areas. "While there may be some discussion about details," Mr. Bush said, "all of us, surely, believe the great hope for this country is to make sure every child -- I mean every child -- is educated."
The conversation turned quickly to a topic that is especially sensitive to Mr. Bush: the dispute over counting the votes, many of them in predominantly black areas, in Florida in the presidential election. 
Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan, said before the hourlong White House meeting: "There's nothing more painful for blacks than our struggle for the right to vote. We're not getting over the pain we have from Florida."
Mr. Bush was ready to discuss the issue. Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, said before the meeting that the president believed there were numerous problems that the election highlighted beyond black voting, including difficulties with absentee ballots from overseas military personnel and news projections of the winners before the close of voting.
Chief among the 20 or so issues that arose at the meeting today was Mr. Bush's nomination of John Ashcroft, an outspoken conservative, as attorney general, an appointment vehemently opposed by many black political leaders and organizations. 
"That was the first thing that came up," said Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan. "We explained to him why we couldn't buy Ashcroft in 100 years."
It is unlikely that such opposition would be assuaged by the appointment of a black person as one of Mr. Ashcroft's deputies. Larry Thompson, a former United States attorney from Georgia, is a likely candidate, administration officials said. One appointment that would make at least some amends, black lawmakers say, would be to give Roger L. Gregory, whom Mr. Clinton last month appointed temporarily to the Fourth Circuit, a permanent post.
Mr. Bush's outreach toward blacks, who make up roughly 13 percent of the population, began shortly after he took the oath of office.
"While many of our citizens prosper, others doubt the promise, even the justice, of our own country," he said in his inaugural speech, remarks that aides said were intended, in part, for blacks. "The ambitions of some Americans are limited by failing schools and hidden prejudice and the circumstances of their birth. And sometimes our differences run so deep, it seems we share a continent, but not a country."
In the days since, Mr. Bush has spoken to traditional black leaders and sought to widen the circle to others more sympathetic to his approach.
He named three African Americans to high-level positions in his administration: Colin L. Powell as secretary of state, Roderick R. Paige as education secretary and Condoleezza Rice as national security adviser. And he surrounded himself with blacks at the White House while announcing his education reform plan and his initiative to prod more religious groups into delivering social services.
Mr. Bush also called Mr. Jackson soon after the civil rights leader acknowledged that he had fathered a child with a mistress. Mr. Bush said in the call that he was praying for Mr. Jackson, who has been outspoken in challenging the fairness of the vote-counting in Florida.
Last Sunday, Mr. Bush chose Lincoln Park United Methodist Church in Washington, which has a predominantly black congregation, for one of his first spiritual outings as president. He nodded his head to the chorus and swayed at the refrain, "I've got a feeling everything's going to be all right."
It is far from clear, however, whether the same can be said of his relations with African-Americans. Aides say that Mr. Bush had a dismal showing among blacks in his first campaign for Texas governor but rebounded four years later with about a fifth of the African-American vote.
Aside from the president's own aides, Mr. Rangel has been the black official who has visited most often with Mr. Bush, primarily because of his position as the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee. After three meetings in 24 hours, Mr. Rangel says he is still reserving judgment on whether the new president will aid African-Americans.
"We have not dealt with a single substantive issue in these meetings," Mr. Rangel said. "He's agreed with everything I've said. You can't come out angry when someone says, 'You're right. You're right. You're right.' "
As for some of the gestures the president has made, Mr. Rangel dismisses them.
"Passing out a couple dollars to ministers is not an overture to blacks," he said of the Bush initiative on religion-backed charity. "Visiting a black church is like me going to a cathedral in Paris to reach out to European Catholics. We have to deal with something of substance."

HEADLINE: THE LOCKERBIE VERDICT: THE OVERVIEW; 
LIBYAN CONVICTED BY SCOTTISH COURT IN '88 PAN AM BLAST

BYLINE:  By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: CAMP ZEIST, the Netherlands, Jan. 31 

 BODY:
A Scottish court today found a Libyan intelligence official guilty of murder in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988, when 270 died, but did not convict the second defendant and released him.
 The investigation into the bombing pitted Libya and its leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, against the West, with international sanctions costing Libya an estimated $30 billion before it finally handed over the suspects in 1999 under a diplomatic compromise that brought the trial to the Netherlands. 
 But the White House said today that the verdict would not end a ban on business deals with Libya or flights there by Americans, which has been in place since 1986. And President Bush said he would press Libya to apologize for the terrorism and compensate the families, many of whom watched the verdict in person or at closed-circuit broadcasts around the world, including New York and Washington. 
The verdict appeared to satisfy many families who lost members when Flight 103, on its way from London to New York, dropped out of the sky onto Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988. They said it would help their civil case against Libya, which names Colonel Qaddafi as the chief plotter in the bombing, which took the lives of 189 Americans.
Bruce M. Smith, a retired Pan Am pilot whose wife, Ingrid, was killed, said he regretted that the trial had not been in an American federal court "so we could have gotten a death sentence." And Bryan Flynn, whose elder brother, J. P., was killed, said the verdict proved the bombing had been "an orchestrated strike against the Western world." He and other family members want sanctions renewed and Colonel Qaddafi tried as a war criminal.
The three judges, in an 82-page written decision, admitted that the prosecution's case had "uncertainties and qualifications," that key witnesses had repeatedly lied and that the prosecution had not explained how a bomb got aboard the plane. 
But they nonetheless unanimously concluded "there is nothing in the evidence which leaves us with any reasonable doubt as to the guilt" of the Libyan intelligence officer, Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi.
Mr. Megrahi's fellow defendant in the nine-month trial, Al Amin Khalifah Fhimah, a former airline manager, was told he was "discharged and free to go." Draped in a white toga and wearing a flat black fez, he rose to walk out a side door to freedom. His legal team stalked out the opposite door with curt bows to the judges.
Mr. Megrahi remained alone, slumped slightly forward, listening to his lawyer, who gave a brief, strained plea that Mr. Megrahi still maintained his innocence. He was told sentence would be passed after lunch, and Mr. Megrahi returned in three hours, looking stooped and wan, his toga hugged tightly around him. He was told that a life sentence was mandatory under Scottish law, and that the court, "in view of the horrendous nature of the crime," wished him to serve 20 years before any parole consideration.
Were it not for his age, 49, and that a Scottish prison will be foreign to him, Chief Judge Lord Ranald Sutherland said, the court would have recommended an even longer wait. Even so, Peter Lowenstein, father of a young American killed in the crash, said afterward: "Twenty years for 270 murders is less than a month per victim. It's just not right."
As the court attendees sat in stony silence while the clerk recorded the verdict, the public gallery on the other side of the soundproof glass was aflutter with nervous concern because Jim Swire, a tall, white-haired doctor who had sat through most of the trial and speaks for many of the British families, had suddenly gone pale and slid down his chair with his jaw agape. Ushers carried him out to an ambulance, but apparently he had only fainted from the tension.
United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan said after the verdict, "Justice has taken its course and the authority and legitimacy of the legal process must be respected." United Nations sanctions inposed on Libya in 1992 were suspended during the trial, but could be reinstated. 
Libya's ambassador to the European Union, Hamed al-Hudhairy, on hand for the verdict, said he thought there was "no possibility of sanctions being re-imposed." That threat was "something we have heard for a long time from the families," who he said were trying to "take the whole Libyan people hostage." 
Mr. al-Hudhairy called the verdict "a political decision," asking how it was possible to conclude that a defendant accused of arranging the bombing could be guilty if the defendant accused of helping him get the bomb aboard was innocent.
But the court did not conclude that Mr. Fhimah was innocent; it concluded that the prosecution had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he was guilty, though the court did not choose the "not proven" verdict available under Scottish law. 
The three judges did vote unanimously to find Mr. Megrahi guilty, which in theory reduces his chances of winning any appeal because in Scottish courts, a unanimous verdict tends to carry more weight than a split decision. The decision on Mr. Fhimah was also unanimous.
Although Mr. Megrahi was convicted, the court's written reasons (available at www.scotcourts .gov.uk/html/lockerbie.htm) show that it did not think the prosecution had proved all elements of its case.
The judges agreed that forensic evidence proved that the bomb, triggered by a Mebo MST-13 timer, was inside a Toshiba radio-cassette player in a brown Samsonite suitcase with clothing bought at Mary's House, a store in Malta.
But, they added, "the absence of any explanation of the method by which the primary suitcase might have been placed aboard KM 180 is a major difficulty for the Crown case." If there was an unaccompanied bag with a bomb on KM 180, an Air Malta flight from Malta to Frankfurt, there was evidence that such a bag could have moved through Frankfurt's airport to Pan Am Flight 103. 
The judges were scathing about two important witnesses: Abdul Majid Giaka, a Libyan secret service turncoat, and Edwin Bollier, an owner of Mebo, a Swiss electronics firm.
"Putting the matter shortly, we are unable to accept Abdul Majid as a credible and reliable witness on any matter except his description of the J.S.O.," the court concluded, referring to Libya's intelligence agency, the Jamahariya Security Organization, at which Mr. Majid had started his career as an auto mechanic. It rejected all his testimony about plastic explosives hidden in desks, conversations with the defendants about the Pan Am bombing and his claim to have seen Mr. Megrahi with a brown Samsonite.
Mr. Bollier, the court found, was an "untruthful and unreliable witness," and some of his testimony "belongs in the realm of fiction where it may be best placed in the genre of the spy thriller."
Tony Gauci, the owner of the clothing store in Malta, was "doing his best to tell the truth," the court found, and was believable when describing the clothes he sold. Of his visual identification of Mr. Megrahi, it said, "there are undoubtedly problems," because he had picked other people out of photo displays. 
Still, the court convicted Mr. Megrahi on several grounds: He was a Libyan intelligence agent "of fairly high rank" and traveled on a false passport. Libya bought Mebo bomb timers; he was in military procurement and had dealt with Mebo. Mr. Gauci identified him as the buyer of the clothing in the bomb suitcase, though it was "not an unequivocal identification." He was in Malta's airport at the time the bomb was presumably sent on its way. 
All in all, the court concluded, Mr. Megrahi's movements "form a real and convincing pattern."
The only evidence against Mr. Fhimah, the court found, were his diary entries about luggage tags and meeting Mr. Megrahi, and the prosecution conceded that it had not proved that he was a member of Libyan intelligence. Even if he gave Mr. Megrahi the suitcase tags, the court found, there was no evidence that he knew that doing so was part of a bomb plot, so he was acquitted.
At 6 p.m. today, Mr. Fhimah, bare-headed and in a denim shirt, left Camp Zeist in the back of a car, waving to the Scottish officers who had guarded him for two years.
A cousin, Ali Fhimah, using an Arabic expression for a family member, had said earlier: "We're happy that our son has been released, but we came here to see both of them let go. We believe that al-Megrahi is as innocent as our son, but we believe in Scottish justice and will continue to fight until he is acquitted, too."
Libyan television said today that Mr. Megrahi would appeal. In the Scottish courts, he has two weeks to ask permission from the same court, and six weeks more to file his reasons. If the court agrees, the appeal could be heard by at least five judges who would have to be appointed to hear the case. They would sit here, where Mr. Megrahi must be kept under the agreement with Libya until his conviction is final; if he waives his right to be present, they would sit in Edinburgh.
If his appeals fail, Mr. Megrahi is expected to serve his sentence in Barlinnie Prison in Glasgow.

HEADLINE: The Minimum Wage 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 During her confirmation hearing, Elaine L. Chao, who is now labor secretary, said President Bush wants states to be able to opt out of future minimum-wage increases (news article, Jan. 25). 
 If we allow such a change, the states most likely to do so would be those with the largest share of low-wage workers. 
Those states have a much bigger incentive to opt out, lowering the earnings of thousands of workers who would now be out of reach of the federal policy.
Furthermore, the economy in low-wage states has shown no negative effects of the last minimum-wage increase; to the contrary, the low-wage labor market has performed extremely well there. President Bush's idea would simply undermine a policy that has protected our lowest paid workers since its introduction in 1938.

HEADLINE: Blustery, Independent Panel Chief to Hold Sway on Bush Economic Agenda 

BYLINE:  By LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 

 BODY:
The road to George W. Bush's economic agenda slashing taxes, shoring up Medicare and privatizing Social Security -- passes through the office of Representative Bill Thomas, where the ride could get bumpy.
 Mr. Thomas, the new chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, is known for his sharp intellect and ability to finesse complex legislation, his independent streak and, especially, his quick temper. For years Mr. Thomas, a California Republican, was famous for interrogating administration officials and outside experts in the long debate over how to revamp the nation's health care system, reserving the brunt of his anger for those who arrived at the hearing room unprepared. 
 Last week, Mr. Thomas expressed enthusiasm for an across-the-board tax cut similar to the one proposed by President Bush. Now Mr. Thomas, who has a reputation for doing things his way, turns his attention to getting Mr. Bush's tax-cutting bill -- tweaked and rewritten, if necessary -- out of the House, where it will be acted on first, through the Senate and back to Mr. Bush for his signature.
"He's an ally and important friend for the Bush White House," said Representative Mark Foley, a Florida Republican on the Ways and Means Committee. "But they better be prepared for strong negotiations, spirited debates, and they better have the facts on their side before they expect him to march up a hill simply because the president asked."
Mr. Thomas, 59, has not said much publicly about how he intends to address tax cuts. But last week, in an interview, he seized on a particular chunk of testimony from the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, to say he would consider pushing for across-the-board tax cuts quickly, without packaging them with more targeted tax cuts that would benefit married couples and heirs.
Mr. Thomas said that he met several times with Mr. Bush in Austin, Tex., during the presidential campaign to discuss issues, including health care, and that he had managed to forge an easy relationship with the president. Already, he has been to the Bush White House several times, including today. 
But in many ways, the new president and the new chairman are polar opposites. While Mr. Bush prefers to be briefed on highly technical issues, Mr. Thomas prides himself on mastering the most arcane subjects and expects everyone else to be as well-prepared. After Mr. Thomas wound up on the Ways and Means health subcommittee, he immersed himself in Medicare minutiae for two years, rising at 4 a.m. to crack the books.
More pragmatic than ideological, Mr. Thomas is most at peace dismantling and reassembling old cars and clocks. He recently patched up a 1965 Porsche, then sold it right back at a profit to its original owner, who had given it up for dead.
"One of the things I tell people I do as a hobby is to trace electrical shorts in cars," Mr. Thomas said. "It's just a process of elimination, and you just have to start with a logical beginning. Figure out where the problems could be, see if that's where they are, and go through a sequence of decisions."
Legislation, he said, is no different. "It's the same, the same," he said. "Trace shorts. Find out what works, who is where, what is it we can do."
Mr. Thomas's depth of knowledge helped catapult him to the Ways and Means chairmanship over a more senior, more conservative member.
Few would have predicted it; a raft of conservative groups had rallied against Mr. Thomas, a supporter of abortion rights. And Representative Tom DeLay, the powerful Republican whip from Texas, threw his support behind Mr. Thomas's chief opponent, Representative Philip M. Crane of Illinois.
Some said they believed Mr. Thomas's prickly personality would alienate people, a trait Mr. Crane tried to seize on in a letter to Speaker J. Dennis Hastert. "Never in my tenure in Congress have I allowed my temper to insult, berate or offend a colleague," Mr. Crane wrote.
But Mr. Thomas received a crucial endorsement. The vast majority of the panel's Republicans sent a private letter to Mr. Hastert supporting Mr. Thomas, a politically risky move had Mr. Crane won the job.
"That played into my decision," said Mr. Hastert, who skipped over his Illinois colleague and voted along with the steering committee to name Mr. Thomas to the chair. 
The personality issue was overshadowed by Mr. Thomas's legislative skills and political instincts.
"The House leader and the president have to ask that he deliver, not that he go to personality school," said Newt Gingrich, the former speaker.
Mr. Thomas has been a chairman before, over the House Administration Committee, a B-list panel responsible for overseeing the House's bureaucracy, but he wielded the gavel so effectively that many members say he empowered the committee and made a name for himself as an adept manager who can juggle many projects at once.
Even Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee said Mr. Thomas's selection was likely to reinvigorate the tax-writing panel, which had much of its power stripped away when Republicans took control of the House in 1994. Under Speaker Hastert, chairmen are just beginning to regain much of their old authority, and many House members expect Mr. Thomas to restore, at least in part, some of the panel's cachet under the legendary chairman Dan Rostenkowski. The panel, which oversees tax legislation and entitlement programs, is a powerhouse for corporate lobbyists, who gravitate to it like supplicants to Lourdes.
"The one thing he will do is bring back the prestige of the Ways and Means Committee," said Representative Robert T. Matsui, a senior California Democrat on the panel. "He doesn't roll over to anybody. That's probably his one weakness, that he always needs to have the last word. But he's strong and smart and he's formidable." 
Mr. Thomas acknowledges that he has a temper, but said that he unleashed it mostly on the deserving: those both ill-prepared and overly verbose. "People don't like it when I'm upset because somebody decides that they just thought about this for 10 seconds and they want to take two hours to dissect it," he said.
One of his most memorable clashes came in 1999 with Jim Nicholson, the Republican national chairman. Mr. Thomas publicly scolded Mr. Nicholson over redistricting in California, stunning some colleagues. When the dispute spilled over into letters, Mr. Thomas wrote one to Mr. Nicholson saying: "Thank you very much for your mucho carboned C.Y.A. letter. You seem to have the negative letter writing thing down pat." C.Y.A. is an abbreviation for cover your behind.
In 1995, a Florida Democrat, Representative Sam Gibbons, leapt for his tie in a hallway after a heated committee meeting.
But Mr. Thomas said his edges would not be as sharp as chairman. He wants to work with Democrats, he said, for the simple reason that it is easier to make law with them on his side.
"We can do some things partisan," he said. "It's just going to take longer and it's harder."

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW; 
Chattering Objects That Need No Word for Art

BYLINE:  By ROBERTA SMITH 

 BODY:
"African Forms" at the Museum for African Art in SoHo is another outstanding exhibition from an institution that has made a habit of them since its founding 17 years ago. It hasn't hurt that the art of Africa is one of sustained and multifaceted excellence, or that research in this field has expanded exponentially over the last three decades.
 But success, at least on this level, was not preordained. Since its inception the museum has looked at the cultures of Africa through one lens and then another, delving into social, religious and geographical contexts, taking more purely formal tacks or pulling back to scrutinize African art's reception and interpretation in the West. Four exhibition titles indicate some of this breadth: "Art/ Artifact: African Art in Anthropology Collections" (1988), "Wild Spirits/Strong Medicine: African Art and the Wilderness" (1989), "Close Up: Lessons in the Art of Seeing African Art" (1990) and "Exhibitionism: Museums and African Art" (1994). 
 Alternating and often combining formal and contextual approaches, the museum's exhibitions have taken particular care to distinguish between aesthetic and spiritual power, between visual presence and cultural meaning, while encouraging the appreciation of both. 
Viewers have repeatedly been reminded that many African cultures do not have a word for art and that many objects were not meant to be looked at in a sustained way. A 1993 exhibition, "Secrecy: African Art That Conceals and Reveals," for example, examined how many sculptures and masks were visible only during ceremonies, and then sometimes only to the initiated.
A third approach has been emerging, one that considers decoration and daily use in addition to the more ascetic concerns of form and ritual. This was the case with the museum's exemplary "Hair in African Art and Culture" last year, and it continues with "African Forms," which has been organized by Frank Herreman, the museum's director of exhibitions, working with Marc Ginzburg, a founding trustee of the museum and longtime collector of African art. Most of the 400 works in the show are drawn from Mr. Ginzburg's collection. 
This effort is unusual for being almost entirely devoid of the figurative sculptures and masks that distinguish most exhibitions of African art. Instead, it presents, both in small clusters and large groupings of related objects, chairs and stools, neckrests, hairpins and hats, textiles and beaded aprons, jewelry and currency, bottles for snuff and kohl, ceramic vessels and baskets, flutes and other musical instruments, shields and weapons.
These objects are variously made of ivory, wood, straw, terra cotta, gourd, shells and animal hides, as well as brass, iron, silver and gold. The show concludes with a smattering of small religious objects, among them ornate bronze Ethiopian crosses and Muslim writing boards from Nigeria and Chad. But everything here feels subtly animated, if not inspirited, whether it is an elaborate knife sheath that suggests a little shrine or bowls fashioned from a large gourd incised with cosmological patterns.
Over all, "African Forms" asserts that with or without a specific word for art, few African peoples neglected the expressive opportunities implicit in the creation of handmade objects, no matter how basic.
As the wall texts indicate, many objects for daily use were produced by the same artists who were making masks and figures; they were usually commissioned and were owned and used by a single individual. Their forms adhered to local styles, like the low stools with three disclike legs of the Kamba people of Kenya. They communicated both cultural tradition and personal status. 
From raffia hats and cut-pile textiles to square-topped baskets (and the square-topped carved wood boxes modeled on them) and swords, the Kuba people's love of ornate patterning is evident. The two huge bright red berets near the exhibition's entrance, one made of human hair, the other of cotton, were specifically the accessories of married Zulu women.
This is a beautiful show, with much of that beauty emanating not only from the recurring elegance of the forms but also from the patina of human use, especially in the objects made of wood or hide. It suffers from a dearth of contextual information; it would be nice to illustrate, for example, how the beaded rectangular ear pendants of the Masai are worn.
But the groupings of related objects mostly compensate for the relative silence. A process of comparative viewing helped along by what labels there are reveals the diversity of sensibilities, technologies and materials. 
Certain Ethiopian people, for example, made the conical bases of their neck rests on lathes, while others preferred solid but delicately incised shaped blocks of wood. Still others, the Rendille, preferred a more free-form approach. Their headrests are pared-down sections of tree trunks that turn branches into legs.
As the objects talk effectively among themselves, they also speak frequently of other cultures. At least one of those exchanges is starkly concrete. 
The show includes a circular Ethiopian shield made of heavy hide decorated with radiating bands of silver, one of which has been engraved (presumably in London) with the following: "Taken from an Abyssinian Chief during the War in 1867 and given by Colonel Palliser to his cousin Sir Henry Charles Hardinge."
But in a more diffuse and elevated sense, the African influence on Western art, which has been widely acknowledged and detailed over the last 30 years, is as apparent here as in an exhibition of figurative sculptures and masks from the continent. Giacometti's "Spoon Woman" and Brancusi's "Endless Column" are two of the modern classics that may come to mind in these galleries. More interesting, the show, which is probably not the first to indicate that modern design has a similar debt to African art, confirms this repeatedly in the objects' collective emphasis on natural materials, elegant line and economy of form.
It is not by chance that Ray and Charles Eames were collectors of African objects of daily use, or that the introduction to the book by Mr. Ginzburg that accompanies the exhibition is written by the textile designer Jack Lenor Larsen. If the African influence on modern design is worthy of its own exhibition, so is an even more interesting cultural affinity suggested here: the one with the assiduously aestheticized objects of everyday use in Japan, which, to come full circle, also strongly influenced modern design.
In delineating a third path to African art, that of functional use, this show, like the "Hair" exhibition, more or less erases its tracks. It does this by revealing the overriding unity of visual material in most African cultures, the seamless progression from objects of physical adornment to those of mundane use to those of spiritual worship. Figurative sculpture and masks may be the "high art" of Africa, but in truth there is no low.

HEADLINE: INSIDE ART; 
Unsold At Auction

BYLINE:  By Carol Vogel 

 BODY:
Last week's old master paintings sales in New York followed what has become a familiar pattern this season. While Sotheby's and Christie's were able to sell some works for exceedingly high prices, a large percentage of material in each auction remained unsold. 
 Christie's sale included 175 works, of which 59 failed to sell. At Sotheby's, 219 paintings were offered and 84 never found buyers. 
 The same trend was seen last fall at the Impressionist and modern art auctions and at the American paintings sales: with the exception of a few top works, cautious buyers were scared off by high estimates. 
"It's a tricky market," said Anthony Crichton-Stuart, head of Christie's old master paintings department in New York. "Everyone's so aggressive to get property that sometimes you overreach and estimates are too high."
Christopher Apostle, director of Sotheby's old master paintings department in New York, said he believed that the high rate of unsold works reflected a sagging in the middle market. "I definitely have noticed a slowdown in more medium-level pictures," he said.
Still, a few museums gravitated toward some of the best paintings. 
While it can often be weeks or even months before museums announce their auction purchases -- curators must wait until the museum boards vote on the acquisitions -- three museums confirmed buying at last week's sales. 
The J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles bought Hans Hoffmann's "Hare in a Forest" at Sotheby's for $2.6 million. One of the only known oil paintings by the artist, it was commissioned in 1585 by the Hapsburg Emperor Rudolf II and is based on "The Hare," a 1502 watercolor nature study by Durer.
"We had been looking for early German paintings," said Deborah Gribbon, director of the Getty Museum. "We already have a group of works that are associated with the court of Rudolf II."
The $2.6 million paid by the Getty was well above the painting's $1.5 million high estimate. 
"A Hare in the Forest" failed to sell in 1990 at Sotheby's in London and again last year at the European Fine Art Fair in Maastricht, the Netherlands, where it was prominently displayed by the Maastricht dealer Robert Noortman. 
A Spanish bank, the Caja Madrid, bought Ribera's "Raising of Lazarus" (1613-1615) for the Prado Museum in Madrid at the Sotheby's sale. The bank paid $1.8 million for the work, just below its $2 million high estimate.
The painting, which depicts the figure of Christ wearing a red robe, is in a sense going home. It was listed in a 1686 inventory of the Spanish royal collection as being among the works in the Royal Chapel of the Palace of the Alcazar in Madrid. 
The third museum buyer last week was the Portland Art Museum in Oregon. It acquired Luca Giordano's "Battle of the Lapiths" for $248,000, well above the work's $150,000 high estimate. A bigger version of the composition is in the Hermitage. 
Museums did not snap up all the big-ticket paintings. Dealers also bought, though to replenish stock rather than for clients, they said.
Mr. Noortman bought Rembrandt's "Portrait of a Bearded Man, Bust-Length, in a Red Doublet" (1633) for $12.6 million. The seller, the casino owner Steve Wynn, paid $9 million for the work just two years ago at Christie's. 
In December Mr. Noortman bought Rembrandt's "Portrait of a Lady Age 62" for $28.6 million at Christie's in London.

Collection for Sale
The minute there is talk of a recession, top-flight dealers are offered collections that in more optimistic times would have found their way to the auction block. The latest example is a group of about 125 paintings, drawings, watercolors and prints by leading German Expressionist artists that experts say is worth about $50 million.
The collection belongs to Jan A. Ahlers, a German businessman who lives near Cologne and has been buying German Expressionist works for about 20 years. Mr. Ahlers recently decided it was time to sell and chose Mitchell-Innes & Nash, the Manhattan dealers, together with Christoph Graf Douglas, a Frankfurt art adviser, to handle the sale.
"The collection is as complete as it's going to get," said the dealer David Nash. "It would be too difficult to add more with today's high prices. So he's decided to sell the whole thing and concentrate instead on contemporary art."
Mr. Douglas and the dealers at Mitchell-Innes & Nash are all ex-Sotheby's experts who worked together for years. 
Among the collection's highlights are two paintings by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, one a depiction of the Brandenburg Gate and the other a portrait of a young Gypsy girl with her cat.

From Actors
John Gielgud and Ralph Richardson, who with Laurence Olivier were considered the Olympian stage actors of their generation, also happened to be friends who shared a passion for collecting. Now Sotheby's in London will be selling the Gielgud and Richardson estates in April. Gielgud, who died in May at 96, spent his last years South Pavilion, his 1690 home in Buckinghamshire, which was filled with furniture, paintings, silver, books and paintings.
"He tended to buy very decorative things," said Harry Dalmeny, deputy director of Sotheby's house sale department in London.
The sale, on April 5, includes a wide assortment of memorabilia, some of it personal, like Gielgud's Panama hats and cigarette cases. But there are also minor modern British and old master paintings, including a still life of flowers and fruit by Sir Matthew Smith and an 18th-century view of Venice by Giovanni Migliara.
Richardson, who died in 1983, and his second wife, the actress Meriel Forbes-Robertson, who died in April, were serious collectors of antiquities. Their sale, on April 27, will include a Hellenistic terra cotta female figure circa 300 B.C. and a first-century Roman bronze figure of a dancing satyr.
A label inside a wine pitcher bearing a Greek figure reads "26 July '78. Bought after lunch with Peter Hall," who was then director of the National Theater.

HEADLINE: POP AND JAZZ GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by critics of The Times of noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.

ALHAMBRA, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400 or (212) 545-7536. Just over 500 years ago, before the Inquisition, Spain had a thriving Sephardic Jewish culture that created its own hybrids of European and Middle Eastern traditions. Alhambra, formed in 1981 to study and revive Judeo-Spanish music and to bring back that vanished culture, has delved into neighboring styles, ranging from those of North Africa to those of the Balkans. Sunday at 3 p.m. Admission: $21; $15 for World Music Institute members (Jon Pareles).

BLIND BOYS OF ALABAMA, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400 or (212) 545-7536. After more than 60 years as a group, the Blind Boys of Alabama are no longer boys but gray-haired pillars of gospel quartet singing. Led by Clarence Fountain, they proclaim their reverence in close harmonies and gutsy improvisations that leap heavenward. For this concert they will be joined by the St. Paul's Community Baptist Church Choir. Tomorrow night at 8. Tickets: $26 (Pareles).

* ABRAHAM BURTON-ERIC McPHERSON QUARTET, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 242-1785. Once led solely by Mr. Burton, a saxophonist, this band now has equal leadership from Eric McPherson, one of the new young drummers changing the way rhythm sounds in jazz. It's a hot, loud, percussive band; James Hurt, who plays the piano like a huge set of drums, is part of the rhythm section. Nightly sets through Sunday are at 9 and 11, with 12:30 sets tonight and tomorrow night; the cover charge is $20, with a $10 minimum; $17.50 for Sunday (Ben Ratliff).

* DON BYRON, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8777. Mr. Byron, a clarinetist who hates the tyranny of categories, has just issued his latest genre-smasher, "A Fine Line: Arias and Leider" (Blue Note Records/Capitol), which runs through popular music by Stevie Wonder, Roy Orbison, Stephen Sondheim, Puccini and Schumann as if these strands needn't ever have diverged. Tomorrow night at 8:30 he'll play music from the album, accompanied by the singers Patricia O'Callahan and Mark Ledford. Tickets: $20 (Ratliff).

* DU-TELS, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3055. The Du-Tels' brand new album is called "No Knowledge of Music Required" (Shimmy Disc), a real howler from these masters of the thrift store songbook. Few musical pleasures compare with an evening with Gary Lucas on guitar and Peter Stampfel on vocals and whatever he decides to bang on. The virtuosity of Mr. Lucas, the axman, perfectly complements the joyful embodiment of Americana of the folk hero, Mr. Stampfel. If they take requests, be sure to shout for "Wisconsin Honeymoon" and "Bamboo." With Curtis Eller's American Circus, Sunday night at 10. Tickets: $8 in advance; $10 the day of show (Ann Powers).

CAJMERE/GREEN VELVET, Limelight, 47 West 20th Street, Manhattan, (212) 807-7780. One identity isn't enough for Curtis A. Jones. As Cajmere, he's a house-music disc jockey, producer and record-label founder whose "Brighter Days" became a dance-floor staple. And as Green Velvet, he's a cranky, hard-luck character bemoaning his latest mishaps to the blunt sounds of drum machines and cheap synthesizers. One or both will be the disc jockey tomorrow night, starting at about 10. Admission: $25 (Pareles).

MORRIS DAY AND THE TIME, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. Clothes make the man about town in the Time, Morris Day's long-running Minneapolis funk band. Though Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis left the group to become full-time producers, Mr. Day still preens like a narcissistic Don Juan above the band's keyboard-driven funk, while his sidekick, Jerome, holds his mirror. Tomorrow and Sunday nights at 8 and 10:30. Admission: $35 (Pareles).

RAY DRUMMOND QUARTET, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037. Since the late 1970's Mr. Drummond has been one of the hardest working musicians on the New York jazz scene, to the detriment of his own strengths as a composer. He's right in the middle of mainstream neo-bop, but he's also a bit of an Africanist, and he has often worked with the Senegalese percussionist Mor Thiam, who will join him this week. The pianist Stephen Scott and the drummer Billy Hart, who can both be excellent players, are on hand, too. Nightly sets through Sunday are at 9:30 and 11:30, with a 1 a.m. set tomorrow. Cover charge is $20; $15, Sunday; $10 minimum (Ratliff).

SNOOKS EAGLIN, Village Underground, 130 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 777-7745. The guitarist Snooks Eaglin rarely leaves New Orleans, and New Orleans never leaves him: it's in every syncopated chord he plays and in every growly, cackling note he sings. Mr. Eaglin has taken his whole band with him for this rare New York appearance, including the flamboyant pianist John McCleary, and he can draw on decades of repertory for his casually unerring revamps. Tomorrow night at 8:30 and 11:30. Admission: $20 (Pareles).

RICHIE HAWTIN. Twilo, 530 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 268-1600. When he records as Plastikman, Richie Hawtin concocts techno at its most minimal: sparse combinations of clinical, inhuman sounds in ominous patterns. Behind the turntables, he ramps up the propulsion to push dancers into action. Tonight at 2 a.m. Admission: $25 (Pareles).

* ANDREW HILL SEXTET +11, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. The pianist Andrew Hill is one of the most mysterious composers of modern jazz, not just for his fraught harmonies and layered rhythms but for his periodic disappearances from the scene. But over the last four years or so, he has come back in a big way, gigging, hooking up with young performers who approach his music systematically and curatorially, even making a startling new record (last year's "Dusk," on Palmetto). This weekend is the world premiere of his 17-piece big band, put together with some of the enormous amount of money given to jazz last year by the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation. And some of the better musicians in town -- great fans of Mr. Hill's work -- are in the band, including the saxophonists Marty Ehrlich, Aaron Stewart and Greg Tardy; the trumpeters Dave Ballou and Ron Horton; the bassist Scott Colley; and the drummer Dafnis Prieto. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 8, 10:30 and midnight, with a $25 music charge for the first two shows and $18 for midnight; Sunday night sets are at 7 and 9, with a $18 music charge; $10 minimum on all nights (Ratliff).

* DAVID JOHANSEN AND THE HARRY SMITHS, Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-7880. David Johansen's latest genre excursion heads for the recorded roots of American music: the blues, ballads, country and gospel songs, full of murder and adultery and hope for redemption, that were collected by Harry Smith for his "Anthology of American Folk Music," a foundation of the 1950's folk revival. Although Mr. Johansen is a master of irony, he sings the songs as straightforward folk with a touch of rock, making the old narratives sound current. Tomorrow night at 7:30 and 10:30. Admission: $20 (Pareles).

* LUNA, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Embracing the legacy of two-guitar New York bands from the Velvet Underground to Television, Luna applies the dynamics of strum, drone and build to Dean Wareham's tales of longing and decadence. As Mr. Wareham sings about high-toned parties, aimless road trips and creeping paranoia, the songs start out cool, but the writhing, swelling guitars reveal the obsessions within them. The band is about to release a long-awaited live album. Tonight and tomorrow night at 10, with Joy Zipper opening tonight and the morosely tuneful band Clem Snide opening tomorrow. Admission: $15 (Pareles).

CHARLES McPHERSON QUINTET/JAMES CARTER SEXTET, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592. Mr. McPherson, a saxophonist, has been associated with two other Charlies: Mingus, in whose band he played during the 1970's, and Parker, whose style he fully absorbed to become one of the best interpreters of bebop we have. James Carter, on the other hand, is an eclecticist whose tastes range from Ben Webster to Sun Ra to Django Reinhardt, whose music he covers on a lively recent album, "Chasin' the Gypsy" (Atlantic); this weeklong gig will focus on the Reinhardt material. Double sets tonight through Sunday, at 9 and 11:30; $30 music charge and $5 minimum. (Ratliff).

"MODE FOR JOE: THE MUSIC OF JOE HENDERSON," Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080. Mr. Henderson's influence as a record maker has endured into the 90's, but he's rarely celebrated as a composer, despite having written tunes like "Recorda Me" and "Blue Bossa," classics of the 1960's Blue Note Records era. This ad hoc band addresses Mr. Henderson as a writer. It includes Javon Jackson, the tenor player who probably sounds most like Mr. Henderson today, as well as the trombonist Josh Roseman, the drummer Lenny White and others. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11. Cover charge, $25; $10 minimum (Ratliff).

OTHER DIMENSIONS IN MUSIC, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. One of the best things to come out of the resurgence of interest in good old-fashioned free-jazz energy music is this working quartet, whose members (Roy Campbell, trumpet; Daniel Carter, saxophones; William Parker, bass; Rashied Bakr, drums) lean on little motifs to guide their bursts of inspiration.Sometimes the results are messy, but this band tries to mirror the emotions, and sometimes emotions are messy. Sets tonight through Sunday night at 8 and 9:30; cover charge, $10 (Ratliff).

JEB PATTON AND PERCY HEATH, Kaplan Penthouse, Rose Building, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500. Mr. Patton, a fluid young bebopper who plays in the Heath Brothers band, will perform duets with the bassist Percy Heath, he of the melodic lines, beautifully economical swing and a tone to die for. Because he's a rhythm-section player and not a bandleader, Mr. Heath hasn't received the distinction as a national treasure that he deserves; his appearance at the big John Lewis concert a few weeks ago at Lincoln Center was a Top 10 moment if there ever was one. The concert is tonight and tomorrow night at 8. Tickets: $45 (Ratliff).

VERNON REID AND MASQUE/CHURCH OF BETTY, Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-7880. From hard rock to harmolodic jazz to hybrids of hip-hop and jungle, the guitarist Vernon Reid has delved into all sorts of sharp-edged music. He brings fast fingers, a taste for experimental structures and a fearless ear for noise to his projects. Chris Rael, who leads Church of Betty, is determined to mesh East and West. Collaborating with downtown New York musicians who'll take on anything, he mixes pop and ragas from India with funk, rock and hip-hop, coming up with a hybrid that radiates optimism. Tonight at 7:30 and 10:30. Tickets: $20 (Pareles).

PATTI ROTHBERG, Fez, 380 Lafayette Street at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212) 533-2680. Not just a songwriter but a painter and a green belt in karate, Patti Rothberg is a real New York woman. Her music is tough and tender, with a groundedness that doesn't come often in pop. At this show she will play songs from her recent album "Candelabra Cadabra" (Cropduster) and new tunes she hasn't recorded yet. With Eddie Skuller. Tomorrow night at 7:30. Tickets: $10; two-drink minimum (Powers).

RUSSELL SIMINS, NEW WET KOJAK, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. "I'm not a model!" screams Russell Simins in a rant from his recent solo debut, "Public Places" (Grand Royal Records). True, but Mr. Simins, drummer for the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, is one eclectic fellow within the range allowed fashionable downtown New Yorkers. Hip-hop and power pop mix with the usual bluesy craziness in Mr. Simins's songs. Tonight his band will be joined by New Wet Kojak, also a side project with a vision of its own, spearheaded by Johnny Temple and Scott McCloud. Lo-Hi opens the show. Tonight at 8. Admission: $12 (Powers).

SIXTEEN HORSEPOWER, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. Old-time country music was haunted by faith, death and love. David Eugene Edwards, the leader of Sixteen Horsepower, ties his own obsessions to the country tradition. He expects apocalypse and hellfire at every turn, and banjo picking still surfaces amid the piano and electric guitars. Tomorrow night, Botanica opens at 9, with Sixteen Horsepower at 10. Admission: $15 (Pareles).

SKELETON KEY, Village Underground, 130 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 777-7745. Skeleton Key is the sound of the Lower East Side distilled into arty raucousness. Its songs use snappy, tightly wound riffs that pack the musicianly games of progressive rock into the terse time frame of punk, and its lineup includes a percussionist playing a rack of found junk. Tonight at 8, with VPN and Co-Defendants opening. Admission: $10 (Pareles).

* MARY TIMONY, CRAIG WEDREN, CHRIS LEE, Brownies, 169 Avenue A between 10th and 11th Streets, East Village, (212) 420-8392. This triumvirate of underground singer-songwriters proves that unfurled emotion can win you points with the cool kids. Each is a drama queen in his or her own way. Mr. Lee croons soulfully about the pleasures and pains of the flesh. Mr. Wedren, once of the band Shudder to Think, mounts mini-dramas worthy of Errol Flynn. Ms. Timony, of the band Helium, spins tales that Tolkien would have been proud of. This should be some enchanted evening. Tonight at 9:30. Tickets: $10 (Powers).

MARK WHITFIELD QUARTET, Iridium, 48 West 63rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 582-2121. Mr. Whitfield emerged in 1990 as a prodigy in the Wes Montgomery-George Benson mold, and he's developed, happily, into a player of much broader inclinations. But he still sounds great on a blues. Nightly sets through Sunday at 8:30 and 10:30. Cover charge, $25; $10 minimum (Ratliff).

* JOHN WOLFINGTON, CHRISTINA ROSENVINGE, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. Delicate and dark, the songs of these two singer-songwriters complement each other so well that they are on the same label: Smells Like, run by Steve Shelley of Sonic Youth. Mr. Shelley will be behind the drums and Tim Foljahn of Two Dollar Guitar will play guitar and offer harmonies, as Mr. Wolfington and Ms. Rosenvinge add their musings to the post-Nick Drake school of folkish melancholia. Sunday night at 8. Tickets: $7 (Powers).

HEADLINE: My Student Loans 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As someone from a working-class family who financed her education at Yale University and Stanford Business School with a combination of scholarships, loans and jobs, I think Princeton's decision to compete for students by not requiring them to borrow money is a bad idea (news article, Jan. 28).
 Education is an investment. 
This is especially true for Ivy League graduates, as they have the best opportunities to get high-paying jobs. 
 It would be far better to offer loan payments spread over a longer time, lower interest rates or a well-designed program to forgive loans if graduates go into lower-paying lines of work like academia or public service.
Having paid my loans, and having tried to be generous in gifts to my universities, I see little justification to give the best and the brightest a free ride.

Dow Closes at 4-Month High on Hope for More Rate Cuts

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks posted their highest close in more than four months yesterday as expectations that the Federal Reserve would fire off another round of interest-rate cuts to pump up the economy overshadowed fears that the nation was teetering perilously near to recession.
 The Dow Jones Industrial average jumped 96.27 points, or 0.9 percent, to 10,983.63, its highest close since Sept. 14. The Nasdaq composite index edged up 10.1 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,782.79. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 7.46 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,373.47. 
 "In the short run, bad news is good news for the market," said David Sowerby, market strategist for Loomis Sayles. "We don't wish for a recession, but at least the weakness just further reinforces that the Fed has, in my opinion, another full percentage point to give us in lower interest rates."
Driving the Dow were gains in Merck and Intel. Both were added to UBS Warburg's list of favorite stocks. Merck rose $2.30, to close at $84.48, and Intel added 81 cents, to $37.81.
Also in the Dow, the local and wireless telecommunications company SBC Communications gained $2.20, to $50.55. I.B.M., another Dow component, added $2.05, to $114.05.
The market was held back through most of the day by news of a slowdown among United States manufacturers.
The National Association of Purchasing Management reported that its index of manufacturing activity slumped in January to its lowest level since March 1991, when the United States was last in a recession.
The association's index fell to 41.2 in January, well below the 43.6 reading expected by Wall Street, from a revised 44.3 points in December. A number below 50 denotes a contraction in the sector.
On Wednesday, the Fed cut its key federal funds rate by half a percentage point, to 5.5 percent, saying the economic slowdown called for "rapid and forceful action," and indicated it would cut rates again if necessary.
To underscore its message, the Fed also cut its discount rate on direct Fed loans to commercial banks by a half-point, to 5 percent.
The economy is now "awfully close" to a no-growth scenario, Norbert Ore, a senior official at the National Association of Purchasing Management, said. 
"The overall economy could certainly still be growing, but that would be a maximum of 0.6 percent, so it is still coming awfully close to that no-growth scenario," Mr. Ore said. --------------------

Treasuries Are Higher
By Bloomberg News
Treasury bond prices rose yesterday on expectations that a report that said that manufacturing activity was near a 10-year low would help prompt policy makers to cut interest rates further.
"The economy is slowing to a point where the Fed is afraid it's slowing too much, and there's no reason for them to stop" lowering interest rates, said Todd Abraham, who helps invest $1.5 billion in bonds at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh.
The 10-year Treasury note rose 8/32, to a price of 105 2/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.07 percent from 5.11 percent on Wednesday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 28/32, to 111 23/32. The bond's yield fell to 5.44 percent from 5.50 percent on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Caught in the Electrical Fallout 

BYLINE:  By Gary Locke; Gary Locke, a Democrat, is governor of Washington.

DATELINE: OLYMPIA, Wash. 

 BODY:
If pragmatic action isn't taken soon to fix the broken electricity market threatening the economy of the West, our national prosperity could be seriously harmed. And the federal government -- not just California and the neighboring states now finding themselves forced to share its problems -- must be involved in the solution.
 In the State of Washington, we elected not to deregulate our retail electric power industry. We continue to expect utilities to serve their customers with low-cost power while earning a fair rate of return. But now, caught in the fallout of California's energy meltdown, we, too, are facing potential shortages, skyrocketing prices and escalating debt. 
 We are on the same electric grid -- regional power market and transmission system -- as California. (More than a dozen Western states are on this grid.) Usually this helps everyone: Washington sells power to California in the summer, for example, helping it keep its air conditioners running, and buys from California in the winter to keep our homes warm.
But the current unexpected and serious power generation shortage in California drives prices through the roof for us, too, affecting our utilities, businesses and citizens. Some utilities in Washington are now paying more than 10 times what is normal for power at this time of year.
Adding to Washington State's burden is an unusually dry winter. Too little rain has fallen to fill the reservoirs behind our dams. In some areas, like Lake Roosevelt, behind the Grand Coulee Dam, we haven't seen water levels this low for 25 years. Even if we get normal rainfall for the rest of the season, this year's mountain snow pack -- which melts to feed our reservoirs in spring and summer -- will be at 50 to 70 percent of normal. And if we divert too much water from our rivers for power generation, we use supplies needed for migrating salmon and agricultural irrigation.
The utility that serves Tacoma has instituted a 50 percent surcharge for power, and the one that supplies Seattle has passed 28 percent price increases. Customers north of Seattle face a 35 percent rate now and probably another increase later. The impact of these rising prices ripples through our economy: industries have already curtailed operation because of these rising costs. And Washington is not alone. The Idaho Power Company recently announced it may increase prices 24 percent, and some utilities in Utah and Arizona also expect sharp increases.
Independent power producers bought many of the generating plants that California's deregulation required its utilities to sell, and these producers were expected to build new plants to keep pace with demand. The legal obligation of regulated utilities to serve, however, does not transfer to the independent, competitive generators. This market structure provides inadequate incentives to construct new plants -- or, worse, perverse incentives not to generate electricity, since if supplies stay short, prices will stay at high levels. Independent power producers are realizing huge profits in this West Coast crisis and stand to continue to do so, at the expense of the region, through the summer and perhaps into the next year or two.
Both political parties and both state and federal governments had a hand in creating the deregulation that has disrupted our power market, and government at all levels must set aside partisanship as we confront the results. The Bush administration must help solve the crisis or risk letting it spin out of control. This is not a "normal" market where the integrity of price signals needs to be protected. This is a highly distorted market where intervention is needed. And because interstate commerce is involved, only the federal government can supply this intervention.
President Bush and his energy secretary, Spencer Abraham, should put pressure on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to stabilize the market immediately by putting temporary price controls on wholesale electricity. They should also ask Congress to expand the federal assistance that helps low-income people pay their electric bills. 
California, of course, must work to solve the debt problems of its utilities and renew the financial integrity of its system. But as it struggles to restore stability, our entire region needs protection.
Washington State is doing its part. I have issued an energy supply alert that mandates a 10 percent reduction in energy consumption by all governments in the state. I've asked for the same reduction by citizens and businesses. The energy alert also allows companies to fire up their own diesel generators now, with the requirement that they offset additional particulate emissions with investments in clean air contributions later.
We in the Northwest cannot protect ourselves from a crisis we did not cause and a deregulation experiment we did not want. Even the most fervent free-market advocates should recognize that there must be short-term steps taken now to stabilize the market. And only the federal government can provide the immediate help we need.

HEADLINE: Fed Noted in December That a Cut Was Needed 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1 

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers agreed at their meeting in December that they might have to cut interest rates sharply, but they were not prepared to do so at the time, minutes of the meeting showed today.
 Members of the Federal Open Market Committee felt they lacked enough evidence to lower rates in December, but by Jan. 3 they agreed unanimously that "prompt and forceful policy action sooner and larger than expected by financial markets" was needed, according to minutes from the Dec. 19 policy meeting and a Jan. 3 conference call. 
 Even though a few members of the committee wanted to cut rates right away, "they could accept a delay in light of prevailing uncertainties about the prospective performance of the economy," the minutes said. 
As usual, the minutes did not specify how many or which members of the group -- which includes the five executive governors and presidents of regional Fed banks who vote on a rotating basis -- were pushing for an immediate rate cut.
In the end, the Fed held rates steady in December but issued a clear warning in its so-called statement of risks that an excessive slowdown was the main risk, a sharp shift from its previous stance that inflationary overheating was the key threat to the record expansion, now in its 10th year. The revised statement of risks "could strengthen expectations regarding future monetary policy easing to an extent that was difficult to predict and could generate sizable reaction in financial markets," policy makers agreed in December.
On Jan. 3, the Fed cut its target rate on overnight loans between banks a half percentage point in a relatively rare intermeeting move -- the first since late 1998 --that surprised global markets and briefly sent stocks soaring.
The January move was followed by an additional half-point cut on Wednesday, which lowered the key federal funds rate to 5.5 percent from 6 percent. The Fed continued to stand by its warning that it was ready to cut rates further if necessary.
At their December session, the policy makers noted the economy had slowed significantly, albeit from an "unsustainably high" and potentially inflationary pace earlier in 2000.
That had helped keep inflation in check, a factor that Fed policy makers agreed would ease the path toward swift interest-rate cuts if the economic picture continued to darken.

HEADLINE: Factory Index Shows Output At Its Lowest In a Decade 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
American manufacturers cut production sharply in January, sending an index of their activity to a level not reached since the recession of a decade ago, a trade group reported yesterday.
 The report by the trade group, the National Association of Purchasing Management, was released two days after another group, the Conference Board, said its measure of consumer confidence in December had its largest monthly decline in more than a decade. Such signs of a slowing economy led the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates twice last month, most recently on Wednesday, to try to bolster consumer spending. 
 While personal income grew rapidly in December, Americans remained cautious about spending, the Commerce Department said in a separate report yesterday. That was one reason the economy grew at its slowest rate in five years in the last three months of 2000. But with little serious threat of inflation, economists said consumer confidence, and eventually the broader economy, might improve now that the Fed has lowered its benchmark interest rate. 
"Monetary policy tends to have a fairly long lag," said Calvin Schnure, senior economist for J. P. Morgan Chase. Still, "there could be some immediate effect on confidence."
The purchasing managers' index fell below what that trade group termed the break-even point, the level below which the drop in manufacturing would hurt the economy as a whole, for the first time since 1991.
The index stood at 41.2 for January, its lowest point since the 40.8 recorded in March 1991 and down from an adjusted 44.3 in December. A reading above 50 would indicate increased activity by industrial companies and suggest growth in manufacturing. The index has not been above 50 since July.
The group's report suggested that production, new orders, employment and exports were contracting while the prices of raw materials were increasing, a development that would worry economists more if inflation was seen as a bigger threat.
"This is the sixth month that manufacturing has failed to grow, which technically by our numbers would indicate a recession," said Norbert J. Ore, chairman of the committee that publishes the report. "It brings to an end the longest economic run of growth that we've seen in history."
The purchasing-managers index has fallen steadily since late 1999 as manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of the economic output in the United States, has been hit with higher energy costs and a stronger dollar, which in turn, hurts exports. This came as corporate earnings, stock prices and most economic indicators were faring well. 
The production component of the overall index fell to 37.9, its lowest point since the 37.2 reported in May 1982, when the economy was struggling to emerge from a recession.
"One of the reasons we're less likely to go into a recession is that inventory buildup has not been as great," said David Huether, an economist for the National Association of Manufacturers, another industry group. Increased efficiency in purchasing methods has curtailed unintentional inventory buildup, Mr. Huether said.
An unprecedented 10-year economic expansion fueled by business investment is not over, he said, but "those lower interest rates probably aren't going to spill over to the economy for another four months or so."
Heartened by their new-found ability to refinance loans, consumers could return to buying durable goods like refrigerators and cars, items that are easy to put off buying when times are hard. Many people avoided such purchases in December, according to figures released yesterday by the Commerce Department.
Personal income increased $36.6 billion, or 0.4 percent, in December, while personal spending rose $19.4 billion, or 0.3 percent. Personal spending has risen at the same rate for three months, but is down from an 0.8 percent pace in September.
Interest rate cuts alone will not necessarily inspire consumer confidence, economists said. Low inflation and a steady stock market will also play a role, they said.
Consumer confidence has also been hurt by corporate efforts to increase investor confidence.
Even though businesses slashed costs and consumers cut back, construction spending rose 0.6 percent in December, to an annual rate of $811.5 billion, compared with a 0.2 percent gain in November, the Commerce Department reported. But government spending contributed to much of this increase.

Economic Mood Brightens In Europe as It Sours in U.S.
Even as the economic mood of Americans has shifted almost overnight from exuberance to anxiety, Europe has emerged as an oasis of tranquillity and prosperity.
 Europe now stands a good chance of outpacing its economic rival by a significant margin. Consumer confidence is running at nearly record levels across most of the Continent and European unemployment, stuck for much of the decade above 10 percent, is now at its lowest level since 1991. Page A1. 

Verizon and Sprint Post Results
Verizon Communications said that its fourth-quarter earnings rose 1.3 percent while Sprint reported an 11 percent decline in profit. Verizon, which spent more to add long-distance customers in New York and sell more data and wireless services, met Wall Street expectations. Sprint, which was hurt by a decline in long-distance sales, exceeded analysts' estimates. Shares of Verizon rose 5 cents, to $55, while Sprint fell 25 cents, to $24.55. C5.

Japan Banks Told Not to Expect Aid
Hakuo Yanagisawa, the head of Japan's Financial Services Agency, said that banks and their corporate customers should not expect additional government aid.

HEADLINE: Report on States Finds New York Is Not Stacking Up the Way It Used To 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
New Yorkers still smarting over being trounced by Maryland now face another blow to their battered pride: evidence that other states are beating out New York on a host of nonfootball measures, economic and social.
 Georgia's population and economy have been growing far faster than New York's. In Texas, earnings have been rising faster and taxes falling faster, too. Connecticut has a better-educated population, California residents receive more patents and Massachusetts has far fewer people without health insurance. 
 All this information was compiled by the Citizens Budget Committee, a nonpartisan New York civic group that compared New York with the nine other most populous states (New York is No. 3), as well as Connecticut and Massachusetts. 
What it found was "a mixed picture, but not as bright as anyone expected," said Charles Brecher, research director for the group. "There were some bright spots, but a slightly greater number of not-so-bright spots."
Gov. George E. Pataki's administration criticized the report as misleading. 
"It's out of date and very emphatically a shoddy piece of work," said Stephen Kagann, the governor's chief economist. "It completely mischaracterizes the state of the economy." For example, the report used 1988 data on the growth of the state economy, he said, but more recent estimates would show New York's growth far above the national average. 
The Empire State still rules in some areas: its very low rate of crimes against property, its steep drop in violent crime and its increasing attractiveness to foreign tourists. (If you count those who arrive at Newark International Airport, as well as at Kennedy and La Guardia, New York actually had more international visitors than California in 1999.)
As Governor Pataki likes to point out, New York has slashed its state and local taxes; its 11 percent drop between 1993 and 1998 is second only to Texas's, according to the report. But as the governor's Democratic rivals in the coming election will stress, the state and local tax burden in 1998 was still the heaviest of any rival state and far above the national average.
Quite a few of the results were just plain bleak. In 1999, New York had the highest percentage of people living in poverty and the highest percentage of families receiving welfare, and was second only to Connecticut in the increase of those without health insurance over a five-year period. Electricity was more expensive in New York than in the other states, at least as of 1998, and construction of everything except housing was the least robust.
Most striking of all is what has happened to the state's population, according to the census estimates cited in the report. Far more residents have left New York than any other state in the group -- twice as many as left California in 1998 and 1999, for example -- and on a percentage basis, New York's losses are the steepest, at almost 6 percent over the five years ending in June 1999. California's domestic migration, as statisticians put it, was a loss of about 3 percent during the same period; Georgia, meanwhile, gained more than 5 percent.
That matters, in part because "In a nation where people are free to move, perhaps the most intuitively sensible indicator of an area's competitiveness is its population size," the report said. "If many people want to live in a place, it must be doing something right; if few people choose to live there, then it is, by definition, unattractive."
Of course, New York also attracted immigrants from overseas, at rates second only to California's. Almost 104,000 people from abroad moved to New York in the 12-month period ending with June 1999; in the five years ending with June 1999, overseas immigrants added 3.2 percent to the state's population, according to census estimates. That, along with births that outnumbered deaths, helped increase New York's population by 0.2 percent; the only state that fared worse was Pennsylvania, which lost population.
To be sure, data from the 2000 census suggests that the state's population problems may have been overstated in the report. Detailed breakdowns of domestic and international migration are not yet available. But broadly, the census found that over the last decade, the state's population had grown 5.5 percent, rather than the 1.1 percent increase the census bureau estimated in 1999.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 6, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about a report that New York had fallen behind other states on a range of economic and social measures misstated the date for figures about the growth of the state's economy. It was 1998, not 1988. The article also misstated the name of the nonprofit group that prepared the study. It is the Citizens Budget Commission, not Committee.

HEADLINE: Brooding Over Its Homeless, Japan Sees a Broken System 

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: OSAKA, Japan, Jan. 26 

 BODY:
Down and out, in Japan?
 Dressed in stained sweaters and tattered parkas, the men began milling in the hangarlike building well before dawn, smoking and stamping their feet on the ground against the biting cold. 
 A few hours passed. No construction vans in sight. For most of the graying, ill-shaven men waiting around the city welfare office, it became grimly apparent that this day had brought no better luck than the last, the last but one and several more before that.
Homeless, the dozens of men who gather here each day -- more out of routine than in hope -- will soon begin to fan out across Osaka, Japan's second-largest city, collecting cans and other garbage to sell, or simply head back to their tents in city parks to sleep until soup kitchens open in the evening. 
"I've been able to survive as a day laborer for 13 years," said Isamu Sato, "but in the last two years, there just haven't been any more jobs." Mr. Sato, 53 and homeless, wore a short towel in lieu of a scarf and had on a flimsy blue jacket and baseball cap. "Now I am living in a city shelter, and am down to two meals a day. People think there is something wrong with us, but if there were work we would do it. With nothing to do, all that's left for us is to wander around."
Through 10 years of economic ills, Japan has clung tightly to a number of cherished national myths, from the idea that an economy that rose to greatness so quickly after World War II couldn't possibly be fundamentally broken, to the notion that all Japanese people are essentially middle class.
In Osaka, where the number of homeless -- the largest in Japan -- is increasing swiftly, belief in those myths is becoming strained. The homeless are taking over public parks and straining the prefectural budget to the point where officials who put the number of city homeless at 10,000 -- modest by the standards of some American cities -- recognize that the real figure may be much higher.
Even by official data, the number of makeshift tents for the homeless in the city's largest park alone rose to 458 last summer, from 159 a year earlier.
Citizens' groups, meanwhile, have been protesting about the problem, demanding that Osaka clear the homeless out of public areas and protect people better against a population viewed as dirty and dangerous. Many of these groups have also campaigned against having public shelters in their neighborhoods.
"People are always complaining, why don't we find a vacant lot to house these people in far away from the city center, or why don't we just keep them all by the port," said Yukata Izumi, an official in the Osaka Welfare Bureau. "We have replied that the homeless have a right to a proper living area of their own, too, and have begged for the public's comprehension. 
"These people have become economic refugees, and the basic problem is that when the economy is bad, there is no work, and people without work will eventually become homeless."
According to government data released this week, the monthly unemployment rate in 2000 was 4.7 percent, tying a record set the previous year. 
Layoffs as a result of Japan's prolonged economic downturn have hit middle-aged men particularly hard. In a society where lifetime employment was the postwar standard in many industries, the loss of a job at that stage of life leaves people with little chance of starting over.
Osaka may have the largest number of homeless, but they are present and visible these days in every major Japanese city -- from Tokyo, where they sleep under bridges or build cardboard hovels along riverbanks, to Yokohama, Nagoya, Kobe and Kyoto. According to city estimates, there were 5,700 homeless in Tokyo as of late last year. But people who work with the homeless say their true numbers are most likely twice or even triple that.
The reaction of Japan's local and national governments clearly betrays their inexperience in dealing with the issue.
Pressed into action late last year by angry citizens to remove the tents of homeless people from Osaka's biggest park, Nagai Koen, the welfare bureau built a state-of-the-art shelter within the park. But the shelter's presence in the huge wooded site, which contains ponds, museums and sporting areas, quickly became an issue itself. The city government, under duress, promised to remove the glistening new shelter within three years, and not to allow the homeless to return.
But even as they repeat that pledge, city officials remain at something of a loss to explain how they will fulfill it.
A watchman guards the entrance to the shelter, an impressively neat collection of brushed aluminum structures on the edge of the park. 
Takafumi Katagiri, the deputy director, explains that the 250-bed center opened in December and began filling up quickly until it reached about half capacity. Since then, new arrivals have just about matched departures.
The center offers spotless living quarters with showers, televisions and laundry areas that would be welcomed in many an American university town. 
There is even a kennel where the residents can keep their pets. Still, many of the homeless living in the park remain suspicious of the program, and say they cherish their independence most of all.
In theory, Mr. Katagiri said, the homeless residents can save enough money from their odd jobs to move out eventually and find homes of their own. 
"The one thing that is sure is that this is a temporary structure, and after three years it will be removed," he said. "We are hoping they will find alternatives; otherwise they will back on the streets. But we have promised the neighbors that they won't be back in the park, and if need be, we will stop them from putting up tents."
So far, Kitashiro Naomichi, a 55-year-old homeless man and longtime resident of the park, has resisted the calls to come live in the new shelter. Just five minutes away by foot, the place he calls home is a jumble of heavy blue plastic sheeting thrown up against a park wall and anchored with old car batteries. He has also built a small wooden home for his two large puppies, who tussle with each other aggressively, paying little heed to a stranger.
"If I had a job, I wouldn't be here," said Mr. Naomichi, who warmed himself by a fire made from trash as a university track team jogged by in the stiff morning cold. "But I make a living O.K. collecting things that other people have thrown away, and it suits me here just fine."
More than social welfare, Mr. Naomichi indicated that he craved the consideration of others, all the more since he lost contact with his family several years ago because of their deep and mutual shame over his condition.
"I realize that many people worry about us being in the park," he said. "But some people have been very friendly nonetheless, offering me money and clothes, and sometimes food for my dogs. I would really like to speak to my family, but whenever I make up my mind to call them, as soon as I hear a voice on the other end, I hang up."

HEADLINE: As American Economy Slows, Europeans Suddenly Feel Flush 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Feb. 1 

 BODY:
Even as the economic mood of Americans has shifted almost overnight from exuberance to anxiety, Europe has emerged as an oasis of tranquillity and prosperity.
 After years of lagging far behind the United States, Europe now stands a good chance of outpacing its economic rival by a significant margin. Consumer confidence, which has plunged to its lowest level since 1993 in the United States, is running at nearly record levels across most of the Continent. European unemployment, stuck for much of the decade above 10 percent, is now at its lowest level since 1991. 
It is not a boom, at least not yet. What constitutes a wonderful year in Europe -- growth of 3.4 percent for 2000 and overall unemployment down to about 8.7 percent -- would not long ago have been considered mediocre if not depressing in the United States, where annual growth has averaged about 4.5 percent the last several years and joblessness is now only 4 percent. 
But mood is largely a matter of perspective, and the contrast could not be more stark. While many Americans fear their spectacular boom may be ending, most Europeans feel they are finally shaking free of their doldrums.
European markets have become more open and competitive and European companies have emulated many American practices to help deliver better performance. State-owned monopolies have been privatized and stripped of their protections. Governments are lowering taxes, at least modestly. Wage increases have slowed to a crawl and labor markets have become more flexible, as companies skirt traditional job-protection rules by hiring part-time and temporary workers.
Yet even as the United States struggles with a slowing economy, few experts believe Europe can jump in to fill the gap for the global economy. Most economists believe Europe's long-term potential growth is still significantly lower than that of the United States. And neither European consumers nor corporations have the same lust for imported goods that helped pull Asian countries out of crisis two years ago.
"If we were to get into a global recession, I do not think Europe would be strong enough to play the consumer of last resort," said Christel Rendu, who analyzes European business-cycles for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "I doubt that it could pull the world out of a recession."
At the same time, Japan remains mired in a decade-long slump that shows no signs of ending, and the rest of Asia, while on the rebound from its financial turmoil of a few years ago, is not strong enough to keep growing without a healthy American economy.
Indeed, many business executives here base their current optimism on the assumption that the American economy will start recovering by the second half of this year.
"The United States is the only real consumer market," said Wolfgang Ley, chief executive of Escada, which designs and sells fashion clothing around the world. "No other country can pull itself out of a recession as fast as America."
Many European companies, in fact, have more reasons than ever to worry about the United States, not because of exports but because they have bought major American companies. From DaimlerChrysler and British Petroleum to Unilever, European companies have spent hundreds of billions of dollars buying American corporations the last few years. For companies like DaimlerChrysler, which lost about $1.7 billion at Chrysler last year, America means heartburn. But over the longer term, many economists argue, Europe's underlying potential for growth will remain lower than that of the United States.
For one thing, Europe's population is not growing, which means comparatively fewer consumers and workers. And even though unemployment is still a major problem, many countries have acute shortages of skilled workers and some are short workers in all fields.
Beyond that, productivity growth has been slower in Europe than in the United States, in part because European investment in new factories and technology has consistently been more cautious.
"The big difference is that the potential growth of the United States is higher than that of Europe," Philippe d'Arvisenet, director of research at BNP Paribas, one of France's biggest banks, said. "In the U.S., because you have had 10 years of very dynamic investment, you have a great deal of added capacity. As a result, the potential growth ishigher than in Europe."
But given how dark the mood has long been in Europe, the current pace feels just fine to a lot of people. It may or may not be a coincidence, but Mr. Ley of Escada said that European women had abruptly lost their interest in fairly cheerless, minimalist clothing.
"There is a comeback in flamboyant colors, rich materials that have the feeling of luxury," he said. "It might be an expression of new excitement."
To Mr. d'Arvisenet, the new excitement is evident, too. "What we experienced in Europe for two-thirds of the last decade is a rate of growth of about 1.5 percent," he said. "Coming from 1.5 percent to 3 percent, suddenly everything is fine," creating, he added, "a big difference in climate."
Perhaps the most important reason for the shift has been a significant change in labor markets. Europe suffered from double-digit unemployment and generated almost no additional jobs for seven long years, from 1993 until June 1999. Since then, unemployment has dropped to 8.7 percent and is now at the lowest level since 1991.
Much of the reason is that Europe's once-powerful unions have become weaker and settled for wage increases that are actually lower than the rate of inflation. Equally important, employers have been able to escape the rigidity of the tough European job-protection rules by hiring temporary and part-time workers.
Ms. Rendu, of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, argued that these changes had fundamentally changed the hiring equation in Europe. By 2007, she predicted, joblessness in Europe could drop as low as 5.7 percent.
European analysts and government leaders believe that growth across the 12 nations that have adopted the euro will slow from 3.2 percent last year to about 2.5 percent or a bit less this year. Countries like Germany and Italy, which depend heavily on exports outside Europe, are more likely to be hit harder than others. But analysts here expect a gentle dip rather than a full stop in growth as in the United States.
"The United States is slowing down after a very long race of spectacular growth," said Carlo Monticelli, co-head of European research at Deutsche Bank. "In Europe, we are in a situation where the good phase is just starting."
The contrast between prospects in Europe and the United States was highlighted today by the European Central Bank, which decided against following the Federal Reserve's move on Tuesday to reduce interest rates in the United States. Wim Duisenberg, president of the European Central Bank, told reporters at a news conference here today that conditions in Europe remained "broadly favorable" and that European economic prospects would mainly be determined by "domestic factors."
Stefan Bergheim, who follows European economics for Merrill Lynch in Frankfurt, said Europe differed from the United States in several basic ways right now. The first is that both consumer and business confidence are running at nearly record highs across Europe. Even in Germany, which depends heavily on exports of industrial goods and was severely set back by the Asian financial crises in 1998, recent surveys show that confidence is running far above normal levels.
Many European companies believe they can shrug off an American downturn, as long as it is relatively short. Exports to the United States account for less than 3 percent of Europe's annual economic output, a smaller share than the value of exports to Central Europe and Russia. And many manufacturers here are convinced that their real growth markets are elsewhere.
Consider the case of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen of Germany, the world's biggest manufacturer of large printing equipment. In the six months ended last September, exports to North America accounted for about one-third of total sales.
But by far the biggest source of growth came from the Asia Pacific region, where sales soared 57 percent to more than $400 million. Orders from within Europe jumped nearly 40 percent in the past year, one of the biggest increases in that region in years.
"We think we are in a moment of special momentum in Europe," Herbert Meyer, the chief financial officer of Heidelberger, said. "As long as we can expect a soft landing in the United States -- growth higher than 2 percent -- we expect this momentum can be maintained."
But Mr. Meyer also added a crucial caveat: if the United States goes into a severe downturn, exports from Asian countries to American consumers will plunge and European countries will not be able to escape the downturn.
"Due to better and better working of the European common market, Europe is a bit better protected from heavy shocks from outside," Mr. Meyer said. "But if you have a big recession, Europe would not be able to compensate."

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Optimistic After Powell's Meeting With Congo President 

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1 

 BODY:
The new, young leader of the war-shattered Congo, Joseph Kabila, did the rounds of Washington today, a face among many at a Congressional prayer breakfast, a supplicant at the headquarters of the World Bank and the guest of corporate investors disappointed at the ruin of his country. 
 The main event of his crowded day was a scheduled session with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. But there was a surprise too: an impromptu, face-to-face meeting with his rival, the Rwandan leader, Paul Kagame, whose troops continue to occupy the eastern part of his country and whose support he must win if there is any chance of peace. 
 As he moved through his appointments, Mr. Kabila, 29, appeared to be a quiet figure, and in contrast to his corpulent father, Laurent Kabila, of modest build and demeanor. 
Mr. Kabila, who came to Washington after stopping in Europe, is making his first trip abroad as president, evidently trying to improve Congo's image in the West and around the world. Some diplomats said it was rather brave of him to leave his capital, Kinshasa, so soon after the turmoil of his father's death, but said he must have felt relatively confident of his support.
Wherever he went officials said he spoke of peace and an interest in reviving accords calling for the departure of the armies of five African countries that have taken sides in the two-and-a-half-year Congo conflict. Such words had been heard before from his father, who was assassinated last month, after spending his last year blocking a cease-fire agreement, known as the Lusaka accords. 
But after his 30-minute session with General Powell, a senior State Department official expressed optimism anew. The Congolese leader had "expressed a conviction to start the dialogue, carry out the Lusaka accords and then rebuild democracy," the official said.
In reply, General Powell stressed that Mr. Kabila needed to meet with other African leaders to build an atmosphere of trust and security that would permit the occupying armies to withdraw, the official said.
In his only public address of the day, Mr. Kabila spoke at a reception attended by executives of mining and mineral companies given by the Corporate Council on Africa, which promotes business ties between the United States and Africa.
In clear English, Mr. Kabila -- who grew up in Tanzania, where English is spoken -- promised to clear up past "misunderstandings" and appealed to business to return.The economy would be liberalized, he said, and he spoke of human rights and due process. But his huge country is without a functional government and basic services. 
Seasoned hands at the reception, including Maurice Tempelsman, one of the leading American investors in Congo for several decades, until the early 1990's, received Mr. Kabila with warmth but with some warnings for him. "A businessmen is always accountable for the safety of his people and the security of his investments," Mr. Tempelsman said in a subtle message to Mr. Kabila.
Neither standard has existed in Congo in recent years, and the International Rescue Committee, a nongovernmental group working in Congo, says the war has resulted in 1.7 million deaths in two years. 
On his visit, Mr. Kabila was accompanied by the governor of the Central Bank of Congo, Jean-Claude Masangu. They met with top officials of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
The Congo has among the highest arrears to the fund, with $510 million in overdue debt, a spokesman said. At the World Bank, the Congo owes $288 million and has not received loans going on a decade, a spokesman said. 
No new commitments were made at the international financial institutions, the spokesman said. 
At the Congressional prayer breakfast this morning, Mr. Kabila shook hands with Mr. Kagame, and they later met at a Washington hotel.
Mr. Kabila will attend the Security Council of the United Nations Friday. 
Mr. Kabila was trained in the Ugandan Army and then went to China for further training, an American diplomat said. He is believed to have met Mr. Kagame in 1997 when Mr. Kagame temporarily joined forces with Laurent Kabila.

2 Rental Projects Near South Orange Train Hub

BYLINE:  By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

DATELINE: SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. 

 BODY:
The first two upscale rental developments in a dozen years are under construction near the heart of this compact suburb's reviving downtown and a block from its New Jersey Transit train station.
 One, with 200 apartments, is rising on a 4.7-acre site on Third Street and will be called Gaslight Commons, after the type of street lights that predominate in the 2.7-square-mile township. The other, Church Street Commons, is taking shape in two 25-apartment phases around the corner on Church Street. 
 The larger development replaces a car dealership that formerly stood on the site. It will have 200 one- and two-bedroom apartments with 771 to 1,282 square feet of space each. The apartments will include washers and dryers, high-tech wiring and balconies or patios. Some will also have dens and fireplaces. 
The apartments will be in two four-story brick buildings, each of which will wrap around an interior courtyard. One courtyard will feature a garden, the other an outdoor swimming pool, according to the developer, LCOR Inc., which is based in Berwyn, Pa., with offices in Jersey City. There will also be a health club and a 180-car garage as well as surface parking for 158 cars at the complex. LCOR's financial partners in the project are Key Bank and Lehman Brothers.
Gaslight Commons, the developer said, will capitalize on the absence of new upscale rentals in the township as well as in surrounding communities and the project's closeness to the train station. South Orange's attraction for commuters to Manhattan has been enhanced since the introduction in 1996 of an express service directly into Penn Station, called Midtown Direct, that shaved about 15 minutes off the previous 45-minute trip. 
"With the labor market tight and roadways congested, being able to offer good train access and a convenient commute is a major draw," said Anthony Marchetta, a vice president at LCOR. Another appeal is that the project, designed by Humphreys & Partners Architects of Dallas, is in a reviving downtown, he said.
Efforts to turn around the township's 12-block business district that began seven years have paid off in the last two years, said John O. Gross, South Orange's administrator. 
Some of the projects, including the rehabilitation of the 1916 Sloane Street Station and the string of stores adjoining it, were done in cooperation with New Jersey Transit, the overseer of the state's transit system. In 1999, the area around the station was one of five such areas designated as "transit villages" as part of a state program aimed at attracting private investment and spurring mixed-use development within walking distance of transit hubs. 
Projects are in various stages of development in the four other designated towns: Rutherford, Pleasantville, Morristown and South Amboy. Among them is a 226-apartment rental on a three-acre site across Lafayette Avenue from the train station in Morristown. Construction of that project, Lafayette Commons, is to start in September, according to the developer, a partnership between the Roseland Property Company of Short Hills and Woodmont Properties of Parsippany.
Two blocks from the train station in South Amboy, work is under way on Lighthouse Bay, made up of 115 town houses and 70 one-family detached homes. Sales are to start this spring at the project, said the developer, Baker Residential of Pleasantville, N.Y.
Jeffrey A. Warsh, New Jersey Transit's executive director, described the transit village program in South Orange as "a model for the state." He added, "A project to restore blighted storefronts served as a catalyst for subsequent improvements." 
Other downtown projects include a $10 million art center that is to contain five cinemas, a 350-seat theater for live performances and a community room. Construction of the center is to begin this spring. 
The strong demand for and limited supply of rentals helps Gaslight Commons and Church Street Commons, Mr. Gross said, noting that they are "certainly the first such upscale developments since the 1980's."
Roy Scott, who runs Re/Max Village Square Realtors, a realty company in South Orange, said there would always be people who "are not prepared to or choose not to buy." But many potential tenants were not drawn to the older rentals in town because they lacked amenities, he said, adding that "people wound up renting elsewhere."
Mr. Marchetta said his company bought the car dealership site late in 1999 after it secured all approvals and the township rezoned the parcel for housing. As part of the downtown redevelopment, property taxes on the project are reduced for 30 years, he said.
Mr. Marchetta said the units would be marketed mainly to empty nesters as well as young professionals who live in the area or elsewhere in New Jersey and work in Manhattan. Tenants relocating from Manhattan are another potential audience, he said, adding that monthly rents are expected to range from $1,400 to $2,000. Leasing will begin by September with initial occupancy to start four months later, he added.

How 'Miracle on Ice' Helped Restore Faith

BYLINE:  By Richard Sandomir 

 BODY:
After the 52 Americans who were held hostage in the United States embassy in Tehran were released on Jan. 20, 1981, they were shown an hourlong video that summarized the world events they had missed during their 444 days in captivity.
 The tape, made by the State Department, ended with the stunning 4-3 victory by the United States men's hockey team over the powerhouse Soviet Union/Red Army squad in the semifinals at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, N.Y. 
 The group, which flew to the United States Air Force hospital in Wiesbaden, West Germany, where it viewed the video, applauded the most for the hockey team. "Here I'm exposed to this wonderful sight of Americans going crazy over a hockey game," Barry Rosen, one of the hostages, said. "I wish I had been there; that was my only regret." 
Rosen tells the story at the end of yet another finely made HBO documentary, "Do You Believe in Miracles?" (Monday at 10 p.m. Eastern time), which puts the Feb. 22, 1980, victory over the Soviets (and the gold medal won by the United States two days later against Finland) in the context of America's crisis of confidence.
"Besides the cheers on the plane leaving Iran, I don't remember cheering as much for anything else as I did for the hockey team," Rosen, now the head of public affairs at Teachers College, said Wednesday night after a screening of the film.
After being freed, Rosen got on with his life, and had not thought much about the Olympic hockey saga and its meaning to the hostages until he got a call last year from Brian Hyland, the documentary's producer. Hyland was not seeking any more than Rosen's views on the turmoil in Iran.
"I laughed," Rosen said. "He said, 'Would you be interested in talking about the Iranian situation, and I said, 'What?' But during the interview, things came out. It was natural." He recalled for Hyland how he learned about the United States hockey team's victory, which occurred 11 months before his release.
"If I had been able to read about the hockey team, it would have been a great thing to talk about, but it would not have had as great an impact if I were free," Rosen said.
Rosen said that HBO's use of the United States-Soviet game to symbolize how Americans started feeling better about themselves is not a stretch -- especially in what was a post-Vietnam period marked by runaway inflation, soaring interest rates and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
"That game may have been the moment when Americans starting feeling pride again," Rosen said. His wife, Barbara, added: "People were looking for something to hold on to. Things were so bad for so long."
Indeed, much like the event itself, "Do You Believe in Miracles?" is a feel-good work that takes viewers from how Coach Herb Brooks utilized motivational techniques, many of them shamelessly manipulative, to bond the team, often against him, and to prepare his players to play the mighty Soviets.
It builds the story effectively, then intercuts action with interviews to capture the tension of the games against the Soviets and the Finns.
The documentary is rich with game and training film, and enlightening interviews with United States and Soviet players, as well as remarks from people like Rosen, former Vice President Walter Mondale, and Al Michaels, who called the game for ABC.
Vladislav Tretiak, the peerless Soviet goalie who was pulled by Coach Viktor Tikhonov after giving up two goals in the first period of the game, said: "They were just students. We played as professionals and students came out to play against us. Simply, we did not respect that team and you can't do that in hockey."
Tretiak, and his teammates Boris Mikhailov and Zinetula Bilyletdinov, as well as the Soviet reporter Igor Kuperman, offer candid commentary about their formidable team's Olympic demise. Inevitably, Tretiak was asked if he believed in miracles.
One Soviet holdout from the documentary was Tikhonov, who is still coaching hockey in Russia. Hyland might as well have asked the late Leonid Brezhnev for a sitdown.
"I was escorted into this dark office that looked like the opening scene from 'The Godfather,' " Hyland said. "He said, 'Nyet.' He said more than that, but my translator was so afraid of him, he told me, 'He said no. Now let's get out of here.' "

Althea Gibson's Voice
In ABC's "Raising the Roof" (tomorrow 1-2 p.m. on Channel 7), a report that celebrates Black History Month and looks at black managers, black quarterbacks and Magic Johnson, remarks from the ailing Althea Gibson are read by an actress, Novella Nelson. It's an unusual but effective device to learning something about the reclusive 73-year-old tennis icon.
In melancholy words, Gibson says, "I want people to remember me as I was: strong, vibrant and athletic, not as I am now." About her career, in which she faced racism in tennis and golf, she added, "It has been a bewildering, challenging, exhausting experience, often more painful than pleasurable, more sad than happy."

Airwaves
ABC will experiment with a new technology capable of tracking players' on-ice speed and the distance they cover during Sunday's National Hockey League All-Star Game (2:30 p.m. on Channel 7). The Trakus system will use transmitters the size of credit cards fitted inside four players' helmets. It will send data to antennas around the rink that will send the information to computers. . . . Channel 5 has agreed to renew its deal to carry 50 Yankees games this season for a small increase above the $18.5 million fee that it paid in 2000.

HEADLINE: Energy, in the Arctic and California 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "California's Golden Dream Goes Dark," by D. J. Waldie (Op-Ed, Jan. 28):
 This energy crisis has been caused not so much by tremendous economic growth and prosperity as by the ineptitude and lack of vision by the utility companies, former Gov. 
Pete Wilson and the Legislature. They enacted the flawed deregulation system. 
 In the next few years, with the right vision and political will, there is no reason California cannot develop an energy system that can be a model for the rest of the states. Economic growth doesn't have to cause a disaster if the same ingenuity that fostered the high-tech boom is applied to energy production. 
And yes, we're going to keep our hot tubs.

HEADLINE: Power Supplier Shifts Its Clients 

BYLINE:  By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 1 

 BODY:
Enron Energy Services officially notified many large business customers today that, as reported, it would no longer supply them with low-cost power because of the turmoil in California's electricity market. 
 The businesses will be switched to Pacific Gas and Electric, which is in such financial distress that the state has been forced to buy some of the power needed to supply its customers. 
 Enron's move was another sign of how soaring wholesale electricity prices and power shortages were forcing more private companies from the country's largest energy market and sending ripples through the economy.
But Enron officials said the company had decided that it would absorb any increases in power rates for these customers. One person close to the company estimated that the increases could be as high as 35 percent over the prices in the long-term contracts with these businesses.
While it appeared that the decision could cost Enron, a huge Houston-based energy concern, tens of millions of dollars, if not several hundred million dollars over the next several years, it would allow the company to maintain good relations with the business customers, a company official said.
Peggy Mahoney, an Enron spokeswoman, said that the costs would not be so large that they would stop the company from meeting its overall earnings forecasts. Enron Energy Services is a subsidiary of the Enron Corporation that helps businesses save money on their energy needs.
Under California's deregulation plan, companies like Enron negotiated contracts directly with big businesses, in this case companies like Cisco Systems, Kaiser Permanente and Genentech, and sell them power at a discount from what Pacific Gas and Electric would charge.

HEADLINE: Starting Race for Governor, McCall Focuses on Pataki 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
Accusing Gov. George E. Pataki of "aimless lethargy" and "detachment" in office, H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller, announced last night that he will run for governor in 2002, kicking off what promises to be one of the longest and most bitterly contested races the state has seen.
 Mr. McCall, a Democrat, is the only black person ever elected to statewide office in New York State and the first black person ever to be regarded as a serious contender for the governor's office. 
 At a fund-raising dinner at the Plaza Hotel that his aides said took in more than $1 million, Mr. McCall answered the supporters who have been shouting, "Run, Carl, run" for almost a year. "You don't have to chant any more," he said. "I am here to tell you tonight, I am running."
With 21 months to go before the election, the events of this week mark the earliest start to a statewide campaign that political professionals can remember, yet Mr. McCall was not even the first big-name candidate to declare his entry into the race.
That distinction went to another Democrat, Andrew M. Cuomo, the former United States secretary of housing and urban development and son of the former governor, who told his backers on Monday that he planned to run.
But Mr. McCall ignored Mr. Cuomo, who promises to be a strong primary opponent, and trained his fire on the even more formidable Republican incumbent, Mr. Pataki, who enjoys great popularity and is a potent fund-raiser.
"The governor has done nothing to improve our public schools, he's shortchanged our public universities, he's ignored the upstate economy," Mr. McCall said. "He's failed to lead."
"It's time to turn around the aimless lethargy of this administration," he said. "It's time to replace detachment with determination."
Mr. McCall's comments signaled his intention to make a campaign issue of the governor's laconic public persona and often low public profile.
But Mr. Pataki has proved to be a fierce, often nimble political battler, and his office was ready with a reply to Mr. McCall before the comptroller had stopped speaking. "Carl McCall's political ambitions have apparently made him overlook the fact that Governor Pataki has cut more than $100 billion in taxes, helped create more than 780,000 new jobs, provided record school aid increases, improved health care and our environment, and brought our crime rate and welfare rolls to record lows," said Joseph Conway, a spokesman for the governor's office. "All of which explains why the governor enjoys such tremendous support from the people of New York State."
This week's two Democratic coming-out parties stood in stark contrast to each other. Mr. Cuomo's announcement Monday came in an unorthodox setting -- a shoe store owned by Kenneth Cole, a brother-in-law of Mr. Cuomo's -- and drew an unorthodox crowd of 200, some of them political veterans, some of them famous, but few who are currently fully engaged in politics.
Mr. McCall's party was more in the mold of a classic political gala, held in an ornate hotel ballroom. Among the 600 people in attendance were many of the power players of Democratic politics -- Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer, Representatives Charles B. Rangel, Jerrold L. Nadler, and Gregory W. Meeks, and dozens of state legislators, City Council members and party leaders. Three of the four Democratic candidates for mayor of New York City attended; two, Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, and Alan G. Hevesi, the city comptroller, who have endorsed Mr. McCall, and a third, Mark Green, the public advocate, who said he was only "here as a friend." Missing was the City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone.
Even the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, who has had a strained relationship with Mr. McCall and is expected to remain neutral in the primary, felt compelled to make an appearance and greet Mr. McCall, though he did not stay for dinner. Almost as striking was the number of upstate officials present to support Mr. McCall, a Manhattan resident.
The fundraiser also drew a celebrity element, with the likes of Bill Cosby, Shirley MacLaine and Vernon Jordan in attendance. Ms. MacLaine captured some of the evening's confident, almost giddy air, calling it "the loosest coming-out party I've been to in 5,000 years."
Invoking Bella Abzug, the late congresswoman, Ms. MacLaine said, "I haven't endorsed or supported anyone since Bella, and I talked to her last night."
Mr. McCall's supporters readily acknowledged that he faces an uphill fight -- a tough primary against Mr. Cuomo and then, should the comptroller win, a battle as a decided underdog against Mr. Pataki. "Whether he can beat George Pataki or not, I don't know," said Mel Miller, the former Assembly speaker who is now a lobbyist. "George Pataki is very popular."
But Mr. McCall's backers consider him a strong candidate, and one they can support enthusiastically. And for black supporters, there is a sense that his run represents a coming of age. "We've been planning for a long time to get here," Mr. Rangel said.

HEADLINE: Strength of January Vehicle Sales Surprises Automakers 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 1 

 BODY:
Americans snapped up new cars and sport utility vehicles last month as though the economy were booming and layoffs were far from their minds, surprising and even mystifying auto executives worried about plunging consumer confidence and an economy that has slowed almost to a standstill.
 Automakers sold cars, vans, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 17.2 million vehicles in January, far better than the pace of 15.4 million vehicles set in December. The auto industry considers anything above 16 million to be a strong month. 
 Sales were down 6 percent from those in the month a year earlier, when the industry was enjoying an extraordinary boom. For all of last year, automakers sold 17.4 million cars and light trucks, their best year ever by a wide margin. 
Good weather and large shipments of cars to corporate and government fleets probably played some role in the rebound in sales after December, said George Pipas, Ford Motor's director of United States market analysis, adding that the true strength of the market was probably between the December and January levels. "We're very pleased with January's results, but as far as I know, I haven't heard any Champagne corks pop at Ford headquarters," Mr. Pipas said.
Jamie Jameson, the vice president for marketing and sales at the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler, said that the Federal Reserve's first cut in interest rates a month ago may have increased sales slightly even though most economic models suggest that movements in interest rates take many months to have an effect. As automakers' own borrowing costs declined after the rate cut, they began offering lower interest rates to consumers on discounted loans in late January, Mr. Jameson said. Chrysler, for example, reduced interest rates on Monday for loans on Jeep Grand Cherokees and Dodge Durangos.
The Fed is cutting rates in an effort to stimulate the economy and keep it from heading into a recession. The auto sales figures were released on the same day as a report showing that United States manufacturers cut their production sharply in January. Page C2. 
Enduring or not, the auto market's strength last month produced one immediate benefit for the economy in the Midwest: no automakers announced further cuts today in their targets for production in the first quarter after doing so repeatedly in December and early January. General Motors, Ford and Chrysler officials did say today that they would idle several factories for a week or two this month but added that these production cutbacks were part of plans set in early January to reach the first-quarter targets rather than a further retrenchment.
G.M., Ford and Chrysler have been idling factories for a week or two at a time and furloughing the workers. Chrysler announced on Monday that it would reduce its work force by 26,000 people over the next three years, partly by laying off up to 7,100 people in the United States and Canada and 3,100 in Mexico and South America. These steps have caused ripples across the upper Midwest, as auto parts suppliers have also begun closing factories temporarily, prompting economists to warn that consumer spending and confidence in the region might be so damaged as to push the region into a recession.
The auto industry directly and indirectly accounts for about a quarter of the economic output of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana, according to an analysis a few years ago by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.
G.M.'s sales fell 5.1 percent last month, while Ford's dropped 11.6 percent, and sales at Chrysler tumbled 16.2 percent. G.M. prospered partly because of enormous shipments of cars to fleets; Paul Ballew, executive director of market analysis at General Motors, said that the company's extra fleet sales alone had increased the seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales in January by 200,000 vehicles.
He also cautioned that January and February are weak months for auto sales, making it hard to draw conclusions. 
But G.M. also did extremely well in selling full-size sport utility vehicles, which are mostly sold at high profits to families and not to fleets, which typically buy unpopular models available at deep discounts. G.M.'s sales of full-size sport utilities jumped 18 percent even as Ford's sales of them dropped more than 20 percent. Mr. Pipas said that Ford's main full-size sport utilities, the Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator, were not selling as well as a year ago because they are now in the last year before a redesign.
The sharp drop in Chrysler's sales was in line with expectations, said Gary Lapidus, an auto analyst at Goldman, Sachs.
Dieter Zetsche, the former Mercedes executive sent from Germany two months ago to become Chrysler's chief executive, said in a statement today that uncertainty preceding the layoffs announced on Monday had hurt the company's sales last month.
Foreign automakers had a mixed performance last month, as some benefited from new models and from the strength of the dollar against the yen and euro, which made it much cheaper to import cars and car parts to the United States.
Mitsubishi's sales leaped 15.2 percent, Honda's sales rose 11.1 percent and BMW's climbed 9.8 percent. But Nissan's sales dipped 4.4 percent, the Mercedes unit of DaimlerChrysler had a 7 percent drop and Toyota's sales were down 11.4 percent.

In Hailing Bomb Defendant, Qaddafi Rants Against U.S.
Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi turned his personal welcome for the Libyan acquitted in the Lockerbie bombing trial into a rambling tirade against the entire handling of the affair. With a backdrop of the preserved wreckage of his own house, which was bombed by the United States in 1986, the Libyan leader said relatives of those killed and hurt in the American strike deserved compensation as much as the families of Pan Am Flight 103 victims.

Senate Confirms Ashcroft After Bitter 5-Week Fight
The Senate voted, 58 to 42, to confirm the nomination of John Ashcroft for attorney general. All 50 Republicans, joined by 8 Democrats, voted for Mr. Ashcroft, a former Republican senator. While the outcome was a victory for President Bush, it was also a show of strength by the Democrats, who demonstrated through their 42 votes that they had the power to sustain a filibuster against a Supreme Court nominee they could not accept. A1

Mr. Ashcroft, anticipating his confirmation, has been conducting interviews with candidates for senior positions in the Justice Department, and now that he has been sworn in, is close to filling some top posts. A17

Bush's Outreach Effort
President Bush elaborated on his plan to increase the involvement of religious groups in providing social services without violating constitutional constraints, and he announced a program to extend more government help to the disabled, all part of an effort to reach out to moderates. A17

The boys are recovering in a hospital. New York City child welfare authorities returned the boys to her custody in 1998 and concluded that she had overcome the domestic violence and drug addiction that had long scarred her life. A1

Prison Population Declines
The number of prisoners in New York is declining for the first time in 27 years, to 70,283 inmates, from 71,750 a year ago, state corrections officials said, attributing the 2 percent decline to new policies that grant early release to more nonviolent felons.

HEADLINE: U.S. Said to Approve Anti-Hussein Funding 

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1 

 BODY:
An Iraqi opposition group said today that it had been given permission by the Bush administration to begin American-funded activities within Iraq in an effort to undermine the government of President Saddam Hussein.
 The group, the Iraqi National Congress, said through a Washington spokesman that it would be the first time that the United States had provided funding for opposition activities inside Iraq since 1996, when the assistance was suspended. 
 "In that sense, it is a big deal, a pretty substantial departure" in American policy, said Francis Brooke, the American adviser to the London-based dissident group. 
He said the Bush administration's decision to let the group tap a multimillion-dollar fund established last fall by Congress "portends a more serious approach to the problem" of confronting Mr. Hussein. 
A State Department spokeswoman would not comment on a report in The Washington Post that disclosed the administration's decision to grant a one-year license allowing the money to be used inside Iraq.
Although the Clinton administration had set in motion the plan to help opposition groups re-establish activities inside Iraq, it was often tepid in its support for the opposition. President Clinton signed a law in 1998 authorizing $98 million in military aid and equipment, but in the end his administration provided very little assistance and explicitly refused to provide weapons. Senior Clinton administration officials warned that Iraqi opposition groups were too weak and fractious to pose a serious threat to Mr. Hussein and could embarrass the United States.
Mr. Brooke said the Bush administration decision would allow the opposition group to use American money to collect information about human rights violations, breaches of United Nations resolutions and other political intelligence. "We operate in Iraq anyway," he said. "The significance is that we're going to be able to operate inside Iraq with overt American assistance."
The new administration had signaled its intent to increase pressure on Iraq, both through reinvigorated economic sanctions and support for the opposition. The administration includes senior officials, notably Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who directed the 1991 war against Iraq.

HEADLINE: Giuliani, Thinking of the Future, Celebrates a Book Deal That Has City Hall Abuzz 

BYLINE:  By ERIC LIPTON 

 BODY:
Edward I. Koch landed a $100,000 advance for a book he wrote while still mayor. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo drew less than $20,000 for a collection of his best-received speeches. But when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani went to the literary market, he set a City Hall record, drawing an advance of nearly $3 million for a memoir and a less juicy how-to guide on managing an unmanageable city.
 The deal elicited a quick celebration Wednesday night at Gracie Mansion with his publisher, Talk Miramax Books. But by yesterday, the size of his advance had the mayor answering questions about any possible conflicts it might present, given that Talk Miramax's corporate parent is the Walt Disney Company, the entertainment conglomerate that bases many of its operations in New York City. 
 Disney officials and the mayor said yesterday that the deal did not pose any conflicts. Miramax, they noted, is an autonomous subsidiary. And any major publisher the mayor might have picked would have a sizable presence in New York City and occasional interaction with City Hall, Mr. Giuliani added.
"There are no issues," the mayor said, after giving a broad outline of his two books, the first of which will focus on his professional and personal life and the second of which will be a sort of manual on managing mammoth organizations like New York City.
To ensure that no ethical questions surface, the mayor said, he will stay away from matters related to Disney.
Disney has extensive operations in New York City. Though based in Burbank, Calif., it has several thousand employees in New York, working at places like ABC Inc., WABC-TV, WABC-AM, WPLJ-FM, ABC News, ABC.com, and on such programs as "The View," "Good Morning America" and two soap operas.
In addition, the company's retail presence includes ESPN Zone and several Walt Disney stores. Miramax Films is based in TriBeCa, and Disney's theatrical division operates the hugely popular Broadway shows "The Lion King," "Aida" and "Beauty and the Beast."
In past years of Mr. Giuliani's administration, Disney or its subsidiaries have benefited from a range of city assistance, including $26 million in sales-tax abatements and other aid to keep its ABC television network based in New York, and more than $20 million in state and city loans to rebuild the New Amsterdam Theater at Times Square.
"I've given similar help to The New York Times, given similar help to CBS, NBC, the New York Stock Exchange, the New York Yankees and the New York Mets," Mr. Giuliani said, after a speech in Times Square. But he added that from now on when it comes to Disney, "I will stay out of any decisions about them."
Mr. Giuliani's decision to write the book, in fact, puts him in a league with an increasing number of public officials who have decided to mix their political careers with the literary life. But others, including many members of the Clinton administration, waited until they left office to start work on a book.
Asked why he chose to start writing the book now, the mayor said he had been contemplating such a project for about 15 years and had already made several false starts. And why did he not wait until the end of his tenure to sign a deal? The mayor said he was eager to figure out what he would be doing with himself starting next year.
"I have got to find a way to make a living next year," he said. "I want to do something interesting, I want to do something that is creative, I want to do something that is fun, I want to do something that is enlightening."
The advance offered to Mr. Giuliani -- who has 11 months left in office -- would be prohibited if he were a member of the United States House of Representatives. But there is no city ethics law that bars such advances, said Gene Russianoff, senior attorney at the New York Public Research Interest Group.
Even so, Mr. Russianoff and Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a nonprofit Washington organization that advocates campaign finance and ethics reform, said yesterday that they were disturbed by the deal. The mayor, they said, should not have accepted a large advance, or he should have waited until he left office to sign such a lucrative contract.
"There is bad judgment here," Mr. Wertheimer said. "It is ethically questionable and certainly insensitive to the larger public interest concerns."
Beside the big-ticket economic assistance the city has provided to Disney or its subsidiaries, topics related to the company routinely involve City Hall or the mayor. When Time Warner last year shut off ABC's signal on its cable television system, Mr. Giuliani came to ABC's defense. When Disney wanted a festive premiere for its "Pocahontas" film, it negotiated a deal with the city to show it in Central Park.
Disney officials said that nothing about the company's relationship with New York City would change.
"Obviously the fact that the mayor has a book contract with Miramax will not have any influence on our interactions with the city, or business decisions we would consider regarding the city or the state," said Christine L. Castro, a Disney spokeswoman.

HEADLINE: Expert Says Car Weight Was Key in Tire Failures 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
Firestone tires have been failing on Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles because of a combination of factors, especially the vehicle's weight, according to a report issued today by a professor retained by Bridgestone/Firestone Inc.
 Sanjay Govindjee, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of California at Berkeley, said in his report that tire inflation pressure, hot weather and vehicle speed had all played a role in causing a fraction of 1 percent of Firestone tires to lose their treads during highway driving. But he said that the most important single factor in determining how quickly cracks spread through the tires was how much weight they were carrying. 
 "The variable that seems to be most important is the load on the tire -- that is, the weight of the vehicle itself," Mr. Govindjee said in a conference call with reporters . 
Mr. Govindjee, an expert on how rubber and other elastic substances behave when subjected to stresses, declined to discuss whether the Firestone tires had been the right tires for the Explorer, sticking to the results of laboratory and computer analyses while offering few opinions.
Bridgestone/Firestone, a unit of the Bridgestone Corporation of Japan, recalled 6.5 million tires on Aug. 9 after the Ford Motor Company determined that the tires had an above-average rate of failures causing deaths and injuries, especially since 1997. Federal regulators had received unconfirmed reports of 148 deaths linked to Firestone tires by Dec. 6, the last time regulators released a tally.
Ken Zino, a Ford spokesman, said today that the problem was that the tires were unusually sensitive to the loads on them, and not that the Explorer was too heavy for its tires. "We have studied that, and there's nothing unusual in the Explorer as far as loads," he said.
The completely redesigned 2002 Ford Explorer, which goes on sale later this month, uses larger tires that are capable of carrying more weight. Ford also announced in November that it would begin providing customers with more information on how much weight their vehicles could safely carry.
Current owners' manuals in Explorers suggest customers have their empty vehicles weighed at weighing stations along highways or at shipping companies. By subtracting this number from the recommended maximum weight of the vehicle when fully loaded, found on the inside of the pillar behind the driver's door, the payload can be calculated. The typical Explorer can safely carry slightly less weight than a Ford Taurus sedan, according to Ford and tests by Consumer Reports magazine.
Ford manufactures the Explorer by bolting a large, heavy passenger compartment onto an underbody originally designed for the Ford Ranger pickup truck, a much lighter vehicle.
Mr. Govindjee's report did not address the stability of the Explorer, an area outside his expertise.
A computer analysis last fall by The New York Times of a federal database of all fatal crashes nationwide found that 97 percent of all tire-related deaths in Explorers during the 1990's also involved rollovers, compared with 84 percent for all other sport utility vehicles and 38 percent in cars. Tire problems were a factor in roughly one-tenth of the rollover deaths in Explorers during the 1990's, an unusually high proportion at a time when tire-related deaths were a tiny and dwindling share of traffic deaths.
A mention of warranty claims in Mr. Govindjee's report attracted considerable attention today among personal injury lawyers and consumer activists. Mr. Govindjee said that the rate of warranty claims for some recalled Firestone tires was the same as for some Firestone tires that had not been recalled.
The brief statement on warranty claims in the middle of the highly technical report today prompted Joan Claybrook, the president of Public Citizen, the consumer safety group in Washington, to call for a wider recall.
Firestone has recalled all ATX tires of the P235/75R15 size, but only recalled Wilderness AT tires of this size that were made in Decatur, Ill. Firestone has not recalled Wilderness tires made at its factories in Joliet, Ill., Quebec and Wilson, N.C. The ATX tires have been made since 1990 and the Wilderness tires since 1996.
Mr. Govindjee said in his report that the frequency of warranty claims for Wilderness tires varied little by where they were made. All of them had warranty rates that were somewhat above the average for all Firestone tires made in the late 1990's, but considerably below the average for all Firestone tires made in the early 1990's. The Wilderness tires had much lower warranty rates than ATX tires produced since 1996.
Greer Tidwell, Firestone's director of manufacturing, said that Wilderness tires had a better design than ATX tires. He said a recall of all Wilderness tires would be unnecessary.
Firestone paid for Mr. Govindjee's report and provided him with the laboratory results that he used for his computer analyses. But Mr. Govindjee said in the telephone interview that Firestone had not tried to steer his research.
A table in today's report showed that rubber tests from Firestone's own laboratory produced results that were consistently a little less favorable to the company than an independent laboratory's tests on identical rubber. Mr. Govindjee attributed the discrepancy to differences in test methods.
The report today comes as lawyers continue to file tire-related lawsuits. A few are suing automakers other than Ford, and representing clients in hot-weather places outside the United States.
Firestone and General Motors were sued on Wednesday in Nashville by the family of three citizens of Mexico , one of them pregnant, who died in a crash in Mexico a year ago. The lawsuit asserted that the family's 1997 Chevrolet Suburban crashed because a Firestone tire failed. Firestone and G.M. officials said that they had not yet seen the lawsuit, which was reported today by NashvillePost.com, a business news Web site.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Technology Dampens Stocks as Job News Sends Mixed Signals

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
A sharp drop in technology shares pulled the stock market lower yesterday as investors got mixed signals from the January employment report. Bond prices also fell, pushing yields higher.
 The nation's unemployment rate rose to 4.2 percent last month, up from 4 percent in December, providing another sign that the economy is slowing and adding to fears that corporate earnings will decline in the first and second quarters. A steep drop in consumer confidence, also reported this week, is making the outlook even grimmer. 
 At the same time, however, the government reported that 268,000 jobs were created in January, three times the Wall Street forecast. That shows that the economy may not be as weak as the 19,000-job increase in December led some to think.
Stock investors focused more on slowing growth and corporate earnings. Bond investors worried that the stronger than expected job growth meant the Federal Reserve was less likely to cut interest rates again before its next scheduled meeting in March. Stock investors would also like another rate cut soon, to assure them that even if the economy falls into a recession, the recovery will be quick.
The Fed cut its benchmark short-term interest rate half a point on Wednesday, to 5.5 percent, its second half-point reduction in four weeks. But all three major indexes are below where they were before the Fed action.
"Investors are still struggling with whether Fed policy is more important than soggy profits over the next few months," said Christine A. Callies, chief United States investment strategist at Merrill Lynch. "A tug of war is going on," she said, and that means the market will take "one and a half steps back for every three steps forward."
The technology-heavy Nasdaq finished the day down 122.29 points, or 4.4 percent, at 2,660.50. For the week, it was off 4.3 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 119.53 points, or 1.1 percent, to 10,864.10, but finished up 1.9 percent for the week. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 24 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,349.47 and was off 0.4 percent for the week.
In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 5.14 percent yesterday, from 5.07 percent on Thursday, as the price, which moves in the opposite direction, fell 17/32, to 104 17/32. The yield on the 30-year bond rose to 5.51 percent from 5.44 percent Thursday. The price fell 23/32, to 110 24/32.
The Nasdaq was led lower by Cisco Systems, which dropped $2.75, to $35.50; JDS Uniphase, which fell $5.81, to $50; Oracle, which was off $2.31, to $27.75; Intel, which declined $2.13, to $35.69; and Microsoft, which was off $1.56, to $60.81. Cisco is expected to report its earnings on Tuesday, and investors and analysts are worried that the company may have some disappointing news.
Fourth-quarter earnings, based on the companies that have reported so far, are expected to rise about 4 percent, compared with the fourth quarter of 1999. That is down from a forecast of a 15.6 percent growth on Oct. 1 and down from actual earnings growth of 18.4 percent in the third quarter.
But the Wall Street forecast for the first-quarter earnings, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, is already in negative territory, with a decline of 0.8 percent. If the forecast proves to be correct, it would be the first quarterly decline in earnings since the third quarter of 1998.
The forecast for the second quarter is now at just 0.1 percent growth, and Chuck Hill, the director of research at First Call, said the forecast should be in minus territory by Monday, when it will be updated with the latest analysts estimates. There have not been back-to-back quarterly declines in earnings since 1991, when the economy was just barely emerging from the last recession.
A decline in the expectations for technology companies is what is dragging down the earnings growth forecasts so quickly. The earnings forecast for the technology sector is now a decline of 11 percent in the first quarter, 10 percent in the second quarter and an increase of just 1 percent in the third quarter. But the third-quarter forecast is dropping quickly. It was an 11 percent increase at the beginning of the year.
Mr. Hill said he was worried that this bad news for technology could spread to other companies and threaten a recovery in earnings in the third quarter. Currently, the forecast is for 6.8 percent growth, down from 9.2 percent at the beginning of the year. "The first two quarters are already in the market," he said, "and even if they come in worse than expected, I don't think the market will care as long as investors still feel that the earnings recovery will begin in the third quarter."
So now that the next Fed policy meeting is more than six weeks away , corporate earnings and data on economic growth could keep the stock market bouncing around as the mood of investors swings from hope for more quick rate cuts to dismay about what could become a significant decline in corporate earnings.

HEADLINE: Ashcroft Gets Acquainted on First Day of New Job 

BYLINE:  By DAVID JOHNSTON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
On his first day in office, Attorney General John Ashcroft toured the Justice Department's headquarters, met with heads of the agency's principal divisions and took a drug test that is required of all new department employees.
 Mr. Ashcroft entered the Justice Department building this morning telling reporters, "Nice to be here." He was confirmed on Thursday by the Senate in a vote that ended a bruising partisan fight over his outspoken conservative record. 
 Today, in an e-mail message to Justice Department employees, Mr. Ashcroft repeated the pledge he made in Senate confirmation hearings that he would enforce "the rule of law" and uphold "rights for the advancement of all Americans."
In his message, Mr. Ashcroft said, "Together, we will move forward to strengthen federal, state and local law enforcement, tackle new international and cybercriminal ventures and develop appropriate understandings of the new economy to ensure we balance the needs of commerce with protections for consumers and the environment."
Mr. Ashcroft walked through the seven-floor headquarters building, was given a security briefing, had lunch with his senior staff and met with the heads of Justice Department agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Drug Enforcement Administration. He also met with Eric H. Holder, the Clinton administration's deputy attorney general who served as acting attorney general from President Bush's inauguration until Mr. Ashcroft was confirmed.
One issue raised by Democratic senators in Mr. Ashcroft's confirmation hearings continued to resonate among Democrats. Representatives Richard A. Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, and William Clay Jr., who like Mr. Gephardt is from Missouri, urged Mr. Ashcroft, in a letter made public today, to renominate Ronnie White to the federal bench.
As a Republican senator from Missouri, Mr. Ashcroft voted in committee against the nomination of Mr. White, who is Missouri's first black State Supreme Court justice. No full Senate vote on the nomination was ever taken. During Mr. Ashcroft's confirmation hearings, several Democratic senators accused Mr. Ashcroft of seriously distorting Mr. White's record in an effort to block the appointment.
Mr. Ashcroft testified in the hearings that he was concerned about specific death penalty rulings that Mr. White made as a state judge. Mr. Gephardt and Mr. Clay said, "Judge Ronnie White is a qualified and accomplished jurist who continues to be deserving of an appointment to the federal bench."
Today, the White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer, said members of the Congressional Black Caucus, in their meeting earlier this week with Mr. Bush, also asked for Mr. White's renomination.
Other lawmakers, like Senator Russell D. Feingold of Wisconsin, one of eight Democrats to vote for Ashcroft, also called for White's renomination.
Mr. Fleischer said Mr. Bush, who is responsible for judicial appointments, has not said what action he might take with regard to Mr. White.
"The president has received that request from other members of Congress, and he has not given any indications," Mr. Fleischer said today.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 6, 2001

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about Attorney General John Ashcroft's first day in office misstated the Senate's 1999 action on the nomination of Ronnie White, Missouri's first black state supreme court judge, for a seat on the federal bench -- a nomination that Democrats were now urging Mr. Ashcroft to revive. The 1999 appointment indeed reached the Senate floor, where it was rejected, 54 to 45.

Energy Costs Catapult Idaho Regulator Into Public Eye

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: PORTLAND, ORE. 

 BODY:
THEY have had it good, the residents of Idaho. Energy crisis, what energy crisis? In Idaho, electricity users have been paying about a nickel a kilowatt hour, the cheapest rate in the country and half what Californians pay.
 This is why: Snowy winters generally fill Idaho's reservoirs with enough water to keep the state's hydroelectric plants running and to keep state regulators out of the now hugely expensive markets for electricity produced elsewhere. The system worked so smoothly in recent years that most Idahoans would not have known Marsha H. Smith if they stumbled over her. 
 Well, that is changing, and the fact that Ms. Smith is rising to prominence in Idaho provides yet another cautionary tale about how energy problems in one state -- California, for now -- inevitably reverberate through other states in a region.
As a member of the Idaho Public Utilities Commission and chairman of the electricity committee of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, Ms. Smith is one of those faceless bureaucrats around the country whose decisions have a profound impact on the family budget. In Idaho, the job of a commissioner (she is one of three) is to balance the interests of electricity consumers and providers, a trick that, if done properly, keeps rates low and dividends high.
In her position with the national organization, Ms. Smith helps members of state utility commissions stay abreast of current issues and lobbies Congress when she believes a change in policy is vital to the national interest. For example, two years ago, she urged the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to continue allowing each state to determine for itself whether to deregulate. So far, about half the states have deregulated or have plans to do so; Idaho is among those that have resisted.
These days, Ms. Smith's responsibilities have taken on a more somber tone. The demand for electricity in California has driven up fuel costs all over the West. That, combined with an unusually dry period in the Pacific Northwest, means that the cost of electricity in Idaho, as approved by the utility commission, is scheduled to increase by 29 percent in the spring. For the first time, Ms. Smith said, the cost per kilowatt hour in Idaho will exceed 6 cents.
While energy consumers in states like Colorado, Wyoming and Montana, where prices have more than doubled, would welcome a such a low increase, Idahoans are unaccustomed to major fluctuations. And suddenly, Ms. Smith is not so faceless anymore.
"I know this is severely impacting people," she said here on Thursday, at an energy conference with Western governors and the new energy secretary, Spencer Abraham. "Any time I have to put my name on the line that causes those kinds of economic disruptions to customers, it's a crisis for me. It's a bad day."
The potential effect of rising prices on low-income families resonates deeply with Ms. Smith, 50, whose career in utility regulation was serendipitous. Her father, Eugene Hatch, a third-generation Idahoan, was a firefighter; her mother, Joyce, made sandwiches for vending machines; Ms. Smith planned to become a librarian. But unable to find a job after graduating with a master's degree in library science from Brigham Young University, she entered the University of Washington law school.
For most of her first decade as a lawyer, she worked for the Idaho attorney general, handling telephone regulatory cases. Anticipating humdrum work, which was fine with her inasmuch as she and her husband, Terrell, a GTE executive, were rearing one, then two young boys, she found it anything but.
"Two months after I started," she said, "divestiture was announced."
Her work caught the attention of Gov. Cecil D. Andrus, a Democrat, who appointed her to the State Public Utilities Commission in 1991 for a six-year term. In 1997, Gov. Phil Batt, a Republican, appointed her to a second term, which runs through 2003.
From her dual vantage points in energy regulation, she is now questioning American attitudes toward energy. The country has been too slow, she said, to devise long-term solutions to prevent energy shortages. 
IN addition to building new power plants and lines to carry the electricity they produce, the plants need to diversify their sources, Ms. Smith says. Nearly all the power plants planned or under construction will rely on natural gas.
"With this industry," she cautioned, "we need to be careful and not put all the eggs in one basket. We went from coal to nuclear and now to natural gas. We've got to create a balanced portfolio of generating assets that include renewables like solar energy and wind."
Ms. Smith also said the United States lags far behind Europeans in developing and using more energy-efficient construction materials. "Our building industry is in the Dark Ages," she said. "Americans are energy hogs. We need smarter building practices."
Her suggestions do not include oil drilling in Alaska, favored by the Bush administration. (Ms. Smith is, after all, a Democrat; "one of the two in Idaho," she said with a laugh.)
No matter what long-term solutions are devised, Ms. Smith said, they should be the handiwork of bipartisan efforts and, especially, local decision-making.
"Decisions made should not involve politics," she said. "That is not in the public interest. These things are best resolved in a regulatory setting, not a political setting. Electrons don't care if you're a Republican or Democrat."

U.S. Unemployment Rate Jumped to 4.2% in January
Responding to a slowing of the economy, the unemployment rate jumped in January to 4.2 percent -- the highest level in 15 months -- as the number of jobs in manufacturing continued to shrink, the Labor Department reported.
 But the vast service sector, bucking the ebbing tide in American industry, produced enough new jobs to clearly suggest that the overall economy has not tipped into recession. And consumer confidence, which fell sharply in December and early January, appeared to stabilize by the end of the month, according to the latest survey by the University of Michigan's Consumer Research Center.

'Survivor' Scores Ratings Success
The CBS reality series, "Survivor: The Australian Outback," scored a huge ratings success Thursday night, bringing in almost 30 million people and a particularly strong rating among young people. The performance defied some predictions that the reality-show genre might soon play itself out. Combined with strong ratings this week for two shows with similar formats, "The Mole" on ABC and "Temptation Island" on Fox, the success of "Survivor" reinforced the expectation of network executives that the genre would become a more dominant part of prime-time programming in the near future.

Report on Firestone Tire Failures
A report by a university professor retained by Bridgestone/Firestone found that tire inflation pressure, tire making procedures and vehicle speed had all played a role in causing a fraction of 1 percent of Firestone tires to lose their treads during highway driving. But the most important single factor in determining how quickly cracks spread through the tires was how much weight they were carrying. C2.

Sale of Grand Union Stores Approved
The Federal Trade Commission approved a piecemeal sale of the 185 supermarkets owned by Grand Union, a bankrupt grocery chain. Nearly half of the stores will be acquired by C&S Wholesale Grocers, a supplier, for $301 million. Royal Ahold, the Dutch supermarket giant, will take over more than 60 locations, at a cost of $178 million. The remaining stores will be split between Pathmark, the New Jersey-based chain, and Shaw's Supermarkets, which is owned by J. Sainsbury, the British supermarket giant. B4.

BP Amoco to Sell Oil Field Stake
BP Amoco said it had agreed to sell its stake in the Kashagan oil field in the Caspian Sea to TotalFinaElf, advancing the campaign by TotalFinaElf to gain management control of what many in the industry think will prove to be the world's largest oil development project. C2.

Sotheby's Guilty Plea Is Accepted
A federal judge accepted a guilty plea by Sotheby's to price fixing and collusion with its competitor Christie's and approved a $45 million fine that the auction house had agreed to pay in a plea agreement with prosecutors. C14.

Microsoft Appeal Procedure Set
Microsoft and the government filed an agreement with the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit laying out the structure for their oral arguments later this month in the appeal of the antitrust ruling against the software company. Last spring, a United States District Court judge ruled that Microsoft was in violation of the nation's antitrust laws and ordered the company broken in two. C4.

Nokia to Move Plants Out of U.S.
Nokia, the cell-phone maker, said it would shift some of its handset manufacturing from the United States to its lower-cost plants in South Korea and Mexico. The move will cut 800 jobs from Nokia's work force in Texas, currently 5,500 employees, 3,000 of whom work in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. A spokesman for Nokia declined to say how much the company expected to save by making the changes. C3.

HEADLINE: In Embattled California, Another Power Struggle 

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
On the surface, it looks like a typical midwinter here. The camellias outside the Capitol are in brilliant bloom, the thick tule fog comes rolling up the Great Central Valley on cold mornings, and Frank Fat's, the illustrious Chinese restaurant and bar downtown, fills nightly with lobbyists and legislators looking for deals.
 But nothing is anywhere near normal as California's leaders grapple with the state's energy crunch. When a mentally disturbed trucker plowed his 18-wheeler into the Capitol two weeks ago and died of smoke inhalation after the rig exploded into flames, it seemed like the perfect metaphor for a city in meltdown. 
 "Not ever, nothing even close," said the State Senate's Democratic leader, John Burton, a grizzled, profane veteran of the Legislature and Congress, when asked if he had experienced anything like the current problems, including how to stabilize the troubled utilities and generate more power long-term. 
"I mean, I have literally short-circuited," Mr. Burton said. "I got on the elevator the other day and the operator said, 'What floor?' and I said, 'Ten.' There ain't none!"
The Capitol has only four floors, and all are filled these days with anxious, exhausted legislators and nervous, grumpy talk -- much of it about Gov. Gray Davis and whether he is up to handling what he alone persists in calling "California's energy challenge," long after everyone else accepted the word "crisis" as all too apt.
"We have given the governor the tools to move forward to end this crisis," his fellow Democrat, the Assembly speaker, Robert M. Hertzberg, said on Thursday after the Legislature barely passed a bill to let the state float bonds to buy power on long-term contracts and pass it on to the struggling utilities in exchange for possible rate increases. "It is our hope that he moves swiftly and promptly."
That is about the nicest thing anyone in either party has to say these days about Mr. Davis, a cautious centrist who took office two years ago and whose biggest challenge has been how to parcel out billions of dollars in annual budget surpluses generated by the roaring state economy that the power shortage now threatens to derail.
The complaints are clear and surprisingly uniform: Mr. Davis waited too long to face the problem, and has since been too slow to propose his own solutions, preferring to wait for the Legislature to move.
When Mr. Davis initially vowed to avoid rate increases at all costs, a stance most experts saw as unrealistic, legislators feared he was setting them up to take the fall for increases that even he now acknowledges are possible, if not certain. 
Last month, frustrated at Mr. Davis's indirection, legislative leaders asked him bluntly what he wanted. When he replied that he wanted them to ask him to declare a state of emergency, they succinctly reminded him that that was his job, several said.
"The same instincts that served him so well for a year and a half -- do no harm, go slow, resist -- have now taken a bump and turned it into a major crisis," one senior Republican legislative leader said. "I think he thought it would go away."
Mr. Davis, whose presidential ambitions are taken for granted by most of his colleagues even if they doubt his prospects, brushed off the criticisms on Thursday with what may have been a Washington-Freudian slip.
"I don't have time for what I call the Beltway chatter," Mr. Davis said. "I'm just keeping my head down and moving forward. I expect to be judged in the end by the results we craft on a bipartisan basis, and I'll be pleased to be held accountable for the end result. But right now we're just moving forward."
To be fair, Mr. Davis has never been too popular in Sacramento, and most state politicians scoffed at his chances of winning the governorship against a field of flashier, richer Democrats. 
Polls still show his approval ratings remain relatively high, with most of the public more inclined to blame the utilities and out-of-state power generators for fomenting the energy shortage in an effort to raise electricity rates.
"The hallmark of Gray Davis's entire political career is that the only people who like him are the voters," said the governor's chief political adviser, Garry South. "If I had to choose, that is exactly the political reality I would choose."
Davis aides also insist that their man cannot win for losing. They recall the outcry the governor drew 18 months ago by opining that it was the Legislature's job to enact his priorities, and they note that even the overwhelming Democratic majorities in both houses are not enough to guarantee the two-thirds majorities needed to pass spending bills and emergency measures, like the power-buying bill this week. 
They defend Mr. Davis's approach as an effort to ensure consensus and say he showed decisiveness today in using his emergency powers to seize low-price, long-term power contracts that would otherwise have been sold to help settle utility debts.
At the same time, legislators themselves are on the defensive, because many voted for partial deregulation of electricity when the measure passed the Legislature unanimously five years ago. It turned out to be a disaster, because wholesale prices were deregulated but retail rates were capped, and as demand for electricity increased with no new power plants on line, wholesale prices spiraled and left utilities near bankruptcy.
Late today, after governors from 10 Western states met in Oregon to tackle the region's energy crisis, California power operators extended through Monday the state's high power alert, so Californians were faced with a 21st consecutive day of possible blackouts.
Neither legislators, who on top of everything face redistricting next year, nor Mr. Davis want to face voters angry at rate increases, and everyone tiptoes around any notion of a "bailout" for utilities, preferring terms like "cash infusion." 
The state's strong tradition of consumer advocacy almost guarantees that someone will put an electricity-related initiative on the statewide ballot next year that could roil the electoral waters for everyone.
In addition, the term-limits law means that legislators barely make it into important posts here before they must leave.
"There tends to be a concern with almost immediate political gain," said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a senior scholar at the School of Policy Planning and Development at the University of Southern California. "Because the long-term economic pain is likely to come when the legislator is out of office, gone from the capital into another political job and doesn't have to deal with it."

HEADLINE: Unemployment Grew to 4.2% During January 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Responding to a slowing of the economy, the unemployment rate rose in January to 4.2 percent -- the highest level in 15 months -- as the number of jobs in manufacturing continued to shrink, the Labor Department reported yesterday.
 But the huge service sector, bucking the ebbing tide in American industry, produced enough new jobs to clearly suggest that the overall economy had not tipped into recession. And consumer confidence, which fell sharply in December and early January, appeared to stabilize by the end of the month, according to the latest survey by the University of Michigan's Consumer Research Center. 
 "The notion that the economy is collapsing around us is not validated by this employment report," said Richard D. Rippe, chief economist at Prudential Securities. "What we don't know yet is whether the manufacturing sector will get so weak that it will pull down the rest of the economy with it." 
The better-than-expected job report seemed to convince Wall Street that the Federal Reserve would not be in quite the rush it was to cut interest rates. The central bank, in an unusual move, reduced short-term rates by half a percentage point twice in the last month. Stock prices, which usually rise when traders anticipate a Fed rate cut in the near future, fell sharply yesterday. 
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 119.53 points, or 1.1 percent; the Nasdaq composite index slid 122.29 points, or 4.4 percent.
Fed officials had expressed the hope that their interest rate cuts would help restore stability to the economy by ending the slide in consumer confidence. Yesterday, Richard T. Curtin, director of Michigan's consumer surveys, said that goal had apparently been achieved. The Michigan confidence index -- a measure of how willing consumers are to spend their money -- fell sharply in December and continued its slide in early January, but edged back up late in the month.
"The free fall has ended," Mr. Curtin said. "People seem to have concluded that the Fed's interest rate cuts will improve economic prospects in the future."
The present, however, is still shaky. The economy generated an estimated 268,000 new jobs last month, but that robust figure was exaggerated by statistical quirks. In any case it fell short of the number who entered the labor force hunting for work. The unemployment rate, as a result, rose 0.2 of a percentage point from 4 percent in December, its biggest rise since April 1999.
The secretary of labor, Elaine L. Chao, in a statement, focused on the jump in joblessness, arguing that it was "further evidence of the need for a tax cut" to stimulate the economy. "The unemployment trend line is troubling," she said.
The 4.2 percent unemployment rate was the highest since October, 1999. Black workers were hardest hit. Their unemployment rate jumped by 0.8 of a percentage point, to 8.4 percent. Hispanics, teenagers and the less educated accounted for most of the increase elsewhere.
"There really was full employment," said Dean Baker, an economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. "Most workers were able to get jobs easily, and that is why we stayed so close to 4 percent unemployment for so long. And now we have moved away from that -- not a lot, but noticeably." 
The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles the monthly figures, said that the number of new jobs it reported for January overstated the strength of the labor market, largely because of unusual weather patterns and a shift in the Postal Service's Christmas hiring. The report showed an increase of 145,000 construction jobs and 54,000 government jobs, but Thomas Nardone, chief of the Bureau's Division of Labor Force Statistics, said a more realistic number would be closer to 75,000 construction jobs and 9,000 for government.
As a result, a more accurate measure of job growth for the month would be about 110,000, the bureau estimated. Given the weakening economy, that was still a respectable showing, well above job creation in November and December.
The strength came in retailing, insurance, health care, mortgage banking, real estate, investment banking, computer services, engineering services, law, and private school education.
"The trend is still gently slowing job growth, except in manufacturing," said Ian Shepardson, chief domestic economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y.. 
Job growth has averaged 113,000 a month since November, including a sharp downward adjustment for December, to 19,000 jobs from the 105,000 originally announced. That three-month average has fallen from 145,000 over the previous 12 months and much higher numbers in 1999. But it remains safely above 100,000 a month, says Chris Varvares, a partner at Macroeconomic Advisers Inc.
And there was another strength. A Labor Department index that tracks the total number of hours worked rose by 1 percent last month, after falling by nearly that amount in December. The additional hours pointed to a stabilization in January after the sharp collapse in growth at the end of last year. 
Manufacturers, in sharp contrast to the rest of the economy, shed 65,000 jobs last month -- mostly in the auto industry -- on top of 56,000 in December.
Manufacturers have been hurt, economists say, by high interest rates, a cutback in investment, rising energy costs, over-production of automobiles and trucks, and a strong dollar, which has hurt exports.
The manufacturing sector accounts for roughly a fifth of the nation's output, and nearly 14 percent of the country's 132.1 million workers. The first clear signs of a spillover from manufacturing's troubles appeared in yesterday's report.
Transportation and wholesale trade, which have added jobs month after month, shed 8,000 between them in January. These are the industries that ship, store and market manufactured goods. In addition, job loss in the temporary help industry surged -- to 39,000 last month and 184,000 since last April.
"Temporary help had been a growing industry, and a good number of these temps had worked in manufacturing," Mr. Nardone said. "One strong possibility is that they are no longer being hired in this sector."

To the Editor:
 Re "Instead of a Tax Cut, Send Out Dividends" (Op-Ed, Feb. 1): 
 This concept appeals to me. It should also appeal to Republicans and Democrats alike. And as a third-generation Republican and a former elected official, I find the idea of a $500 dividend and its speed to my pocket a great stimulus to overcome the self-fulfilling prophecy that recession is knocking at the door. 
I also like the effect on the impoverished of our country, who will spend this dividend on consumer goods. 
Looks like a win-win without tampering with the tax code. We want quick fixes. The $500 dividend check gives us one.

HEADLINE: Landlocked Berth for Boat Lovers; 
New York Yacht Club Spruces Up Its Grand Home And Finds It Can Thrive Without America's Cup

BYLINE:  By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
They do not have the fabulous trophy anymore, that pitcher-shaped chunk of silver with the curly-topped handle -- the America's Cup. But they still have the fabulous building, the landlocked monument to the damn-the-torpedoes determination of J. Pierpont Morgan and his turn-of-the-century seafaring chums.
 "The building's the real prize," the yachting historian John Rousmaniere declared as he led the way into the New York Yacht Club, awash in limestone anchors and carved wooden seaweed. 
 The club, founded by captains who were also captains of industry, has been celebrating itself, or more precisely, its building at 37 West 44th Street, which just turned 100. 
Last week, the current generation of dues-paying sailors held four nights of lectures and a black-tie dinner dance. But they had a lot to live up to: in January 1900, the clubhouse's inauguration went on for a whole week of open houses that Morgan presided over. "It gave me new respect for J. Pierpont," said Charles Dana, sounding a bit winded even before the evening of the dinner dance. 
As the club's commodore -- its equivalent of president -- Mr. Dana had the honor of cutting the building's cake as members sang "Happy Birthday to You." "I hope you can stand that idea," he said before the singing began, "but you've got to have that goose bump moment."
It was merely the latest goose bump moment in the club's long history, which began 56 years before the building opened. Some historians maintain that Henry M. Stanley was carrying the club flag, called a burgee, on the search in Africa that led to "Dr. Livingstone, I presume." Stanley had been sent by James Gordon Bennett Jr., the publisher of The New York Herald, who was the youngest person elected to club membership, joining when he was 16 years 3 months old. (Other historians say that it was on a later mission for Bennett that Stanley carried the flag.)
Bennett was also the only two-term commodore in the club's history. That may explain why the club's board meetings were front-page news in The Herald.
Nowadays the oldest member is Briggs S. Cunningham II, 93, who joined in 1928 and went on to be a skipper of the America's Cup and a race-car driver. Walter Cronkite is a member in good standing, as are Ted Turner and William F. Buckley Jr.
Naturally, a club this old has its share of stories. There is the one about the commodore who was asked what he would put in the display case if the club ever lost the America's Cup. "The head of the losing skipper," he supposedly said.
But the head of the skipper who lost the cup after 132 years, Dennis Conner, was still attached one morning last week as he left the club.
The club was founded 157 years ago on -- where else? -- a yacht. In one of the lectures last week, Mosette Broderick, a professor at New York University, put it in the context of 19th-century New York and an economy that evolved from merchants of the port. 
"The old mercantile class of New York, the old gentry to about 1840, were engaged in the clipper trade," she said. "They were big in boats because that was how they would get the stuff back. So this club evolved from those who took that seriously. Then New York changed from a port-based economy to capital-based, financial economy. This club might not have managed to survive that if they had not had that wacko idea of taking a fast race across the Atlantic."
But back to the building where they put the America's Cup after they claimed it. The clubhouse was a house of Morgan. His 241-foot-long Corsair was the club's flagship. But in 1898, the year after he became commodore, it was bought by the government for the Spanish-American War. "This was a bit of a problem," Mr. Rousmaniere said. "As commodore, you're expected to have a nice yacht. So he built another one, very quickly."
Morgan subscribed to the philosophy that bigger was better, whether the subject was bank balances or boats or buildings. The next Corsair was 304 feet long, and the clubhouse was built on three lots that he bought and donated to the club. He also pushed for Whitney Warren's unconventional (to a landlubber) design.
"It's a 3-D building," said Mr. Rousmaniere, who joined the club in the 1970's. "To me, the distinctive thing is that it's coming at you. And it's so open. It seems strange that an elite club, and that's what they were, was so open. But they wanted you to look in."
Warren designed large windows like those on Dutch ships. "The reason we know they're Dutch ships is Dutch ships are the only ones that had windows in the stern in that distinctive bulbous shape," Mr. Rousmaniere said.
The building on 44th Street cost $350,000 at the turn of the century. The club, between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas, sold its air rights in the 1980's for the construction of a new hotel next door and began a $600,000 restoration in 1992. "The room" -- when yacht club members say "the room," they mean the Model Room -- "was black from 100 years of cigar smoke," Mr. Rousmaniere said.
Last year the club installed a 64-by-19-foot Oriental rug in the Model Room. The club maintains that it is the largest one-piece carpet woven in India in recent years.
"The rug helps a lot," Mr. Rousmaniere said. "It used to look like a basketball court in here."
Clearly, that was not what Whitney Warren, the architect, had in mind. Scientific American called the Model Room "the pride of the clubhouse," and Mr. Dana calls it "our living room," but turn-of-the-century architectural critics were not impressed. Architectural Review sniffed at the elaborate stone mantel that surrounds the fireplace, calling it "a riot of swags and spinach, icicles and exotic vegetation."
But the fireplace is not the room's main draw. The Model Room was designed to showcase the history of yachting, from one end to the other and all the way upstairs, where the balcony is adorned with a galleon railing. On the walls are scale models of boats -- members' boats. "I think they judged the size and success of the club by the number of models," Mr. Dana said. 
What about the success of the club nowadays, 17 years after it lost the America's Cup?
"In some ways we're fortunate we lost the America's Cup," Mr. Dana said. "It forced us to reinvent the New York Yacht Club and find what the strengths of the members really were. We did not let up. We brought in more younger, active sailors."
The effort to add fresh blood to the blue blood has increased the roster to about 3,000 members. Mr. Dana would not discuss the dues. "That's not something we should talk about," he said. "A person in a country club would laugh. Yacht club dues are relative bargains in the world of clubs."
But it takes more than money to qualify for this club. Socially prominent landlubbers need not apply; the club wants members who have an interest in boats even if they do not actually have a boat. Mr. Dana told of one couple who flunked "the salty test": they did not know the difference between port and starboard.
"The bonds you form here are remarkable," Mr. Dana said. "I've known people here and can't tell you where they live or what they do; I just know what they're like on the ocean." (Mr. Dana has a 70-foot ketch, "more a cruising ketch than a racing ketch, though I do race," he said. He raced with the tall ships from Bermuda to Newport, R.I., in 1976 on a vessel he has since traded in, a 56-foot yawl.)
But Ms. Broderick, a student of New York clubs, maintains that the yacht club is changing. "If you look in the Model Room," Ms. Broderick said, "they've got some of these whoopsie new boats, things that don't look New-York-Yacht-Clublike. It is a place where the rest of the leftover gentry hang out."
So is it a stuffy, stodgy, pretentious place?
"Sometimes I think way too much is made of status," Mr. Dana said.
And Mr. Rousmaniere?
"As in any organization, some behave in a pretentious way," he said. "But despite wealth and size and over-the-top extravagance of design, there are human touches that aren't noticed. A club is a gathering of people, not a building. My guess is anybody who belongs to the Rotary knows that. To anyone who looks at this club and is overwhelmed, I'd say, look a little more closely."

HEADLINE: NEW JERSEY AGREES TO PAY $13 MILLION IN PROFILING SUIT 

BYLINE:  By IVER PETERSON and DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
New Jersey's attorney general today agreed to pay nearly $13 million to settle a lawsuit arising from the state's most explosive racial profiling incident, in which several young minority men were shot and wounded by state troopers in a 1998 traffic stop.
 In an effort to quell the aftershocks of the case, the attorney general, John J. Farmer Jr., also threw out criminal charges against 128 other defendants who claimed their arrests were racially tainted. 
The settlement ends the civil rights suit brought by four black and Hispanic men whose van was stopped in April 1998 on the New Jersey Turnpike. Three of the men were shot and wounded when the van began to back up toward a trooper, accidentally, according to the driver.
The case turned the state police's practice of singling out minorities for traffic stops and searches into perhaps the nation's premier civil rights issue. The fallout from the case also for the first time revealed how pervasive the practice was, not just in New Jersey, but nationwide. 
The young victims of the turnpike shooting were quick to place their experience in the context of civil rights issues from the past. 
"It seems like we're still in the struggle, you know?" Jarmaine Grant, one of the three men injured in the shooting, said at a news conference today announcing the settlement. "Like Dr. King, Malcolm X, Rosa Parks, they took the back door so we could take the front door. But it seems to me now like we're still taking the back door."
The settlement stipulates that the state does not admit any guilt in the shooting of the three men -- Mr. Grant, Rayshawn Brown and Danny Reyes. Keshon L. Moore, the driver of the van, was the only one of the four who was not injured.
But Peter Neufeld, one of the men's lawyers, said that the settlement spoke for itself.
"In the agreement there is no statement admitting liability or denying liability," he said. "However, they just agreed to pay $12.95 million, and we think that that number speaks volumes about what happened that night."
While the settlement had been expected, what occurred here in Trenton, even as lawyers were announcing the settlement in Lower Manhattan, was a surprise. The attorney general said he would move to dismiss criminal charges against dozens of people accused of illegally transporting weapons or drugs.
In all, Mr. Farmer said, he would seek to drop charges in 77 of 94 cases in which defendants claimed they were stopped only because of their race or ethnicity, and were therefore seeking to suppress as evidence the weapons or drugs that troopers seized.
Mr. Farmer, who took over as attorney general in June 1999 at the height of the uproar over racial profiling, has been besieged ever since by the contending forces at work. There are the lawyers for a host of criminal defendants claiming to be victims of profiling, who continue to accuse the state of a cover-up. There is the legal team for the 1998 shooting victims, now headed by the celebrity lawyer Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., whose lawsuit against the two troopers, John Hogan and James Kenna, is still pending. And there are the state legislators, caught between an instinctive loyalty to the state police and a fear that the charge of racism will haunt them, who are to hold hearings within weeks on 90,000 pages of documents, released by the state last fall, that attest to the long-denied fact that profiling was common on New Jersey's highways.
Not surprisingly, Mr. Farmer called today's decision to dismiss the cases a difficult one, and he seemed to swing between a resigned acknowledgment that the accused drivers might have prevailed in having their cases thrown out, and a tough insistence that the evidence against them was sound, even if the way it was obtained might not have been.
"Let's be clear," Mr. Farmer stressed in a statement that aides said he wrote himself, and that throbbed with anger and frustration. "The defendants in these cases may have prevailed in their motions to suppress, but they are criminals nonetheless. All were carrying some form of contraband for distribution in communities in this and other states. It is, accordingly, impossible to view them as victims."
Still, Mr. Farmer conceded, there was no question that some of the dismissed cases involved "problematic conduct by individual troopers," and he vowed internal investigations leading to, "where appropriate, discipline, including termination."
He accused unnamed lawyers of chasing legal fees by promiscuously raising the charge of racial profiling in numerous criminal cases. And he alluded critically -- even woundedly -- to the hearings planned by the State Senate's Judiciary Committee, whose members have vowed to question both Mr. Farmer and his predecessor, Peter G. Verniero, now a State Supreme Court justice. They plan to ask Mr. Farmer and Justice Verniero, along with dozens of other law enforcement officials, about their knowledge of the extent of racial profiling and their efforts to eradicate it, including the handling of the case against Troopers Hogan and Kenna.
"We have laid bare the truth," Mr. Farmer said, adding that New Jersey officials had "subjected ourselves to levels of scrutiny and criticism unheard of in the rest of this nation."
"But as we attempt to move forward, we are beset by the debilitating consequences of our candor: opportunistic litigation and the disruption of belated legislative hearings which -- however well motivated -- will, by forcing us once again to reinhabit the past, necessarily hinder our efforts to move forward.
"Enough," he added. "It is time to move on, to push this issue past competing but equally divisive political and economic agendas."
Members of the Judiciary Committee said nothing of Mr. Farmer's decision to drop the criminal cases, but took issue with his rebuke of their inquiry.
Senator William L. Gormley, the committee's chairman and a Republican, said that the inquiry was actually moving quite quickly given the release of hundreds of reams of documents last fall, and that it would be impossible for the state to move past this episode without a full public airing. "If there weren't a process where the questions could be asked," he said, "how would the public feel about that?"
But Senator John A. Lynch, the ranking Democrat, said Mr. Farmer "should be ashamed of himself." He accused Mr. Farmer and Mr. Verniero of conspiring to stonewall the Judiciary Committee when it sought information with which to question Mr. Verniero during the 1999 confirmation hearings on his nomination to the State Supreme Court.
"John Farmer shouldn't be complaining about the Judiciary Committee going back and trying to do what it was prevented from doing the first time, getting the truth," Mr. Lynch said. "The question John Farmer should be answering is why are his people going around the state with bags of money settling these cases without ever allowing them to go to discovery?"
Of the 128 defendants whose cases are being dropped, 123 are already out on bail and 5 others are to be released unless they face other outstanding charges, officials said. Mr. Farmer said prosecutions would proceed against defendants in 17 cases where "there was no colorable basis to allege that racial profiling was an issue in the arrests."
In his statement, Mr. Farmer sought to mitigate his acknowledgment of wrongdoing by some troopers by defending the force's reform efforts, and he warned, "We simply cannot have our state troopers double-clutching in the performance of their duties because of a fear of second-guessing."
But the president of the State Troopers Fraternal Association, Edward H. Lennon, responded furiously, calling Mr. Farmer's decision to drop the prosecutions expedient but reprehensible.
"I suggest that without clear direction from the top, and the belief that they will be supported from the top, troopers will probably not even let the clutch out," Mr. Lennon said.
New Jersey civil rights leaders responded with mixed emotions to Mr. Farmer's announcement. 
The Rev. Reginald T. Jackson, director of the New Jersey Black Ministers Council, called the dropping of the criminal cases appropriate, but sobering because a number of those to be released had been carrying drugs or weapons. And he said he sympathized with Mr. Farmer's complaints, up to a point.
"I think his sentiment is correct," Mr. Jackson said. "And yet, even in dismissing these indictments, even with the settlement today, it does not remove the fact that racial profiling is an issue we have to resolve, not only in New Jersey but across the nation."
According to details of the settlement released by the state this afternoon, the four men will receive combinations of 10- and 30-year annuities. Mr. Grant's will pay a total of $4.4 million in monthly installments, and Mr. Reyes, who was the most seriously injured and like Mr. Grant still has bullets in his body that must be removed, will get annuities worth $5.85 million over 30 years. Mr. Brown, who was also wounded but less grievously, will get $1.785 million in the same manner, and Mr. Moore, the driver and the only one who was not physically injured, will get $912,000.
Structuring the settlement through annuities means that actual outlays by the state will total less than $5 million.
The four have a separate suit against Troopers Kenna and Hogan, which is not affected by today's settlement.
The four men were aspiring professional basketball players on their way to a camp in North Carolina when they were pulled over, and part of their claim for a settlement was based on their view that the shootings ended their careers. Today, Mr. Grant said that the four "would never give up" the hope of playing professionally. But, he added, he knew a career for him "was not going to happen."
What, the young men were asked, would they do now?
"Obviously, now we have to set new goals for ourselves," Mr. Reyes said. "My life was based on going to school and playing basketball. Now I can't play anymore, and now I have to make new plans. Do I have an idea what I want to do? Yes. But am I going to get it done? Time will tell that."

CORRECTION-DATE: February 8, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about the settlement of a lawsuit by four men who were fired upon by two state troopers on the New Jersey Turnpike in 1998 misstated the cost and form of the settlement, and the outlook for further court action.
The total cost to the state is $12.95 million, not $5 million or less. One of the men, Rayshawn Brown, will receive a lump sum of $1.785 million. The three others -- Jarmaine Grant, Danny Reyes and Keyshawn L. Moore -- will receive a combination of annuities, paid out over 10 to 30 years, and lump sums. The state will pay $4.4 million to Mr. Grant, including $2.1 million in annuities worth more than $10 million over time; $5.85 million to Mr. Reyes, including $2.15 million in annuities worth more than $12 million over time; and $912,000 to Mr. Moore, including $423,000 in annuities worth about $2 million over time.
The settlement ends all litigation; the men do not have a separate suit against the troopers.
A picture caption misstated the roles of four lawyers. Three of them -- Barry Scheck, Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. and Peter Neufeld -- represent Mr. Grant and Mr. Reyes. The fourth, Linda Kenney, represents Mr. Moore. Mr. Brown's lawyers, Douglas Burns and Wayne D. Greenfeder, were not pictured.

HEADLINE: Tapes Spy Chief Left Behind Scandalize Peru 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
They were the most closely guarded secrets of President Alberto K. Fujimori's rule, thousands of videotapes documenting the corruption and sexual high jinks of Peru's most powerful people that his spy chief used to blackmail and control virtually the entire political establishment.
 Now, as Congress and an investigating judge release the tapes day by day, they have become a national obsession, shaking the elite to its core, stunning a mesmerized public and feeding a deep popular suspicion and cynicism. 
 The tapes testify to corruption and dissolution reaching to the highest levels of the army, Legislature, Supreme Court, business community and news media. Virtually no quarter of power has been left unsinged.
Several of the leading candidates in the April 8 election to replace Mr. Fujimori, who resigned in November, have already been damaged by the tapes, which promise to define the political landscape for at least months to come and perhaps permanently transform how politics are conducted in this Andean country, which has been an important regional ally of the United States. 
The tapes were secretly recorded by Vladimiro Montesinos, Mr. Fujimori's spy chief and a close associate of the Central Intelligence Agency through most of the 1990's, who is now a fugitive from justice. They show Mr. Montesinos and his aides handing out money and giving directions to a wide array of officials.
"The impact has been sweeping," Jose Ugaz, the state attorney who is leading the government's investigation into the former spy chief's activities, said in an interview. "The presidential candidates complain that the release of the tapes is being manipulated. The public shows no interest in hearing about government programs but only demands more videos, and the videos we have already seen have changed the political scene."
Government officials say there is also evidence that Mr. Montesinos and his henchmen continue to pull strings behind the scenes, spreading disinformation in an attempt to destabilize the government, affect the political campaign and derail the government's investigation.
The videotapes released so far show Mr. Montesinos and his associates manipulating everything from government arms purchases, to the concession of mining contracts to foreign companies, to the granting of private bank loans to political allies, to the fixing of the electoral apparatus to allow Mr. Fujimori to win a tainted re-election victory last May.
About 2,400 tapes were captured late last year from Mr. Montesinos's offices and a Lima apartment as he and Mr. Fujimori were forced to resign and take flight under a cloud of scandal. Mr. Fujimori remains in exile in Japan, while Mr. Montesinos's whereabouts have remained a mystery since he reportedly underwent plastic surgery in Venezuela in December.
"The videos show that Montesinos had absolute control over the public institutions of this country," Mr. Ugaz said. "And he taped absolutely everything." By Mr. Ugaz's count, the tapes have already helped lead to the arrests of eight active and retired generals, one Fujimori cabinet minister, two senior government prosecutors and one mayor. 
Four of the Supreme Court's 25 members are under investigation, three of whom were suspended from their judicial duties this week, accused of links to Mr. Montesinos. One congressman has been arrested, another has fled to Miami, and five more are under investigation.
Mr. Ugaz said only 10 percent of the 700 most sensitive videos captured had been reviewed by judges so far because the former spy chief had them electronically scrambled, forcing a time-consuming process by which technicians reprogram the tapes to retrieve a grainy black and white picture and muffled audio.
Mr. Ugaz said he expected many more officials "at the highest level" to be revealed taking bribes once all the videos are seen in the coming weeks. Law enforcement officials are seeking hundreds, if not thousands more videos that are believed to be hidden around Peru or spirited out of the country.
Alejandro Toledo, who ran a lively campaign against Mr. Fujimori last year and is the front-runner in the current political contest, said last year that a Montesinos videotape existed showing him drugged and in a compromising position with women other than his wife. Mr. Toledo has said he was kidnapped by government intelligence agents at the time of the taping.
The tape has yet to surface, but others reportedly exist showing prominent people patronizing a bordello and using illegal drugs.
"There may be all sorts of bombs in the tapes," said Enrique Zileri, director of Caretas, the country's leading political magazine. "The only candidate who is not nervous is Alan Garcia, because he was not here for nine years," he added, referring to the former president who lived in exile during most of the Fujimori years.
Dirty tricks are still part of Peruvian politics, and many say Mr. Montesinos and his associates are behind them in an effort to weaken the interim government and prevent anti-corruption hard-liners from winning the presidential and congressional elections. "I'm convinced Montesinos is still a force in the country and his organization -- containing hundreds of people -- is still pressuring the Congress, the judiciary and the police," Mr. Ugaz said. "To clean this up will take a long time."
Last weekend, one major television network long tied to Mr. Montesinos broadcast unsubstantiated reports alleging that interim President Valentin Paniagua had taken a $30,000 campaign contribution from an associate of Mr. Montesinos. 
Mr. Paniagua immediately went on television to deny the charge, and the network suspended its news gathering activities after several journalists resigned in protest.
Rumors this week that several major banks are about to go bankrupt, Economy Minister Javier Silva Ruete said, "can only have its origin in a mafia well known to us."
A video that showed Mr. Montesinos meeting with three Supreme Court justices has disappeared -- proof, some Peruvians say, that Mr. Montesinos's tentacles reach deep into the government investigation. The missing tape showed Mr. Montesinos offering one of the justices, Alipio Montes de Oca, who headed the national elections commission during last year's balloting, a $10,000-a-month stipend. 
According to a summary transcript released by a criminal court judge before the tape was lost, Mr. Montes de Oca was heard to say that he would consider the offer, at which point the former spy chief replied, "You have nothing to think about."
Mr. Montes de Oca said he had never received the money, but the Supreme Court has suspended him.
Congress last month temporarily disbanded a legislative committee investigating the origins of some $80 million that Mr. Montesinos held in foreign bank accounts, now frozen, after one of its members was seen on a tape receiving a $4,000 campaign contribution from the brother of an arms dealer close to Mr. Montesinos.
That videotape was particularly shocking to Peruvians because it apparently showed that the congressman, Ernesto Gamarra -- long one of Mr. Montesinos's most strident public critics -- was in the pay of the spymaster to limit any investigations into his spy network.
Congressman Fernando Olivera, a leading presidential candidate and close ally of Mr. Gamarra, has been hard hit by the disclosure, even though it was his party that revealed the first damaging Montesinos video last September -- showing the spy chief giving a bribe to an opposition legislator -- that sparked the unraveling of the Fujimori government.
Mr. Gamarra has denied any wrongdoing, but he has been thrown out of his party. And an opinion poll released on Thursday found that Mr. Olivera's support in Lima and the nearby port of Callao had dropped him from second place with 17 percent to fourth place with 10.9 percent.
Other tapes suggest that Mr. Montesinos's web of corruption reached deep into the private sector.
In one tape he is seen meeting with the director of Banco Wiese Sudameris, Peru's second-largest bank, to ask that debts for media companies friendly to the Fujimori government be refinanced. In another, Mr. Montesinos pressed Justice Jaime Beltran of the Supreme Court to rule in favor of the Newmont Mining Corporation, based in Denver, in its bid to buy an additional 25 percent share of the country's largest gold mine from a French state-owned company that preferred to sell to an Australian concern.
Mr. Montesinos argued that if the court favored the American company, it would help clinch Washington's support for Peru's search for a peace settlement with Ecuador over a border dispute. The Supreme Court's 1998 decision in favor of Newmont outraged the French government.
Mr. Beltran denied any wrongdoing, saying the court's ruling was "perfectly legal."
The investigations of Mr. Montesinos have so far painted a picture of a reckless man with an unappeasable craving for money and power, with almost unlimited influence and a taste for diamond-crusted watches and beach-side mansions.
Mr. Montesinos and his associates, investigators said, sold apartment buildings and hotels to Peruvian pension funds at highly inflated prices and directed the purchases of defective Soviet-era MIG fighters. 
Peruvian investigators are looking into evidence that he might have been involved with gunrunning to Marxist guerrillas in Colombia.
His wife, Trinidad Becerra, has been put under house arrest, his daughter Silvana, 25, has been detained, and other close relatives have gone into hiding. Several of the relatives had multimillion-dollar foreign bank accounts in their names.
The tapes and investigations have dominated the radio talk shows and increased the ratings of the television news programs. "The commotion will not end," Mr. Ugaz, the investigating judge, said, "until every video is seen."
But ordinary Peruvians seem less certain that all of the tapes will indeed be aired publicly, and the tapes seen so far have created widespread cynicism among Peruvians about their institutions. "These tapes show you can't trust a single politician," said Manuel Aguilar Crevoisier, 54, a fireman in Callao. "You watch: they are not going to show all the tapes. There are too many powerful interests involved."
In Lima, Juana Hinojosa, 40, a street vendor who sells boiled eggs, potatoes and corn on the cob, was similarly distrustful. "These videos give me great pain," she said. "All the politicians are the same. They want nothing but money while we poor people fall farther and farther behind."

PERSON: Nicholas C. Forstmann 

HEADLINE: Nicholas C. Forstmann, 54, Buyout Firm Partner, Dies 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
Nicholas C. Forstmann, an investment banker and a philanthropist who was a founding partner of Forstmann Little & Company, the leveraged-buyout firm, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 54.
 Last year, Mr. Forstmann was found to have small-cell lung cancer, a spokesman for the family, George Sard, said. 
 Mr. Forstmann quietly played a crucial role behind the success of Forstmann Little, which he founded with his often outspoken older brother, Theodore J. Forstmann, and William Brian Little, an investment banker at Merrill Lynch, in 1978.
Nicholas Forstmann structured the financing of many of the firm's high-stakes takeovers. In the 1980's, Forstmann Little took over the Dr Pepper Company and the Topps Company, the trading-card maker; in the 1990's, the firm bought out Gulfstream and General Instrument.
He graduated from Georgetown University in 1969 and started his career at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company. In 1975, just as the leveraged-buyout industry was beginning to emerge, Mr. Forstmann joined Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, one of the first buyout firms and his future rival.
After two years at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, he and Theodore Forstmann, who was working as a lawyer, decided to start their own firm. With the help of Mr. Little, who died last September, they created Forstmann Little & Company.
From the start, Forstmann Little took an atypical approach to financing its deals. In contrast to many of the leveraged-buyout firms that flourished in the 1980's, Forstmann Little relied less on borrowed money and more on equity financing to pay for the companies it bought, creating its own separate debt fund. The strategy paid handsome dividends. Since the firm's inception, it has made more than $5 billion in profit for its investors and has an almost unheard of annual rate of return of 55 percent.
Theodore Forstmann gained most of the attention for the firm's success. But behind the scenes, even as his cancer appeared and progressed in the last year, Mr. Forstmann continued to manage the firm's business.
"We were partners in business for 24 years and never had a single disagreement about any big decision we had to make as a firm," Theodore Forstmann said.
Nicholas Forstmann contributed to many causes, particularly children's education charities.
He was the chairman of the Inner-City Scholarship Fund, an organization in New York that helps economically faltering Roman Catholic schools. He was also chairman of the board of the Family Academy, an experimental school in Harlem.
In addition, Mr. Forstmann was the chairman of the St. Brigid School, a small East Village school for immigrants, and co-chairman of the Inner-City Endowment Fund. He was a member of the board of Communities in Schools, which connects community resources with schools and provides children with support.
Mr. Forstmann was on the advisory boards of Georgetown and Marymount College. And he served as the vice chairman of Empower America, a Washington nonprofit group that promotes free markets, which was founded by Jack Kemp, the 1996 Republican vice presidential candidate. 
Mr. Forstmann is survived by his mother, Dorothy Sammis of Greenwich, Conn.; his wife, Lana; a son and two daughters; three brothers, Anthony of Los Angeles, John of Avon, Colo., and Theodore of Manhattan; and two sisters, Marina Forstmann-Day of Los Angeles and Elissa Moran of Greenwich.

HEADLINE: G.M. Plans Online Sales Partnership 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
General Motors has proposed a partnership with its dealers valued at $50 million in an attempt to increase its sales over the Internet.
 The automaker said previously it was considering buying into an Internet auto sales company or starting its own to offer cars from all automakers as a way to draw a wider swath of online shoppers. 
 In documents filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission, General Motors said it was forming a company called AutoCentric that would act as a go-between for G.M., its dealers and whatever venture they eventually decide to form.
General Motors said it would offer to sell $25 million in AutoCentric shares, or half its declared value, to its 7,800 dealers and retain the rest for itself.
The money raised would be used to buy an interest in an existing Internet company or start a new one, and for general business expenses, the company said.
While several studies have shown a majority of new-car shoppers in the United States turning to the Internet to research their purchase, fewer than 1 percent have actually bought online, according to Forrester Research, a firm specializing in Internet research.

HEADLINE: At Home Abroad; 
Bush And AIDS

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
The most profound and immediate threat to life on earth is the AIDS epidemic. According to the National Institutes of Health, more than 36 million people in the world now have H.I.V. or full-blown AIDS. Every day about 15,000 are newly infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS.
 The grimmest figures are in developing countries; in sub-Saharan Africa 8.8 percent of people 15 to 49 years old are H.I.V.-infected. But the United States and other Western countries are hardly going to be immune from the consequences of the plague. As millions die around the world, leaving millions of orphans -- as whole societies crumble -- our moral posture will be challenged. So will our economic outlook, based as it is on global prosperity. 
 Those realities made it shocking that George W. Bush, in his first major decision as president, took an action that will increase the spread of AIDS. That was his decision to deny U.S. aid to family-planning organizations abroad that inform women about medical options including abortion.
Mr. Bush's press secretary, Ari Fleischer, explaining the decision, said, "The president does not support using taxpayer funds to provide abortions." But that was a non sequitur. Government funding of abortions abroad has been prohibited by law since 1973. The Bush rule says that clinics in developing countries will lose U.S. funds if they even discuss abortion with their patients.
What it means on the ground is this: A woman who has AIDS comes to a clinic somewhere in Africa or Asia. Drugs to prevent transmission of the disease to newborn infants are not available there. She desperately wants to avoid bearing the child. But the doctor or nurse cannot advise her on a safe, legal abortion if the clinic wants to keep its American funds. 
Many family planning groups, knowing that women will not understand a refusal to discuss abortion, will decide to give up U.S. support. That will have drastic consequences, because U.S. dollars may provide most of the contraceptives.
The result? Families will not get contraceptives. Without them, more people will be infected with H.I.V. -- and in due course develop AIDS.
The gag rule on discussing abortion, first imposed by President Reagan, was dropped by President Clinton. But otherwise the Clinton administration's record on fighting the worldwide menace of AIDS was unimpressive.
The most shameful action of the Clinton years in this regard was the pressure Vice President Al Gore put on South Africa to keep it from going ahead with a plan to impose compulsory licensing on drugs made by the big international drug companies, so others could make and sell them far more cheaply. 
The drug issue remains a crucial test of American understanding -- and honor. It was explored by Tina Rosenberg in The New York Times Magazine last Sunday in one of the most moving and important articles I have read in years.
In the United States and Europe, the anti-retroviral drugs that have made AIDS a containable disease for many sufferers cost either the patient or the society $10,000 to $15,000 a year. It has been widely assumed that poorer countries cannot afford them, and in any event do not have health systems that could use them effectively. 
Ms. Rosenberg showed that those assumptions are false. Brazil now makes the drugs itself and has cut the cost by nearly 80 percent; government commitment has produced clinics to supervise the treatment effectively. Many lives, and much money, have been saved.
The big drug companies are frantically resisting the precedent. And they have great lobbying power in the United States, achieved by campaign donations.
Will George W. Bush find it in him to resist the drug companies? To lead a great American campaign to get treatment for the H.I.V. and AIDS sufferers around the world? 
The example of the abortion gag rule gives little ground for hope. There, in the name of life, he imposed a policy that will produce more death: terrible death.
I doubt that he did it with knowledge of the consequences. He just wanted to please his anti-abortion supporters. So perhaps, on the larger issue, he may still decide that compassion and self-interest both demand serious American action to fight the AIDS epidemic.

HEADLINE: Border Agents Reporting Fewer Illegal Mexican Immigrants 

BYLINE:  By GINGER THOMPSON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
The number of seizures of illegal immigrants crossing from Mexico into the United States has ebbed in recent months, according to law enforcement agents along the border.
 After years in which just about everything had been tried to hold back the human tide -- from high-profile paramilitary operations to emotional public service campaigns -- the number of illegal immigrants taken into custody by the Border Patrol in Arizona, California and Texas since Jan. 1 has dropped by one-third compared with the same period last year. At the busiest corridor for illegal immigration, between Douglas and Naco, Ariz., the daily average apprehension rate has dropped almost 40 percent. 
 Law enforcement agents said it was too early to describe the decline as a trend, and they offered different theories about why fewer people seemed to be trying to cross. The number of agents posted along the 2,100-mile border has doubled since 1993, and because of that, border patrol officials say, they believe that they have been more effective at catching immigrants who try to cross the border. 
Reports of attacks against migrants by ranchers and smugglers may have scared off many prospective immigrants. Others may have deemed the journey too risky after having heard reports of the hundreds of immigrants who drowned or died of exposure last year. The perils are not new, but in the past, they tended to divert the flow of immigrants through more isolated border areas.
Mexican consular officers and researchers who regularly speak to immigrants suggested that they were hearing about new forces at play. Hope, they said, seems to be keeping Mexican people at home.
Last summer, Mexicans set their nation on new course by electing Vicente Fox, an opposition candidate, as president. Mr. Fox, a former rancher and marketing executive, became the first person in 71 years to take control of the presidency from the Institutional Revolutionary Party. He enters office promising to create 1.3 million jobs and to grant additional loans to small business owners and college scholarships to high school graduates. He has expressed long-term visions of an open border between the United States and Mexico, one through which workers pass as freely as merchandise. 
In the short term, Mr. Fox aims to persuade the United States to expand workers' programs so that additional Mexicans can legally seek seasonal work across the border. With more than 150,000 immigrants illegally entering the United States from Mexico each year, those ideas will be among the main topics when President Fox meets President Bush in two weeks.
Roberto Rodriguez, the Mexican consul in Nogales, Ariz., said Mexican immigrants seemed to believe that their new president would accomplish his goals. "After so many years of offerings and promises by the government, for the first time they are coming from a president who was elected freely and fairly," Mr. Rodriguez said. "He has real credibility, and people are saying that they have decided to stay in Mexico to give him and his programs a chance."
Jorge Bustamante, an immigration expert who is a founder of the College of the Northern Border in Tijuana and is now on the faculty at the University of Notre Dame, agreed with those views. People in Mexico, he said, have been increasingly optimistic about their prospects for finding work in their homeland since the onset of the North American Free Trade Agreement seven years ago. Unemployment on the border, for example, is nonexistent in many major cities.
Mr. Fox's election and his commitment to increase economic growth have "reinforced that optimism," Mr. Bustamante said. Injecting a note of caution, Mr. Bustamante added that because the decline in the numbers of illegal immigrants was so dependent on psychological factors, it was as unpredictable as a crosswind.

HEADLINE: Energy Secretary Rejects Request to Cap Electricity Price 

BYLINE:  By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore., Feb. 2 

 BODY:
Spencer Abraham, the federal energy secretary, rejected a plea from several Western governors today for the federal government to impose temporary price caps on wholesale electricity, after listening to their concerns that "exorbitant" and "out-of-control" electricity costs were spreading economic havoc across the region.
 "I have great concerns about that, and the president has expressed concerns as well," Mr. Abraham said in response to the request from at least eight Western governors, including those of the three West Coast states, California, Oregon and Washington. 
 "At a time when demand is a very serious challenge for us this summer," Mr. Abraham said, "anything that puts disincentives in place, that would work against reducing demand, I think has to be looked at very closely." 
Several of the governors, especially the Democrats, denounced the Bush administration's unenthusiastic response.
"I'm very disappointed by the secretary's statement that the administration does not support even temporary, quick price caps," said Gary Locke, the Democratic governor of Washington. "They're really leaving all the people of the Western United States out in the cold and on their own for many years."
"This is a growing crisis that's going to sweep across the United States," Governor Locke said, "and that's why the Bush administration needs to get involved now and has to provide some immediate relief and stabilize the situation."
The meeting here in Portland was called by the Western Governors' Association and held under the polite billing of an "Energy Policy Roundtable," but there was no mistaking the tension as elected leaders struggled with the economic and political fallout of the turmoil in the region's electricity markets. And Secretary Abraham was not the only official on the hot seat during the event.
A leader who many governors felt had some explaining to do was Gov. Gray Davis of California, the state where the electricity crisis began and the one that has been widely blamed by its neighbors for creating supply shortages that have driven up electric rates by 10 percent to 80 percent in some Western cities.
Governor Davis, a Democrat, cited the bill he signed on Thursday in Sacramento that would allow the state to buy as much as $10 billion worth of power through long-term contracts to try to stabilize its electricity market. He promised his fellow governors that California would move at "warp speed" to build new power plants, after more than a decade in which not a single major plant had been built in the state, and he managed to defuse some of the anger directed at him and his state with his description of the conservation measures that he said California was undertaking.
The California conservation plan, to reduce demand by as much as 20 percent, includes a requirement that retail businesses curb their outdoor lighting and take other measures to cut power consumption.
Secretary Abraham, who was sworn into office barely a week ago, praised the electricity bill signed by Mr. Davis. He cited it and the conservation measures in explaining why he did not believe that significant federal intervention in the electricity crisis, including price controls, was needed right now.
"I think Governor Davis proved that California can stand on its own with the actions they've already taken," Mr. Abraham said at a news conference. "They've made the progress they said they would make, and I commend them."
Despite his opposition to price caps, Mr. Abraham said he was open to more suggestions from the governors, and he noted that President Bush had convened a task force on the electricity problem, with Vice President Dick Cheney as chairman.
The issue of price caps was contentious even among the governors, as at least three -- Dirk Kempthorne of Idaho and Jane Dee Hull of Arizona, both Republicans, and Tony Knowles of Alaska, a Democrat -- announced their opposition and thwarted a forceful effort by the three West Coast governors to forge a unanimous resolution in favor of capping prices.
Such controls could, indeed, stabilize electricity bills in the short term by limiting what large power generators could charge utilities. But critics say the measures are an artificial and dangerous tinkering with normal market forces and could exacerbate problems in the long run by discouraging development of new sources of electricity.
The issue is further complicated by the fact that some Western states are net exporters of power, and price caps are bitterly opposed in those states by power industry leaders, who say curbs will produce a net loss for the states, even if consumers temporarily benefit.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees the wholesale electricity markets, has so far turned back pleas to use its authority to impose the caps, saying it can do so only if it finds evidence of collusion by power companies to drive up prices. Although wholesale rates for electricity have soared at times to 10 times and even 100 times their normal rates in the recent crisis, the regulatory commission has said it does not believe that industry officials have manipulated the market.
The commission's chairman, Curt Hebert, repeated Secretary Abraham's comments in opposing price controls.
"Caps are completely contrary to everything the FERC is trying to accomplish" in creating competition and alleviating the Western power shortages, Mr. Hebert told the governors today, using the acronym for his agency. He said the caps would also reduce incentives to conserve electricity.
The governors did agree today on a number of short-term and long-range strategies to help ease the crisis, including increasing conservation, in part by exploring ways of billing consumers that encourage them to use significantly less electricity during peak demand hours, which is when rolling blackouts, which have already hit California, are most likely to be imposed. And they pledged to work on speeding the construction of new power plants. But Gov. John Kitzhaber of Oregon, a Democrat, pushed for an extensive expansion of conservation efforts, warning against simply trying to "dig, drill and burn" a way out of a crisis.
Also at the meeting were leaders of several Indian tribes, who repeatedly expressed concern that the electricity problems could unravel federal laws and programs protecting salmon and other migratory fish that must navigate the huge network of federal hydroelectric dams in the Northwest.
"Salmon did not create the current crisis, and the Columbia River cannot continue to be run on their backs," said Antone Minthorn, chairman of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, in northeastern Oregon.

HEADLINE: Bush, the Conciliator, Meets With Democrats 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER and ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
President Bush ventured into enemy territory today, meeting with Senate Democrats to outline his hopes for his first year in office.
 Later in the day, in a speech to Republican members of Congress at a retreat in Williamsburg, Va., he vowed to make the case for deep tax cuts "over and over again" until Americans were convinced that his plan would help the middle class and act as a remedy for economic slowdown. 
 Mr. Bush's spokesman said the Democrats, who met Mr. Bush behind closed doors, listened politely but were "tentative and silent" during his 12-minute speech, which was followed by a brief question-and-answer period. But after they emerged from their own strategy sessions, the Senate Democrats warmly praised Mr. Bush for the gracious gesture of showing up. 
The Republicans, not surprisingly, were basking in the glow of the legislative possibilities ahead, and talked openly about tax cuts that are even deeper than what Mr. Bush proposed in his campaign.
"I come from the school of thought that by cutting marginal rates for everybody who pays taxes is a good way to help ease the pain of what may be an economic slowdown," Mr. Bush told the Republicans, brushing past Alan Greenspan's warning last week that by the time any tax cut would be passed and take effect, it would probably be too late to correct the current slowdown. "And we'll make that case over and over and over again until we get a bill through." 
At both the Democratic and Republican gatherings, Mr. Bush turned on his charm -- and repeated some well-tested laugh-lines -- to show that he was at ease in his new setting and confident of legislative victory. He told House and Senate Republicans, who went to Williamsburg with their spouses, that he would invite them all to the White House.
"Just don't take any silverware," he said, to much applause.
Mr. Bush was not specific today about his tax proposals, but his spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said the bill he would propose next week would closely mirror the $1.6 billion tax cut he proposed in the campaign. That plan seemed a long shot a few months ago, but today, with the economy slowing and new estimates of the federal surplus rising, it is clear that Mr. Bush will almost certainly get a huge tax cut through Congress.
Democrats are trying to limit any cut to $750 billion to $1 trillion over the next 10 years -- far larger than the tax cut Al Gore ran on in his campaign -- while some Republicans are talking about Mr. Bush's proposal of $1.6 trillion as a floor, not a ceiling. 
The result is a predictable rush among Washington lobbyists to get their favorite tax provisions included in the legislative language, with everyone from high-tech corporations to automakers arguing that after years of higher productivity, they now need a break. 
Mr. Bush discussed none of that today. But he did warn Republicans that "it's important for us not to let the tax relief debate fall into a class warfare debate," arguing, as he did during the campaign, that even a single mother making $22,000 a year would benefit.
"It seems like to me the fair way to do things," he said, "is if people pay taxes, they ought to get tax relief."
The White House has set aside next week as its tax-cut week, just as last week was devoted to education reform and this week to helping religious organizations perform charitable work. And once again, the White House is choreographing events to keep its agenda on television and the front pages.
On Monday, Mr. Bush is planning to bring four families to the White House to talk about how his tax cuts could aid them; on Tuesday he is to visit a small business, and on Wednesday he plans to hold a reunion of families he met on the campaign trail to humanize his tax proposals. On Thursday, he is to send his tax legislation to Capitol Hill.
The size and composition of the tax legislation, however, will be the subject of a protracted struggle. So Mr. Bush took the unusual step of appearing at the annual party retreat of the Senate Democrats, at the Library of Congress, as a sign that he wanted to reach across the aisle.
While he stayed for under an hour and did not get into detailed discussions of policy, Democrats called Mr. Bush's very appearance before them an unusual gesture of good will and said it the first time a president of the opposition party had appeared at the strategy sessions that have been a staple of party politics since the 1980's.
Mr. Bush expressed the hope that the parties could reach compromises on education, tax cutting and Medicare prescription drug coverage, the lawmakers said. And there was no discussion of the confirmation battle just past over John Ashcroft.
"I give him very high marks for being there," said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont.
Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, said, "I thought that his remarks were very conciliatory. He indicated an interest in working with us and reaching compromise on issues."
Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware called the visit to the Democratic gathering a "good gesture," but cautioned that the president might have a hard time pulling the parties together. 
"Where are the compromises?" Mr. Biden asked. "Bipartisanship doesn't mean we just like each other. I mean, we do like each other. But it means how does that translate? Are you really going to have compromises on issues? He said he thought we could."

An article on Saturday about President Bush's appearance at a closed-door meeting with Senate Democrats included an erroneous phrase from a pool news report of the event. A spokesman for the White House said afterward that the Democrats had been "attentive and silent," not "tentative and silent."
The article also misstated the size of Mr. Bush's proposed tax cut. It is $1.6 trillion over 10 years, not $1.6 billion.

 WHILE AMERICA SLEEPS
Self-Delusion, Military Weakness,
and the Threat to Peace Today.
By Donald Kagan
and Frederick W. Kagan.
Illustrated. 483 pp. New York:
St. Martin's Press. $32.50.
 A clarion call, a sounding of the tocsin or a plea to heed history's dire warnings -- all are fair ways to describe "While America Sleeps," an unflinching polemic nested in the language of historical research and contemporary strategic analysis. A father-son duo -- the former a renowned professor of history and classics at Yale, the latter a professor of military history at the United States Military Academy -- Donald Kagan and Frederick W. Kagan adjure us to wake up lest America after the cold war repeat the grave errors of Britain after World War I. 
Britain's position then and America's today, they insist, are analogous. And both countries' leaders are guilty of the same mistakes, which are, in ascending order of severity: trusting expressions of good will, international organizations and arms control agreements to keep the peace; allowing one's credibility to be eroded by a supine diplomacy; and letting one's military might decay to a level far below that required to consummate one's commitments.
The book is divided into a short introduction that both makes the case for its organizing analogy and sets its mobilizing tone; a lengthy chronicle of Britain between the world wars; a slightly shorter discussion of American post-cold-war policy; and a brief conclusion that restates, with the confidence of explication behind it, the claims laid out in the introduction. 
Does this straightforward thesis, embedded in this parsimonious presentation, work? Well, no -- not unless the reader, already persuaded of the authors' point of view, reads in search of self-referential support. For everyone else, there are problems. One of them concerns the Kagans' use of their core analogy. The introduction, though badly written, nonetheless leads us to expect close correspondences. But in the 11 chapters on interwar Britain that follow, except for one offhand reference to a "revolution in military affairs," no analogies to the American present are suggested. These handsomely fashioned chapters stand alone as monographs, but that is precisely the problem: they are not supposed to stand alone. In the section on post-cold-war America, we do occasionally encounter a claim for a strict analogy: the end of the Persian Gulf war is like the defective Versailles Treaty; the 1994 Agreed Framework arrangement with North Korea resembles the pusillanimous conclusion to the 1923 Corfu crisis; and a few others. But then, upon reaching the concluding section of the book, the reader is told: "It has not been the purpose of this work to draw precise parallels. . . . The analogy is much broader and more fundamental than that. It is the similarities between the strategic positions of England and the United States with respect to the rest of the world and, above all, in the general pattern of self-deluding pseudoengagement that both countries pursued."
It is not clear, then, what the Kagans claim for their approach. If close correspondence is not intended, then why the eye-straining detail, taking the reader through the Chanak crisis of 1922, the Corfu affair of 1923, the approach to the Locarno peace conference in 1925 and the debilitating aftermath of that unfortunate promise to defend France and Belgium, through to the rape of Abyssinia in 1935 and the German remilitarization of the Rhineland in 1936? It is, after all, not an obscure story. But if the drawing of parallels is loose and episodic, then what justifies the conclusion that the strategic positions of Britain and the United States with respect to the rest of the world are similar, and that both are guilty of "self-deluding pseudoengagement?" Is America today "in danger of suffering a fate similar to that which befell Britain in the 1930's," as the Kagans believe?
It is true that liberal great powers are prone to sentiment and distraction when pursuing long-term strategic ends. It is also true that a mismatch between military capabilities and political commitments is a dangerous thing. And it happens to be true, as the Kagans nicely observe, that the first serious challenge to Britain after World War I and to America after the fall of the Berlin Wall arose in Iraq. But beyond that, the claims for an British-American analogy, and for fearing that America is engaged in "self-deluding pseudoengagement" -- activism without strategic purpose -- are slightly preposterous.
To take only the most obvious points, Britain vastly expanded the territory it literally had to garrison after World War I, and did so in the face of wrenching economic strictures. With the threat of nuclear war much reduced and that of a major European war eliminated, America in the 1990's had less to do, and less to do amid an economic expansion without parallel in the country's history. Moreover, Britain was an empire in the classical sense: it conquered territory and faced other empires cheek by jowl around the globe. America's imperial career is far less concrete and narrowly self-interested in character. (Why men of conservative mien like the Kagans would want to contribute to effacing this distinction is baffling.) Finally in this regard, Britain's main challenge after World War I was to deal effectively with a defeated major power, Germany. America's main challenge is to integrate other powers who wish to enter an international mainstream of which the United States is simultaneously champion and chief beneficiary.
Further, there is a dispute over how irresponsible Britain and France really were after World War I. Even the Kagans regard the two countries' confusion and timidity as having been far more significant than their military weakness -- though to accuse them of "withdrawal into isolation" seems a bit much. They also stress that it was the Great Depression that made all the difference, "that brought the most serious dangers into being" while it simultaneously "helped to undermine the leading power's will and ability to respond to those dangers." And who, at the time of Locarno, say, could have -- or should have -- predicted the Great Depression?
More to the point, however, is whether the United States has been engaged in "self-deluding pseudoengagement" these last 10 years. The Kagans think so. They regret that the United States did not take Baghdad and oust Saddam Hussein, and that it did not use decisive military force early on in the Balkans. They regret the 1994 agreement with North Korea, chalking it up to a failure of will based on too frail a military posture. They criticize the Clinton administration for a legacy of half measures in diplomacy and for an irresponsible diminution of American military clout. They cannot identify the next threat -- they can see no parallel to a Japanese invasion of Manchuria or any Hitler coming to power in some parallel to Germany -- but they are sure that the erosion of American credibility and interventionary reach will call forth such a threat in due course.
Credibility and power are important, and the world is still a dangerous place. But the Kagans seem concerned not at all about the consequences of American overextension, pretension or failure to set priorities and limits -- difficulties that have plagued great powers in history as often as timidity and weakness. The United States spends more on defense than at least the next half dozen countries in the world combined, and conducts nearly 80 percent of the world's military research and development. By most measures, American military (and economic) superiority has grown relative to others over the past decade. The United States stations troops permanently in a dozen countries overseas; its military reach is fully global. The United States dominates most relevant international institutions and is the policy-active center of global finance. This is weak pseudoengagement?
Does all this mean, then, that all is well, and that the Kagans are crying wolf? Not exactly. Their realist instincts are sound even if their analysis isn't. In a sense, they miss their own best historical point. What most threatens American security and the present relatively benign international order is not the prospect that the United States will not hold up its end of a balance of power. It is that a rogue event like the Great Depression will undermine the capabilities of American leadership, and others' confidence in it, just as it generates defections from the present normative order and multiplies challenges to it. If the American economy should go seriously into the tank after more than a decade of accelerated international economic integration, relative stability could deteriorate very fast. It could make the sorts of threats the Kagans fear seem tame by comparison. 
But who today can, or should, predict that?

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Sunset Park, Brooklyn; 
Historic Character and Foreign Accents

BYLINE:  By JOYCE COHEN

 BODY:
IT took two years of looking before Nicholas and Jill Benz Malter found a house.
 The couple, who had previously rented in Windsor Terrace and Park Slope in Brooklyn, settled on a two-story brick row house in Sunset Park, arriving in late summer with their 3-year-old son, Teddy. 
 "We wanted a nice house, something sturdy, with some historic character," Mr. Malter said. "Jill and I did a lot of legwork. We either drove or walked up every block from 40th to 60th Streets and went to dinner in the neighborhood on Saturday nights." 
Sunset Park, saddled by crime and poverty in the 1980's, has been on an upward track for a dozen years. It has always been a magnet for immigrants and is now attracting home buyers priced out of other parts of the city.
"Yesterday, I stepped outside and saw a guy riding his bike, and thought, 'This guy is scoping out houses,' " Mr. Malter said. Sure enough, the bicyclist stopped to inquire about the neighborhood.
"He asked where I used to live," Mr. Malter said, "I said, 'Park Slope,' and he laughed and said, 'Me, too.' "
Mr. Malter, a former photographer who is now a firefighter, runs or bikes the three and a half miles to Ladder Company 113 in Flatbush. His wife takes the subway to freelance editorial assignments in Manhattan. Their goal was a place both livable and affordable. "You have everything you need; the shopping is good; and we are central to a lot of Brooklyn," Mr. Malter said.
"We realized we were not moving to a gentrified yuppie neighborhood with a coffee bar and a Barnes & Noble. The services are a little bit different. Sometimes when you go into stores on Fifth Avenue, you feel like you are in a foreign city. You go into a Mexican cafe, and they don't speak any English."
The housing stock in Sunset Park is uniform: Rows upon rows of attached two- and three-family homes, most built at the turn of the century. The entire area from Fourth to Seventh Avenues and 38th to 64th Streets, though not a city landmark, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Houses currently sell for $275,000 to $400,000, real-estate brokers say, with brick or frame houses on the low end, and brownstone or limestone houses on the high end. Most homes have finished basements and yards; hardly any have driveways.
PRICES surged two to three years ago but are now steadying and even sinking a bit, said Jeannette A. Fasino, a broker at E.R.A. Okelly International Realty. "In 1998, nothing was selling," she said. "In 1999, everything just jumped. A house would be $250,000 and had to go up $50,000 because we had people fighting over the house." 
Though the bidding frenzy has quieted, "as soon as we put a house on the market, somebody is putting an offer on it, even if the house is priced high," she said.
Buyers in Sunset Park "are not picky," Ms. Fasino added. "All they want is a two-family under a certain amount, and they are happy with it."
Many homes have lovely interior details, said Delvis Valdes, owner of the Clarimar Realty Corporation. "They have all the antique woodwork and moldings, working fireplaces and old bathrooms with clawfeet tubs and pedestal sinks." 
Sunset Park also has a scattering of mid rise apartment houses of eight units or more. A one-bedroom goes for around $800, Mr. Valdes said, with a nice one-bedroom in a private home costing around $1,000.
Crime peaked in the early 1980's, said Mr. Valdes, whose parents, Clara and Mario, ran Brooklyn's Clarimar Supermarket chain. "It was really rough. Gangs were prevalent. When crime went down and the economy picked up, Sunset Park started getting the benefit of Manhattan becoming too pricey. You are getting a lot of Manhattan push outs, so-called Anglos. Come the 1990's, it became a more pleasant area to work and live. It's a nice revival."
That also goes for the area's businesses. There are just a handful of vacant storefronts along the main commercial strip, Fifth Avenue, compared with dozens when the Sunset Park Fifth Avenue Business Improvement District was organized six years ago, said Renee Giordano, the executive director.
Except for a few national chains -- McDonald's, Burger King, Radio Shack, Rite-Aid -- Fifth Avenue is crammed with mom-and-pop places: restaurants, food markets, nail salons, beauty shops, hardware stores, furniture stores and clothing stores. There are plenty of five-and-dimes and even some tattoo parlors.
The Business Improvement District collects garbage, decorates for the holidays and helps to finance building renovations. Most recently, it ran a "Keep Sunset Park Clean" poster contest for local schoolchildren.
One big effort, begun three years ago, is graffiti removal. "We were one of the most graffiti-scarred communities," Mrs. Giordano said. "It was on lampposts, fire hydrants, call boxes, gates, buildings, everything. You feel really defeated when you have somebody writing on your property."
She and her husband, Tony, who have five children, have lived in Sunset Park since 1978. "Now, we have a lot of owner-occupied properties," she said. "Many block associations don't have to meet any more because there don't seem to be the problems they had. People are hard-working and really want the community to look nice."
The area's other commercial strip, Eighth Avenue, is the centerpiece of Sunset Park's Chinatown. "Eighth Avenue is up and coming," Mrs. Giordano said. "When I moved here, it was almost all abandoned." 
Chinese immigrants like Sunset Park because housing prices are lower than in Manhattan's Chinatown or in Flushing, said Vicky Tse, a broker at LCCW Realty, where about 85 percent of the clientele is Chinese. "When they come, their relatives are here and they take care of each other," she said. Chinese immigrants often work in Sunset Park or take the N train directly to Manhattan's Chinatown.
The area, settled by the Dutch, was farmland until Brooklyn's street grid was laid out in the 1830's. First, Irish immigrants streamed in, followed by Scandinavians, Poles and Italians. After World War II, there was an influx of Latinos. Since the 1980's, immigrants have primarily been Asian. There are also Arabs, Turks, Indians, Greeks and Russians.
A century ago, industry thrived at Bush Terminal, built in the 1890's by a man named Irving Bush and covering 200 waterfront acres from 32nd to 41st Streets. The 97-acre Brooklyn Army Terminal, which opened in 1919 between 58th and 63rd Streets, was one of the primary departure points for United States troops and supplies during World War II. Today, both are urban industrial parks belonging to the Southwest Brooklyn Economic Development Zone. 
Currently, the public has access to the waterfront only at the Brooklyn Army Terminal's 58th Street Pier, where the Sea Streak ferry docks. (The one-way 12-minute ride to Wall Street costs $5.)
In 1941, the Gowanus Expressway went up, roofing Third Avenue and attracting drugs and gangs. Today, it remains a "physical and psychological barrier that separates the waterfront from the upland," said Jeremy Laufer, district manager of Community Board 7, which includes Sunset Park.
"If you have no other dealing with Sunset Park, the impression you get is there are all these sex-related businesses, because, from the expressway, you have these neon signs in your face," he said. There is talk about replacing the Gowanus with a tunnel, though it is unclear when, or whether, that would happen.
Sunset Park was once considered part of Bay Ridge, but in 1969 it was given federal money for revitalization and renamed for the 25-acre park at its center.
ITS large immigrant population makes it one of the city's finest areas for ethnic restaurants and markets, said Myra Alperson, editor and publisher of a quarterly print newsletter called NoshNews.
"It's an amazingly rich place," said Ms. Alperson, who devoted an issue of NoshNews to Sunset Park. "It has tremendous personality."
She enthuses about the Mexican, Ecuadorean and Dominican restaurants on Fifth Avenue and the Asian ones along Eighth Avenue. The park itself, which Ms. Alperson termed "stunning," is on a rise, offering a lovely, faraway vista of Manhattan, as well as a closer view of the egg-shaped dome atop St. Michael's Roman Catholic Church. The park has a recreation center and an outdoor swimming pool.
Nearby is the huge and historic Green-Wood Cemetery, opened in 1840. Some real-estate agents refer to the area just east of the cemetery as Green-Wood Heights.
Most of the neighborhood children are zoned for Community School District 15, whose superintendent, Francis J. DeStefano, resigned last month amid allegations of financial mismanagement. Overcrowding and large class sizes are a problem in the district, with all of its schools "at a minimum of 125 percent utilization," said Patricia Lawrence, the district's chief executive for operations.
"The schools are on an upward line in terms of academic achievement, but still have a very poor immigrant population," Ms. Lawrence said. "We are teaching children who don't come in speaking English."
The area's three parochial schools, which teach children through Grade 8, are St. Agatha's, St. Michael's and Our Lady of Perpetual Help. Sunset Park currently has no public high school but plans have been approved to build one on Fourth Avenue between 37th and 38th streets.
The Sunset Park Public Library, expanded and renovated three years ago, is heavily used. It stocks materials in Spanish and Chinese, and it holds after-school programs for children.
In the very long term, proposals are in place that would reinvigorate the waterfront and open it to the public, said Mr. Laufer of the community board. A 40-year plan for the waterfront includes a 24-acre park in its first phase.

He was so grateful for surviving bladder cancer in 1982 that he "made a promise to God" and created a sort of shrine with decorations that he changes for each holiday. The display is filled with signs, pictures and assorted flotsam, some of it donated. It includes a nativity scene that stays up year-round, plus assorted stuffed toys -- Raggedy Ann, Tweety Bird, Bugs Bunny. Mr. Zammit, 65, said his favorite holiday display was Halloween, which takes him three weeks to set up. Everything is buttressed from behind with milk crates, chicken wire and duct tape. "People take pictures all the time," Mr. Zammit said. One Valentine's Day, "someone proposed to his girlfriend here. They used to live on the block. Now they have a son."

HEADLINE: What's doing in Rio 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER; LARRY ROHTER is chief of the Rio bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
Rio de Janeiro is always alluring and exhilarating, but never more so than in the weeks leading up to Carnaval. As the annual bacchanal draws closer, the easygoing, relaxed rhythms of a Southern Hemisphere summer -- lying on the beach, quaffing ice-cold beer and chatting at a seafront cafe -- begin to wane and the city pulses with anticipation.
 This year Carnaval in all its excess and baroque splendor will run from Feb. 24 to 27. At weekend rehearsals that are open to the public, the 14 samba associations competing for the title of best in the city are putting the final touches on their lavish presentations. In fact, the intrepid visitor, foreigner or Brazilian, can even get fixed up with a costume and parade along Avenida Marques de Sapucai at the Sambadrome with some of the better-known "schools." 
 Though Carnaval usually gets all the publicity, the Lenten period following may be one of the best times of year to visit. The weather is still warm and the beaches inviting. But Cariocas, as the city's residents are called, have gone back to work and school, so the attractions are much less crowded than in December or January, and some hotels lower their rates accordingly. 
A decade ago, Rio had a reputation as unsafe. Things have improved markedly in recent years, thanks in part to a stepped-up police presence in tourist areas such as Copacabana and Ipanema. Nevertheless, Carnaval is a time of jostling and often-raucous crowds; people tend to lower their guard, drink a lot or go long periods without sleep, thereby offering chances galore for pickpockets and thieves. Visitors should remain as cautious as in any other large city.

Events
Tickets to the two nights of formal Carnaval parades, on Feb. 24 and 25 at the Sambadrome, are snatched up far ahead, and at this late date can be acquired only from scalpers or as part of a package tour purchased from travel agencies in Brazil or the United States. But the samba schools open their pre-Carnaval rehearsals to the public, and it is a favorite Rio pastime to visit the principal associations to gauge their chances of winning. The oldest and most traditional school is Estacao Primeira de Mangueira, which performs Saturdays at 9 p.m. at Rua Visconde de Niteroi 1072 in the Mangueira neighborhood. Tickets are $5.25, or $32 for a table for four, at 1.90 reals to the dollar. Call (55-21) 567-4637.
In addition, local samba groups called blocos participate in free smaller parades in neighborhoods ranging from Ipanema to Vila Isabel, scheduled so that they do not conflict with the samba competition. Check with a hotel concierge for details. 
A glimpse of the African influence on Brazilian culture will be on display in an exhibition of paintings by Rubem Valentin at the National Museum of Fine Arts, Avenida Rio Branco 199, from March 20 to April 24. Most of his work is concerned with the themes of religious and cultural syncreticism, such as the Afro-Brazilian religion called Candomble. The museum, which also has a wide-ranging permanent collection of Brazilian art, is open Tuesday to Friday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and on weekends 2 to 6 p.m.; $2.10; (55-21) 240-0068.
The chaotic manner in which Cariocas drive suggests that their favorite sport other than soccer may well be automobile racing. The real thing, in the form of the Formula Indy, can be seen, with several Brazilian drivers competing, at the Nelson Piquet Autodrome, Rua Embaixador Abelardo Bueno in Jacarepagua, on March 25. Grandstand tickets: $24 to $37, with a garage pass costing $95; information (55-11) 3819-0054.
Once Carnaval is over, Canecao, at Avenida Venceslau Bras 215 in Botafogo, next to the Rio Sul shopping mall, once again becomes the focus of the city's musical life with its mix of diverting samba, pop and rock shows. This fall, programming at Rio's premier music hall includes the reggae-samba band Cidade Negra from March 2 to 11 and Rita Lee, the godmother of Brazilian rock, March 15 to 18. But the highlight of the season promises to be the joint performances by Gilberto Gil and Milton Nascimento, two of the country's biggest stars, April 19 to 29. Tickets: $8 to $26; (55-21) 543-1241
Classical music also comes into its own at the elaborate, French-inspired Theatro Municipal, at the Praca Floriano in the downtown area known as Cinelandia, in the weeks after Carnaval. The Orquestra Sinfonica and its chorus will feature a Verdi Gala, with selections from some of the composer's best-known operas, March 16 to 18, and performances of "Simon Boccanegra," April 20 to 29; (55-21) 262-3935.

Sightseeing
The 100-foot-tall statue of Christ the Redeemer atop Corcovado (Hunchback) Mountain offers one of the most spectacular vistas of the city. The statue itself faces east, overlooking Guanabara Bay and the mountains ringing it, from a height of 2,300 feet, but the view from the pavilion is 360 degrees of sheer pleasure. Accessible by train from Rua Cosme Velho 513, from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily; $8; (55-21) 558-1329.
The Tijuca National Park, Estrada da Cascatinha 850, in Alto da Boa Vista, surrounds Corcovado and is a cool oasis in a city that regularly suffers temperatures of 100 degrees or more this time of year. Accessible from many parts of the city, it includes a tranquil tropical forest with nature trails, waterfalls, museums and restaurants. Free admission; (55-21) 492-2253.
There is no more relaxing way to spend a Sunday than strolling the Ipanema or Copacabana beach front or around the Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas, the lagoon that separates the beach-front neighborhoods from the mountains. The three eastbound lanes of the main waterside boulevard are closed to vehicles and become the domain of skaters, courting couples, residents walking their dogs and music groups of all styles. 
Though the hundreds of squatter shantytowns perched on mountainsides above some of Rio's most exclusive neighborhoods have fascinated visitors since the movie "Black Orpheus" of 40 years ago, they have always been considered too dangerous to visit. But several companies now offer guided tours of Rocinha, the largest settlement, with the residents' cooperation. Jeep Tours' three-hour visit is $30 a person. Call (55-21) 3890-9273 or 3476-3510.

Where to Stay
Rates have zoomed in the past two years, as oil and telecommunications executives have flocked to the best hotels for dealmaking; many establishments are also abandoning the tradition of including breakfast in the rate. So it pays to shop around. With few new hotels being built, bargains are increasingly harder to find. 
The Rio Atlantica Hotel, Avenida Atlantica 2964 in Copacabana, (55-21) 548-6332, fax (55-21) 255-6410, www.rioatlantica.com.br, is one of the city's newer and more conveniently situated hotels, with 228 rooms designed in cool pastels with minimalist furniture. Doubles without a sea view from $170. 
Perched on a promontory overlooking the sea, the Sheraton Rio Hotel and Towers, Avenida Niemeyer 121, (55-21) 274-1122, fax (55-21) 239-5643, www.sheraton-rio.com, on the outskirts of Leblon, is somewhat isolated, but has the advantage of what amounts to a private beach. All 559 rooms have at least a partial ocean view; the best boast spectacular panoramas. Rates from $225. 
Budget: A traditional favorite of economy travelers is the 230-room Hotel Novo Mundo, Praia do Flamengo 20; (55-21) 557-6226, fax (55-21) 265-2369, www.hotelnovomundo-rio.com.br. Built in Art Deco style and a popular haunt of politicians back when Rio was still Brazil's capital, it is convenient to downtown and has recently been remodeled, with some rooms offering great views of Sugar Loaf Mountain and Guanabara Bay. Doubles: $75, with breakfast. 
Luxury: The Copacabana Palace Hotel, Avenida Atlantica 1702, (55-21) 548-7070, fax (55-21) 235-7330, or copacabanapalace.orient-express .com, was the obvious choice to serve as the backdrop for some of the most romantic scenes in Bruno Barreto's recent comedy "Bossa Nova." Built in ornate French style in 1925, the Copa is both a symbol of everything that is most elegant about Rio and a favorite of celebrities, with prices to match. Its 226 rooms were completely remodeled in the 1990's. Doubles without an ocean view begin at $425. 
The 221-room Caesar Park, Avenida Viera Souto 460 in Ipanema, (55-21) 525-2525, fax (55-21) 521-6000, www.caesarpark-rio.com, is convenient to shops, night life and restaurants in the trendiest neighborhood in Rio. The beach-front location is complemented by a security force that keeps an eye on guests on the beach. Doubles with a partial ocean view start at $300.

Where to Eat
Antiquarius, Rua Aristides Espinola 19 in Leblon, (55-21) 294-1049, fax (55-21) 512-5756, is a standout for traditional Portuguese cuisine -- fish and poultry with sauces that are hearty but not heavy -- in a tastefully subdued atmosphere. In fact, many food writers say it is Rio's best restaurant. The only disadvantage: just one card, Diners Club, is accepted. Dinner for two with a bottle of sparkling Portuguese wine: $125. 
At Satyricon, Rua Barao da Torre 192 in Ipanema, (55-21) 521-0627, fax (55-21) 287-7010, freshly caught fish on ice beckon at the entrance. The menu is Italian (although there is also a sushi bar), portions are generous, and service is attentive. Risottos are a specialty, as is a juicy whole fish baked in salt. Dinner for two with South American wine: $100. 
Just down the street at Rua Barao da Torre 368, (55-21) 522-3730, fax (55-21) 247-6153, is Gourmet, the restaurant of the moment. The best dishes are tropical variations on French or Italian recipes, such as a vichyssoise made from hearts of palm, coquille St. Jacques served with Thai sauces, and Amazon-fruit sorbets. The setting is agreeable, with a simple all-white decor. Dinner for two with wine: $90. 
Rio abounds in restaurants serving grilled meats in an all-you-can-eat format, with waiters continually coming to the table with choice cuts until the customer is sated. One of the best is Marius, at Avenida Atlantica 290A in Leme; telephone and fax (55-22) 542-2393. Next door, Marius Crustaceos, (55-21) 543-6363, recently opened with an interesting new twist on the concept: platter after platter of shrimp, lobster, mussels, squid, clams, sea bass and salmon, along with various cold seafood salads and hot soups. Dinner for two with Belgian beer: $60. 
Rio's "food by the kilogram" restaurants continue to be the best source of a good cheap meal, especially for those in a hurry. For lunch try Estacao, in the heart of the Ipanema shopping district at Rua Visconde de Piraja 572, (55-21) 512-3230, or Terra Brasilis, at Rua Humberto de Campos 699 in Leblon, (55-21) 274-4702, which specializes in regional cuisine and rich desserts. Meals at either place cost about $4 a pound; wine and beer available.

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER; 
Peeling the Layers of History in Berlin

BYLINE:  By DAISANN McLANE 

 BODY:
MY plane landed smoothly at Tegel Airport in Berlin, but I didn't. Emerging from the gate with the other passengers, I soon found myself in the airport's main terminal. But what about immigration? I walked on, a bit nervously, eyes peeled for the official checkpoint I must have missed. Surely some security guard would notice me and steer me in the right direction before I did something illegal. 
 But no one approached. Finally, I spotted an information desk and went over to ask where I should present my passport. 
 "No problem," said the clerk. "You came in on the flight from Amsterdam? You don't need to show your passport." 
Once you enter the European Union, as I had in Amsterdam the previous week, you can travel freely among its member nations without formalities. And some part of me did know this. But I spent my early childhood watching the cold war on TV, and I had memories, grainy, in gray and white: Khrushchev, pounding his shoe on a table at the United Nations, and John F. Kennedy proclaiming, "Ich bin ein Berliner." 
The child of the cold war, arriving for the first time in one of that era's hot-button capitals, was incredulous that she could stroll into Berlin straight off the plane. The adult traveler, on the other hand, was pleased there was an airport bus at curbside, which, for about $1.85, at 2.15 marks to the dollar, transported her to the center of town, two blocks from her hotel, in only 20 minutes. 
I spent four days and nights in Berlin in early December, taking advantage of low-season air fares that got me a round trip from J.F.K. in New York with a stop in Amsterdam, for only $402. Normally, Berlin is a much more expensive ticket, because there is no direct flight from the United States (a situation that will change next month when Lufthansa inaugurates nonstops from Dulles Airport outside Washington). Like so many of Berlin's quirks, the logistical difficulty in getting there from North America is a cold war legacy. Because it was divided between the West and the Soviet bloc for more than 40 years, Berlin doesn't have a single huge airport -- instead, it has three modest-sized ones, including Tegel, the hub for most commercial flights within Western Europe. 
Four days and nights was not enough time to peel the layers of a city that I found completely absorbing, like a history book or a complex novel that one couldn't put down. Since the Berlin Wall came down more than 10 years ago, the city has undergone an enormous transformation as, reunited, it takes its place once again as Germany's capital city. And there's more to come, as evidenced by the Berlin skyline's most dramatic feature: a bumper crop of spiky steel construction cranes stretching as far as you can see. 
The usual sightseeing routine in other European capitals is to visit museums by day, then recover from art and culture overload by, perhaps, sitting in a cafe, or strolling along a charming street in some quaint quarter. While Berlin has some terrific museums, it is no museum piece. History spills into the streets here, dramatically and sometimes unsettlingly. A short walk in Berlin can take you past pompous Nazi-era buildings, or sleek modernist apartments designed by Bauhaus architects, through blocks still bullet scarred from World War II into glittery -- some would say tasteless -- steel-and-glass shopping complexes. 
There is an English-language map of the city called "Walk the Wall," on sale at most newsstands for $2, that superimposes the outline of the former Wall on contemporary Berlin, and details suggested self-guided tours. Cynically, I applauded the clever Berlin entrepreneur who'd probably made a small fortune from American tourists with this map. And then I bought one.
Map in hand, I forged through changing neighborhoods in the former East and West. My wheels spinning, I kept it up until my legs gave out. (A word of warning: Berlin is a city of sprawling neighborhoods, like London, and the walking distances between U-Bahn stops and notable sites is often 15 minutes or more.) By 7 or 8 p.m., I was usually ready to collapse. But my Berlin collapses were stylish ones, cushioned by fluffy comforters and nice cotton sheets. 
Among the city's many changes is one that's good news for the budget traveler. The boom in real estate in the former Eastern section has encouraged small, inexpensive and offbeat hotels in the $60-to-$100 range. Neither of the places I stayed in, the Sorat Art'otel or the Kunstlerheim Luise, existed in their current form five years ago. 
Both caught my interest because each is part of a novel hotel concept, flourishing in Berlin, called the art hotel. On the Internet and in guidebooks I found several listings for art hotels, so called because they feature rooms and common areas designed by local artists. The concept was handled differently in the two I was able to sample: the Sorat Art'otel used a single artist's designs in all the rooms, while each of Kunstlerheim Luise's 30 rooms is a commission from a different artist. However, in both cases I retired each evening to personality-filled chambers in which I was surrounded by (in one case, literally embedded in) original artwork. This European city is worth a visit for the art hotel experience alone. 
For symmetry's sake, I'd booked two nights at the Sorat Art'otel, just off Kurfurstendamm (Ku'damm), in the former West, and two nights at the Kunstlerheim Luise, in Mitte, in the former East. There was no particular reason for starting my stay in the West, but, looking back, I am glad I did. The neighborhood around the Sorat, Charlottenburg, was Berlin's main tourist destination before the Wall came down. The Ku'damm is a broad boulevard of wide sidewalks and pricey shops, Berlin's answer to Madison Avenue. 
Strolling up and down the familiar environment along the Ku'damm, as I did my first afternoon, was a good way to warm up and get oriented to the city. It also gave me my first opportunity to jump on the Euro-bargain bandwagon. In Amsterdam, I'd been dismayed at the lack of major-league shopping opportunities. But on the Ku'damm, the designer boutiques all had big signs saying "Reduziert." In an hour, I'd managed to find a new down coat from the Italian designer Max Mara -- the first such garment that didn't turn me into a ringer for the Michelin Man. Originally $600, with "reduziert" by 40 percent, and a refund on the V.A.T. tax, which ended up being about 10 percent, it was $300. 
Returning to the hotel along Ku'damm, I passed a window filled with gingerbread, strings of twinkling lights and a jaw-dropping spread of cakes, candies and cookies. Walking into this gingerbread house, I made a dangerous discovery -- Leysieffer Confections sells the most delectable butter cookies imaginable, at $4.60 a bag. (Worse news, at least for those who are trying to avoid the Michelin Man look: Leysieffer's has branches throughout Berlin.) 
Back at the Sorat, which reminded me a lot of the Paramount Hotel in New York, I munched cookies and took stock of my art room. Small, with twin beds and a sleek, modernist bathroom, it radiated a tasteful Philippe Starck-inspired sensibility of geometric shapes and soft shades. In the bright white-tiled bathroom -- shower, no tub -- was the steel cone-shaped sink that is becoming the ubiquitous signifier of the postmodern. Considering the size of the room, I wondered if the Sorat was really a good value at $107 for a single. The next morning over my (free) breakfast in a huge, sunny dining room, spread with a lavish buffet of meats, smoked fish, salads, cheeses, eggs, breads and pastries, I decided it definitely was. 
Having a big breakfast in the hotel turned out to be a good thing, since sightseeing became so absorbing that I tended, like some absent-minded professor, to forget about eating. Climbing up the spiral ramp in the spectacular new Reichstagskuppel, Sir Norman Foster's gleaming glass-and-steel addition to the top of Germany's capitol building, I became entranced watching the amazing view of the city, and the reflection of my fellow sightseers in the surfaces of the structure's centerpiece, a funnel made of broken mirrors. I stopped in the dome's pleasant rooftop cafe for coffee and apple cake. Returning to the ground floor, I was amazed that I'd spent nearly three hours in the dome, symbol of the new Berlin. 
I spent nearly as much time in another new architectural landmark, equally stunning: Daniel Libeskind's Jewish Museum. The museum's exhibits, which will chronicle the history of German Jews from the Middle Ages to the present, will not go on display until September; however, more than 340,000 visitors toured the empty building in the past two years. (Earlier this month, the museum was closed to the public until September.) Fashioned to resemble a shattered Star of David, it is designed to provide a symbolic experience of German Jewish history. 
I walked, disoriented, through corridors that turned at unexpected, irregular angles, then climbed a steep, ever-narrowing staircase that rose as if to heaven (according to a short documentary film I viewed in the museum, it symbolizes Jacob's ladder). Passing through a garden of white pillars, each one topped by an olive tree, I lost my footing on the pebbled ground. Laughing, the guard informed me that was the point -- the base of the garden is tilted at about 13 degrees. The off-balance feeling is designed to evoke the emotions of the German Jews who fled before World War II, and found themselves adapting to foreign countries and cultures. 
The last room was the most evocative. With the help of the guard, I pulled open a heavy door and entered a dark chamber. As my eyes began to adjust to the dimness, the door slammed shut with a loud thunk behind me. For an instant, surrounded by blackness, I felt a cold panic -- exactly as the architect had intended. 
THE Museum Haus am Checkpoint Charlie offered insight into another Berlin era, albeit in a more conventional setting. Situated directly above the infamous passage point between East and West Berlin, the private museum holds a collection of ephemera, and documentation of the hundreds of escape attempts and escapes made during the 30 years of the Wall -- everything from hot-air balloons to hand-dug tunnels to specially fitted Volkswagens that could hold "passengers" in a hidden compartment behind the engine. Leaving the museum, I walked freely back and forth past the "checkpoint," just to shake off the feeling of confinement and claustrophobia. 
An even better remedy for bad Wall flashbacks is a stroll through the gallery district of Mitte, ground zero of Berlin's art and fashion scene. If the Ku'damm is Madison Avenue, Mitte is SoHo, circa 1979, chockablock with young artists and designers and those who follow them like heat-seeking missiles. Dozens of small private galleries (mainly showcasing contemporary artists and photographers) line the narrow streets behind the Hackescher Markt -- Sophienstrasse, Auguststrasse and Oranienberger Strasse.
As in SoHo, the galleries have attracted the fashionistas, and there are almost as many boutiques as galleries now. I enjoyed poking through both -- savoring an exhibit of vintage Berlin photographs, then popping in to look at funny felt jackets and foot-tall egg cozies shaped like witches' hats at the shop Hut Up. In these corners of the avant-hip, Berlin's recent past fades away -- almost. (It surfaces again when you notice that many of the shops and galleries are run as collectives, or pop into a Chinese cafe for a plate of fried rice on the run and discover that your host came to Berlin as an exchange student from Laos.) 
Staying at Kunstlerheim Luise, as it turned out, was an excellent way to get into the Mitte spirit (and, at $69 a night for a room without private bath, an economical one). When I arrived in my room, my initial reaction was to laugh out loud for five minutes. I had been assigned the Hundezimmer, or Dog Room. It was papered on one wall with a design from Disney's "101 Dalmatians" and decorated on another with plastic dog dishes, which unexpectedly created a late-60's Pop Art atmosphere. I noted that the bedside table had been fashioned from a stack of large dog-food cans topped with glass, and that the pillows on the queen-sized bed had been puffed to look like pointed ears. 
What I did not notice, until I awoke on my last Berlin morning, was that the bed itself was a giant wicker dog basket. The clever artist behind this room (identified only as Odin) had transformed me into the "hund" of this "zimmer." 
Yawning in my basket, I thought about how to spend my last few hours in Berlin. Easy decision. The Tiergarten, Berlin's Central Park, was a short U-Bahn ride away. I rolled over, jumped up and took myself out for a walk. 

Stops on a walking tour
I spent an average of $118 a day for accommodation in stylish hotels, lots of museum hopping, food and local transportation, with an exchange rate of 2.15 marks to the dollar. 

Hotels
At the Sorat Art'otel, Joachimstaler Strasse 29, (49-30) 884470, fax (49-30) 88447700, www.sorat-hotels
.com/artotel-berlin, my sleek little room had twin beds, each with a padded gray-green headboard, TV, phone and sparkling bathroom with a shower. The room, which I booked on the hotel's Web site, cost $107 a night (singles now start at $123); the price included a sumptuous breakfast buffet served in the downstairs dining room.
At the Hotel Kunstlerheim Luise, Luisenstrasse 19, (49-30) 284480, fax (49-30) 2844 8448, on the Web, www.kuenstlerheim-luise.de, each of the hotel's 30 rooms is an installation, commissioned to a single artist. My room, the Hundezimmer, or Dog Room, cost $69 a night; the spotless dorm-style bath with shower stalls, sinks and toilets was down the hall. The price included a cold Continental breakfast of croissants, cereal and coffee. One drawback: the hotel is right next to the S-Bahn (overhead train) line, and some of the rooms can be noisy. 

Restaurants
Trying to pack as many of Berlin's sights into four days as possible, I didn't spend much time planning when or where to eat -- and in Berlin, you have to plan, since restaurants seem to fill up by 6 p.m. and stay that way until closing. I tended to pop into any place that looked halfway good and that was open and handy when I got hungry. 
Mahachai Thai, Schluterstrasse 60, (49-30) 313 0879, tucked near the S-Bahn stop Savignyplatz, was a lucky find -- a serenely decorated Thai restaurant with fresh, authentically spiced dishes. I had an excellent chicken curry, with rice, beer, Thai salad and shrimp chips, for $23. 
Oxymoron, Rosenthaler Strasse 40-41, (49-30) 2839 1886, turns into a disco at 5 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday and at 11 p.m. Friday and Saturday; I didn't know that, nor would I have guessed it from the look of the place, which reminded me of a casual SoHo bistro. The early supper menu was a good value. I had a plate of garlic-sauced linguine and a glass of pinot grigio, for $9.25.
At Kafer im Reichstag, Platz der Republik 1, (49-30) 2262 9933, the restaurant adjacent to the new dome in the Reichstag, coffee and apple cake came to $5. 
Leysieffer's, Kurfurstendamm 218, (49-30) 885 7480, also on Friedrichstrasse around the corner from Galeries Lafayette, sells exquisite cookies. 

Museums
The Museum Haus am Checkpoint Charlie is at Friedrichstrasse 43-45; (49-30) 253 7250; museum-haus-am
.checkpointcharlie.org. Open 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily; admission $5.60.
Though the Jewish Museum, at Lindenstrasse 9-14, (49-30) 2839 7444, www.jmberlin.de, is not yet open, it will be a must-see when the collections are installed in September. 
The Reichstagskuppel (Dome of the Reichstag), Platz der Republik 1, (49-30) 227 0, is free and open daily from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. 
The Brohan Museum, Schlossstrasse 1A, (49-30) 32690600, www.broehan-museum.de, is a little jewel of a place, filled with extraordinarily beautiful examples of German, French and Dutch Art Deco objects and furniture. Open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Closed Mondays; $3.70. 

Transportation
From Tegel airport, I caught a bus to Berlin Zoo, near the Sorat Art'otel and Ku'damm, for about $1.85. 
The Berlin transit network (www.bfg.de) is very user-friendly. I found it easiest to buy a day pass, or Tageskarte. The card is good for all U-Bahn, S-Bahn and bus rides within the city center, and costs $4 a day. 
Returning, I took a taxi from the Kunstlerheim Luise hotel to the airport; the fare was $12.

HEADLINE: FILM; 
The Rare Producer Honored for His Art

BYLINE:  By DAVID THOMSON; David Thomson is the author of "A Biographical Dictionary of Film."

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
IT'S very interesting," says the filmmaker James Toback. "I have known Ed Pressman since school. We were at Ethical Culture and Fieldston together. We grew up in the same building, the Majestic, on Central Park West. He's like my oldest friend. He's always been there. And now he's become really very important and very powerful. And I don't see any change. As a kid he always had the best toys, and he'd share them. And now he's involved on maybe half -- or more -- of the best films. But it's still Ed -- quiet, shy, bookish Ed -- trying to help and please the wilder kids, the ones who try to make movies."
 Mr. Toback ("Black and White") isn't far from those wilder guys, but the director Abel Ferrara, who even sounds as if he staggered, wounded, from one of his bloodiest scenes, may even be closer. "His legacy," he says of Mr. Pressman, struggling to describe this renowned producer, "the strangest films -- all leading back to him. He's very up front. He's there for us to be what we can be. Yeah, that's it. And behind closed doors, he has his moments. Don't let appearances fool you." 
 I have to admit that finding a serious appreciation of a producer in the American press is not a common experience. The impresarios of theater, the museum world, or opera and popular music have their place. But in film the producer is almost invariably cast as the heavy in the story of art versus commerce -- whereas any number of encounters in Hollywood will confirm that there are few people as money-minded as some of our directors, and that few are as devoted to making good, different pictures as Edward R. Pressman. As a measure of that, on Friday, the Brooklyn Academy of Music will begin a 25-film retrospective of the career of this man who is still only 57.
Ed Pressman has his name on, among other films, Terrence Malick's "Badlands." I could stop there, because if you directed or produced "Badlands," you are home. But the list goes on: "Sisters" and "Phantom of the Paradise" (both by Brian De Palma); "Despair" (by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, from Nabokov, with Dirk Bogarde); "The Hand" (Oliver Stone's debut); "True Stories" (David Byrne); "Good Morning, Babylon" (the Taviani brothers); "Blue Steel" (Kathryn Bigelow); "To Sleep with Anger" (Charles Burnett); "Reversal of Fortune" (Barbet Schroeder's von Bulow story); "Bad Lieutenant" (Mr. Ferrara); "Hoffa"; "City Hall"; "Two Girls and a Guy"; "Plenty"; "Wall Street"; "American Psycho."
Not that every one those films has to be your favorite, or one you'd want to see again. But think of them as they must have begun -- fever dreams in the minds of their makers. Consider how far-fetched, how outrageous or disgusting they seemed. And then ask yourself what the tradition of independent film in America would mean without most of them. And if you point out to Mr. Pressman that people like Mr. Ferrara and Mr. Toback, or Mr. Stone and Mr. De Palma, are larger than life, hard to control, tricky in a deal sometimes, dangerously unpredictable and hardly the sort of people you might think of offering to a band of sober investors, he grins, and says, "Well, I've always been drawn to vivacious people."
He was the son of Jack Pressman, who started a toy company in the 1940's, cornered the marble business and made America crazy for Chinese Checkers. Ed, the oldest son, was supposed to take over -- Jack died when Ed was 16 -- but somehow, with his mother, Lynn Rambach, running the business, Ed went away, to Stanford University and the London School of Economics, so that he ended up asking his kid brother, Jimmy, to run the company. Ed would take some money out of the toys and branch out.
A turning point came at the Fieldston School, in the Bronx, where he'd had a teacher who taught modern history using Siegfried Kracauer's "From Caligari to Hitler" and showed pictures like "M" and "The Blue Angel." Suddenly, horizons defined by Edward G. Robinson and George Raft lifted. A few years later, Mr. Pressman was a devotee of the French New Wave -- the age when the rules about how to make a film began to seem fatuous or suspicious. When he went to England, he met Paul Williams, a young American with wild ideas. "To me," Mr. Pressman says, "he was Orson Welles, and I'd be Louis B. Mayer -- and that's how we did "Out of It" and "The Revolutionary,' " with Mr. Williams directing and Mr. Pressman producing.
This is not a common fantasy. Mr. Mayer is one of the more odious villains in film history, while Welles was a genius, a bon viveur, one of the greatest storytellers and tragic heroes ever made. So many kids grow up wanting to be Welles -- or just behaving like him. Mr. Pressman recognizes his own perverse streak. He thinks it was due in part to his love of business, that family influence. But it also came out of his objective, philosophical stance. From early on, he liked to observe the differences in people and how they might be helped to fit together. But there was also some profound shyness, some feeling that he was not attractive or spectacular enough to be a famous leader (though Mr. Toback recalls that in school Mr. Pressman was a brilliant quarterback). It was more something he felt about himself than what others noticed. And to this day he has never wanted to be a director himself -- no matter that he's seen directors make mistakes that he could have avoided.
"With Paul, at the beginning, I totally loved getting behind his vision," he says. Mr. Pressman's wife, Annie, an actress, adds this: "Eddie once said, 'You have to be a very quick thinker to be a director.' And he likes to take his time. He could have been a professor. But once he makes up his mind -- the perseverance!"
SOME projects take 10 years before the script is right, or the several small pieces of money fall into place. And Mr. Pressman is not wild with money ("He's ingeniously tight," says one agent), even if he has gone beyond family loans to lines of credit with banks. Over the years, he has had big hits, "Conan the Barbarian" and "The Crow," though many predicted disaster for both. He has had great moments, as when "Badlands" delighted the 1973 New York Film Festival. But there was a preview screening of "Paris by Night" (1988) in Seattle when he and its director, David Hare, had to reckon that the film was doomed.
He is bright-eyed about the future -- these are the prize marbles he shows you: Tamara Jenkins is working on a biopic of Diane Arbus. There is another chapter in the Crow saga to come, with the hip-hop artist DMX in the lead. He has the rights to the David Begelman story, with a very good script by Michael Thomas; Nick Broomfield, the provocative English documentarian, is lined up to direct. And he has fun thinking about the roller-coaster career of an establishment figure like Begelman, the onetime producer and major studio executive who went from check forging and ignominy to resurrection and then suicide.
There is also a film about gambling, from the book "No Limits," to be directed by Richard Kwietniowski, who made "Love and Death on Long Island." And there is Mr. Toback's next film, "Harvard Man," as well as the chance of Sean Penn and Nick Nolte doing "The Monkey Wrench Gang" from Edward Abbey's novel about terrorists acting to protect the environment.
Not every one of those dreams is guaranteed. But securely based in New York and Los Angeles, with Annie and their 13-year-old son, Sam, Ed Pressman shows no sign of relaxing. He's also invested in the future of digital film and is continuing to push the limits of bad taste (as in "Bad Lieutenant" and "American Psycho"). Most of all, he sees a kind of business flux ahead in which only producers -- independent, courageous but experienced -- are likely to guard movies against the drab, merchandising hand of intergalactic conglomerates.

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE; 
Gathered Vestiges of a Covered-Wagon Diaspora

BYLINE:  By JOSHUA BROCKMAN; Joshua Brockman is freelance writer who until recently lived in Santa Fe, N.M.

DATELINE: SANTA FE, N.M. 

 BODY:
ALMOST everyone is familiar with the entrance of Jews to America through Ellis Island, but few people have heard of a smaller but nevertheless important Jewish migration westward to New Mexico by wagon train along the Santa Fe Trail. Their number was not great -- by 1917, fewer than 1,000 called New Mexico home -- but these Jews helped shape the economy, culture and political landscape of the region.
 Today, their story is being told through the art, memorabilia and family histories of the Ambergs, Bibos, Floersheims, Herzsteins, Ilfelds, Spiegelbergs, Uhlfelders and Zeckendorfs, among others, in a rich display of pioneer life at the Palace of the Governors of the Museum of New Mexico. The exhibition, "Jewish Pioneers of New Mexico," opened in October and will remain at the museum for five years. 
 The first to settle in New Mexico were Ashkenazic immigrants from German principalities. They moved west from the East Coast beginning in the 1840's, caught up in the sentiment of Manifest Destiny to populate the vast western territories. Putting down roots in this arid and mountainous landscape, where Spanish and American Indian dialects were spoken and justice was often carried out through gun fights or public hangings, was no easy task, particularly for foreigners. Yet these Jews moved into isolated areas, lived among the Indians, established community institutions and formed synagogues where none existed. 
The travails of life in the West paled in comparison to the persecution and second-class citizenship these Jews would have continued to face had they remained in Europe. And, unlike much of the eastern United States, the West remained full of opportunities for entrepreneurs and was largely free of anti-Semitism and religious divisiveness, mainly because Anglos there needed one another to survive.
The exhibit, the museum's first examination of the New Mexico Jewish diaspora, spans the years from 1821, when the Santa Fe Trail opened, providing a trade route from the East, through 1917, when the flow of immigration was slowed by the United States' entrance into World War I. The show looks at the contributions made by Jewish merchants, bankers, miners, ranchers, soldiers, sutlers and traders throughout the region.
It is organized along four themes: immigration, occupations, social and family life, and religion. Elegantly displayed using panels of scanned photographs and documents alongside artifacts, the exhibit is largely based on loans and donations from families in New Mexico (an estimated 15,000 Jews live here today) and descendants of Jewish pioneers now scattered across the nation.
The flow of heirlooms has continued even after the opening, said Thomas E. Chavez, director of the museum. Among them are a number of steamer trunks, one of which traveled by boat over the Atlantic and then by wagon train over the Santa Fe Trail.
"I look at a trunk and I imagine where it's been and the people packing it," Mr. Chavez said. "Those trips seem even a little bit risky today."
The show's curator, David H. Snow, schooled as an archaeologist and anthropologist, said preparing the exhibit had felt like an excavation. "I might just as well be out there with a trowel again, digging up roots," he said.
Jewish pioneers were mostly young single men like Solomon Jacob Spiegelberg, who left Westphalia as a teenager in search of a better life. Spiegelberg settled in Santa Fe in 1846. He was the first German Jewish merchant to live in this Western outpost along the Santa Fe Trail, where he established the Spiegelberg mercantile business and became sutler to Fort Marcy, keeping it supplied with provisions.
Like other young Jewish entrepreneurs who came West, he was also an ambassador for the region, persuading his family in Germany to join him. One by one, six Spiegelberg brothers immigrated to New Mexico between 1844 and 1861 as part of a first wave of Jewish immigrants to the territory. Once here, their first goal was to find a place in Southwestern society rather than create a religious and ethnic niche for themselves.
The idea for the exhibit came from Spiegelberg descendants -- Susan and Felix Warburg, guest curators and principal donors -- after a Spiegelberg family reunion in Santa Fe in 1988. Mr. Warburg's family donated their Fifth Avenue mansion in New York City to the Jewish Theological Seminary in 1944 to house the Jewish Museum. Mrs. Warburg is the great-granddaughter of the Jewish pioneers Wolf (Willi) and Flora Spiegelberg. Willi, the youngest brother of Solomon, learned to speak Spanish, English and four Indian dialects and ultimately became the probate judge, or mayor, of Santa Fe County in 1884. 
"They wanted to create a new world and they had to reinvent themselves," Mrs. Warburg said of her pioneer ancestors. "They were highly respected because of their ability to adapt."
Religion and culture also traveled over the dusty trails. The museum display includes a 200-year-old Torah used by the first synagogue in New Mexico, an 1870 piano and the Uhlfelder family Bible printed in 1786 with Hebrew, German and Latin texts. Handwritten notations listing birth dates of family members inside the Bible provide something of a genealogical road map. 
Many of the first Jews who immigrated were cousins. In many cases they became further connected in New Mexico through marriage. By 1860, half of the Jewish population in the territory was related, the museum says. But there was also intermarriage with the local Hispanic and Indian populations.
Of all the members of the Bibo clan -- children of a cantor in Brakel, Westphalia -- who immigrated to New Mexico, Solomon Bibo immersed himself the most in American Indian life through marriage and his involvement in tribal government. In 1885, after establishing a trading relationship with Acoma Pueblo and learning its language, Keres, he married Juana Valle, the granddaughter of the tribe's governor. In the late 1880's Bibo was chosen as governor of Acoma Pueblo, a title he held again in later years.
Before 1870, there were no banks in New Mexico, so merchant families functioned as financial institutions by holding deposits, extending credit and even mortgages. The role of Jewish merchants as bankers is documented by a fine example of scrip issued in 1863 by Spiegelberg Hermanos, the Spiegelberg Brothers.
Ushering in a new era, the railroad arrived in Las Vegas, N.M., in 1879 and in Albuquerque in 1880. New cities emerged including Clayton, Deming and Tucumcari. East Las Vegas and New Albuquerque also sprouted up, mirroring the adjacent established towns. In response, Jews relocated to seize opportunities. By 1880, half of the original Jewish pioneers had left New Mexico, but a Jewish population of about 200 grew during the next two decades, bolstered by a second wave of Jewish immigrants who arrived with the railroad. Most businesses became more specialized because goods could be carried swiftly and in greater quantities to distant locations.
Meanwhile, Charles Ilfeld and his family presided over the expansion of what would become the state's largest mercantile business. Their company grew from its original retail location in Las Vegas to wholesale branches throughout New Mexico. The Ilfelds established themselves as a precursor to Wal-Mart with their slogan, still painted on the side of the Ilfeld building on the plaza in Las Vegas: "Charles Ilfeld Company Wholesalers of Everything."
Despite the civilizing effect of the railroad, which began to transform New Mexico from a frontier into a marketplace, Jews were not immune from the lawlessness that was part and parcel of Western society. Levi Herzstein discovered this when he came face to face with one of the West's most notorious gangs -- the "Black Jack" Ketchum gang. In 1896 the Herzstein store and post office was held up by these outlaws. Levi, who was summoned to Liberty in the early 1890's to help run the family store by his older brother Morris, pursued the gang and was killed in a shoot-out.
The Herzstein business later moved to Clayton and ultimately into the Texas panhandle. This expansion is captured by the inscription on a shoe brush: "Herzstein's Clayton, New Mexico -- Dalhart, Texas. If it's from Herzstein's it's correct."
"There was kind of a Jewish telegraph through the Southwest, and my grandmother and the family knew all of the Jews in Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona and western Texas," said Mortimer H. Herzstein, 74, who was born in Trinidad, Colo., and is a descendant of two Jewish pioneer families.
"Jewish Pioneers" presents a balanced picture of Jewish life, blemishes and all. A prison portrait from 1901 shows Jake Gold, who by 1882 established Gold's Old Curio Shop, one of the first stores to sell American Indian crafts, with a number pinned on his suit: he served time in the New Mexico Territorial prison for abandoning his wife.
Before synagogues, Jews maintained civic affiliations through membership in the Order of Masons, the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and the Germania Club and as founders of the Historical Society of New Mexico.
As Reform Jews, these pioneers were initially satisfied with private expressions of their faith. The first synagogue, Temple Montefiore, in Las Vegas, was founded in 1884, well after the first pioneers arrived. The first Jewish cemetery followed in 1888. A synagogue did not exist in Santa Fe until 1953.
Although the exhibit focuses predominantly on men, one woman who stands out is Yetta Kohn. She came across the Santa Fe Trail in the mid-1860's and became the matriarch of a ranching dynasty, known today as the T-4 Cattle Company, in Montoya. The family has operated the business since 1902.
Despite their small numbers, Jewish pioneers and their descendants rose to prominence in New Mexico territory and after it became a state in 1912. Towns and railroad sidings were also named for Jewish pioneers, although these names have largely vanished from maps.
In assembling the shards of Jewish life, "Jewish Pioneers" reveals an enduring legacy of Jews in New Mexico and their successful efforts to blend into the landscape and culture. 
"They made every effort to fit in, and that applies not only economically but politically," said the historian Henry J. Tobias, author of "A History of the Jews in New Mexico." "It's part of the heritage they left. In some ways you might think of them as part of the glue that held society out here together."

HEADLINE: MUSIC; 
There's a Method to This 'Choral Miracle'

BYLINE:  By CORI ELLISON; Cori Ellison is the dramaturg at the New York City Opera.

DATELINE: STOCKHOLM 

 BODY:
AN icy December wind chills Sweden's temporarily sunless capital. But inside the torchlit portals of Berwaldhallen, a 1979 concert hall carved into a granite hillside in Stockholm's green Djurgarden district, the 34 members of the Swedish Radio Choir are working up a sweat. They bray incantations from "Curse Upon Iron" by the Estonian composer Veljo Tormis: "You flesh eater, gnawer of bones, spiller of innocent blood!" Tonu Kaljuste, their departing music director, jerks about, smacking a tambourine against his flank like a mad shaman. Is this any way for good Lutherans to behave?
 Forgive them: they're celebrating the 75th anniversary of their elite squad. Their hearty encore piece capped a gala program including a gospel-style "Hallelujah," folksy numbers by the native sons Alfven and Stenhammar, blockbusters by Schubert and Poulenc, and premieres of specially commissioned works by Sven-David Sandstrom and Esa-Pekka Salonen. It's all in a day's work for this incarnation of the "Swedish choral miracle." 
 The Swedish Radio Choir will continue its jubilee celebration in New York. On Friday, it will team up with the Eric Ericson Chamber Choir, conducted by its namesake, for a program of 20th-century a cappella works presented by Lincoln Center's Great Performers series at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. And next Sunday the two choirs will join the Swedish Radio Orchestra at Avery Fisher Hall for a performance of the Verdi Requiem, led by the orchestra's vibrant new Austrian maestro, Manfred Honeck.
On close scrutiny, the Swedish choral miracle turns out to be less mysterious than methodical. In the last century, Sweden has produced a prodigious quantity of first-rate choral music and the stellar choirs to perform it, an achievement that has much to do with hospitable soil: a small, largely homogeneous population of 9 million, one-sixth of which is clustered around Stockholm; periodic upsurges of nationalism, expressed notably in choral singing; the legendary Swedish team mentality; and what Mr. Sandstrom, since 1999 a professor of composition at Indiana University in Bloomington, calls "the melody of the Swedish language."
It also has to do with fertile seeds, embodied in a group of gifted, zealous individuals whose rise to leadership positions in Sweden's musical life transformed the nation's musical tastes and standards. In 1944, the Monday Group, a gaggle of young Stockholm Conservatory students fed up with the National Romanticism of Alfven and Stenhammar, began studying privately with the modernist Hilding Rosenberg and meeting to discuss and study the music of Bartok, Hindemith, Schoenberg, Stravinsky and others.
The group comprised two instrumentalists, three musicologists, five composers and a choral conductor, Mr. Ericson. In 1945, Mr. Ericson enlisted 16 conservatory friends to sing through Renaissance madrigals and motets, music they had read about but never heard. Though their plans had not included performing, they ended up presenting a meticulously prepared program, billing themselves as the Stockholm Chamber Choir (later, the Ericson Chamber Choir). Once they had developed a blooming sound and technical proficiency, they proceeded to tackle the heady works of Brahms, Reger and the Swedish Romantics, eventually moving on to Bartok, Martin, Milhaud, Schoenberg and Stravinsky.
Mr. Ericson insists that it is a choir's repertory that shapes its technique and sound. "The pieces we did early on that seemed difficult tonally and rhythmically became less and less so," he said over coffee in a Stockholm hotel. "Certain pieces were like rungs on a ladder, pieces by Lidholm, Stravinsky, Nono and Dallapiccola, perhaps most of all. This is how we really learned to read notes and rhythms. When you come out on the other side of such pieces, you're a better musician, a better singer, maybe even a better person."
By the 1950's, Mr. Ericson's efforts had spawned a new breed in Sweden: the professional choir, musically confident and vocally secure. Swedish composers were inspired to write for this unique, flexible instrument, ready and able to brave new choral techniques and harmonic languages. The ensuing flood of commissions and premieres yielded, to Mr. Ericson's mind, 10 or 15 true classics, including several works by Ingvar Lidholm and Mr. Sandstrom.
Swedish composers so eagerly embraced choral music because most of them were enthusiastic choral singers themselves. Lars Edlund, Eskil Hemberg, Thomas Jennefelt and Lars Johan Werle all sang in Mr. Ericson's choirs, and Mr. Sandstrom was a tenor in the Hagersten Motet Choir for two decades.
But there has been no closer connection between conductor and composer than the fruitful alliance of Mr. Ericson and Mr. Lidholm, another member of the Monday Group. Mr. Lidholm's "Laudi," evoking both Palestrina and Stravinsky, was given its premiere in 1947 by Mr. Ericson's choir. The first masterwork of modern Swedish choral music, it is one of many repertory staples by Mr. Lidholm. His heavily chromatic, chant-infused "Libera Me" will highlight the choirs' program on Friday.
In 1952, Mr. Ericson was recruited by the Swedish Broadcasting Company to revamp its Swedish Radio Choir. The choir and its sister orchestra were spinoffs of the post-World War II orchestras and choruses established in Western Europe to bolster the cultural programming of national broadcasting corporations. Blessed with far-reaching airwaves, luxurious rehearsal periods, a mandate to nurture native and contemporary music and ample subsidies from the arts-friendly Social Democratic government, the radio orchestra and choir would revolutionize Swedish music.
One of Mr. Ericson's first official acts was to insist that at least 75 percent of the radio choir's repertory be a cappella. "A cappella singing is the only way to establish high choral standards of intonation, balance and listening," the 82-year-old maestro said.
Led by executives devoted to contemporary music (including Mr. Lidholm, who was director of chamber music from 1956 to 1965), the Swedish Radio afforded significant opportunities to musicians hungry to catch up with international musical developments after their World War II isolation. Mr. Ericson enjoyed exhilarating associations with Luigi Nono, Karlheinz Stockhausen, John Cage, Terry Riley, Witold Lutoslawski, Krzysztof Penderecki, Mauricio Kagel, Morton Feldman and Pauline Oliveros, all of whom visited Stockholm to conduct or discuss their works.
BEGINNING in 1959, Gyorgy Ligeti regularly visited Stockholm. His Requiem, commissioned by the Swedish Radio, was given its premiere by the choir and orchestra in 1964, and his 16-part "Lux Aeterna," which the choirs will sing on Friday, inspired a wealth of large-scale "symphonic" choral pieces. His signature tone clusters and micropolyphony began to crop up in Swedish choral music of the 1970's.
In the 1960's, the Ericson Chamber Choir began a collaboration with Nikolaus Harnoncourt and his period-instrument ensemble, Concentus Musicus Wien, which resulted in recordings of Monteverdi's Vespers, Purcell's "Fairy Queen" and Handel's "Jephtha" and "Belshazzar." Mr. Ericson's growing reputation in Europe led, in 1971, to a major project for EMI: a four-LP album, "European Choral Music of Five Centuries," featuring the radio choir and the Ericson Chamber Choir.
The groups, combined as an oratorio choir, became much in demand. During the 1980's, they began a series of collaborations with the Berlin Philharmonic, resulting in recordings of Mozart's Requiem with Riccardo Muti, Haydn's "Creation" and Beethoven's "Missa Solemnis" with James Levine, and Brahms's "German Requiem" with Claudio Abbado.
Mr. Ericson loves to tell how Mr. Muti once panicked to hear that his Verdi Requiem choir would comprise a mere 66 souls. "I told him, 'Trust me,' " Mr. Ericson said. "You should have seen his face when our choir sounded loud and clear over the Berlin Philharmonic's brass."
By the time of Mr. Ericson's mandatory retirement from his radio choir post (a civil service job) in 1983, the ensemble had established a seven-concert subscription series, four or five annual collaborations with the radio orchestra and about one commission per season. Though their hours have increased to half-time and their wages have steadily improved, the choristers, who supplement their incomes with church and teaching jobs, still aspire to parity with the orchestra.
Yet there is little turnover, with only two or three new choristers joining the ranks annually. Those chosen few must pass rigorous auditions, singing rangy, tricky choral parts, chromatic and whole-step scales and crescendo and memory exercises. Once accepted, the choristers must reaudition every three years (and after the age of 50, annually).
Mr. Ericson has hardly been idle since leaving the radio choir. Until 1990, he continued teaching choral conducting at the Stockholm Conservatory, where he trained virtually all of Sweden's choral conductors for four decades. He also went on leading a men's choir, Orphei Drangar, in Uppsala until 1991. He has taught master classes worldwide and conducted choirs including the BBC Singers, the Vienna State Opera Chorus, the Netherlands Chamber Choir and the Groupe Vocale de France. He also continues to conduct the Ericson Chamber Choir.
The radio choir has since been directed by the Baroque specialist Anders Ohrwall; Gustaf Sjokvist, an Ericson protege; and Mr. Kaljuste, an Estonian and the first non-Swedish leader. In 2002, the Swede Stefan Parkman, the principal conductor of the Danish Radio Choir and another Ericson associate, will take charge.
Mr. Ericson has so dominated Swedish choral life for so long that the waning of his career seems to cause an unspoken malaise. Yet his legacy is so tangible -- in Sweden's vital choral repertory; in its "pyramid" of more than half a million regular choral singers, from beginners to virtuosos; in its army of impeccably trained conductors -- that there seems little cause for worry.
Still, Sweden's recent economic slowdown, high unemployment rate and shift away from the welfare-state model make its arts organizations understandably nervous. A full 70 percent of the radio orchestra and choir's $10 million budget is direct government subsidy.
Perhaps Mr. Ericson's greatest but least tangible legacy is the legendary Scandinavian choral sound. It's a sinewy, lean sonority, less expansive than that of a Slavic, German or Italianate choir. For the rest, one can only itemize the qualities of great choirs the world over: purity of tone and pitch, an impeccable unison, perfectly blended partials, rhythmic precision, unanimity of diction, stylistic versatility and finely modulated dynamics, from diaphanous piano to bracing forte.
The definition of the elusive "Scandinavian sound" was one topic addressed at an informal symposium before the radio choir's jubilee concert. Mr. Lidholm defined it as "an absolutely even, equalized sound, in which every singer consents to relinquish his or her own personality in favor of the choir's."
Mr. Ericson admitted to a paradox. "The secret is solo-quality voices," he said. "In an orchestra, any violinist could step out and play the Beethoven Violin Concerto. Why shouldn't one of the sopranos in a good choir be able to step out and sing Mozart's 'Exsultate Jubilate'?" And indeed, over the decades, the radio choir has included Kim Borg, Nicolai Gedda, Kerstin Meyer, Anne Sofie von Otter, Erik Saeden, Elisabeth Soderstrom and Ingvar Wixell, among others.
Mr. Salonen waxed typically poetic: "Their sound is like the northern light, and to get it, you must know what it is to live without sun."

HEADLINE: DANCE; 
What Is 'Black Dance'? A Cultural Melting Pot

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER REARDON; Christopher Reardon's most recent article for Arts & Leisure was about the choreographer Doug Varone.

 BODY:
IF things had gone according to plan, Salia Sanou would be earning a decent living these days as a police inspector in Burkina Faso, the tropical West African country where he was born and reared. After passing the police exam, Mr. Sanou was on the verge of getting his badge in 1991. Then, in a final fling with dance, which he had studied since childhood, he went to an audition that turned his world upside down.
 Seydou Boro showed up, too. Not unlike Mr. Sanou, his compatriot, he had pursued a respectable career working with computers. His dream, though, was to perform in films and on stage. The audition helped it come true. 
 Today Mr. Sanou and Mr. Boro are widely regarded as two of West Africa's most inventive dance makers, right up there with Beatrice Kombe from Ivory Coast. Proteges of the French choreographer Mathilde Monnier, they performed at last summer's Lincoln Center Festival in her postmodern retelling of Sophocles' "Antigone." 
Later this month they will return to New York to present one of their own works, called "Taagala." The title means "traveler" in Bambara, a language spoken in parts of West Africa, and the two choreographers give it an expansive reading. The 50-minute piece, which will be staged on Feb. 21 and 23 at the Harvey Theater at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, presents an expressionist vision of the itinerant life familiar to both sub-Saharan nomads and jet-setting artists. 
"Taagala" comes as part of "Black Dance: Tradition and Transformation," an annual series of performances, discussions and master classes presented by 651 Arts, a community-based organization that rents office space at the theater. The series will run from Feb. 15 through Feb. 24, offering recent works by the African-American choreographers Abdel R. Salaam, Bebe Miller and Ronald K. Brown.
An opening-night celebration will honor 14 black dancers and choreographers who have advanced the art form, among them Katherine Dunham, George Faison, Diane McIntyre and Eleo Pomare. There will also be a screening of an excerpt from "Free to Dance," a new documentary that chronicles the contributions that black artists have made to modern dance in the United States. Produced by the American Dance Festival, it is to be broadcast nationally by PBS in April as part of its "Dance in America" series.
"Black dance" has always been a problematic term, not least because of enduring conflicts over race and the body. Adding to the confusion is the facility with which black dancers and choreographers have absorbed and spread cultural influences.
Last year, 651 Arts underscored this propensity by presenting a slate of emerging choreographers whose work defied any neat distinctions between black and white dance. (One choreographer took some of her inspiration from video games, another from circus tricks.) Similarly, this year's lineup stresses the long tradition of transformation.
"We need to recognize that tradition is something that is created," said Mr. Salaam, 50, a native New Yorker who worked his way up through the Chuck Davis Dance Company before starting his own troupe in 1981. "It's constantly evolving and constantly developing."
Mr. Salaam's reverence for traditional African dance is matched only by his willingness to use it as a springboard for experimentation. That hasn't always been a safe position. When he began to meld traditional and modern steps 16 years ago, he came under fire from both camps.
"It was very controversial," he said. "These two didactic languages were bumping up against each other, and they were seen as philosophically incompatible. Now everybody's doing it. Finally there's this understanding that culture is organic, that it has deep roots to nourish it and branches spreading in different directions."
Mr. Salaam's troupe, Forces of Nature Dance Theater Company, traces that growth in "Rhythm Legacy: The Living Books." Almost biblical in scope, it starts with the discovery of rhythm in Africa and ends with its second coming in America. Along the way, it traces the evolution of many traditional African dances, like a mating dance that originated in Senegal and took on new meaning among the Gullah people on the Sea Islands off the coast of Georgia.
Dance transforms itself on African soil, too, a process that seems to keep pace with globalization. Another reason, though, is support for creative partnerships and international tours through programs like Africa Exchange at 651 Arts and L'Afrique en Creations in Paris. Mr. Sanou and Mr. Boro, both in their early 30's, have benefited from each of these programs. Yet their passion for experimentation goes back much further.
One of Mr. Sanou's mentors was Germaine Acogny, a Senegalese choreographer who has worked closely with Maurice Bejart and Susanne Linke. (Ms. Acogny's company, Jant-Bi, performed Ms. Linke's "Coq Est Mort" ("The Rooster Is Dead") last summer at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Massachusetts.)
Mr. Boro, on the other hand, got his early movement training on the soccerfield, and later he joined a theater company in Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso.
They caught the eye of Ms. Monnier when she went to audition dancers and musicians for "Pour Antigone," her update of the Greek tragedy, which she planned to set in Africa. (Raised in France and Morocco, she presaged the recent boom in crosscultural collaboration.) Ms. Monnier chose five artists to work with her in France. 
For Mr. Sanou, the experience was an epiphany. "I was trained in African styles by the older men in the village," he recalled in a 1999 interview, "but I never imagined that I could make a career of it, or that I could dance in silence, without music. Abroad, I discovered the music in me."
After finishing "Pour Antigone," he and Mr. Boro stayed with Ms. Monnier's company at the national choreographic center in Montpellier, France. Even so, they returned often to their families in Burkina Faso.
Once known as Upper Volta, the country now takes its name from a phrase in two local languages, Moore and Dioula, that means "land of upright people." Nevertheless, it has experienced five military coups since winning independence from France in 1960. The most recent one, coming with the assassination of Thomas Sankara in 1987, gave a haunting subtext to "Pour Antigone." Like Polyneices in the ancient play, Sankara was never given a proper burial.
Ouagadougou's flourishing film and theater industries have inspired Mr. Sanou and Mr. Boro to press ahead with plans to open a choreographic center modeled on the one in Montpellier. The project began to take root in 1996, when they established a troupe, Compagnie Salia Ni Seydou and created their first dance together, "Le Siecle des Fous" ("The Century of Fools").
Mr. Boro took the lead in choreographing their next piece, which was called "Figninto" (Bambara for "blind"). After winning prizes in Angola and France, it edged out "Pour Antigone" and "Le Coq Est Mort" to win the people's choice award at the 1999 International Festival of New Dance in Montreal.
Audiences in Ouagadougou were cynical at first. Several years ago, Mr. Sanou heard a viewer there remark, "They spend six months in France and voila! they dance like fools to please the whites." Now the prevailing view is more receptive. One explanation for the changed attitude lies in the dancers' physical artistry.
"Salia has a coiled kind of energy, like a cricket that flies up with explosive force," said Nena Gilreath Lucas, co-director of Atlanta's Ballethnic Dance Company, which gave the two choreographers a residency last summer. "Seydou is more like an albatross. His arms are so long, and he's so tall. It gives his movement a smoother quality, full of breath and air."
Joining them in "Taagala," their third production, are two other dancers and a pair of traditional musicians from Burkina Faso. Shrouded in a linen sheet, the dancers evoke a sense of dislocation and loss of identity that sometimes comes with a life spent in constant motion.
Travel is a recurring theme in this year's "Black Dance" series. Mr. Brown, 34, takes a sanguine view of migration and immigration in his new work, "High Life." Born in Brooklyn, he said the first act grew out of his sense of wonderment at the Great Migration, when millions of blacks moved north and created a new hybrid culture. The second act is set in West Africa after independence and was inspired by several recent trips to Ivory Coast to work with the choreographer Rokiya Kone. (Through Africa Exchange, she has also come to New York to work with Mr. Brown's company, Evidence.)
"I don't want to bastardize traditional dance, but when I go into the studio I'm trying to physicalize an emotion," he said. "I don't worry about how I do it, or whether I'm drawing from capoeira, modern dance, traditional or what I might do in a club."
Ms. Miller, also Brooklyn-born, shares Mr. Brown's expansive reach, if not his every aim. A postmodernist known for the intimate tenor of her musings on cultural identity, she deftly probed the dynamics of race, class and gender in "Going to the Wall," which was seen last spring at the Joyce Theater.
The casting for her newest dance, "Verge," might suggest a return to those themes. (Ms. Miller, now 50, described it as a quartet with "two men, two women; two whites, two blacks.")
Cultural factors are still present, but her main interest was in exploring the more primal, animalistic properties of touch. She began working on the piece two years ago during a residency in Portland, Ore.
"One of the first things we did was go to the zoo and watch the primates and the blind mole rats to get a different sense of the body and moving in your skin," she recalled. "The next day we went downtown to Pioneer Square, where all the grunge kids hang out. We sat for an hour watching them. It soon became clear that they had their own economy and their own social rules, a lot of which was manifested through touch."
BACK in the studio, she and her dancers began developing new movement vocabulary through a series of structured improvisations. One day they formed a pile of bodies on the floor in an effort to "resensualize" themselves.
"It was one of the most lovely things I've ever done," Ms. Miller said.
"I found myself at one point with someone's chin underneath my chin in a way I'd never felt before. It was nothing very interesting to look at, but it short-circuited all of my physical and emotional impulses. It felt amazing to be there wondering: what's in contact here?"
Her question, asked of cultures as well as chins, is an apt catch phrase for the "Black Dance" series.

HEADLINE: GOVERNMENT; 
New Liaison to Gay Residents: From Rabble Rouser to Bureaucrat

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA ROWE 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS 

 BODY:
UNTIL last month, Joseph DeFilippis had spent his adult life as a rabble-rousing advocate for gays and lesbians, lobbying government officials and writing angry letters. Now he has switched sides.
 Mr. DeFilippis is Westchester County's new full-time liaison to the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. 
 He was persuaded to make the leap into government because of what he sees as the clear commitment of County Executive Andrew J. Spano to better serve the so-called "L.G.B.T. community."
The acronym stands for lesbian-gay-bisexual-transgender and is the current, politically correct catchall phrase. But Mr. DeFilippis hates it.
"It sound like you're ordering a sandwich," he said. "This is going to be an adjustment for me, working in the political arena. I tend to shoot from the hip."
During an interview at his new office, Mr. DeFilippis, 33, was just moving in -- trying to find a stapler that worked and figuring out exactly what a community liaison does. 
He is the former coordinator of the Queer Economic Justice Network, which he founded in 1999 to alert government to the effects of welfare reform on gays and lesbians. He also worked on behalf of elderly gay people as the director of Sage, a community organization in Queens. Gay seniors are particularly isolated, he said, because they are less likely to have children to provide for them and are routinely turned away from nursing homes that will not admit their partners.
"There's a myth that we're all white, educated, affluent men. I don't think the gay agenda is just getting into the military and getting married," said Mr. DeFilippis, who did, in fact, marry his partner, David Koteles, seven years ago. The couple live together in northern Manhattan.
A native of Queens, Mr. DeFilippis is the son of immigrants whose dinner table arguments focused neither on political parties nor lifestyles but on a kind of one-upmanship over how left-leaning one could fairly claim to be. He found his calling after college when he went to work for the New York Foundation and saw that activism could actually make a difference.
"That's where I decided that fighting over the dinner table wasn't really a sufficient contribution," he said.
But how, exactly, will Mr. DeFilippis fill his days in Westchester? 
He plans to spend much of his time educating employees in schools, hospitals, clinics and senior centers on how to be sensitive to gay and lesbian clients. He will also create an advisory board -- like the county's African-American and Latino boards -- to advise Mr. Spano, and he plans to hold community forums to gain a better sense of the needs of gays and lesbians in Westchester.
"We have a large lesbian-gay community here," Mr. Spano said. "And we thought its needs would be better served if we had a designated person who could respond. I expect Joseph to be our eyes and ears, to investigate charges of harassment or discrimination and to refer people to our Human Rights Commission, if need be, on matters of sexual orientation. That's a full-time job."
Mr. DeFilippis is not the first person to hold the post. Mr. Spano's predecessor, Andrew P. O'Rourke, created the position as a part-time job. Mr. Spano has expanded it to 40 hours a week, with a salary of $65,235 a year.
The last person to hold the job was Dr. Zelle Andrews, who left almost a year ago. The county does not have any other liaison positions.
Depending on whom one asks, gays and lesbians make up 5 to 10 percent of the general population. But in Westchester they may be particularly hidden, said Laura Newman, executive director of the Loft in White Plains, a lesbian and gay community services center with 2,200 people on its mailing list.
"It's not like living in New York City or the Village with people waving flags all the time," she said. "One of the reasons that people are particularly closeted up here is that they may not be sure this is a friendly climate."
For good reason. Two years ago, when the county was forming its Human Rights Commission, the attempt to include language about sexual orientation in its charter brought a firestorm, Ms. Newman said.
"I saw a lot of extremely bigoted people who were quite outspoken about not accepting lesbian and gay people or families," she said.
With the hiring of Mr. DeFilippis, Mr. Spano is trying to address that. Last month, he also introduced legislation that would create a domestic partnership registry, so unmarried couples in a long-term relationship could qualify for legal protection and benefits.
More evidence, Mr. DeFilippis said, of the county's commitment to this population.
"That's what got me to schlep up here every day from Manhattan," he said. "The feeling that I am going to work with an administration that's truly open to this."

Billion-Dollar Expansion Plan for High-Tech Center

BYLINE:  By RACHELLE GARBARINE

DATELINE: WEST WINDSOR 

 BODY:
FROM the outside a cluster of buildings along Route 1 here looks more like a 1950's high school than a repository of high-technology research and development of the sort that takes place inside the Sarnoff Corporation, which pioneered such innovations as color TV and high-definition television as well as the infrared camera. 
 Now, the company is planning to transform its 600,000-square-foot headquarters into a 3.5-million-square-foot technology campus that, like Sarnoff itself, will marry technology and research with commerce. In partnership with the Advance Group of Bedminster, the company plans to build the $1 billion project in stages over the next 10 to 15 years, with the first 610,000-square-foot phase expected to start in 2003. Stubbins Associates of Cambridge, Mass., designed the master plan for the project and is its architect with Rothe-Johnson of Edison. 
 The plan still must navigate the approval process. But it has already drawn both applause for the jobs it could generate and criticism for the disruption in the quality of life it could cause when added with other projects planned along the Route 1 corridor, from New Brunswick to Trenton. 
The technology campus is to comprise as many as 22 buildings with laboratories, offices and hotels as well as such services as a day care center and health club. Its anchor is to be a 750,000-square-foot headquarters for Sarnoff, including incubator space for its spinoffs. There are also plans for satellite campuses of Stevens Institute of Technology of Hoboken and the New Jersey Institute of Technology of Newark. 
The buildings, along with deck parking garages, will be clustered on 89 acres in the middle of the 336-acre property. Beyond the existing buildings, the site is a tangle of woods and fields between Washington Road and the Millstone River. 
"We're not just going to build more buildings, but create a center with national focus," James E. Carnes, Sarnoff's president and chief executive, said. The project could attract 10,000 jobs, he said. 
Over the years Sarnoff, which creates and commercializes electronics, biomedical and information technologies, spurred similar companies to locate along Route 1, helping to make it a high-tech corridor. Now, with its proposed campus, Sarnoff hopes its own facilities will be attractive to scientists that it is recruiting as well as to technology-related companies.
In many ways, Sarnoff's decision to develop its site has as much to do with changes in the information economy as it does with changes in the company itself.
The company was started in 1942 as the nonprofit research arm of RCA by Gen. David Sarnoff, RCA's chairman. Its complex here was built by 1965, when Route 1 still passed potato fields, cow pastures and hardwood forest -- not office parks. 
In 1986 RCA was acquired by the General Electric Company, which had its own research arm, making the complex redundant. It was sold in 1987 to SRI International, a nonprofit company in Menlo Park, Calif., and became a for-profit subsidiary. 
SINCE then Sarnoff, no longer reliant on its parent for financing, worked for industry and government clients under contract or for royalties on products made from its discoveries. In 1992 Sarnoff started to spin off start-up companies -- 19 of them so far -- to bring its technologies to market, and it expects to profit by selling all or part of its stock in the companies when they eventually go public or when the start-up company is acquired by another concern. (Orchid BioSciences, which works on genetics-based technologies, is its only fledging to go public, and Sarnoff's stake was worth $1.2 million at the time of the offering last May. The VideoBrush Corporation, a spinoff whose product enables several snapshots to be combined into one, was sold in 1999.)
Meanwhile, Sarnoff, which employs 750, realized it needed to expand and update its buildings to remain competitive, Mr. Carnes said. To do so "without draining our investment in our technology" meant leveraging other assets, including real estate, he said, adding that the new headquarters would help with recruiting because "it will provide a flexible and collaborative environment." 
That Sarnoff is the sponsor and anchor of its 336-acre park in West Windsor makes it distinct from the three technology research parks already in the state. Two of them are along the Route 1 corridor. They are the 2,200-acre Princeton Forrestal Center in Plainsboro and South Brunswick and the 50-acre state-sponsored Technology Center of New Jersey in North Brunswick. The third is the 50-acre University Heights Science Park in Newark's Central Ward, sponsored by four institutions of higher education.
Dean Lundahl, regional managing director at Advance, said the Sarnoff park planned to attract established as well as emerging companies. He said -- and early proponents agree -- that the park would help the image of New Jersey as a high-tech state and Mercer County as one of its silicon corners.
"Sarnoff is an icon of New Jersey's transition to the New Economy," said Stephen R. Sasala II, president and chief executive of Prosperity New Jersey, a public-private nonprofit partnership created by the state to attract high-tech concerns. 
Science- and technology-oriented companies are considered a growth engine for New Jersey, which has more scientists per capita than any other state. It also has more than 10,000 high-tech companies, putting it fourth in the nation in the number of such concerns, according to Prosperity New Jersey.
Mr. Lundahl said that because the project is along Route 1 and near a train station, it conforms with a goal of the state Development and Redevelopment Plan to concentrate development near highways and mass transit. He also said the project's proposed 3.5 million square feet is less than the 4.5 million feet that could be developed on the site under current zoning.
Carole Carson, the mayor of West Windsor, said the project "is well-designed, well-thought out" and "in an appropriate place" for growth. It is also important, she said, that the company stay in the township.
Still, challenges exist, including environmental concerns involving the nearby Millstone River and traffic issues. A proposed bypass on Route 1 near the Sarnoff site is under review by the state's Department of Transportation. The developers support the bypass, which will parallel Washington Road, as a way to keep cars moving along the highway and to their park. 
Meanwhile, some critics of the way development along Route 1 is evolving say that improvements along the heavily traveled highway, including the proposed bypass, have not kept pace with the growth and that more should be done before the next round of projects, like Sarnoff's, moves forward. Among them is George Hawkins, executive director of the Stony Brook-Millstone River Watershed Association, an environmental preservation group.
"Sarnoff's decision to develop its site makes sense in isolation," he said, noting, however, that if land-use decisions continue to be made piecemeal, "the collective consequences from the potential development will be calamity." He said that under present zoning some 10 million square feet of commercial space could be added to the corridor over time. 
Mercer County Executive Robert D. Prunetti acknowledged that "the livability of the county is dependent on striking a balance between growth and conservation." He called the Sarnoff project reasonable.
The developers say they expect to address concerns about the project. Its cornerstone will be Sarnoff's new 750,000-square-foot headquarters, which will be created by demolishing 350,000 square feet of its existing complex, renovating the remaining 250,000 feet and adding 500,000 square feet of space. About 150,000 square feet will be an incubator for start-ups. 
Mr. Lundahl said the hope is that as those companies mature, they will want to stay close to Sarnoff and its resources and take space in the rest of the technology park.
The other 21 planned buildings include two hotels, a health club and a day care center. Others will contain the 2.2 million square feet of research laboratory and office space, most of which will not be constructed until after a significant amount of space is preleased, Mr. Lundahl said, noting that rents will be competitive. Mr. Lundahl and brokers in the area all said that offices of the sort planned for the complex would currently charge rents in the low to mid $30's per square foot per year. 
With such a "long-term project there will be ups and downs in the economy," Mr. Carnes said, adding that the key is "to re-evaluate and respond to the market."

HEADLINE: The Enforcer; 
As Mrs. Whitman Begins Her New Job, There Is Debate Over Her Commitment to the Environment in the Past

BYLINE:  By JOHN SULLIVAN 

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
THERE was Christie Whitman, canoeing down a pristine stream in the interior of New Jersey. This was not a tourism advertisement, but rather a back-to-nature touch strategically inserted into the governor's State of the State address several weeks ago.
 And this was not just any governor, but the woman who had just been chosen by President-elect Bush to head the nation's Environmental Protection Agency. As the state's own Senator Robert G. Torricelli put it, "There are few training grounds that could better prepare someone for this position than the governor of New Jersey." 
 But as Mrs. Whitman begins her new career, there is some debate over the depth of her concern for the environment. Her efforts to preserve open space and to protect the coastline have received high marks from nearly every environmental group. But the governor's overall record -- particularly in her first term, when "open for business" was a campaign theme -- has another side. Faced with a deep economic slump, Mrs. Whitman took office pledging to slash not only taxes but regulations that stood in the way of business. 
"She is certainly good on open space," said Edward Lloyd, a professor at Columbia University Law School and a former director of the Rutgers Environmental Law Clinic. "That is what she is best known for in the environmental area. On the regulatory side, there is a very different story to tell."
Indeed, in her last address as governor, Mrs. Whitman cited her program to protect a million acres of woods and farmland from development, and used the speech to unveil a new effort to improve state parks.
"Even as the state has been growing, our air and water are cleaner, with fewer days of high ozone and carbon monoxide and far fewer beach closings," Mrs. Whitman said. "All policy is personal, and for me few policies are more personal than our efforts to preserve open space in the Garden State. Raised on a farm, I want every New Jersey child now and in the future to enjoy the character of the state that I have always loved."
The reality is far more complex.
For instance, the State Department of Environmental Protection was one of Governor Whitman's first targets. She clearly intended to shift the organization and philosophy of an agency long viewed as an enemy of business and developers. In her first budget, Mrs. Whitman cut more than 200 positions from the department, an action that included transferring the Board of Public Utilities to the Treasury Department.
When environmental groups and public employee unions strenuously protested, the governor was unmoved, saying increased regulation was not the best way to get a cleaner environment.
The cuts Mrs. Whitman proposed for later budgets were so deep that they drew opposition from her own party. In May 1996, some state senators including John O. Bennett, the majority leader from Little Silver, said Republicans would oppose the governor's budget unless she restored money for environmental programs.
"The proposed budget would require dramatic reductions in scientific, technical and human resources," Senator Bennett and six other senators wrote in a letter to the governor. "We feel strongly that the proposed layoffs of D.E.P. personnel will negatively impact the department's ability to effectively safeguard the environment and protect public health."
In subsequent years, Mrs. Whitman restored much of the agency's financing -- though her budget allocations did not reach the 1994 level until the fiscal year 2000.
In a recent interview, Eileen McGinnis, the governor's chief of policy and planning, said that although some of Mrs. Whitman's policies in her first term were a response to the state's economic problems, the changes at the Department of Environmental Protection were not among them.
"The department needed a more focused mission," Ms. McGinnis said.
In many ways, the Whitman administration marked a deep change for New Jersey's environmental policies -- from a trend toward greater regulation and control to a more cooperative relationship with industry and developers. While her predecessors created large blocks of rules to shape the environment -- the Byrne administration's creation of the Pinelands commission, the financing of municipal sewage plants in the Kean years and the Florio administration's stringent pollution regulations -- Mrs. Whitman concentrated on adjusting existing rules rather than creating new ones.
Ms. McGinnis said the intent was not to simply cut down on regulation, but to replace a thicket of confusing requirements with clear timetables and concrete goals. She said the plan was to maintain strict environmental standards while eliminating the creation of what some considered unneeded regulations.
"I would say sensible regulation," Ms. McGinnis said.
But the definition of sensible can vary depending on one's agenda, and that change in philosophy is controversial to this day. Many of the steps taken by Mrs. Whitman still rankle environmental groups in the state, including these actions:
*Elimination of the Office of Environmental Prosecutor and the office of the Public Advocate and the creation of the Office of the Business Ombudsman.
*Downsizing the Department of Environmental Protection, which saw its staff drop to a low of 3,022 in 1998 from 3,729 in 1994.
*Elimination of the Department of Environmental Protection lab.
*Support for the expansion of controversial highways and such developments such as Merrill Lynch's corporate park in Hopewell.
*Reduction in both staff and financing for the state's parks.
*Elimination of more than 100 stations that monitor water quality.
*Removal of more than 1,000 chemicals from a group of hazardous industrial chemicals, called the right-to-know list, that are subject to state inspection.
David S. Pringle, the campaign director of the New Jersey Environmental Federation, a private watchdog organization, maintained that Mrs. Whitman's policies had a drastic effect. Although he was quick to credit the governor's efforts to preserve open space, he said she had been "exceedingly poor on enforcement and regulatory funding."
"There was a 20 to 30 percent cut in funding for environmental programs," Mr. Pringle said. "There was a two-thirds cut in the toxic right-to-know list. All of these had the cumulative impact of sending a message to polluters that they could get away with significant compromises to environmental and public health."
Other critics pointed to a sharp drop in money collected in fines and penalties for environmental violations in the seven years Mrs. Whitman held office -- as much as 80 percent in some of those years. In addition, the number of inspections conducted by environmental regulators dropped to 23,686 in 2000 from 27,826 in 1994. In 1999, the inspector general of the federal agency that Mrs. Whitman would later inherit issued a report critical of the state's water-monitoring program for failing to meet federal guidelines. Ultimately, the environmental agency suspended some financing because the state did not file its water-quality reports on time.
Not surprisingly, Whitman administration officials disagree vehemently with the critics. Cathy Tormey, an assistant commissioner at the state Department of Environmental Protection, attributed the drop in the number of inspections to a change in the inspections themselves rather than a lax attitude.
In addition, Ms. Tormey said the number of legal actions taken against major polluters remained virtually the same after Mrs. Whitman took office in January 1994. She said that the federal environmental agency assessed penalties of $225 million in 2000, with New Jersey collecting $12 million in fines.
"We are out there and we are assessing penalties against people who are violating environmental laws," Ms. Tormey said. "We do have a strong enforcement program and it does respond with penalties."
On the other hand, critics say the $12 million collected by the state pales in comparison with $26 million in fines collected in the last year of the Florio administration. While Ms. Tormey and others in the Whitman administration contend that the amount of the fines has little to do with environmental quality, critics insist it is an important measure of the state's aggressiveness in sanctioning polluters. If the state is not willing to punish violators, they say, then it naturally follows that more companies are willing to take risks.
"That has bad consequences because people don't try to comply until they are caught," Mr. Lloyd said. "It sounds good to say we want to assist, we want to foster compliance. But the question is what happens in the field. It makes a difference when you have the hammer."
Before Mrs. Whitman took office, the willingness of state environmental regulators to use an enforcement hammer had long been a complaint of industry. Businesses -- particularly those in heavy industry and land development -- often found themselves at odds with state officials.
"There was a command and control atmosphere in Trenton, and businesses were viewed not as friends but as enemies," said Joseph Gonzalez, president of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, the state's largest private business advocacy group.
And while business did not always agree with Mrs. Whitman's approach -- the two sides fought bitterly over the state's sewer rules -- Mr. Gonzalez said the governor was always willing to work with industry, particularly in shortening the time needed to receive environmental permits.
"We have seen real improvement in that across the board," he said.
Critics, on the other hand, said that Mrs. Whitman's concern for economic growth caused problems for the administration in several cases.
One example often cited is the controversial Merrill Lynch office park in Hopewell, a rural town in Mercer County. Faced with the prospect of the investment company moving 3,500 jobs out of state, Governor Whitman stepped in with more than $100 million in incentives to persuade the company to stay. The project, a sprawling office development with the potential to house more space than the World Trade Center, was seen as a betrayal by town residents, particularly in light of the governor's support for open-space preservation.
"The state capital is eight miles away, and they are building this giant office building in a cornfield, while Trenton is going begging for jobs," said Mayor Marylou Ferrara of Hopewell Township. "The state gave them subsidies and tax breaks like you can't believe. They made it more attractive to build in a soybean field than a city."
Then there was the state energy efficiency fund, with nearly $1 billion that was supposed to pay for renewable energy and heightened efficiency. Environmentalists contend that the state Board of Public Utilities has dragged its feet and has spent none of the money, even though the first $128 million has been available for nearly a year. Utility companies have fought for control of the funds, while environmentalists argue that the money should be disbursed by the state or by a combination of industry and environmentalists.
"There has been no articulation of an energy policy," said Curtis Fisher, legislative director for the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group.
Mr. Fisher, whose group successfully pushed for the money as part of the 1999 energy deregulation bill, said recent problems in California underscored its importance. New York recently doubled available funds for energy efficiency, he said, while New Jersey had been slow to move. "So far they have refused to move forward with this money, and it is critically needed," he said.
Even more embarrassing for the Whitman administration was fallout from a settlement between state regulators and a large cranberry grower over accusations that the company's operations had expanded into the state's wetlands. Under the proposed agreement, A. R. DeMarco Enterprises said it would turn over another large parcel of land to the state to settle any complaints lodged by New Jersey environmental regulators.
Critics raised an outcry, pointing to a longtime friendship between Garfield DeMarco, the company's president, and Robert Shinn, the commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection. Although Mr. Shinn said he had recused himself from the settlement, Governor Whitman requested an investigation by the state inspector general.
In November, the inspector general criticized the regulators' actions, saying the settlement was flawed for several reasons. And although he found no improper actions by the commissioner, the inspector general said Mr. Shinn did not totally shut himself out of the process.
"The appearance of impropriety coupled with an inappropriate enforcement process leads the office of inspector general to conclude that it would not be in the public interest to finalize" the agreement, wrote Edward M. Neafsey, the inspector general.
The Department of Environmental Protection is still working on a final settlement based on the guidelines recommended by the inspector general, a spokeswoman said last week.
Despite the criticism of her stewardship of the state's natural resources, the Whitman administration's response has been consistent: Look at results, not at regulations.
"Is the air and water cleaner?" Ms. McGinnis asked. "That is where the focus should be."
To be sure, many environmental groups credit Mrs. Whitman with improving the state in several areas. Her most ambitious effort was the plan to save a million acres of open space and the protection of Sterling Forest on the New York State border.
Even so, aides to Mrs. Whitman acknowledged that the loss of open space in New Jersey -- the nation's most densely populated state -- actually increased during her terms in office.
In addition, the beaches are much cleaner than they were as recently as 10 years ago, when the sight of medical waste and industrial sludge washing up on New Jersey's beaches was not unusual. Indeed, there have been no beach closings in recent years.
"Our program is one of the best in the nation," said Cindy Zipf, executive director of Clean Ocean Action, a private environmental advcocacy group.
Ms. Zipf said Mrs. Whitman led the effort to stop the dumping of toxic harbor sludge off the New Jersey coast, and was a strong proponent of the state's beach-monitoring programs. And though Ms. Zipf said her organization would like to see even tighter regulation of pollutants in the water, she conceded that under Mrs. Whitman, "the ocean experience has been a positive one."
In other areas, the record seems to be more mixed. A report prepared for Governor Whitman by an aide concluded that water quality had improved in some areas but worsened in others. According to the memorandum, 42 percent of streams and rivers were identified as polluted in last year's water-quality report as against 33 percent in 1994. But the memorandum also said that the number of streams identified as severely polluted dropped to 1 percent in 2000 from from 5 percent in 1994.
Air quality is better since Mrs. Whitman took office, according to reports filed with the Environmental Protection Agency by state regulators, with lower levels of such pollutants as lead, sulfur and airborne particles. Critics of Mrs. Whitman acknowledged that she took a strong position on reducing the amount of pollution emitted from power plants and praised her for sticking with her program to toughen emissions testing for vehicles despite the political fallout from a disastrous and costly implementation.
Still, critics contended that the improvements in air quality were part of a trend that had begun in the 1970's with passage of the federal Clean Air Act and the banning of such pollutants as leaded gasoline. In addition, they said that in recent years, improvement in the air quality had flattened when compared with the strides made in previous decades.
"We should have been a lot better," said John Paul Guinan, a staff attorney for the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group. "Our technology has improved, but the results have plateaued."
While supporters and critics alike agree that it may be too soon to evaluate Mrs. Whitman's performance on the environment, Assemblyman Leonard Lance, a Republican from Flemington, says that overall, "the record is strong, particularly in the second term."
Speaking in defense of her checkered record, Mr. Lance said Mrs. Whitman did not have the ability to finance many of her environmental initiatives until the state's economy rebounded at the beginning of her second term, and that programs like the 10-year open-space plan would bear fruit many years in the future.
On the other hand, Mr. Fisher of the public interest organization said that many of the programs that have helped to clean up the state's air and its beaches were begun by Governors Kean and Byrne, and that the results of Governor Whitman's efforts might not become apparent for some time. 
"Environmental policies take years to see all of the positives and negatives," he said. "It will take years to know exactly, but the early indication is there is damage that needs repair."

Learning the Hard Way in Camden

BYLINE:  By JILL P. CAPUZZO 

DATELINE: CAMDEN 

 BODY:
ONE indication that Annette D. Knox was the right choice for superintendent of schools here is that on the day after her first school board meeting, which went on until 2:30 in the morning, she was able to describe the event as "mild."
 Another good sign was that no matter how confrontational some speakers became during Monday night's marathon meeting, Ms. Knox kept her cool. While dozens of people approached the front of the room to question numerous items in Ms. Knox's first round of proposed changes, the new superintendent stared intently over the top of her rimless glasses, soaking up what the speakers had to offer, and occasionally responding, always politely and confidently. 
 "I learned over the years that you have to be calm and listen to what people have to say," said Ms. Knox. "The people here have a history with the city and the schools that I don't have, and they have their stories to tell. I have to know that history and where people are coming from. I may not always agree, but I need to know it." 
Perhaps that's a lesson that should have been reviewed when Ms. Knox first took over on Jan. 1 as superintendent of the largest and poorest school district in southern New Jersey.
On her first day on the job, the 54-year-old administrator made an indelible mark when she requested resignation slips from all 200 employees in the district's central administration office. The intent was not a wholesale firing of all district employees, Ms. Knox said, but to provide a tool for evaluating the organization to ensure that workers' skills matched their jobs and to give her some options.
But the damage was done. Teachers, administrators and union officials immediately perceived the action as a threat, and although Ms. Knox dropped her request for resignations, people remain cautious.
"I'm trying to be neutral and diplomatic, but her actions did not fare well with our members," said Claraliene Gordon, president of the Camden Education Association, which represents 3,100 of the district's 4,000 members. "I hope her intentions are honorable, but there's a process. That's what's in question, not her ability, not her plan."
In hindsight, Ms. Knox recognizes that she could have handled things differently that first week.
"I might have talked to more people about it, gotten more views," she said, adding, "I don't think it ended up badly. Some people may hold on to it, but I think we've moved around it as an organization."
Despite some ruffled feathers, Ms. Knox has not slowed down. In a city where the unemployment and crime rates are three times higher than the state averages, with a school district where 88 percent of the students qualify for subsidized lunches and 50 percent drop out before graduating from high school, time is a luxury that she does not have.
Filling a position that had been vacant since April 1999 has meant Ms. Knox had to hit the ground running. In her first month, she has proposed developing a uniform curriculum for all schools, privatizing the food service program, consolidating six school buildings that currently serve from 21 to 274 students each, reorganizing the district and creating a strong literacy program and a comprehensive summer school program. These and other proposals were included in her report to the board last week, but by the end of the meeting some items had to be tabled because of resistance.
In a highly politicized system, where a former school board president was convicted of spending school funds on personal meals and vacations, and the last superintendent resigned after repeated clashes with the board, part of what Ms. Knox is up against is the fact that she is the first woman and the first outsider to run Camden's 32 public schools serving 19,000 students. The president of the school board, Philip E. Freeman, said it was exactly that outsider status they were looking for when they narrowed their time-consuming search to five finalists, and then to Ms. Knox. 
"She brings a fresh perspective to the district that lends itself to being fair and unbiased," said Mr. Freeman. "She's apolitical, she's not connected to the system, doesn't have any special interest groups she's representing. She's someone who's open and honest and can promote her program to all the different factions with integrity." 
Before coming to Camden, Ms. Knox was regional superintendent of 23 public schools in Cleveland, where she was brought in to help restructure the school system that had just come out from under state rule. Most of her 31 years in education were spent in the New York City school system, where she started out as a first-grade teacher and worked her way up to principal in public schools throughout Harlem. She said she first got a taste for education as a young girl in the town of Washington, N.C.
"Growing up, I never really wanted to be a teacher," said Ms. Knox, who wears her hair in short, neat cornrows and dresses in black and neutral tones accented by native prints. "I had four aunts who were teachers, and we all lived in the same neighborhood, so I'd go to them whenever I needed help. Later I realized that those aunts had a lot more impact on me than I thought."
Ms. Knox said she was attracted to Camden because she always wanted to be superintendent of a district where she was really needed and her skills could be tested. This weekend she planned to move into her new home in Camden, just around the corner from the district offices and in view of the new baseball stadium under construction.
"Some districts are just matched to your personality," said Ms. Knox, who has signed a three-year contract at a salary of $160,000 a year, making her one of the highest-paid superintendents in the state. "I feel I'm matched to Camden. I'm a fighter. I'm a person who never gives up. I believe in always being prepared at all times, and if I'm not prepared, developing the skills and tools I need to be."
And fight she will have to, not only against the special interests of unions looking to protect members, but also against a system in which giving pupils a substandard education is so ingrained. Students describe the high schools as places where kids spend most of their days trying to figure out how to cut classes, where broken windows are standard and where fights can break out in the hallway at a moment's notice, where passing gym merely requires one to change into and out of uniform, and where students routinely fall asleep in class while teachers gossip with security guards. 
As the district where the 1981 class-action lawsuit of Abbott vs. Burke originated, Camden forced the New Jersey State Supreme Court and the state Board of Education, after several years of wrangling, to guarantee the same level of financing to poorer urban school districts as that provided by taxpayers in richer districts. To that end, Camden is one of the state's 30 special districts and receives $240 million of its $247 million budget from the state. But money is not always the answer. Camden spends $10,792 a year on each student -- far higher than the state average of $9,505 -- yet pupils' test scores fall far below average, a situation that has led to the state's oversight of the district for the last two years.
While educators point to everything from poverty to the high percentage of foreign-speaking students to inadequate resources as reasons for the schools' failures, Ms. Knox has been visiting classrooms in recent days, talking to students to find out what they feel is lacking in their schools.
"Students are able to tell you what they need," she said. "They see it at other schools, and they know that the experiences they're having here are not the same as those other students. Every child in this world starts out with the same intellectual capacity to learn. It is how we engage them in the school environment that will determine whether they can compete in this world."
Along with her critics, several people who spoke at the board meeting offered to lend their support, reminding Ms. Knox that she could not do it all alone. The next morning, Ms. Knox said she received several phone calls from well-wishers telling her they were praying for her and telling her to be strong. She says the welcome she has received from the community has been tremendous and that she feels the city is ready for the change she represents.
"There's a level of expectancy, that we're going to be moving ahead and people are wondering what's next," Ms. Knox said. "There's anticipation but I think it is positive. I've always been working my way toward a Camden, N.J.. I believe this is the place where I can make a difference. I have no fears."

Bitter Pill For Local Druggist

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN MILLER 

DATELINE: WANAQUE 

 BODY:
The signs are everywhere, though you have to slow down to see them.
 "For Rent" notices pepper a stretch of Ringwood Avenue in the Haskell section of this Passaic County town. And between sagging storefronts, another establishment announces that it sells "Used Junk." 
 Then there's a sign across the street: "Over 53 Years and We're Staying," in red letters in the window of Kressaty's Pharmacy. 
The reason for the sign's insistence is a proposal before the town planning board to allow a business on a vacant lot down the street from Kressaty's where a CVS pharmacy wants open. Borough officials contend that the depressed Haskell section desperately needs an anchor, something like a CVS, to attract new businesses. But the plan puts the officials in the uncomfortable position of threatening one of the town's few successful businesses -- and the kind of place where customers linger, talk about family, tell jokes.
"Our customers are more worried than we are," said Fred Kressaty, the 80-year-old pharmacy owner, who has encouraged visitors to sign a petition asking local officials to block the "unnecessary introduction" of chain stores.
"The arrival of chain stores is one sign of progress," the petition reads, "but the price of progress should not be the loss of people and institutions, whose dedication to the community is beneficial and long-standing."
Nearly 500 people signed the petition in the first week alone, and now there are more than 1,000 signatures, Mr. Kressaty said.
That still has not kept CVS from making an offer to buy out the pharmacy, thoughMr. Kressaty said he turned it down.
So far, the town has received about $1 million from the state to help build a "town center" for Haskell, complete with old-fashioned lights, brick crosswalks and a clock tower. Housing for 2,200 elderly residents has also been approved.
Indeed, there are already sections of Wanaque that have been visited by the mixed blessing of gentrifrication. Professionals are moving into the area, and homes that sold for a song are fetching more than $200,000. Passaic County Community College opened a campus in Wanaque last year. And a consulting firm is marketing the town to businesses. But none of this has done much for Haskell, and to make the area come alive, supporters of the CVS say new retail businesses have to be encouraged to come here.
"You can't invite merchants to come into a town that looks like the South Bronx," said Lorraine La Neve, a longtime resident and former president of the borough's Chamber of Commerce. 
Officials here envision restaurants, boutiques and business offices lining Ringwood Avenue, and it is a vision that many of them are excited about.
"Many towns will have these plans," said the borough administrator, Tom Carroll, "but it won't happen. Here, it will happen." 
Mr. Kressaty -- though his business is imperiled -- insisted that he was not opposed to competition. But Barbara Offner, a nurse who was shopping at the pharmacy, complained about the long lines and unfriendly service at chain stores.
Whether to accept the CVS is a tough decision, said Robert Rizzotti, a planning consultant who conducted an economic development study for the borough.
What's more, Mr. Rizzotti said that approval of the CVS must come quickly to assure the success of the redevelopment effort.
"It's an unfortunate situation in some instances, because businesses will be hurt," he said.
But James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, said Mr. Rizzotti might be overstating the case. 
"Any one store," Mr. Hughes said, "I don't think you could say the whole plan would hinge on it." 
But he did note that when local stores are pushed out, it's a loss of something less tangible than simply one business.
"Those pharmacies," he said, referring to chains like CVS, "can destroy the fabric of the community."
They can also offer discounted prices and wider selections, undercutting the smaller, locally owned businesses.
Todd Andrews, a spokesman for CVS, which is based in Woonsocket, R.I., disagreed with the notion that the chain would treat customers impersonally.
"That is a misconception," Mr. Andrews said. "Our pharmacists are professionals, and look after our patients with the same care and professionalism that other pharmacists would."
Moreover, the introduction of big pharmacies does not necessarily mean the death of smaller ones. Mr. Rizzotti's report, citing the Bergen County town of Waldwick, noted that two major chains had opened in the past few years -- including one near Waldwick Pharmacy..
"You have to be creative, flexible," said Bill Brown, who has owned the pharmacy for 28 years.
For Mr. Brown, the answer is a hometown feel, competitive pricing and innovative products like the throat lozenges he sells under the store's own label.
Despite such assurances, the concerns here are palpable. John Soojian, a 45-year resident of neighboring Pompton Lakes, who is the owner and developer of the CVS site, said he feared vilification.
"I'm damned if I do, I'm damned if I don't," Mr. Soojian said.
And Mayor Warren Hagstrom, who was born and raised here and has a seat on the planning board that will hear the CVS proposal, said he had been lying awake at night thinking about the plan for the last several weeks.
"I can't hurt them," Mr. Hagstrom said of the Kressaty family. 
But the Kressatys -- Fred and his wife, Claire and their daughter Terri, 44 -- insist that they will stay. Fred and Claire own the building and live above the store.
"I wouldn't consider closing at all," said Terri Kressaty, who stands to inherit the business. "There is absolutely nothing that will shut us down."

HEADLINE: THE CAPITOL; 
A Feud Brewing Over Family Leave

BYLINE:  By ABHI RAGHUNATHAN 

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
The usual marriage of convenience in which Republicans and business interests are joined in a common purpose -- is showing signs of strain.
 Blame the paid family-leave bill. 
 In fact, the attempt to grant all workers a paid leave of absence when they become parents has brought together legislators of both parties, though not the special interest groups that historically back them.
Labor groups and women's organizations claim that no one should have to choose between a paycheck and a child, which is why they support legislation that would allow employees with newborn or newly adopted children to collect up to 12 weeks of unemployment compensation while taking a leave from work.
Business groups see things differently.
They contend that such a bill would devastate companies by forcing them to seek new employees. Moreover, they say the money available to the state should be used for unemployment compensation, not financing a new government program that could lead to higher tax rates. 
Business groups were not pleased when the New Jersey chapter of the AFL-CIO, along with the state chapter of the National Organization for Women and more than 20 other advocacy groups announced last Monday that they were forming a coalition to lobby for the paid family leave bill.
"This bill is long overdue," said Assemblywoman Arline Friscia, Democrat of Middlesex, a sponsor of the measure who complained that parents no longer have time to spend with their children because most families now depend on the incomes of both parents.
Karen Jarrett of Newark, who spoke at the AFL-CIO's announcement of support for the measure, said that financial problems compelled her to return to her job counseling young mothers three weeks after adopting her 18-month old nephew.
"I just couldn't afford it," Ms. Jarrett said. "We don't need or ask for much help, but we could have used 12 weeks of help a few years ago."
Now, a parent of a newborn or newly adopted child can take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave. Businesses that employ 50 or more people are required to hire the person back at the same or an equivalent job. A temporary disability program also provides some pay for women on maternity leave, the length of which is determined by a doctor.
The proposed bill would replace the current law by allowing workers to draw up to 12 weeks of pay from the state's Unemployment Insurance fund. In addition, in a move that would make New Jersey the first state to adopt such a regulation, businesses that employ 50 or more people would be required to take back employees at the position they held when they left, or an equivalent one.
In the Assembly the bill was also sponsored by Charlotte Vandervalk, a Bergen County Republican. In the Senate Jack Sinagra, a Republican of Middlesex, and John Lynch, a Democrat of New Brunswick, sponsored the legislation.
The measure is before committees in both houses. The likelihood of the measure becoming law is very doubtful, however. Rae Hutton, a spokeswoman for the acting governor, Donald DiFrancesco, said that the governor liked the idea of the bill but was reluctant to support it without the backing of business interests in the state.
In opposing the bill, the South Jersey Chamber of Commerce called it disruptive to the workplace and said it would cripple small businesses. The New Jersey Business and Industry Association, which represents more than 16,000 businesses, had a three-person delegation fan out on Monday afternoon among the newspaper offices in the State House, where they spelled out how the bill could drain the state's unemployment fund.
The state now has a balance of $3.158 billion in the unemployment fund, which comes from taxes collected from workers and employers. Under the terms of the measure being considered, the commissioner of labor could deny aid if more than $130 million was spent on paid-family leave to prevent the fund from shrinking too rapidly.
Though workers pay a fixed rate, each business pays a different amount based on such factors as the number of people laid off and the amount of money in the unemployment fund.
Gregory Williams, a research analyst for the Office of Legislative Services, said the fund would have to dip at least $650 million before businesses would be pushed into a higher tax rate.
The New Jersey Business and Industry Association said the cost of the bill could run as high as $260 million a year if all the people eligible to do so took off 12 weeks, though the Office of Legislative Services placed the cost at about $100 million.
One businessman, Lou Roth, president of Wats Room Inc., a market research company with 300 employees in Rochelle Park, said the bill would force him to spend $8,000 to find and train about 20 new workers.
Mr. Roth also questioned the fairness of using funds intended for the unemployed to help those who just had a child.
"It's a personal issue to have a child," he said. "There's no reason why they should be funded by unemployment insurance funds which are paid by employees and employers."
Nonetheless, Assemblywoman Vandervalk said there was time to get some business groups to support the measure, suggesting that the state incorporate a tax cut for business, or decreasing the amount of paid leave that workers should get.
"We have to talk," she said. "There is still room for negotiation."

Micheaux Film at Newark Museum

BYLINE:  By Margo Nash 

 BODY:
 Just a few years after D. W. Griffith made "Birth of a Nation" in 1915, the African-American filmmaker Oscar Micheaux, a former coal miner and Pullman porter, started making films. In them, African-Americans are portrayed with dignity in roles of authority in contrast to the typical stock characters of the day. 
Micheaux's genres included drama, musicals and films about social themes, and he directed over 40 films between 1918 and 1948. On Saturday Feb. 10 at 2 p.m. the Newark Museum will screen, one of Micheaux's silent films, "The Symbol of the Unconquered" (1920). The drummer Max Roach will provide the percussive accompaniment to the film he performed once before on television. Pearl Bowser, co-author of a book about Micheaux published last fall, "Writing Himself Into History: Oscar Micheaux, His Silent Films, and His Audience," (Rutgers University Press) will also be there to discuss Micheaux and sign copies of her book. In her book, Ms. Bowser wrote that "The Symbol of the Unconquered" reveals the economic underpinnings of the Ku Klux Klan. Michele Parchment, manager of public programs, who also coordinates the Newark Black Film Festival, said of Micheaux, "He is one of our silent heroes when we are dealing with African-American history."

Waiting at theGate For Trade With Cuba

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY DePALMA 

 BODY:
THE Havana harbor has been a forbidden port of call for American ships since the United States imposed its economic embargo on Cuba in the early 1960's, and not much was expected to change after Congress enacted a law last fall lifting the embargo just enough to allow the first sales of food and medicine. The new law imposed such severe restrictions on financing that nobody expected any deals.
 But the law, to take effect in a month, may allow American companies to sell a surprising variety of products to Cuba, ranging from fertilizer and cigarettes to washing machines and live sheep. And some deals may be small enough so that the Cubans can afford to buy the products without borrowing, which would bypass the financing restrictions. 
 There's a catch -- two actually. One is the Bush administration, which will draft the final regulations to carry out the law and has a much tougher view of Cuba than the Clinton administration did. Second is Cuba itself. Cuba officially views American products as symbols of oppression and has vowed not to buy so much as a grain of American rice or a single box of Rice Krispies. 
As a result, the diplomatic and commercial tug of war between Washington and Havana will largely determine the extent to which American companies can break into the market that Canada, Mexico and other countries have had to themselves for 40 years. 
The effort to punch a hole through the embargo has as much to do with commercial interests as with politics. American farmers and food producers pushed for an end to the sanctions and want government agencies to interpret the new law as broadly as possible. They hope that even with the financing restrictions, the United States will gain a toehold in a market worth $1.6 billion a year in sales of food and medicine. 
But the Cuban government is upset by financing restrictions added at the last minute by Representative Lincoln Diaz-Balart, a Republican from Miami, and other legislators who opposed weakening the embargo. The restrictions prevent American companies and banks from extending credit directly to Cuban buyers.
"Our country will not acquire one penny worth of food or medicine in the United States," said an editorial in Granma, the official newspaper of Cuba's Communist Party. The financing conditions were called humiliating and unjust and the government convoked more than half a million people in Havana to protest.
Still, American food producers are trying to persuade the Cubans to make some purchases and prove that the country is a viable market; otherwise, the producers say, support for lifting the embargo completely will shrivel.
"We're working very hard to get a shipment into Cuba this year," said Audrae Erickson, a trade policy specialist at the American Farm Bureau Federation in Washington, which represents the big grain growers in the United States. "We believe we can do cash transactions with Cuba if we can resolve some of the outstanding political issues that Cuba has." 
BUT Fidel Castro is known for contrariness concerning the embargo, which he has used for decades to fan resentment against Washington. 
Pamela S. Falk, a trade expert at the City University of New York School of Law who is advising several companies interested in doing business with the Cubans, said Mr. Castro might feel threatened by the partial lifting of the embargo. Economic necessity may force him to do business with the United States, she said, especially because Cuba has trouble with other suppliers. 
Ms. Falk noted, for example, that Cuba's wheat-for-sugar barter arrangement with France had faltered because of Cuban credit problems, which could lead Mr. Castro to seek an alternative. France has decided to withhold $160 million in credits for the purchase of wheat and flour until Cuba repays millions in debts. 
American producers may also be able to make offers that the Cubans find hard to refuse. Cuba's proximity to the United States means that transportation costs would be far less than for shipments coming across the Atlantic. For example, the Agriculture Department estimates that Cuba will buy more than 450,000 tons of rice this year. American rice producers, who are expected to be first in line to complete deals, have said they could sell rice to Cuba at about half the price it pays to buyrice from Vietnam and China, two of Cuba's biggest suppliers.
If the Cubans buy, the range of goods they may choose is much broader than the term "food and medicine" suggests. John S. Kavulich II, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, a business group that focuses on Cuba, said that despite appearances, the legislation represented a real loosening of the embargo. "By anyone's definition, the commercial landscape between the two countries has radically changed."
The law lifts sanctions on sales of food and medicine not only to Cuba, but also to Iran, Libya, North Korea and Syria. The president can decide to lift financing restrictions on the other four countries, but not for Cuba.
Under the law, American companies may sell food and medical supplies to anyone in Cuba -- including government agencies and tourist hotels. But the financing restrictions mean that business must be done in cash or with financing provided by a bank in a third country. The law prohibits the United States government from extending export credits to Cuban buyers, and no American company or bank may provide financing.
Supporters of the restrictions called them necessary to protect United States banks from Cuba's bad credit risk. Over the last few years, Cuba has not paid some debts to European creditors. "We're talking about what is essentially a deadbeat country," said Thomas M. T. Niles, president of the U.S. Council for International Business, a business organization in Washington.
But the Cuban-American congressmen who led the effort to impose restrictions also believed they would be so onerous that the embargo, in effect, would remain intact. 
That may not be the case. The final regulations, still under discussion, may permit foreign subsidiaries of some American banks to extend credit to Cuba. However, they are unlikely to be permitted to work hand in hand with their affiliates in the United States. 
Last month, Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, and other senators introduced a bill to lift the financing restrictions and encourage greater sales of food and medical products to Cuba. 
Regulators are using a broad definition of food that includes not just grains, but also livestock, meat, fish and a long list of other products derived from basic foods. These may include beer, wine, cigarettes, seeds and fertilizer. The list is expected to exclude pesticides, agricultural equipment and bottled drinking water, which is not considered an agricultural product. 
Processed foods like snacks, cookies and breakfast cereals are expected to be permitted. Because these goods tend to be shipped in smaller quantities than grains, Cubans may be more likely to pay for them in cash and not need financing. 
Despite the dire condition of the Cuban economy, the country does have limited access to dollars. The 1.4 million people of Cuban origin in the United States send $500 million to $800 million a year to relatives in Cuba, and those dollars enter the Cuban economy. Cuba's growing tourism industry also gladly accepts dollars as payment.
"We actually believe Cuba will be a good market for consumer products, especially snack foods, breakfast cereals, sodas and things like that," said Sarah A. Fogarty, director of international trade at the Grocery Manufacturers of America. "We believe we will be selling more to the market, but under some limited conditions, and we'll be looking to the new Congress for a bit more." 
THE definition of medicines and medical supplies is interpreted broadly under the new law. It includes all pharmaceutical drugs, as well as ambulances, operating tables and the institutional washing machines used in hospitals. It excludes desks for doctors and other furniture that could be used outside a hospital, as well as vitamins and supplements.
The definition, however, leaves room for confusion. For example, it is unclear whether the Cubans can buy surgical gowns, which may be classified as clothing, not as medical equipment.
Shipping is another confusing issue. The new law does not address older laws that prohibit any vessel that calls on a Cuban port from entering a harbor in the United States for 180 days. The shipping restriction currently can be waived by the Treasury secretary, and many food producers believe those same waivers can probably be applied under the new law. But until the regulations are published, they cannot be sure. 
Writing regulations for a federal law is always complicated. But it is especially so in this case, because it involves sanctions and coincides with a change in administrations with differing views.
Former President Bill Clinton favored at least a partial lifting of the ban on American trade with Cuba that was first imposed by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1960 and tightened by John F. Kennedy in 1962. During the presidential campaign last year, Mr. Bush took a hard line on Cuba, saying in a speech in August that until it "frees political prisoners, and holds free elections and allows free speech, I will keep the sanctions in place." 
Mr. Bush, however, has said he intends to pay more attention to Latin America than did Mr. Clinton. And his new attorney general, John Ashcroft, was one of the principal sponsors of the law lifting some of the sanctions on Cuba.

They Dislike a Tract's Weeds, But Oppose Shops Even More

BYLINE:  By HOPE REEVES 

 BODY:
If there's one thing everyone agrees on, it's that the tract isn't pretty. But what should be done with the patch of ugly weeds and scattered trees at the intersection of the Belt Parkway and Flatbush Avenue?
 "The last thing we need is another mall," said Dorothy Turano, district manager of Community Board 18, about possible commercial development. "There is no way our community could withstand the extra traffic and pollution." 
 But a shopping center seems to be coming. Philips International, developers, has teamed up with Toys "R" Us and Kristal Automall to build Shoppes at Mill Basin, several acres of one- and two-story businesses that will include a chain bookstore, restaurant and office supply store.
A contract with the Economic Development Corporation, steward of the city-owned land abutting Four Sparrows Marsh and the Gateway National Recreation Area, has been drafted and should be signed within the next three weeks, said Renee Sacks, a Philips spokeswoman. "It's going to be a very high-class, Long Island-looking" place, she said. "It will have all the amenities." The plan also calls for various traffic measures, like the addition of a new laneto Flatbush Avenue's three lanes and more traffic lights.
The development corporation confirmed it was negotiating with Philips but would not comment further.
"You can't just come into the community without talking to us about it," said Mike Steffens, president of the Friends of Marine Park, a nonprofit group. "We're the ones who are going to have to deal with this thing. We've just planted a couple hundred trees there. It should be green space, not concrete."
Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern said his agency was negotiating with the development corporation to create a buffer zone of trees and shrubs to protect an ecologically important marshland that adjoins the site.
Even if a shopping center is built, Mr. Steffens doubts that it will succeed. "The community has said it doesn't want it," he said, "and there are almost the exact same stores at Kings Plaza, less than half mile away." HOPE REEVES

HEADLINE: WEDDINGS; 
Susanne Connolly Brian Kanaga

 BODY:
For many couples, choosing an elopement over a big, splashy wedding offers certain pluses. For instance, there's no need for a cake or to emulate the stiffly dressed plastic couple perched atop it. Elopements also promise a certain simplicity -- a simplicity that nonetheless managed to elude this couple. 
 When Susanne Marie Connolly and Brian W. Kanaga of Narberth, Pa., were married on Friday in the Manhattan chambers of Justice Stephen G. Crane, a State Supreme Court judge, they did so without informing their families. But part of their plan was a Saturday surprise reception for everyone at Astra, a Manhattan restaurant. And luring their families to Manhattan without telling them the reason proved to be extraordinarily complicated. 
 Ms. Connolly, 33, who will keep her name, is an associate at Salvo, Russell, Fichter & Landau, a law firm in Blue Bell, Pa. She graduated magna cum laude from Colgate and received her law degree from New York University. She is a daughter of Elizabeth Freeman of West Yarmouth, Mass., and John Connolly of Staten Island. 
Mr. Kanaga, also 33, is a quantitative researcher at the Susquehanna Investments Group, an options trading firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. He graduated summa cum laude from Johns Hopkins and received a master's degree magna cum laude in economics from Princeton. He is the son of Linda Elliott of Colorado Springs and Robert Kanaga of Fort Worth, and the stepson of Dixon Elliott. 
Ms. Connolly and Mr. Kanaga met in August 1997 on a blind date. By August 1999, the couple had decided to marry, but they didn't buy an engagement ring or tell anyone, Ms. Connolly said, "because then, people would start asking when we'd be getting married." She added that they thought "a sort of a reverse surprise party" would be fun. "We're old enough that our parents shouldn't have to be involved in planning our wedding," she said.
The couple's plans to marry privately were made with the best of intentions, but uncovered a minefield of unexpected events. At most surprise parties, the guests must keep the secret and only one cover story must be concocted, for the guest of honor. Turning the concept on its head was no simple matter. 
It was easy to keep the plan from the bridegroom's far-flung family. "Because I'm so busy with work, they're used to fitting in with my schedule," said Mr. Kanaga, whose previous marriage ended in divorce. 
But how to keep the secret from the bride's tightly knit gregarious family while ensuring they would all be in the same place at the same time? To further thicken the plot, Ms. Connolly's brother, John, had already learned of the elopement (his wife is the best friend of one of Ms. Connolly's best friends). "I grilled him every week to make sure he's not leaking information," Ms. Connolly said, with a laugh. 
As the couple's plan went into high gear, they needed a whole slew of stories to ensure that the couple's family members would not make other plans for the weekend. They had the best friend of Ms. Connolly's father invite him to a wildly expensive dinner on Feb. 2 at Alain Ducasse, the Manhattan restaurant. Ms. Connolly's sister, Cathy Ehrreich, and her husband, who live in West Yarmouth, were invited for a weekend visit with the couple in Manhattan. For an aunt and uncle who live in Florida, she first reserved their time by telling them she was going to visit them. Other plans -- also worthy of a 30's screwball comedy -- were concocted for Ms. Connolly's mother. 
Everything was going well until Ms. Connolly's sister called the aunt and uncle in Florida.
"My sister didn't understand how I could be in two places at once," Ms. Connolly recalled. "She didn't understand why I had invited her to New York when I was going to be in Florida." 
Adding another fictional tale to the mounting pile, the sister and brother-in-law were told their uncle had the dates wrong, Ms. Connolly said. She then told the aunt and uncle that the "real" reason she wanted to see them was for a surprise engagement party -- to be held, by the way, in New York. She bought them tickets and begged them not to tell anyone. 
Closer to their wedding weekend, the couple began to reel out the engagement cover story to the family. Each was told to keep the news a secret from the others. But with every turn, the risks of someone inadvertently revealing their plan grew. 
"I still keep a place in Manhattan, and my father occasionally stays there," Ms. Connolly said. "The wedding band called and left a long detailed message on the answering machine there." Fearful that her father would intercept one of these calls, she said, "I began checking my messages faithfully every three hours." 
She added, with a note of exhaustion, "It was more complicated than I thought."

HEADLINE: A True Depression Doll 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Latest Economic Indicator: A Depression Doll Is Hot" (Jan. 7). Flossie Flirt, a doll whose eyes moved sideways as well as up and down, was given to me on my sixth birthday in 1931. Several months later, my dad's company folded and like millions of other breadwinners during the Depression era, he was unable to find employment. 
 With rapidly dwindling savings and no job prospects, my parents decided we would have to drive back East to live with my 81-year-old grandfather in Lancaster County, Pa. Flossie, our clothing and the few small personal effects that could be squeezed into a beat-up Ford went with us.
We moved from a bungalow with all the modern conveniences of that day to a 100-year-old farmhouse with no indoor plumbing. From attending Minneapolis's Tuttle School, featuring progressive education, I went to a one-room schoolhouse with a single teacher for eight grades.
Within the next five years, we shuttled back and forth between small apartments in Lancaster and my granddad's home in Washington Borough. My dad had several short-term jobs as a timekeeper for W.P.A. roadwork crews and surveying gullies for the C.C.C. Mostly, he had no employment.
The only constant in my life was Flossie. By the time I was 12, Flossie had no hair and the enamel on her face had cracked from hundreds of washings. I still adored her.
As of 1937, my dad had a good job in New York and we were renting a house in Forest Hills for $32 a month.
A 12-year-old child whose constant companion was a raggedy doll must have been an embarrassment and a worry for her parents. At my dad's gentle but firm insistence, we wrapped my Flossie in tissue paper and placed her high on a shelf in my bedroom closet.

Talking BackIs Good Medicine

BYLINE:  By FRED BROCK; Fred Brock is an editor at The Times. His column on the approach and arrival of retirement appears the first Sunday of each month. E-mail: fbrock@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
TWO years ago, Esther Weiss traveled from her home in Encino, Calif., to her hometown of Kansas City, Mo., to help celebrate her sister's 90th birthday. Upon arriving, she found that her older sister was suffering from painful, and untreated, gastric distress after eating.
 So Mrs. Weiss, now 79, recalled confronting her sister's doctor about the problem: "He said to me, 'Well, what do you expect at her age?' I told him I had read about this problem and some possible treatments on the Internet. He told me I shouldn't read so much. I went ballistic. I know people who are 90 and don't have this problem. I demanded they find out what was wrong. So they did some tests, discovered my sister had acid reflux and put her on the proper medication. After that the problem was under control." 
 That doctor's attitude toward Mrs. Weiss and her sister may not represent that of a majority of physicians. But it does point to an issue that is troubling to many older people: doctors who may be dismissive toward the elderly and their problems.
Well, such doctors had better brace themselves, because the baby boomers, the oldest of whom are now turning 55, are on the verge of becoming the latest crop of older patients. Dr. Richard W. Besdine, the director of the Center for Gerontology and Health Care Research at Brown University, calls the boomers "very demanding, with high expectations of being continuously informed in achieving their goals of optimum health."
"Doctors who don't like questions," he added, "ain't seen nothing yet!"
And in about a month, the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer will put into the hands of many older patients a tool that will make life a bit more difficult for dismissive physicians. It is a series of lists of very specific questions for elderly patients to ask their doctors about common illnesses.
The lists are a result of a three-year study by Pfizer and the Rand Corporation aimed at improving the quality of care for older Americans. The questions will cover 12 conditions, including hypertension, diabetes and pneumonia, and will be contained in pamphlets that doctors can display in their offices. The questions will also be on a Pfizer Web site (www.pfizerforliving.com); some pamphlets will be mailed to patients. Doctors are receiving detailed, technical fact sheets on conditions covered by the study.
The consumer pamphlet on hypertension, or high blood pressure, for example, explains the disease and possible treatment. Then it lists questions that a patient should ask his or her doctor, including these: What is my blood pressure? What should it be? How often should I have it checked? Should I buy a home blood pressure monitor? If taking medication, what should I do if I miss a dose? Are there any side effects I should be aware of? If I take other medications, are there any drug interactions I should be aware of?
The questions from the pamphlet on diabetes include these: How can I know I'm controlling my blood sugar correctly? Are my kidneys O.K.? Am I supposed to be on a medicine to help protect my kidneys?
ROBIN P. HERTZ, an epidemiologist at Pfizer and director of the study -- called Acove, for Assessing the Care of Vulnerable Elders -- said she hoped that encouraging older patients to ask questions would not irritate too many doctors.
"Doctors and managed-care organizations are requesting the fact sheets from this study," she said. "So far, 900,000 have been distributed to the medical community. It's a real major step toward improving the care of older people. But we are trying to smooth out the program so it doesn't take the physician by surprise."
She also echoed Dr. Besdine's remarks about the baby boomers, and emphasized that older patients made up a big part of most doctors' practices.
It remains to be seen how effectively patients will use the questions. Mrs. Weiss, for instance, says many older people are just not as aggressive as she is. "They grew up in an era when the doctor was God," she said. "Well, he's not. So I think a list of questions could be very helpful."
Sidney Reznick, 81, a comedy writer who lives in West Hollywood, Calif., and has worked for the likes of Jackie Gleason and Johnny Carson, describes himself as an introvert who would be helped by a list of questions. "The problem with some doctors and institutions is that they treat old people like a cliche," he said. "They figure you're over the hill. They don't listen. This might get their attention."
Dr. Hertz said the Pfizer-Rand study does not in any way direct doctors or patients toward drugs made by Pfizer. Dr. Besdine, 60, who is an unpaid member of the study's advisory board, agreed."I don't think Pifzer has gotten any more noble," he said. "It's just that they know that most health care professionals, as well as the public and the media, are very savvy when it comes to reading between the lines when something is a commercial message. Trying to push their drugs would undermine their primary goal of being recognized as a drug company that cares about the health of older people. They're smarter than that."

Will Doctors Make Your Credit Sick?

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Jennifer Steinhauer covers health care for The Times. Her column on the economics of health care appears the first Sunday of each month. E-mail: jestei@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
KATHLEEN McNALLY knows a thing or two about bad credit. She is vice president for financial literacy at the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, an association of 1,500 agencies that help people with financial problems.
 But even she was taken aback when a second notice from her family doctor was a letter threatening to turn over her bill to a collection agency. She would have paid the first bill, she said, but decided to wait because there was confusion over whether her insurance company had yet paid its portion. After she learned that she was responsible for the amount, she said, "I paid that bill that very night." 
 Back in the quaint old days -- say, five years ago -- when one person in the doctor's office pecked out a handful of notices a day, an unpaid bill was handled a bit more delicately. There were phone calls and there was gentle hectoring, much of it directed at the insurance companies.
But doctors, hospitals, laboratories and other providers are taking tougher approaches to seeing that bills are paid. Tired of waiting for insurance companies to cough up and angry that their office workers have taken on piles of bill-collecting paperwork, many of them are now turning to collection agencies. 
"Without a doubt, an increasing amount of claims from providers are going to collections," said Robert Perez, senior vice president of RevCare, which manages health care claims. His company, in Cypress, Calif., tends to go after insurance companies. Mr. Perez estimates that 25 to 30 percent of his business is "insurance follow-up"; five years ago, it was closer to 10 percent. But many agencies, he added, are also leaning increasingly on patients. 
"Ten years ago, these claims never came to us," Mr. Perez said. "But now, with managed-care companies using every excuse to delay the adjudication, there is frustration." Companies like his also take the paperwork load off of doctors' clerical workers, he said. "Providers figure they need to concentrate their people because they are not staffed to work 10,000 claims per month," he said. 
The American Collectors Association says that far more health care providers are turning over their accounts to agencies 30 to 60 days after a missed payment, instead of the customary 150 to 210 days.
Often, the notices go to patients, and their credit can be tainted in the process.
Unlike car payments, health care claims are rarely straightforward. Medical providers and insurance companies argue over coding and other technicalities that can hold up payments for months. Hospitals lose payment records. Laboratories do not have insurance information on file. Patients and their insurers disagree about what services are allowed, and haggle for months while the collection agencies swoop down. And, yes, patients sometimes feel a moral right to ignore bills that they feel their insurance company should have picked up, even when it is clear that the company will not.
Chat rooms and consumer-advice columns in local newspapers are full of stories of this sort: A woman has a Caesarean section and cannot understand why her insurance company finds anesthesia optional for the procedure. While she argues, she watches the notices pile up.
Some states have laws regulating how long insurance companies may wait before making a payment; others protect consumers from having their credit reports tainted by unpaid medical bills.
New York State, for instance, has the "prompt pay law," which requires insurance companies to pay undisputed claims within 45 days. Since the law was signed in 1997, the state Department of Insurance has fined 30 insurance companies a total of almost $1 million for failure to comply.
California requires insurers to pay interest on late payments. "Prompt payment laws are becoming more prevalent," said Allen Briskin, a health care lawyer at Davis Wright Tremaine in San Francisco. 
HERE is the advice of the professionals like Ms. McNally: Understand what your health plan covers before you go into the hospital; this should prevent unpleasant surprises. If you are fighting a claim with an insurance company, let your doctors know immediately, so they will not submit your bill to an agency. Answer letters from collection agencies promptly with phone calls and letters that will go on file as contested, and do the same with any tainted credit report. In New York and most other states, doctors are not permitted to bill a patient if the H.M.O. does not pay up. 
And check your credit report annually. Credit counseling services like the Incharge Institute can advise you how (www.incharge.org). "There is a tendency with doctors to sell their debts quicker as they look at shorter-term bottom lines," said Tim Raftis, vice president of Incharge. "But that can damage consumers' credit reports. Sometimes they are unaware because they are not monitoring their report all the time."

Eight Million Stories in Dodge City (Jury Dodging, That Is)

BYLINE:  By LAURA PEDERSEN 

 BODY:
ASK New Yorkers anything about jury duty -- how one gets picked, how to be excused -- and you'll get a hundred different survivalist stories.
 There is certainly plenty of raw material. Each day computerized summonses from the State Supreme Court land in city mailboxes, 10,000 a week in Manhattan alone, "inviting" recipients to show up on such-and-such a date, followed by bright red letters that threaten: "Willful disobedience of this summons is a criminal contempt of court and is punishable by a fine of $1,000 or imprisonment not exceeding 30 days, or both." 
 Many New Yorkers, their Filofaxes and Day-Runners bulging at the seams, would move heaven and earth to get out of this job. 
I was a 19-year-old innocent when I received my first court communique, in the mid-80's, after having moved to Manhattan from upstate. The summons so intimidated me that I arrived early at the courthouse on Centre Street and was directed to a cavernous waiting area. 
There seemed to be two factions. The first was abuzz with how to get on a jury. Naively, I insinuated myself into this group because they seemed so cheery. They had brought along breakfast, newspapers and sewing projects. They were mostly Civil Service employees, teachers, retirees and young women who made no secret that they lived on welfare and wanted the stipend, then $15 a day. 
But when my new cohorts spoke wistfully of friends who had managed to be empaneled an entire year, I shuddered. I had a new job as a trading floor clerk at the American Stock Exchange and attended New York University at night. I now glanced at the other group, surly and melancholic, weighed down with armfuls of reading material, lining up at the pay phones. One of my people waved at them and said: "Oh, they're just trying to get off. And they will."
Whoops! As nice as my new friends were, given my schedule, I was clearly in the wrong pew. So I scampered over to the disgruntled group. They weren't welcoming, least of all the men who were converting their benches into work stations. One man had even brought along his secretary, for dictation. 
Now, 16 years later, hard-driving New Yorkers are still resisting the call of the jury. But the rules of the game have changed, thanks to some mid-90's initiatives by the New York State chief judge, Judith S. Kaye. Jurors who are not paid by their employers now receive $40 a day. Better yet, prospective jurors are now guaranteed a first postponement by phone, may be able to get more in person, and are even asked to choose a convenient time to serve.
Also, the sources used to find jurors have been broadened to include not only voter and car-registration lists -- the main sources previously -- but also tax returns and public-benefit records. This change has enlarged the jury pool and lengthened the minimum interval between summonses, from about two years to about four.
But gone are the exemptions for doctors, lawyers, politicians, embalmers and the self-employed. Even mayors must serve, as Mayor Giuliani did in a personal-injury case in 1999. 
In fact, there are only two exemptions left besides a medical disability (and be aware that many show up, usually in vain, with bad-back X-rays and Prozac prescriptions). You can claim financial hardship -- mere loss of income doesn't fly -- if you bring in tax returns and documentation of employment status. Or if you can prove that you are the primary caretaker of small children or of an incapacitated relative.
These changes have challenged the ingenuity of many ambitious New Yorkers. Consider my old colleagues, the Wall Street traders, whose livelihood depends upon being there from opening to closing bell.
I remember a clerk named Roy, who earned about $30,000 to wait in line for all of us at the Department of Motor Vehicles and the post office, and was even sent out to videotape missed Little League games. Of course that was all legal. But at times Roy was also sent out for someone's jury duty. This was not legal.
 REMINISCENT of the old Civil War dodge -- back then, draftees could pay others to take their place in uniform -- this tactic may be more tempting under the new jury rules. And the fact is that no one checks your ID at the courthouse.
But you are under oath when you state your name and address. "It's perjury and a misdemeanor punishable by a hefty fine or jail" to lie in that situation, said Brian Maxey, director of the Citizens Jury Project, a court monitoring group. In 1994, one bond trader, Andrew Levinson, was sentenced to 500 hours of community service for trying to have his auto mechanic replace him for jury duty. 
"We hear this a lot," said Mr. Maxey of people's pleas to let them pay others, or pay higher taxes, to skirt jury service. "But it doesn't work, because by narrowing the pool in this manner, then it's no longer a jury of your peers." 
A television news anchor has used a different approach for years. Once he was excused during voir dire for interrogating the lawyer and being "generally obnoxious," he said. Another time he arrived in an N.Y.P.D. T-shirt carrying a beach chair and a radio. He told the clerk he would be outside and just to holler if he was needed. He was not needed.
Still, outlandish props like the Mr. Peanut suit, the bizarre religious rituals and the hemorrhoid pillow -- all real examples -- seldom work, said one trial lawyer. What succeeds most, he said, is saying that you feel you must follow your conscience and not the law.
A stockbroker said he had had success over the years by telling the judge how much he looked forward to serving. "Because from working on Wall Street," he would say, "I have the ability to tell when a person is guilty by looking at his eyes. People with shifty eyes are always lying." The broker was never given the chance to test his theory.
Peter LaBadia, a retired stockbroker, accidentally stumbled into his escape from jury duty. His handwriting was simply awful and his completed jury questionnaire was always returned. Finally, after some years, believing that English was not Mr. LaBadia's primary language, the court clerk offered to send an interpreter. Mr. LaBadia replied, in his usual handwriting.
Then comes the throwaway strategy. I remember a trader who tossed her summons into the garbage. "I've been deep-sixing them for 10 years," she blithely announced. "How are they going to prove I received it? It's not registered mail." 
Right she was. She is not alone. Eight to 10 percent of those who receive a summons in Manhattan are no-shows. Still, you are taking your chances with such behavior. Every Friday there are hearings at the courthouse at which people who have ignored three consecutive summonses can be fined from $5 to $250.
"You tend to be fined on the lower end if you sign a promise to serve at a later date," Mr. Maxey said. "But if you're indignant and stress how important you are, then you tend to get fined the full amount."
I know what you're thinking. What if I don't show up for the scofflaw hearing either? If not, the court imposes a $250 lien against you. Now just try getting a mortgage.
And what about that threat of prison? Vincent Homeneck, chief clerk of the jury division of Manhattan State Supreme Court for the last seven years, could not recall any no-show who had gone to jail. But he remembered one sitting juror who was sentenced to 10 days for chronic lateness at a 1996 murder trial.
 WHERE is the guilt and the shame? After all, jury duty is "the essence of democracy," said Julia Vitullo-Martin, who is a founder of the Citizens Jury Project and is writing a book about jury duty. "Serving on a jury is to judicial process what voting is to the executive process." 
Perhaps in a freewheeling economy in which time is precious, we view the summons as we would a call at 3 a.m. from the Transportation Department saying, "O.K., it's your turn to plow the roads." 
Still, a duty is a duty. When Andrew Schwarz, a partner in a Wall Street trading company, got the call about three years ago, he had every intention of sidestepping jury service.
"Then the judge gives this speech about how he fought for this country and a lot of his buddies didn't come back and he hopes we'll all take the time to do our duty," Mr. Schwarz said. "He was right. After that I was prepared to stay nights and weekends."

HEADLINE: Here Come the Kids: Gen Y Invades the Workplace 

BYLINE:  By NELSON MUI 

 BODY:
THE other night, I went to a party with a 22-year-old colleague. We were covering the celebrity-happy event for our online news service, Fashion Wire Daily. After surveying the crowd, my co-worker asked what she should do next.
"There's Bret Easton Ellis, and he's alone," I said. "You can start by talking to him."
 She looked puzzled. "Who's Bret Easton Ellis?" 
 "You remember -- the book and the movie 'Less Than Zero?' "
Her face remained blank. After I mentioned "American Psycho," the movie made last year from Mr. Ellis's 1990 novel, she muttered, "Oh." She passed up the chat with him.
Amused, I later regaled a few office mates with our colleague who had never heard of Mr. Ellis, the onetime literary enfant terrible and gossip-column fixture -- but I got the same blank stares. Then it dawned on me: at 30, I am a different generation from half my office. We have a full-time columnist who is barely out of her teens, and one of our junior editors could not rent a car for a weekend trip to Boston because at 24 he is a year too young. 
I often find myself explaining pop references from the not so distant past. When hits from Depeche Mode or New Order come on the radio, someone always asks, "Who is this?" Curiously, there is only selective ignorance of the 80's. The happy, bubblegum music of Banarama and Duran Duran remains popular with 20-somethings, as the forerunners of singers like Britney Spears. Angst-ridden groups like the Smiths or Nirvana will apparently have to wait for a VH1 "Behind the Music" special for resurrection. 
Interacting with younger colleagues has made me realize that I am not, and never will be, one of the self-assured, relentlessly sunny, multitasking young people labeled Generation Y. 
While marketing gurus and management experts have begun studying this wave as it enters the workplace, I have been living it -- at the forefront of the latest generation gap. I'm seeing everything that has been predicted about Generation Y: the warp-speed processing of information, the need to speed through careers, the self-esteem on steroids.
As each generation misunderstands the next, the flashpoint today is the belief among many managers of my generation, Generation X, that these happy, glib youngsters are arrogant and entitled. "They often act as if they're doing you a favor by working for you," said Jason Lundy, 31, a marketing director in New York. Jill Mittelhauser, 30, a communications executive in Boston, called some young people she works with "brazen." 
For their part, Generation Y'ers who have reached the workplace often say their immediate elders are needlessly downbeat. "They don't want to be associated with X'ers," said Neil Howe, the author with William Strauss of "Millennials Rising" (Vintage Books, 2000), a study of the young people whose formative years were the 1990's. "They decry their next elders as the most selfish and complaining generation and the least heroic, and a bunch of slackers." 
Mr. Howe and Mr. Strauss define the youngest Americans reaching adulthood, whom they call millennials, as those born since 1982, not yet out of college. Others date the generation from 1977, when births began climbing after a decade of declines. In either case, a generation is shaped more by cultural experiences than strict demographics, and it is clear in many offices that those under, say, 25 represent a different wave. Last month, the Army changed its recruiting slogan after 20 years from "Be All You Can Be" to "An Army of One," to appeal to the individualism of the younger generation. 
Jokes about Gen Y in the workplace are surfacing, including some on a Web page (http://members .home.net/j2cbat/ritalin.html) that offers tips for "dealing with the Ritalin generation." These include posting "speed limits in hallways" and "preparing for vacation time to be accrued in nanoseconds." 
"Be flexible," managers are cautioned. "Attention levels in the Ritalin generation may be so vastly improved that psychic abilities might be awakened. Don't be surprised if your assistant asks you to sign a letter to someone you don't know, dated months in advance."
It is easy to divine the roots of the divide: while Gen X'ers came of age in an era of soaring national debt, predictions of Social Security apocalypse and a bleak job market in the recession of the early 90's, the younger set mostly has memories of economic expansion. Add to this that their parents, the baby boomers, were obsessed with child rearing and car-pooled their progeny to soccer games, tutoring and community service projects to beef up college resumes, and self-esteem, and you have a generation that expects the world at 22. 
For many 30-somethings in a position of managing the new kids on the block, there is wide resentment. Mr. Lundy, who is the executive director of marketing and strategic planning at Esquire, remembers the recession years, when Gen X'ers took dead-end McJobs, or were grateful for any entry-level professional work. He is surprised to see young colleagues bristle at small tasks. 
He recalled asking an assistant to walk a few blocks to deliver vital documents to a client, but the assistant refused. "It was extremely urgent that the client got it right away," Mr. Lundy said. "We're at 55th and Broadway, and the client's office was at 49th and Sixth. When I asked my 22-year-old assistant to run over there, she responded, 'Why are you asking me to do this?' "
Mr. Lundy continued, "After some further prodding, she whined, 'But it's cold out.' " He ended up walking the papers over himself. He has since found a different assistant. "It's great that Gen Y thinks all is right with the world -- it makes for a nice positive attitude," he said. "The problem is these are people who've often had it easy, and it shows."
Susan Portnoy, 35, a publicist in New York, said that while Gen Y'ers are very ambitious and motivated from the start, they also end up seeming extremely impatient. "A lot of them are bald-faced," Ms. Portnoy said. "It's like, 'I haven't done it before, but I want to do it right away.' " She recalled one young woman she hired who asked for a plum assignment within days of starting her job. "She came to me and said, 'I want to be the one who walks Madonna,' for this magazine's launch party," Ms. Portnoy recalled. "I was like, 'No, you're just lucky you get to go to the party.' "
Deborah Rothstein, the executive director for career services at Columbia University, said: "I think there's a general sense of entitlement among Gen Y'ers, which comes from them knowing it's the strongest job market -- they know that if they don't get a job they want, they'll go freelance. A lot of the kids come to me and say, 'I'd like to be making six figures within six months.' They all want to be challenged immediately and expect opportunities for international travel -- within two months of starting work. 
"I've been dealing with this every year for eight years, and it's kind of a shock to see the attitude in recent years. Sometimes you just want to sit them down and give them a reality check."
Perhaps reality is on the way in the form of the first economic downturn in 10 years. If the corporate layoffs making headlines and the Nasdaq collapse lead to full-blown recession, Generation Y may receive its comeuppance, and many members of Gen X will be quietly smirking. 
But so far, the latest dip seems not to be denting Generation Y's optimism or sense of entitlement. Despite a drop in general consumer confidence, unemployment remains at a three-decade low, and last week the Congressional Budget Office predicted 10 more years of economic growth. 
"I think we have a lot more opportunities than the preceding generation," said Tiffany Williams, 18, a student at Baruch College in New York, who works full time as an administrative assistant. Ms. Williams started working at 13 and by 16 "moved on to the office-administrative thing," she said. "Our lives start so much earlier than older peoples' lives -- the minute you graduate from a high school, you can be recruited by a firm and make much more money than the older crowd ever did at our age. The world opens up to us so young -- we network in class, we network at the coffee shop."
Bruce Tulgan, a management consultant who is writing a book to be called "Managing Generation Y," described the youngest members of the work force as "superhigh maintenance" and a generation that is "on fast forward with self-esteem." 
"Young people are given an unprecedented amount of responsibility at an early age," Mr. Tulgan said. "It's a common conflict when young people overestimate themselves, and because they have high expectations, they're going to be a nightmare to manage."
His advice to older supervisors is to try a "coaching style of management." "You'll have to be rigorous with your feedback," he added. "If they say, 'I want to do this big project,' then you'll have to come back and give them a smaller goal, set a deadline, let them tackle it and give them feedback and increasing levels of responsibility."
One difference, and source of potential conflict, is that Gen Y expects office cultures to adapt to them, rather than the reverse. A senior manager in local government in his 40's expressed surprise at his new analyst, 22. "She said she preferred to work in a different way and said she wanted her assignments on short deadlines, as if it were homework," the manager said. "She wanted to recreate her college experience of doing last-minute term papers. It used to be that in the past, incoming employees would try to figure out what the organization wanted and how it functioned."
According to Mr. Tulgan, members of Gen Y view Gen X'ers with a "healthy contempt" as well as a lot of "healthy respect," but also "think they're a little too edgy." A poll conducted for "Millennials Rising" showed teenagers had negative perceptions of Gen X by 2 to 1. 
In that book, Mr. Howe and Mr. Strauss theorize that the differences between the two youngest American generations to come of age trace not only to economics, but also to cultural influences. Raised in the 1970's, Gen X'ers are, Mr. Howe said, children of the "consciousness revolution," a time when Americans were distrustful of institutions, and children were often neglected at the expense of parental self-fulfillment. Gen Y, by contrast, is the "baby on board" generation, raised by prosperous, increasingly conservative, childcentric parents. 
"These kids are happier, and they don't mind talking about it," Mr. Howe said. "They're collectively optimistic about the future -- they think they have a destiny as a generation and think they will play a role in shaping the future. Gen X'ers, however, were collectively pessimistic but individually optimistic."
Stacy Garrick, 23, a graduate of the University of California at Los Angeles who works in a nonprofit organization, said: "I think we're more free spirited than the X'ers. I certainly wouldn't consider myself a cynical person, and I don't think there's much of that in my generation."
She added that there was a downside to the extraordinary pressure to focus on careers at an early age. "At U.C.L.A., there was a big sense of competition, of people who were on track the whole time they're in school," she said. "I know I was concerned about my resume. Even the parents are more involved. They help plan and track their kids' career plans. Perhaps because of all this work, most of the people I graduated with expect to make quite a bit of money. Most of my friends are making in the 40's and 50's already."
For those X'ers and boomers who feel Generation Y might be skipping paying its dues, both Mr. Tulgan and Prof. Jay Conger of the London Business School, another management specialist, advise: get over it. "The older crowd paid their dues at a different kind of country club," Professor Conger said. "It's much more of a free-agent, market-oriented workplace now."

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
Gladly Taking Criticism, Instead Of Obscurity

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY DePALMA 

 BODY:
IT does not bother Steve H. Hanke that he has been called a hustler, a charlatan and a snake-oil salesman. But being referred to as obscure -- that has the power to sting.
 Mr. Hanke is the Johns Hopkins University professor of applied economics who rose from, well, obscurity in 1998 to international recognition as the man who counseled President Suharto on the mechanics of setting up a currency board to stabilize the rupiah, Indonesia's volatile currency. 
 Mr. Suharto never enacted Mr. Hanke's ideas, but for a few months the odd relationship between the dictator and the professor receoved attention around the world, and most of it was negative. Several accounts of Mr. Hanke's forays into Indonesia described him as "an obscure economics professor." Paul Krugman, a well-known economist (and now an Op-Ed page columnist for The New York Times) called him "a snake-oil salesman" and a "rupiah Rasputin."
"I've got to admit, it's a good line," Mr. Hanke said during an interview last week on the Johns Hopkins campus in Baltimore, where he has been a faculty member for 31 years. The battering that he and his reputation took during the Indonesia episode "left a little scar tissue," he said. But it was worth the effort because it focused so much attention on the issue of currency boards, which he refers to as "the cause."
A currency board is a way to stabilize economically shaky nations. Like the old gold standard, it backs up a local currency with reliable reserves. But instead of using gold, a country guarantees its own currency with United States dollars, German marks or some other strong monetary unit.
The boards were first used in English colonies in the 19th century but fell out of favor. Mr. Hanke says he did not know anything about such boards until another Hopkins professor mentioned the idea more than 15 years ago. Since then he has written several books about the boards and has become a monetary Roto-Rooter man, flying off to help far-away countries with big economic problems.
He obviously relishes the role of globetrotting academic. On the day of the interview, Mr. Hanke, 58, wore a white shirt, a paisley ascot and a navy blazer with a large gold stopwatch chain attached conspicuously to his lapel. The chain dangled in the breast pocket of his jacket, without a watch. "It's being cleaned," he explained.
Mr. Hanke said the name-calling and other ridicule of the last few years had not weakened "the cause." Today he is meeting with the president of Montenegro, who has come to Baltimore to discuss currency.
"Since 1849, there's never been a problem with one of these currency boards," he said. "All the academic critiques are about as phony as a three-dollar bill."
Still, the critiques far outnumber the defenses. Most economists view currency boards as last-ditch efforts that can do more harm than good. They say the economic problems in Argentina, for example, are the fault of its currency board system, which pegs the peso one-to-one to the dollar, thus making Argentine exports uncompetitive.
Mr. Hanke, who has advised Argentina's government, contends that its economic woes have nothing to do with the board. "In Argentina, if the weather is bad, critics will blame it on the currency board," he said.
Mr. Hanke says he enjoyed hunting when he was growing up in Iowa, and he still takes a shotgun approach to issues on his hit list. Among his favorite targets are the International Monetary Fund, which he considers incompetent, and the Federal Reserve System, which he thinks should be dismantled. 
If he has been ejected from the club of economists, that's all right with him, because he never considered himself as an economist in the orthodox sense. He stumbled on economics at the University of Colorado and did his doctoral dissertation on measuring the demand for water in municipal systems. Even today, while he holds an appointment in the economics department at Johns Hopkins, he keeps his office in the department of geography and environmental engineering, where he has worked since 1969.
Lately, Mr. Hanke has had to accept the limitations of "the cause" as struggling countries skip the boards and instead adopt foreign currencies to strengthen their economies. Last year, Ecuador and El Salvador did just that with the dollar.
"Economists are debating whether this should happen, but it's already happening," he said, confident in the rightness of his position and the wrongness of others'. He believes that the fuss over his role in Indonesia drew attention to the merits of strong currencies for weak countries, and that this could lead to the day when there are only a handful of currencies in the world. "The best thing about all that's happened to me," he said, "is that the cause is still alive."

HEADLINE: Hedging Your Bets? Look Homeward, Investor 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
WHEN David Bowers arrived in New York from London early last year as the new chief global investment strategist at Merrill Lynch, he set about to shake up the firm's view of the world. But he was not prepared for the change he would usher in after months of crunching numbers and examining the interplay of Wall Street and foreign stock markets.
 What he and his colleagues concluded in September -- and announced to little fanfare in November -- was that investing abroad for Americans is nowhere near as good an idea as conventional wisdom dictates. Within days, Merrill Lynch advised its wealthy private clients to limit the foreign stocks in their portfolios to about 5 percent. That is down from the 35 percent recommended by Merrill's previous chief investment strategist, Charles I. Clough Jr. 
 "We have to come to grips with not how we think the world should be, but with how the world works," said Mr. Bowers, who as a British citizen found it difficult to turn his back on foreign stocks. "This is not a negative call on international equities. But we think it's prudent to make the change to a lower international exposure." 
Prudent investors are always trying to balance risk. To hedge against a market downturn in the United States, money-management mavens have long suggested diversifying by sprinkling investment portfolios with overseas assets. Buy Sony, Alcatel or BP Amoco, they have recommended. Then, presumably, as one market or stock goes down, another will go up. 
But Mr. Bowers and other strategists have found that there are better ways to reduce risk -- namely, by choosing industry sectors or other markets, like bonds, that are less in sync with the United States market.
Among those coming to the same conclusion is Nicholas P. Sargen, global market strategist for private clients at J. P. Morgan, now part of J. P. Morgan Chase, who recently lowered his allocation guideline for foreign stocks to 10 percent to 15 percent. "We overrode models that suggested more," he said. Rosemary Sagar, head of global investments at the United States Trust Company, said money managers there were lightening up on international stocks to improve risk reduction.
And while James W. Paulsen, the chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management, which manages money for institutional investors, has not changed his foreign guideline, now around 15 percent, he is watching. If the decline in the benefits of overseas diversification "persists for a period," he added, "it will affect us."
IF American investors heed the new advice, they will buy fewer foreign equities and, in all likelihood, take a new approach to the international equities they do buy. Likely casualties are investment vehicles that became popular in the 1990's: mutual funds that focus on specific countries.
Instead, active money managers and mutual fund managers who apply the sector approach may attract a bigger share of investors' money. If Americans pull back overseas, the impact is likely to be greatest on smaller countries, especially those in emerging markets that hunger for foreign capital. 
The reason for Merrill's about-face is hardly a mystery: nowadays, the performance of foreign stocks is much more highly correlated to that of Wall Street. Since the 1980's, the economic policies of Western nations have been more aligned than ever before. Global barriers against trade and capital flows have fallen. Central banks agree that inflation is the No. 1 enemy, and they are determined to fight it. And the introduction of the euro in 1999 has given Europe a homogeneity it never had. 
In the corporate world, foreign companies watched for years as their American counterparts enjoyed greater prosperity and created more jobs than they did. Now companies everywhere are imitating American management -- cutting costs, increasing productivity and putting profits first. And because of mergers, many more companies, in the United States and abroad, have a global reach.
Just think: Ten years ago, how many Americans had ever heard of Nokia? It was a Finnish phone and electronics company. Now its cell phones blanket the world, and its fortunes rise and fall on global trends, not Finnish ones.
Americans, in truth, have always fallen short of meeting conventional money management guidelines: that they put about 25 percent to 40 percent of their equity portfolios into stocks outside the United States, or 15 percent to 30 percent of their entire portfolios (including bonds). At the end of 1999, for example, American pension funds had 11 percent of their investments abroad, including stocks and bonds, according to the InterSec Research Corporation, while individuals had just 2.3 percent of their money abroad. Many of Merrill's own clients, Mr. Bowers said, do not even have enough foreign stocks to reach its new, lower guideline.
Yet the shift in strategy at Merrill and other brokerage firms -- and the change that it reflects on Wall Street and in the money management business -- is turning decades of conventional wisdom on its head.
It is also a gamble -- and not every brokerage firm or analyst is in agreement. Some argue that the reduced benefits of foreign diversification may be temporary, more a product of the surge and then the fall in technology stocks than of a fundamental change in the way a more global world works. And the move toward sectors, while beneficial, is as much a new marketing tool for Wall Street and mutual funds as it is a fashionable way to pick stocks.
STILL, as the numbers are currently being crunched, there is little question that much of the advantage in investing overseas has been lost, as world markets follow American markets more closely than ever.
"It is very comforting when there is a crash and you have something that isn't going down in another market," said Jeremy J. Siegel, a finance professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and the author of "Stocks for the Long Run." "But foreign equities won't give you that."
The change has been so abrupt that Mr. Siegel said he would cut his foreign-investment guideline in the newest edition of his book, due late this year. "Correlations have gone up, and I don't think the returns from abroad have gone up enough to compensate for that," he said. The second edition of the book, in 1998, advised that 25 percent of a stock portfolio be invested outside the United States; the new version will recommend no more than 20 percent.
The change is also remaking Wall Street firms, turning their research focus from countries to global sectors like technology, pharmaceuticals and energy.
"If all these countries are looking the same, I have to latch on to something else to differentiate between stocks," said Stefano Cavaglia, head of equity strategy at Brinson Partners in Chicago. "We used to have all our analysts organized on a country line. That's gone. Everything is organized on an industry basis, and all of the country directors have been reassigned." 
Putnam Investments, the mutual fund company in Boston, has also shifted its approach away from concentrating on countries as a stock-picking tool. "Sector is the biggest driving force," said Omid Kamshad, chief investment officer for international core equities at Putnam.
If investors and fund managers no longer pick Germany or Japan as a year's winner, and then buy stocks in that market, they will have to look for winners in, say, banks and autos. They would look globally for the best companies in those sectors, no matter where their headquarters are.
"A company's market capitalization, or the fact that it is part of the technology sector, for example, will become a more significant differentiator than whether the company is listed on the Norwegian or British stock exchange," said Ms. Sagar, another advocate of the sector approach.
New mutual funds based on worldwide sectors are popping up all over. Some 24 global funds were created in 2000 alone, most of them centered on technology, telecommunications, the Internet and health care, according to Strategic Insight, a mutual fund research company. Just two were started in 1999 and nine in 1998. 
Mr. Sargen said the J. P. Morgan Private Bank created global technology, global health care and global financial sector funds last year for its private clients. 
The companies that build indexes, like Morgan Stanley Capital International and Dow Jones, are shaping new sector benchmarks as fast as they can. Morgan Stanley now has 10 global sector indexes for developed markets -- including utilities, telecommunications, consumer staples, health care, industrials and energy. Two weeks ago, it introduced a new group of all-country sector indexes that include emerging markets.
Dow Jones Indexes has had its own global sector indexes since 1994. But Sheldon Gao, its senior director for strategic development, said that "nobody paid attention to our sector indexes at the time." Now interest is so strong that Dow Jones next week will introduce its Global Sector Titans -- 18 indexes, each with the 30 biggest companies worldwide.
EVEN so, some analysts contend that there is no reason for Americans to cut back their investments abroad. They acknowledge that winning the argument may be difficult; after all, over the last six years, the United States stock market has risen 190 percent while those of the rest of the world, taken together, have climbed just 37 percent. 
But these analysts, noting that half of the world's market capitalization is outside the United States, assert that not looking abroad means forfeiting many opportunities.
"I adamantly believe that there are benefits from international diversification that have not been fully appreciated," Mr. Cavaglia said. 
Roger G. Ibbotson, a finance professor at the Yale School of Management and the chairman of Ibbotson Associates, also advises against cutting back -- mostly because Americans have so little invested overseas to begin with. "Correlations have gone up, but nowhere to the extent that we should do less" investing abroad, he said.
Still, the numbers appear to reveal some perils. Not only do foreign markets take many more of their cues from the American market, but they also tend to follow it more closely when Wall Street is declining. And such times are precisely when American investors want diversification protection the most.
When statisticians measure correlations, a "1" is a perfect correlation between two trends, while a "minus 1" is a perfect inverse correlation. A zero means no relation whatsoever. So the closer that the correlation of two markets is to 1, the less the diversification benefit of investing in the two markets.
In the fall of 1993, the correlation between the performance of the American market and the rest of the developed world's markets was as low as 0.145, according to Merrill Lynch. That was the smallest correlation since 1979, when it was as low as 0.07.
The figure moved generally higher, however, later on. In 1995, it was more than 0.3, and in 1997, more than 0.5. Then the correlation surged, to 0.787 by the end of last year, the highest level since the mid-1970's.
Ibbotson Associates, using a slightly more conservative approach than Merrill, put the correlation between the United States and the rest of the world, including emerging markets, at 0.765 at year-end.
Both firms calculated the correlations in dollar terms, incorporating the effects of currency fluctuations on investors here. In any given year, such movements can greatly affect profits or losses for American investors in foreign markets.
Correlations are also rising between the United States market and those of specific regional groups. Consider emerging markets, once regarded as a perfect place for diversification. The Ibbotson data shows that the correlation between emerging markets and the American market rose to 0.66 at the end of last year. It had been as low as 0.18 in 1992 and 0.19 in 1993.
The correlation between European and American markets has been higher over time, and has risen again recently. At the end of last year, it was 0.687, up from 0.451 in mid-1997 and an average of 0.418 in 1981. 
Japan, the major market that has often had least correlation to the United States, has also shown a mini-trend toward following Wall Street's lead. Its correlation was 0.49 at year-end, compared with an average of 0.18 in 1982.
Although these numbers alone undermine the argument for overseas diversification, a recent study adds fuel to the flame. Conducted by Kirt C. Butler, associate professor of finance at Michigan State University, and Domingo Castelo Joaquin, assistant professor of finance at Illinois State University, it shows that when the United States stock market goes into a tailspin, the rest of the world is even more likely to follow.
"An internationally diversified portfolio becomes riskier in bear markets because of higher volatility and greater correlation among national equity market returns," according to the study, which was published last March. In other words, when Wall Street is in a decline, American investors are getting even less risk protection than they thought from buying foreign stocks.
THESE new thoughts about diversification come at an interesting juncture. After the decline in world markets last year, as most followed the United States downward, investors may be more interested in managing their risk.
And that is precisely why Merrill lowered its guideline for foreign stocks to a range of zero to 5 percent for their least aggressive investors. The guideline is 5 percent to 10 percent for their most aggressive investors. In the three categories in between, the guideline is 5 percent.
Instead, Merrill says that an American investor, based on current analyses, can get much better risk reduction by diversifying into the domestic bond market. Based on the Ibbotson data, the correlation between stocks and government bonds has reversed in the last four years. In 1997, the average correlation was 0.49, near its high in the 1970's. At the end of last year, it was 0.12, with an average for the year of 0.17.
Merrill is also sending clients into private equity funds, which often involve venture capital investments. The correlations of those funds to the stock market are also very low, although this avenue of diversification is open to relatively few individuals because of the high minimum investments required.
Mr. Cavaglia of Brinson Partners had another suggestion for individual investors: Look for active money managers "who know that country and sector factors are important." An investor who buys a mutual fund that invests by geography, not sectors, "is not getting the full benefit of the international game," he said.
Putnam, which made the switch to a sector focus in 1997, has not "completely killed off country factors," Mr. Kamshad said. For example, investors who want to buy a foreign utility -- in Spain, for example -- would still have to pay much attention to local economic factors, he said. 
Nonetheless, investing in different sectors provides more diversification benefits, according to analysts who favor a sector approach. Mr. Cavaglia's analysis shows that the correlations among major sectors like technology, health care, energy and financials were down to 0.33 by last August. Although the sector analysis is done differently and is therefore not directly comparable to the correlation of United States and foreign markets, the industry correlations are well below those of a similar analysis he did for countries.
As the new analysis sinks in, the big losers may be funds that focus on a single country.
SOME of the first country funds were closed-end funds, which have a limited number of shares whose price rises or falls in part with shifting demand for those shares. The price also moves, of course, with the direction of the underlying foreign stock market.
Because the performance of a closed-end country fund depends on investors' interest in that country's stocks, there is a premium or a discount in the price of the shares, compared with the value of the underlying stocks. A big discount means that investors do not find the closed-end fund or the country -- or both -- very attractive.
The net assets of closed-end country funds have dropped from a peak of $16.7 billion in 1996 to $10.3 billion last year, according to Michael T. Porter, the country-fund analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. The number of these funds, meanwhile, has declined to 63, representing 27 countries, from 84 in 1995. And they traded at an average discount of 23.9 percent at year-end.
But not everyone is turning against foreign stocks. Mr. Butler, the Michigan State University professor, said his own work had not made him alter his portfolio; it is heavily weighted toward foreign equities. He has held his ground because the rise in correlations between United States and world markets had much to do with the recent rise in market volatility, he said. If that volatility subsides with the bursting of the technology bubble, correlations may fall again.
Mr. Bowers of Merrill Lynch also acknowledges some doubts. He knows that market relationships can change quickly, just as they did in the last few years. "Is this the start of a new world order, or is this just the time to get into international stocks?" he asks.
Then the moment passes, and he heads out to sell his new view of the investing world.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH; 
In Technology, Caution Is Still the Better Part of Wisdom

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
NOW that technology stocks are humming again, investors are settling back into their comfort zone. The tech wreck of 2000 is receding into the mists of distant memory as investors focus on earnings in the second half of 2001 rather than the gloomy here and now. 
 Technology bulls think that earnings declines through June of this year will give way again to growth, albeit anemic, in the third and fourth quarters. According to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks analysts' prognostications, earnings among technology companies are forecast to fall by 10.7 percent in the first quarter, compared with a year earlier, and by almost the same amount in the second quarter. But current estimates for the whole year expect 0.7 percent growth. 
 This is a far cry from the 26.4 percent earnings growth that these companies showed in 2000. But shrewd investors know that was yesterday's news. The question today is this: Should investors jump back into technology stocks in anticipation of an earnings rebound? 
Tobias Levkovich, an equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, thinks not. He suspects that capital spending on technology will be slower to recover than many people think, even if the Federal Reserve Board's medicine puts the United States economy back on its feet. 
Mr. Levkovich argues that capital spending programs typically rise and fall with corporate profit margins. In recent years, profit margins were high and technology spending went vertical. But because he expects margins to be under continued pressure throughout the year, he thinks that technology spending will remain desultory. 
"Now you have three different pressures on margins: a slowing economy, high wages and energy prices," he said.
As a result, he thinks that consumer spending, not capital expenditures, will drive any economic re-acceleration that 2001 may bring.
Mr. Levkovich saw another reason for continuing weak demand for technology. The urge among traditional companies to embrace the Internet, he said, is not as primal as it was during the last two years.
"Traditional industry players felt they had to do something with the Internet," he said, "or they'd be the old-economy dinosaur put out of business by the new-economy asteroids." So they threw money at anything Internet. 
Now that the Web has lost some of its wonder, it is no longer quite the spending priority among traditional companies. A result will be a delay in increased demand for technology. 
Mr. Levkovich has surveyed leading telecommunications companies, brokerage firms and cable concerns for their technology spending plans in 2001. He estimates that telecommunications companies, whose capital spending has tripled in the last few years, will spend 5.2 percent less on technology this year than last. While brokerage firms will increase their technology spending this year, they will do so by only 8.2 percent, less than half their rate in 2000. And growth in cable capital expenditures is expected to fall to 8.9 percent this year, from 79 percent last year. 
Nevertheless, investors are fairly optimistic about earnings for technology companies in the second half. Too optimistic, in Mr. Levkovich's view. He said he would not be surprised if earnings guidance from companies becomes more conservative in coming weeks. 
"We just had a pretty good decade for technology," Mr. Levkovich said. "Tech spending went from 3 percent to 5.7 percent of G.D.P. But technology spending is cyclical. And these stocks do need earnings to do well."

HEADLINE: PRIVATE SECTOR; 
Finding Skeletons in Bank Closets

BYLINE:  By RIVA D. ATLAS 

 BODY:
THEY call her the Credit Queen. 
 When corporate bankruptcies started to escalate last year, Lori Appelbaum, the bank-stock analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company, was ready. With contacts and skills gathered a decade ago when she was a loan officer at Chemical Bank, Ms. Appelbaum has been publishing estimates showing which banks hold how much in troubled loans. 
 It is not information banks tend to make public. While banks must disclose the overall size of their loan portfolios, they never divulge the names of borrowers, citing client confidentiality.
But Ms. Appelbaum is not afraid to snoop around and name names. In chatty e-mail messages to clients, she has published lists of banks owning the loans of troubled companies like Sunbeam, Finova, Owens Corning and Xerox. Last summer, she assembled a watch list of corporate America's sick and dying, and she actively monitors the loans of 200 or so companies.
Knowing which banks had large exposures to loans was useful information for investors last year. In the case of Sunbeam, the housewares maker, Ms. Appelbaum sent a note to clients on Oct. 23 describing the company as a "potential problem" for three banks that had lent it a total of $1.7 billion: First Union, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America. 
Three weeks later, when Bank of America and First Union filed their third-quarter earnings reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission, they disclosed that by year-end they might be classifying a loan to a large borrower as "nonperforming" -- a euphemism for delinquent.
While neither bank would identify the borrower, it was widely acknowledged to be Sunbeam. As analysts learned of this unpleasant surprise, prices for the shares of both banks fell sharply.
A spokesman for Bank of America and a spokeswoman for First Union declined to comment on Ms. Appelbaum's research. But Thomas Finucane, a manager of the John Hancock Regional Bank fund, said, "She's done a lot of work establishing who's got the hot potatoes." 
Ms. Appelbaum is not always predicting doom for her banks: when problems surfaced at Xerox, for example, she noted that even under the worst circumstances, the company's lenders would likely get all of their money back.
Ms. Appelbaum is clearly relishing the chance to put some rather obscure skills to use, including poring over the terms of dense loan contracts between banks and borrowers. 
"This is my shining moment," she said in an interview last week. "I know just how long a bank can keep a company afloat before it just dies."
Remarkably cheerful for someone who studies companies on life support, she chuckles as she remembers the leveraged-buyout surge of the late 1980's. Fresh out of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, she worked on financing deals at Chemical Bank, only to watch borrowers default on their debts within months.
One of her earliest financings was for Doskocil, a meat processor that in 1988 got into a bidding war for a rival, Wilson Foods. Thanks to a $133 million loan from Chemical, Doskocil won Wilson. But 16 months later, the company was in bankruptcy.
"They had all sorts of excuses," Ms. Appelbaum said of Doskocil, which quickly began missing its earnings targets. "First they said people didn't eat as much pork over Christmas; then, in the spring, they said people were eating more chicken at picnics. It was just endless."
As Doskocil and other Chemical customers missed loan payments, Ms. Appelbaum moved to a group that provided secured loans to keep bankrupt companies afloat as they reorganized.
By 1993, as the economy began to rebound, Ms. Appelbaum decided to get out of lending and into equity research. "I'd really get to know these companies, but I'd go to credit meetings at the bank and nobody cared," she explained. "All they wanted to know was whether they'd get back their interest and principal."
After working for two years as an assistant to the bank-stock analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, Ms. Appelbaum landed at Goldman, where she is senior analyst covering the banking industry. 
In gathering intelligence on banks' troubled loans, Ms. Appelbaum's biggest advantage comes from within Goldman, one of the largest traders of distressed bank loans. She also talks to industry analysts at the firm, and consulted with Goldman's building-materials analyst when several companies in the building industry were overwhelmed by the threat of litigation relating to asbestos claims.
Ms. Appelbaum also pores over loan agreements filed by companies with the S.E.C. as exhibits to their annual reports. 
With the banks keeping silent, Ms. Appelbaum's work often amounts to educated guesses, but she is not afraid to update her e-mail reports as she receives more information. 
On Jan. 5, amid rumors about possible bankruptcy filings by California's two biggest utilities, Ms. Appelbaum sent out a note estimating that Bank of America had committed as much as $700 million to them. But two hours later, she sent an update pegging the bank's exposure at $400 million after doing more research.
Even though her insights into rising loan losses have brought Ms. Appelbaum much attention in the banking world, in December she began to look beyond the trouble, anticipating that the stocks of banks hit hardest by credit problems could get a boost once the Federal Reserve cut interest rates.
By lowering rates, the Fed reduced banks' costs, making lending more profitable. Lower rates also strengthened prices in the market for loans made to many of the most troubled companies by 10 percent, reducing the losses that banks might encounter on some of their poorest-quality debt.
"To Lori's credit, she didn't get stuck on her focus on credit," said Ronald Temple, who follows financial services stocks for Deutsche Bank Asset Management. Bank stocks are up 7 percent since the Fed first lowered rates on Jan. 3, according to the Philadelphia Stock Exchange/Keefe Bruyette & Woods index.
Ms. Appelbaum is not throwing away her list of troubled companies any time soon. "I don't think we're out of the woods on credit issues," she said, but lower interest rates will help make bank stocks more attractive. "Investors can see the light at the end of the tunnel."

Deregulation: A Movement Groping in the Dark

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
THIS bit of gallows humor has been making the rounds of the electricity industry: The British decide to switch drivers from the left to the right side of the road, just like the rest of Europe. But the queen worries that making the changeover all at once will be too complicated.
 So she decides to institute a monthlong transition period. Cars will switch sides in January. Trucks will wait until February. 
 Welcome to the era of electricity deregulation.
Five years after states began giving up their control over the power industry, power prices have soared in both California and New York, two of the states where deregulation is furthest along. Last month, rolling blackouts hit California, prompting Gray Davis, the state's governor, to label deregulation there "a colossal and dangerous failure."
Over the last two decades, the gospel of deregulation has spread from Washington to London to New Delhi, from trucking to banking to telecommunications to electricity. The United States, which embraced deregulation earlier and more thoroughly than the rest of the developed world, grew almost twice as fast as Europe and nearly three times as fast as Japan in the 1990's.
"Letting market forces work, letting competition work, is better for consumers, better for investors and better for the overall economy," said Philip Hoffman, chief economist of PNC Financial Services Group in Pittsburgh.
Now, however, and possibly for the first time since deregulation began in earnest, this dogma faces a serious real-world failure. 
Despite this, many economists still think that electricity deregulation will work. A product is a product, they say, and competition always works better than state control.
"I believe that premise as a matter of religious faith," said Philip J. Romero, dean of the business school at the University of Oregon and one of the architects of California's deregulation plan.
Optimists like Mr. Romero say the current period is merely an ugly transition, not yet even true deregulation. Power costs would have risen anyway, they say, because the price of natural gas, which is used to generate electricity, has soared.
In addition, California has been slow to allow building of new plants. That has left power in short supply, causing prices to rise. As new supplies becomes available, prices will fall, Mr. Romero said.
Also, California made a crucial mistake when it capped the rates consumers could be charged, while removing controls on the wholesale price of power, said Stephen Slifer, the chief American economist at Lehman Brothers. The caps prevented the state's utilities from passing their costs on to ratepayers, creating no incentive for consumers to conserve, Mr. Slifer said. 
However, a growing chorus of dissenters worries that the recent price spikes are not an aberration. The way electricity is produced and priced gives too much clout to the power generators, they say.
To economists, prices serve as crucial signals to producers and consumers. In a regulated market, the state sets prices high enough for private companies to cover their costs and earn a guaranteed profit for their investors. But in a deregulated market, prices should vary with demand and supply.
If prices rise, companies will see the opportunity for profit and make investments to meet that demand. Also, high prices tell consumers that supply is scarce and give them an incentive to conserve.
Sounds good. But building power plants is a slow process, so supply shortages can last several years. Also, electricity is the kind of product economists call "demand inelastic," because it is vital for both consumers and businesses. That means its price must go way up before people will use less of it.
IN other words, once the supply of power gets tight, generators gain almost unlimited power to set prices. As a result, prices can stay high for far longer than is necessary to signal the marketplace that a new supply is needed. Making matters worse is the fact that electricity cannot be stored, so users cannot build inventory to protect themselves.
The way electricity is priced in deregulated markets only adds to the problem.
Because of the physics of power transmission, producers and utilities must work together to keep power flowing across the electric grid. So New York, California and other states that have deregulated have set up nonprofit "independent system operators" to control their transmission grids.
Every day, the I.S.O.'s set the price for the power, using so-called reverse auctions. (California's system works slightly differently, but the effect is the same.)The I.S.O.'s receive offers to produce electricity from generators. Then they pick as many plants as they need to keep the lights on, choosing the lowest bid first, then the next lowest and so on. Once the demand for power has been met, the highest bid accepted sets the price that every generator receives.
In theory, the system should encourage generators to bid no more than the cost of running their plants, because, if its bid is accepted, it will break even; then, if a higher bid is accepted, the generator will get that price and automatically make a profit.
But because I.S.O.'s hold new auctions every day, generators can manipulate the system to raise prices, said Richard Schuler, an economics professor at Cornell University who is a member of the board of the New York I.S.O. For example, a generator with several plants in a state could bid the output of one of its plants at a very high price, to see if it can drive up the overall price of the auction.
ALL those factors combine to give suppliers too much control over prices, said Richard Rosen, executive vice president of the Tellus Institute, a Boston environmental research group, and a longtime critic of deregulation. 
Dr. Rosen is not optimistic that new supplies will solve the problem. For electricity markets to work, there must be a significant excess of supply even at peak periods, he said. But because electricity cannot be stored, having a lot of extra plants simply means some plants won't run, so why would power companies build or maintain them? 
"There's a very good reason this industry has been regulated for 100 years," said Dr. Frank Wolak, an economics professor at Stanford University and chairman of the market surveillance committee of the California I.S.O. "This is an industry that's extremely susceptible to market power."
Deregulation's defenders say that will change as new plants are built. But this winter's price spikes have been so severe, and electricity is so important, that they do not have much time to prove their point. On Friday, the governors of eight Western states, including five Republicans, called for at least temporary controls on the wholesale price of power.
Deregulation promised much, but at least in California, it hasn't yet delivered, and people lose patience very quickly when the lights go out. As S. David Freeman, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, said, "What is the purpose that's being served by going to a system of higher prices, other than satisfying people who believe that the marketplace is better?"

HEADLINE: The Mystery of Economic Recessions 

BYLINE:  By Robert J. Shiller; Robert J. Shiller is an economics professor at Yale and author of "Irrational Exuberance."

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN 

 BODY:
A great embarrassment for modern macroeconomic theory is that it has never achieved any consensus on the basic questions of what makes the stock market rise or fall and what ultimately causes recessions.
 Today, there is great debate over whether a recession is in the offing -- and if there is a recession, how long it will last. Already, signs of an economic downturn are all around -- a depressed stock market, layoffs in several business sectors. That's why many Americans looked with relief toward Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve Board, which last week cut the benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point for the second time in a month. But will the Fed's action prevent a recession? It's difficult to tell. 
 Economists know what economic indicators correlate with recessions -- stock market declines often precede them, for example. And we know that most movements in the stock market haven't made any straightforward sense as a rational response to interest rates or to news about future profits or dividends. But we have not been able to pinpoint what ultimately causes recessions -- probably because the causes are psychological and thus intangible.
The renowned British economist A. C. Pigou wrote in 1929 that psychological factors account for about half of fluctuations in industrial production: he spoke of "psychological interdependence," "sympathetic or epidemic excitement" and "mutual suggestion." His judgment seems about as good today as in 1929 -- and the factors he described are still not easily measured.
Absent any scientific consensus about the ultimate source of economic fluctuations, oversimplified theories abound. Today's example is the popular theory that the Fed controls everything -- that the raising or lowering of interest rates alone causes the economy's ups and downs. The record 14 percent one-day increase in the Nasdaq index on Jan. 3, after the Federal Reserve Board made its first half-point cut in interest rates this year, suggests how strongly some investors buy into this theory.
Of course, the Fed's management of interest rates does have an important role in the way recessions play out, but it would appear unlikely that anything the Fed actively chooses to do will actually disrupt the economy. Something else is driving the periodic recessions.
A recession is generally related to a decline in confidence, a decline that makes consumers less willing to spend and businesses less willing to invest and to employ workers. Eventually we see layoffs and rises in unemployment. The recent string of layoffs and the January decline in manufacturing employment are ultimately due to a decline in confidence.
There are some efforts to measure confidence systematically, notably the Consumer Confidence Index published by the Conference Board. It is based on answers to just five survey questions, about respondents' assessments of business and employment conditions, now and in six months, and of the likely family income in six months. Surely many respondents to these surveys are reflecting what they hear on the evening news, rather than probing their inner psyches.
The index, as simple as it is, however, has been shown in a number of studies to contain valuable information for forecasters. A decline in confidence is a useful predictor that consumer spending will drop. And in the past few months, the index has had its greatest decline since the recession in 1990 and 1991. This suggests some trouble ahead.
Part of our confidence in the past few years has been an exaggerated national faith in Alan Greenspan. This faith may have grown up in part because of the success of the interest rate cuts that he undertook to support the stock market just after the Oct. 19, 1987, crash. It may also stem from the 1998 interest-rate cuts after the Long Term Capital Management debacle, in which the failure of a big hedge fund threatened to cause a chain reaction of bankruptcies. Mr. Greenspan has come to symbolize support for the new economy, and he is an essential part of the current story.
But public confidence based on belief in the acumen of one 74-year-old man cannot be secure. Many critics, in fact, are now going far in the other direction, viewing Mr. Greenspan as the principal cause of the current downturn because of the Fed's persistence in raising interest rates until well into 2000.
Solid confidence is ultimately based on knowledge, on an understanding of underlying mechanisms and a mental accounting of the reasons for security. The problem today is that the economy is in such a cockeyed and unusual situation that it is easy to imagine that confidence could soon erode a great deal.
After 1982, the Nasdaq stock price index moved in a smooth upward arc, rising at a higher and higher clip, until March of last year, and since then it has fallen roughly in half -- as classic a bubble-and-burst pattern as there ever was.
Broader stock-price indexes have followed a similar, though less dramatic, ascending arc since 1982, and real estate prices are also inflated. There have been no bursts yet, but these situations, too, look so much like bubbles that it is hard to imagine how confidence could be secure going forward now.
So are we likely to have a recession?
Some factors suggest that we might. Our economic expansion of the past 10 years has been fueled by some trends that may not be sustainable. One is a historic decline in the average rate of personal savings, from more than 8 percent of income saved each year in 1991 to no saving at all in December 2000 -- in fact, to households' spending more a year than their income. Another is high borrowing. The debt burden of the average American household (especially mortgage debt) has risen to record levels.
 The problem for forecasters is that we are, by these measures, largely out of the range of our historical experience. When we are out of range, past examples cannot be reliable guides to the future. 
Lacking an established theory of the ultimate causes of economic fluctuations, forecasters tend to rely on simple extrapolation of trends or on assumptions that past patterns will repeat themselves. But we are in a moment when confidence and market psychology are changing fast. Surprises -- perhaps a serious recession -- could be in store for us.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "An Offer You Can't Refuse. Well, Maybe" (The Right Thing, Jan. 21), in which Jeffrey L. Seglin discussed the ethical problems of accepting a job offer, then changing one's mind because someone else offers a better deal: 
 The column did not address the flip side of the issue. At least once a month, I receive an inquiry from a distraught, soon-to-be former executive who accepts a position from a new company and then puts her current employer on notice. Then, before the official start date, she is informed by the new employer that the job is no longer hers. Without a written, signed employment contract for a defined period of time, the executive is left hanging in the wind. All too often, the old employer has already accepted the resignation and won't reverse its decision. The executive usually has no legal recourse -- and because she has left her job voluntarily, she cannot receive unemployment benefits, either. 
The reasons the new employer gives for revoking the offer range from "we rethought the position's requirements, and decided you are not the best candidate" to "we have to scale back and reduce head count." Perhaps the executive has a claim of fraud or detrimental reliance, but without a written contract, such claims are nearly impossible to prove.
Most employers, however, do not offer such contracts. So why is it an ethical faux pas for an employee to change his or her mind (which I admit is problematic) yet it is not even an issue for the new employer to wreak havoc on a person's personal, financial and professional life?

Suit Challenges Buyout That Won Fed Approval

BYLINE:  By Robert D. Hershey Jr. 

 BODY:
Has the Federal Reserve, which administers consumer protection rules in addition to conducting the nation's monetary policy, approved a plan that victimizes minority shareholders in a buyout? At least one lawsuit contends just that.
 At issue is the price that the Bank for International Settlements, the Swiss body that functions as central bank for the world's central banks, will pay for privately held B.I.S. shares representing a 13.73 percent minority interest. 
 In September, the bank decided that the existence of a few shareholders other than central banks was no longer "in line" with its international role and development and proposed to pay 16,000 Swiss francs for each of the 72,648 privately held shares, roughly double the then-current market prices. 
This price was calculated with help from the French unit of J. P. Morgan, which said that low liquidity and lack of voting rights meant that the shares were worth 45 percent less than the B.I.S.'s net asset, or intrinsic, value.
One of the most vociferous objectors is Jean-Marie Eveillard, co-president of two First Eagle SoGen mutual funds managed by Arnhold & S. Bleichroeder in New York. First Eagle SoGen has accused the B.I.S. of "fraudulent, deceptive or manipulative" actions in a lawsuit filed in Federal District Court in New York.
"We'd get about one-half the amount that the bank itself says is the true value," Mr. Eveillard complained, calculating that the funds' 130,000 shareholders stood to lose a total of about $100 million.
Last month, the B.I.S. board unanimously approved the buyback at the price of 16,000 Swiss francs, meaning that neither Roger W. Ferguson Jr., the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve who attended in place of Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, nor William J. McDonough, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, objected.
A Fed spokesman declined to comment. "The matter's in litigation," he said. Robert D. Hershey Jr.

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases; 
After an Unforeseen Injury, Help That Lifts the Spirits

BYLINE:  By AARON DONOVAN 

 BODY:
A year ago Joycelyn Brathwaite was happily employed as a home health aide. She worked four to six hours a day, six to seven days a week, earning about $7 an hour.
 Then one day she slipped on a carpet in the home of the elderly woman in Bedford-Stuyvesant that she was taking care of, fell and could not get up. She was rushed to the emergency room and released after several hours. 
 "It was a sharp pain," Ms. Brathwaite said. "When I laid out at night and I wanted to turn, I felt the pain in my back and all the way down to my legs."
The pain would not go away, and every time she thought about returning to work, it got the best of her.
Ms. Brathwaite, 62, an immigrant from Trinidad who worked for years as a baby-sitter and housekeeper, applied for the first time in her life for unemployment benefits, and later for workers' compensation. 
But while she was waiting for the benefits to come through, she had no income, and no savings, because most of her money had been going to rent and food, and to her parents and other relatives in Trinidad.
After two months of unemployment, she had trouble paying her utility bills and the $509 monthly rent on her one-bedroom apartment southeast of Prospect Park in Brooklyn. 
An official from the health workers' union that Ms. Brathwaite belongs to told her that perhaps she could get help from the Community Service Society of New York, one of the seven local charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
She spoke with Jennifer Antoine, a social worker for the agency who specializes in helping people apply for public benefits.
Ms. Antoine immediately gave Ms. Brathwaite a $56 voucher so she could buy food, and followed it up with another two weeks later. 
Next, she secured a six-month grant for Ms. Brathwaite of $294 a month that helped pay the rent. The remaining $215 of her rent was paid by the city and state as a form of welfare called a shelter allowance.
Echoing comments that have been made by the leaders of the other social service agencies that the Neediest Cases Fund supports, David R. Jones, the chief executive of the Community Service Society, said that the agency had been receiving more requests for help from families and individuals who are struggling to make ends meet despite having jobs that pay more than minimum wage. 
"These are the kinds of critical interventions where not-for-profits and resources like the Neediest Cases Fund make it possible for working people who are playing by the rules to have some kind of modicum of a decent life," he said.
Ms. Brathwaite said that when she lost her job she would have considered moving to a less expensive apartment, but that she did not think she could find one.
Ms. Antoine agreed. "Who's going to find an apartment that's less than $500 a month?" she asked.
Mr. Jones said that as rents in New York City had gone up across the spectrum of economic strata, those on the low end had suffered the most, with rent demanding a greater percentage of their incomes.
"About 10,000 apartments below the $800 mark leave the market each year," he said. "Because of the increases in things like the high cost of living in the city of New York, she'd have real difficulty replacing that apartment."
Ms. Antoine said Ms. Brathwaite was fortunate that just as the six-month grant for her rent ran out, she began receiving public benefits, the vast majority of which go to paying her rent. 
Ms. Brathwaite had arranged those benefits with the help of Ms. Antoine. She is also hoping to start receiving food stamps.
Perhaps more important than the financial help was the relief Ms. Brathwaite felt once she got in contact with Ms. Antoine, whom she called "the best social worker ever."
"When you know organizations like this will help you," she said, "it lifts your spirit up."

HEADLINE: Immigrants Provide Employee Answer for Long Island Mailing Company 

BYLINE:  By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

DATELINE: EDGEWOOD, N.Y. 

 BODY:
There is a one-story building in the back of an industrial park here with a roof the size of eight football fields. There, companies' financial statements are prepared and shipped to investors across the country by Investor Communication Services, the nation's largest provider of such services, which expects to send a billion pieces of mail this year.
 The company has one problem: employees. "We can't find enough of them," said Judy M. Winter-Giella, director of human resources. 
 The solution is immigrants. "We know what the job market is and we've found a work force that is eager to work and eager to learn," Ms. Winter-Giella said.
The work force at the I.C.S. center here on central Long Island is about 90 percent foreign born, company officials estimate: about 85 percent Hispanic and 5 percent Haitian. Though they work with mail written in English, most of them cannot speak or read the language.
Like much of the country, Suffolk County is experiencing an unprecedented labor shortage. With unemployment hovering around 2 percent here, there are not enough people to fill all the low-level, low-paying jobs available. 
It is not unusual for large companies to turn to recent immigrants to close the gap. But I.C.S. has come up with a way to keep the workers it has, while helping them toward jobs with better pay and a future: it pays workers to attend courses on English as a second language. Classes are held twice a week in the company break rooms. Each two-hour class averages about 20 people.
The company says employees with English skills work more efficiently and provide a pool of candidates for higher-level jobs. "If you want to sort mail written in English, if you want to get ahead, then you have to learn to read and speak English," Maggie Rajotte, the language teacher, told a dozen Hispanic men in the break room after work.
During the busy season from March through May, the company, a division of New Jersey-based Automatic Data Processing, will take on 1,300 temporary workers to augment its full-time staff of 700. These people will work as much as 84 hours a week in 12-hour shifts, Ms. Winter-Giella said.
Wages start at $6.75 an hour, and few skills are needed to load envelopes and reading material into a machine.
"The truth is, the new people are hungry," Ms. Winter-Giella said. "We've found they will work 54 days in a row. We depend on them to tell their friends and relatives that there is good work here."
Nadeshda Sosa found work here. She walked in the door four years ago as a temporary sorter and is now a line supervisor earning about $15 an hour. 
Ms. Sosa, who fled the civil war in El Salvador, now owns a home nearby in Brentwood with her husband, a day laborer, and two children. She speaks excellent English.
"I came from a war, and now I have a home," Ms. Sosa, 26, said as she wandered among the sorting and stamping machines. "The language classes, they're a good thing. The company is teaching people to be part of society, not hidden laborers."
The Census Bureau estimates that more than 850,000 immigrants came to the United States between July 1998 and July 1999. But some economists believe that the number of illegal aliens is woefully underestimated and that the actual number could be as much as three times that. 
There is a strong demand for people to fill laborious and dirty jobs that pay $8 an hour or less -- about 25 percent of all jobs in the country. And Suffolk County has a large population of new immigrants -- 3,040 in the year that ended in July 1999, according to the Census Bureau. Most of them are from Mexico or Latin America, and many are here illegally.
At I.C.S., workers are required to offer proof that they can work legally in the United States: a Social Security card and a picture ID. But counterfeits are easily obtained and workers readily admit that they work under false names. Workers also must pass a drug test and a criminal background check.
Employers can be fined for knowingly hiring illegal workers, but they also risk being sued for discrimination if they challenge documents that on the surface seem authentic, Ms. Winter-Giella said. 
"If the documents appear real, we accept them as such," she said. "We can't afford to mistreat people."
The Social Security Administration makes only random checks once a year for numbers that fail to match legitimate accounts or repeat themselves in different locations.
The workplace is clean and well kept at I.C.S. The overtime is plentiful, the paychecks steady. And the technology is state of the art.
"The hardest part of the job is the ink and the paper cuts," said Luis Morales, 32, a Mexican who works under another name. "It doesn't pay much, but it's warm work for the wintertime. When May comes, I'll go back to landscaping. That pays $15 an hour without taxes."
While they have found work on the farms and in the factories, new immigrants have not found a welcome mat in Long Island. Groups of Americans routinely protest the presence of day laborers who loiter on their streets while waiting for work. Recently two Mexican men were abducted by two white men and stabbed and beaten with gardening tools in Suffolk County. The motive was hate, the police said. 
There is a housing shortage that the county is unable to solve. Immigrants routinely live in toolsheds and auto garages. "Speak English!" is the battle cry in the suburban parking lots.
But Mr. Morales is unfazed. "It doesn't bother me to hear that racism," he said. "I say, 'How are you going to get your mail without me?' "

HEADLINE: Bronx Journal; 
Residents Seek Shelter From Thriving Motels

BYLINE:  By DEXTER FILKINS 

 BODY:
On some mornings, Joseph Allen emerges from his home in the Fish Bay neighborhood of the northeast Bronx to find a condom or two lying in the street. Once, he looked down and saw a pair of women's underpants just past the gutter. Another time, a line of men were urinating outside his home.
 "It's that motel," Mr. Allen said, nodding in the direction of the Crown Motor Inn, a squat cement structure on Boston Road that shadows Mr. Allen's two-story brick home just around the corner, on Pearsall Avenue. "I don't think a motel like that belongs in a residential neighborhood like this." 
 Nearly everyone who matters in New York City's government professes agreement with Mr. Allen -- the mayor, the Bronx borough president, the planners and the police -- and yet the hourly-rate motels that dot a three-mile stretch along Boston Road continue to flourish. According to the police, many of them are used by prostitutes and drug addicts, and are sometimes the scene of robberies and other crimes. 
In December, after years of complaints from local residents, city officials offered a proposal that would have blocked any future motels on Boston Road -- and many other types of commercial activity as well. Area merchants banded together to defeat the plan, saying it would have flattened the economy along much of Boston Road, which runs from the New York Botanical Garden to the Westchester County line. 
That left residents in the surrounding neighborhoods -- Fish Bay, Williamsbridge and Eastchester -- back at square one. City officials say they are trying to come up with another plan to limit the so-called hot-sheets motels. But the prospects seem less than certain. Local leaders worry that the issue has already become entangled in this year's mayoral election. Others say that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's administration, despite its much-publicized crackdown on sleaze and crime in other parts of the city, has missed its chance in this corner of the Bronx.
"They cleaned up 42nd Street, why not here?" said John Barr, a Fish Bay resident since 1969. "We've become a dumping ground."
The fight over the Boston Road motels has been brewing for years. The northeast Bronx is hardly a mecca for tourists, yet in the last several years one hourly-rate motel after another has popped up. There are now about a dozen, and they are permitted under the commercial zoning rules that apply for much of the area.
Residents were further frustrated by the construction two years ago of the Crown Motor Inn, at 3320 Boston Road.
The motel sits next to a residential neighborhood and across the street from SS. Philip and James Roman Catholic School, an elementary school. Residents of Fish Bay demonstrated against construction of the motel and filed a lawsuit accusing it of several things, including inadequate parking, but the motel won and was awarded a certificate of occupancy. 
It was then that the City Planning Commission came forward with a plan to remake Boston Road. Under the proposal, new businesses would have been limited to retail shops and other types of businesses deemed more compatible with a residential area. Existing businesses, including the motels, would have been allowed to stay, but not to expand.
Although some residents welcomed the proposal, many merchants did not. Besides the motels, Boston Road has dozens of auto-related businesses, including dealerships, repair shops and car washes. Under the city's plan, most of those businesses would also not have been able to expand, and no new ones would have been permitted.
Bernie Landau, who owns a used-car dealership and several other businesses along Boston Road, said the city's plan would have forced several people to seriously consider relocating. Mr. Landau, who has done business in the Bronx for 46 years, says he is proud that the Boston Road commercial strip and the neighborhoods around it remained vibrant when much of the borough declined in the 1970's and 80's. 
"When the business community starts going down, the neighborhood starts going down," said Mr. Landau, the president of a local merchants organization. "If I can't do business here, I'll go somewhere else."
The city decided to withdraw its plan last month after it was rejected by Community Boards 11 and 12 and the Bronx Borough Board. 
Some local leaders say they fear that city politics -- specifically, the well-known animosity between Mayor Giuliani and the Bronx borough president, Fernando Ferrer -- is the major reason that the city has not dealt with the residents' concerns.
Mr. Ferrer, who is running to succeed Mr. Giuliani as mayor, forwarded a proposal to the Planning Commission last year that would have required future hotels or motels built anywhere in the city to be within 1,000 feet of an entrance to a major highway. That, he said, would prevent them from being located in residential neighborhoods. 
The City Planning Commission, 7 of whose 13 members are appointed by the mayor, rejected Mr. Ferrer's plan as too sweeping. 
"We believe New York does not have enough hotels," said the commission's executive director, Andrew Lynn. 
The Ferrer and Giuliani camps have lined up on opposite sides of the issue. The lawyer for the Boston Road merchants' association, Linda Baldwin, is married to Adolfo Carrion, a member of the Bronx Borough Council and an ally of Mr. Ferrer. Ms. Baldwin is also the law partner of Roberto Ramirez, the chairman of the Bronx Democratic Party and a Ferrer supporter.
"You have different folks in politics who don't see eye to eye, and the public interest is forgotten," said the Rev. Richard Gorman, the chairman of Community Board 12.
Mr. Ferrer and Mr. Lynn both vowed to continue working together to come up with a solution that satisfies everyone.
Many people who live and work on or near Boston Road are waiting to see if they'll be successful. One of them is Catherine Lavelle, the principal of SS. Philip and James School. Ms. Lavelle often tells pupils to stay away from the nearby Crown Motor Inn. Still, she said, they occasionally come to class chattering about things they say they've seen through the windows. Efforts to reach the motel's owner or a representative last week by phone were unsuccessful.
"Everyone knew what that place was going to be used for," Ms. Lavelle said. "What was the city thinking?"

HEADLINE: Field Guide? Check. Binoculars? Check. Lobbyists? Soon. 

BYLINE:  By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: NEW ALEXANDRIA, Va., Feb. 3 

 BODY:
The golden-crowned kinglet alighted only briefly in the riverfront scrub of the Potomac River's western shore. But it arrived like a feathery punctuation mark for some fascinated bird watchers who had ducked out of the capital city across the river to take a midday break from their determined new task of building what amounts to a political lobby for birds. 
 "That's the code we're now trying to crack," said one of the birders, Gavin Shire, a conservation officer with the American Bird Conservancy, a nonprofit organization. "How to translate the immense popularity of birding into a political force to be reckoned with." 
He referred to the quiet, teeming world of bird watchers and feeders, a gentle public wary of being seen as foppish, that now includes about one-fifth of the American population, more than 50 million people who outnumber hunters and anglers combined, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service. 
Bird watchers now spend more than $25 billion a year on feed, binoculars, travel forays and high-tech innovations like winterized birdbaths and television "nest cams" to track their plumed favorites from home or watch penguins caper live on the Internet.
Many of the birders cannot believe the success of their own growing subspecies.
"I got into birding as a kid to get away from people, and I have to laugh now at the idea that it's become a booming industry," said Pete Dunne, the vice president of the New Jersey Audubon Society. "But, you know, there are damn few people who don't like birds."
The birders' world increasingly involves city and suburban denizens intent on breaking beyond the asphalt routine to find something fresh and contemplative about life. But, almost by definition, their pastoral calling lacks political clout. And this is the problem now challenging bird conservationists determined to find a way to build a populist lobby against the increasing threats to bird habitats presented by human progress.
This task may sound no less daunting than sighting a resplendent quetzal to the average weekend birder. But various birding and wildlife groups are forming an 83-member policy council through the conservancy (www.abcbirds.org) dedicated to building political awareness and translating it into budget and legal muscle to protect the myriad of nongame birds fluttering under the gaze of this special-interest public.
"If we could reach all of that group it would be remarkable," said Mike Parr, the conservancy's vice president for development, of the mass of amateur birders. "But so far we don't have a brilliant strategy to engage them all out there," he admitted in the midst of his midweek birding along the the Potomac River.
The quiescence of birders is no surprise to such master birders as Mr. Dunne. He directs the Audubon Society's Cape May Bird Observatory at the Jersey Shore, where hotels that used to close after Labor Day are now booked deep into the fall for the seasonal bird migrations.
"People shy away from the label bird watcher," said Mr. Dunne, who spies backyard feeders all over the landscape and gently questions their owners. "The answer is always, 'Oh, no, I'm not really a birder.' People have gone out of their way to buy a device that will give them intimacy with birds, but they're not bird watchers," he said.
The evidence of birding's popularity is mounting, with two major new field guides vying for the lucrative market, scores of new festivals helping local economies in some of the most exotic birding areas and an increasing variety of pro-bird measures. These include the annual Keep Your Cat Indoors Day on May 12 to sensitize the nation to the loss of millions of backyard birds every year.
Hundreds of high-style bird food stores have opened, offering everything from the Yankee Flipper (a battery-powered feeder whose perch begins wildly spinning at the touch of an intrusive squirrel to cast him off) to Under Cover Coffee (purist beans harvested without the usual denuding of bird habitats). Most birders ignore kitsch trappings and make do simply with a pair of binoculars and a field guide.
Birding has grown with Americans' leisure time and disposable income. Paradoxically, new birders are emerging in the suburban rings of "sprawl" that conservationists have denounced for destroying bird habitats.
Conservationists estimate that one in every six species is in decline in North America and could wane by half in the next 30 years as humans use up more land.
"It's this steady nibbling away at bits of habitat through big housing developments that's really creating a problem and could come to a crisis," said David A. Sibley, author of "The Sibley Guide to Birds" (Knopf, 2000).
Mr. Sibley doubts some of the booming numbers but not the passion of modern birding. The premier watchers' group, the American Birding Association (www.americanbirding.org), has only 22,000 members, but these are among the most traveled and sophisticated devotees.
Mr. Sibley is in daily demand as a speaker now that his book, based on 30 years of experience as a photographer and birder, has become a best seller, with 300,000 copies in print. It is being hailed as on a par with the classic Audubon and Peterson field guides.
A second new guide, "Birds of North America" (Houghton Mifflin, 2000), is also selling well. It offers computer-modified spotting photographs and the guidance of Kenn Kaufman, a Whitmanesque birder who hikes America and celebrates "the pleasure of simply watching a bird, without analyzing it to death."
Such was the mood here in the Dyke Marsh preserve as Mr. Parr led his colleagues on a birding trek against the backdrop of the national capital.
"I've got a bald eagle here," Mr. Parr announced as he trained his binoculars skyward.
His companions exemplified birders' idiosyncrasies. These range from "twitchers" who are in a hurry to merely checklist multiple sightings to "extreme birders" who go native and take up residence with the birds. Linda Farley, the conservancy's antipesticide specialist, loves the sounds of birds. She calls them forth, particularly with her practiced "pish-pish" cry - an alarm call that rallies birds to flock in large protective numbers.
"Hear that: tea-kettle tea-kettle?" Ms. Farley asked, easily mimicking the Carolina wren. And she beamed in responding to a nearby white-throated sparrow: "Oh Can-a-da!"
But few birders can rival the adventures of Mr. Shire, a nature roustabout. He took up piloting an ultralight airplane so he could be one of the shepherdlike guides who experimentally re-educate flocks of trumpeter swans to rediscover their ancient East Coast flyways, from which the swans had been displaced.
"Its phenomenal," Mr. Shire said of flying in the open skies as the trusted leader at the head of a vee of swans and even switching the engine off to "thermal" with them on the earth's heat vents.
The communal aspect of birding emerged as members of the group alerted one another to an unexpected winter sighting of a golden-crowned kinglet. As they chatted, they mourned the passing of Phoebe Snetsinger, a world-class lister -- a globe-trotting birder with an enviable record of exotic sightings. She died in an auto accident in Madagascar.
"I'm betting Phoebe was on the trail of something special," Mr. Dunne said of Ms. Snetsinger. Taking up the hobby when she was stricken with cancer, Ms. Snetsinger added wondrous years to her life, said Mr. Dunne in explaining a human being's need to watch birds.
"It's just a treasure hunt," he said.

HEADLINE: Workers in Silicon Alley Feel Underpaid and Fear Losing Jobs, Survey Finds 

BYLINE:  By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
If the dawn of the new media world was supposed to mark the beginning of a fun and egalitarian workplace, Silicon Alley appears to have missed the target, according to a report released last week.
 The report, researched even before the national shakeout in the online industry, shows a transient work force in Manhattan with members worried about keeping their current jobs and ever-trailing in the training needed to find the next ones. 
 Women are often paid less than men, and workers in general are insecure about when the paychecks will stop.
"What we were really surprised at was this was a hip, cool industry, and we thought there would be more equality," said one of the report's authors, Susan Christopherson, a professor of city and regional planning at Cornell University. 
Despite relatively large pay increases between 1995 and 1998, most of the 335 Silicon Alley workers who responded to the 1999 survey thought they were underpaid. Men made $55.90 per hour on average, the study found, compared with $42.80 for women. Workers found that they spent 14 percent of their work week looking for jobs.
And the people who took part in the survey may have had better experiences than others in New York's new media, Dr. Christopherson said, because they were members of professional groups that tend to help employees get the most of their work.
The study was conducted by the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, Dr. Christopherson and another Cornell professor, Rosemary Batt, and Ned Rightor, the vice president of the executive search firm Isaacson Miller.
Dr. Christopherson said the research suggested that professional associations and universities that cater to the new media had often not moved fast enough to stay on top of the training needed by people in rapidly evolving new technologies. But she said some of the more interesting findings involved differences in pay between men and women.
"Essentially, there is an old boys' network, and that women and minorities tend to go into jobs that pay less," she said.
Anna Copeland Wheatley of AlleyCat Information Services, one of several New York organizations trying to address this disparity, said: "It is not like a conspiracy of the old boys' network in the back coat room. It's simply that people have networks and they use them, and venture capitalists use recommendations. Minorities and women don't necessarily have the Rolodex at hand."
Only 2 percent of venture capital money goes to businesses owned by women, Ms. Wheatley said.
The study also said that new media workers tended to move from employer to employer every six months, compared with seven years for the typical American, and that only 56 percent considered their jobs secure.
"That does not surprise me at all," said Allison Hemming, president of the HiredGuns, a consulting company that helps quickly growing businesses find contract workers. She said many companies that were growing fast in 1999 and early 2000 looked to contract workers to keep costs down and waited to hire full-time employees until they were sure what their needs would be.
Although Ms. Hemming said she thought the paradigm shifted in 2000 when layoffs started and employees began looking for more stability, many of her clients are "like mercenaries: they like the change, the flexibility to finish an assignment and then go skiing in Aspen." 
"People now want click and brick, they want the 401(k) plan, they want someone cleaning their offices at night, not just once a week," she said. 
New media workers receive little fringe benefits relative to people in other industries: 57 percent receive basic health insurance; 51 percent receive comprehensive coverage; 46 percent have a retirement plan; and 42 percent have a deferred income plan, like stock options.
For example, according to federal estimates, 87 percent of workers have basic health insurance.
Some blame the lack of labor unions in the new media industry for the low benefits, but others believe they would have little impact.
Peter Cappelli, the George W. Taylor professor of management at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, said: "To some extent I think they are doing it on purpose. Their target work force would prefer to have higher upfront pay and options, and lower benefits."
But he said workers not saving money or not having health insurance posed dangers to the economy, because government programs often pass those costs to taxpayers. 

CORRECTION-DATE: February 8, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about a survey of Silicon Alley workers misstated the job held by Ned Rightor, who helped conduct it. He is president of MXCIX, an executive search and work-force research company in Boston. He is no longer a vice president of the Isaacson Miller executive search firm.

HEADLINE: French Parties Press for Women in Politics 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE DALEY 

DATELINE: CHATAULIN, France 

 BODY:
Most of the 35 women who gathered here in a City Hall conference room recently had shown up for moral support, either because they had decided to run for local office in the Brittany region, or because they were mulling a decision to enter a race. 
 Always before, these women -- and millions of others across France -- had remained at the fringe of politics, believing that they were not really welcome in an overwhelmingly male club. 
 But all that changed this year. Political parties are wooing women as never before because a law was passed last year in France that appears to go further than any other in the world in attempting to share representation more evenly between men and women.
Starting with municipal elections scheduled in March, the new law obliges all political parties to field an equal number of male and female candidates in almost all elections. 
And so these 35 women -- most of them mothers in their 40's who had led feminist groups, union delegations or parents' associations in Brittany -- have found parties of all stripes urging them to run.
"I know one woman who was asked by three different parties to be on their list," said Valerie Pau, who helped organize the meeting. "Every time she picked up the phone, it was someone asking her. She could sit back and take her pick." 
Right now, 7 percent of France's mayors and almost 9 percent of its national legislators are women. That is roughly comparable with the United States, where 13 percent of senators are women, but far behind the 45 percent of Sweden's legislators who are women. 
It is not proving easy to level the political playing field.
Parties say they have had to scour the countryside to find women willing to be candidates; few have come forward on their own. And even when asked to serve, many women demur, questioning whether they have the time and the competence to enter a field they regard as a male battleground. 
Some also question the sincerity of the process. 
"Everyone is being asked," said Ms. Pau, a 42-year-old secretary and union worker who is planning to make her first foray into politics running for office in the nearby town of Brest. 
"But in a lot of cases," she added, "they don't really know us. They don't want us to say anything. Really, they just want us to be quiet and sit on their lists."
Even as the parties struggle to find thousands of women to be candidates, and to smooth the ruffled feathers of the men who must step aside, the debate rages about whether France's new parity law amounts to too much, too fast. 
Some fear that the women swept into office will be mere figureheads or the wives of former officials, taking up space but offering little value. 
But others say that the law will not only bring justice but also the fresh faces that French politics desperately needs. For decades here, politics has been dominated by the same men, almost all of whom are graduates of the same college. 
Most everyone agrees that the speed of the transition is jolting.
"There is no question that this is a brutal arrival for women," said Jean-Claude Kaufmann, a sociologist at the National Center for Scientific Research based in Rennes. "In one fell swoop, the numbers will be huge," he said. "And they will really have to prove themselves because people will be watching."
The birth of the parity law was not easy. First seriously discussed in the early 1990's, it engendered fierce opposition, even from some feminists who said that quotas of any kind were demeaning to women. 
But since the passage of the law -- championed by the Socialist prime minister, Lionel Jospin, and his wife, Sylviane Agacinski, a professor -- the idea has steadily grown in popularity. 
These days a majority of French citizens believe it to be a good thing. In one recent poll, 63 percent of those surveyed said that the parity law meant that French voters would get a better choice of candidates, and that the law would bring about better governance. 
Sixty-five percent said they wanted a woman elected mayor in their town in 2001. 
Monique Prevost, who attended the gathering in Chateaulin, might just be one of those new mayors. She heads a list that has been carefully brokered by the Socialist and Communist Parties in the Breton village of Douarnenez. But it took her six months to accept the offer. 
The principal of a local elementary school, she had been active in various associations and unions in the past. She had expected that with the passage of the parity law she would be asked to be on a list and even to be chosen for a job in the town administration. But the offer to run for mayor shocked her.
"At first, I thought it was a joke," said Ms. Prevost, 50. "Then, I have to admit I was a little bit afraid of so much responsibility and I was worried that I was just supposed to be a showpiece. But finally I said to myself, we wanted this, what will the men think of us if we do not go out there now?" 
The man who organized the list had the credentials to run for mayor himself, she said. For the most part, he has been generous about stepping aside and easy to work with, though on occasion she said she could feel him itching for a bigger role.
"Especially when the photographers are around," Ms. Prevost said. "Sometimes I feel him crowding in. Luckily, I'm a large-sized woman."
Ms. Prevost is not the only new candidate to have doubts about herself. 
Marie-Jo Zimmermann, who oversees women's issues nationally for the conservative Rally for the Republic party and who is running for mayor of a medium-sized city, said it took her months to come up with the candidates for her list. She said she had less trouble than she expected finding women she deemed qualified, but all 10 of those she asked, she noted, had the same reaction to her offer: 
"Every single one of them said, 'Am I capable of this?' and I have to say men do not ask that question. You ask them onto a list and they say, 'Yes.' They don't doubt themselves. One of my candidates was the C.E.O. of a company and she said 'Am I capable of this?' And I said, 'You must be kidding.' "
But some of the women who did come forward on their own got a less than welcoming reception. Michelle Sabban, who oversees women's issues for the Socialist Party, said one woman told her how the mayor of the town had tried to discourage her after she filed her application.
"The man called her into his office and he said, 'You are not going to have any weekends free, you'll have to work at night, you'll have no time for your children and you know what all that adds up to -- divorce.' "
Ms. Sabban said she had a little chat with the mayor, who said he thought of the conversation as just friendly, fatherly advice. In fact, women who have become candidates say they are running into a lot of that. Some say the push to get them on the party candidate lists has meant an exodus of younger men. The older men have hung on to their seats, leaving an abundance of older men now dealing with younger, inexperienced women.
Out on the stump, though, the women say they are usually taken seriously. "Most people seem very receptive," said Clementine Autain, 27, who has written a book on feminism and is running for mayor of one of Paris's arrondissements. "They are tired of seeing old people in politics and they know that I have nothing to do with corruption. But I am a little tired of hearing, 'Heh look, she is pretty.' "
France's foray into candidate parity goes farther than other European efforts to guarantee women a place in government. But most European countries have made substantial efforts in the last decade to raise awareness on the issue and many have moved much faster than France, which only gave women the right to vote in 1944. On average the percentage of women in European legislatures is about 20 percent. But there are considerable differences among the countries. 
Several European countries have flirted with the concept of quotas for women in elected office but most have given up the idea, usually for constitutional reasons. 
In addition to France, only Belgium currently has a quota for the candidate list; political parties there are required to fill one-third of their lists with women. In several countries including Spain, Austria and Germany, however, political parties have put quotas on themselves. 
Other countries have developed an array of incentives such as financing to promote women's participation and watchdog groups to make sure women do enter politics.
The impact women might have once in office is also widely discussed. Surveys show that the French public expects the effect to be positive. 
One poll that asked what areas would be improved by the presence of more women in elected office found that more than 80 percent of people responding expected improvement in education for young children, social services and health issues. Those areas are traditionally considered to be of particular concern to women. But the survey also showed that the public had confidence in women in other areas as well. Nearly 60 percent thought women would bring improvement to the running of the economy, transportation systems and sports. 
On the whole, it is France's left that has done the most to promote women's participation in civic life in the last few years. Even before it was law, the Socialists devised their own quotas for women during the most recent European and legislative elections. Ms. Sabban says that the presence of those women and the large number that Mr. Jospin has appointed to his cabinet -- 10 out of 32 ministers -- can be felt.
"You can already see their hands at work," Ms. Sabban said, pointing to several new laws, including one allowing morning-after pills to be distributed in schools as well as the creation of the pacte civil de solidarite, a new form of legal union for heterosexual or homosexual partners. 
"Women do bring a different perspective" she said. "French politics has changed a lot, is changing a lot and will have to change even more."

HEADLINE: HOCKEY; 
Conquering Czechs Rule With Creativity

BYLINE:  By JOE LAPOINTE 

 BODY:
In the neutral corridor between dressing rooms at Madison Square Garden there stood a middle-aged man in a dark suit, dark shirt and dark necktie. He had the sturdy physique of a former athlete and silver hair trimmed in a brush cut. This was Frantisek Cernik, general manager of the national hockey team of the Czech Republic.
 Cernik's two-week tour of the National Hockey League will include today's All-Star Game in Denver, where North America will play the World. Cernik is scouting for the Olympic Winter Games in Salt Lake City next February, when the Czechs will defend their gold medal. 
As Czech players passed Cernik after Monday's Rangers-Atlanta game, he chatted with them in their native language and also discussed in accented English how and why his country has dominated hockey in recent years. Is it the skating, the passing, the shooting or the checking? Cernik paused, smiled and answered by tapping the left side of his head with his index finger, a gesture that in most cultures suggests intelligence. 
"I think this is first," he said, referring to his gesture. "And the second is a combination. Canadian hockey is hard and tough. Czech hockey is technique. Together, ice hockey from Canada and Czech, half and half, is perfect."
Since the cold war ended a decade ago with the breakup of both Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, European players have flowed into the expanding N.H.L., blending their artistic impulses with the rugged style of this continent. Czech players alone hold more than 60 N.H.L. jobs, more than Russians, Swedes, Finns or Slovaks. You could stock three N.H.L. teams with Czechs. The first-year coach of the Pittsburgh Penguins is Ivan Hlinka, the first European head coach in N.H.L. history.
Hlinka coached the Czech team to the 1998 Olympic championship, which set off a national celebration. The Czechs have won the last two world championships and the last two world junior championships. The N.H.L.'s Hart trophy for most valuable player was won by Czech players in three of the last four seasons -- twice by Buffalo goalie Dominik Hasek, once by Pittsburgh forward Jaromir Jagr. On the Rangers, the best forward line is nicknamed "the Czech mates." On the Stanley Cup champion Devils, three of the top six scorers are Czech.
"The talent is really huge back home and everyone sees the dream to play in the best league in the world," said Patrik Elias of the Devils. "It really pushes them ahead. In the last five years, Czech hockey has really broken through."
He spoke after his team beat Detroit by 3-1 in a crisp game last Tuesday. Devils goals were scored by Elias, Petr Sykora and Bobby Holik, all Czech players who knew the game was televised live back home in the early morning hours. Such trans-Atlantic exposure was rare until the 1990's. Before then, a Czech or a Slovak who wanted to play in the N.H.L. while still in his prime would usually have to defect.
Some of them, like Petr Klima, were smuggled across borders. Radek Bonk, an Ottawa Senator who is in the All-Star Game, said Klima, who played in the N.H.L. from 1985 to 1999, "was one of my big heroes." If the Czech Republic and Slovakia still pooled their talent for one hockey team, Slovaks like Zigmund Palffy and Petr Bondra could supplement the Olympic champions. "We would be even stronger," Bonk said.
In a broader discussion of Czech hockey, Bonk and a dozen other Czech players agreed with scouts, coaches and general managers that the Czech system patiently develops skills at the youth level without pushing children to play too many games too soon. Hasek, an All-Star and one of three Czech goalies in the 30-team N.H.L., said North Americans could improve by teaching skills the way they do in his homeland.
"I just think the program for the kids in the Czech Republic is better," Hasek said.
Bonk said he watches children practicing in the Canadian capital and does not approve of what he sees.
"The coaches were just giving them the puck, but they didn't even know how to skate," Bonk said. "My dad coaches some little guys back home, 5- and 6-year-olds, and, in an hour practice, they skate for 45 minutes without the puck." 
The Devils' Holik is the son of Jaroslav Holik, the coach of the Czech national junior team. When the younger Holik runs summer hockey schools in North America, he said, he uses the teaching methods of his father and other Czech coaches.
"It's a good system," Holik said. "If you know how to skate, you're a lot better off. All the players from my dad's generation, world-class players of the 1960's and 1970's, are giving back to the young players. They are all teaching and coaching. It's amazing."
David Conte, the chief scout of the Devils, said he is wary of making sweeping generalizations. But, when pressed specifically to comment about Czech hockey, Conte said, "Their creativity with the puck, teamwork-wise, is unsurpassed."
This observation was supported by Dave King, the coach of the Columbus Blue Jackets, who coached three Canadian Olympic teams and scouted Europe last season for the Montreal Canadiens. King said the "sports-school model" from the Communist days survived better in the Czech Republic than it did in Russia after the sweeping changes in politics and the economy. "Children play with their club teams and get extra help from professional coaches," King said.
One criticism of European players in the N.H.L. is that they pass the puck too much and shoot it too little. King and others said this is because Europeans learn the game on an ice surface that is 15 feet wider than North American rinks. On wider ice, European goalies play farther back in the net. Like soccer players using a ball, European hockey players often move the puck from side to side to pull a goalie out of position. 
"They are very creative; they are awesome to have on your team, even if at times they overpass and don't shoot enough," King said, speaking of Czech players. "Their style is to score tap-in goals, pretty goals, tick-tack-toe type of plays. They bring that same finesse to our game."
In the N.H.L., the word finesse is not always a compliment. Sometimes, it can suggest that a player avoids rugged play, and this was often said about Europeans in the N.H.L. when the Swedes and Finns led the first migration in the 1970's. One experienced agent attuned to this sort of stereotyping is Rich Winter, a Canadian who includes Hasek, Elias and Sykora among his many Czech clients.
"They still face a general prejudice," Winter said, referring to Czech players. "People say, 'You can't have too many of them on one team.' They would never say that about Canadians or Americans." With sarcasm, Winter asked if there were too many Czechs on the Czech Olympic team that won the gold medal. And he said some N.H.L. teams are "slow to change" and still reluctant to scout Europeans.
"The N.H.L. is not run by Fortune 500 executives," Winter said. He acknowledged that fewer N.H.L. general managers are limiting Czech players to "skill positions" on the first and second lines while refusing to consider them for checking lines, defense or goalie.
Cernik, who runs the Czech national team, said: "Ten years ago, many defensemen in Czech were small. Now, we have many good defensemen, big and strong."
One of them is Roman Hamrlik of the Islanders, 6 feet 2 and 215 pounds, drafted first over all by Tampa Bay in 1992. He played as a junior in Europe, but some young Czech players are moving to Canada as teenage juniors to learn a hybrid style. One is Pavel Brendl, chosen by the Rangers in the first round of the 1999 draft. Jason Arnott, the Devils center who skates with Elias and Sykora, was asked about the old impression that Czech players lack a taste for Canadian-style combat.
"They are in there just as much as I am," said Arnott, a 6-4, 225-pound native of Collingwood, Ontario. "They are good with the puck and they are all fast. They compete every night, especially my two wingers."
Despite their overall acceptance, Czech players are sometimes singled out for criticism by N.H.L. coaches. An example is on the Rangers. Although Petr Nedved, Radek Dvorak and Jan Hlavac make up the top line, Coach Ron Low frequently says that they don't shoot enough. After the Rangers beat Montreal by 4-2 last Wednesday behind three goals from the Czech line, Low's first comment about them was to complain about a turnover that resulted in a Montreal goal. And he admitted that he wanted Dvorak to shoot instead of pass before he set up Nedved's second goal. 
Nedved acknowledged this tension and said: "Maybe we don't shoot as much as we should, but I guess that's our game. We are trying to be unselfish and pass the puck. It's such a fine line." He noted that the North American style is to "dump the puck," that Europeans are still reluctant to do this and that the two styles are not fully reconciled.
One of the last players from Czechoslovakia to defect before the political changes, Nedved is 29. He played for the Canadian Olympic team in 1994 and he has seen both sides from inside and out. On the narrow rinks of Canada and the United States, Nedved said, the style is "north-south," up and down the ice. Players from the wider rinks of Europe, he said, tend to "go a lot more east to west."

What's Both Up and Down?

BYLINE:  By David E. Rosenbaum

 BODY:
 Evidence mounted that the American economy is flagging. That led the Federal Reserve Board to cut key interest rates by another half a percentage point. 
Even so, the Congressional Budget Office predicted that the economy would grow faster than expected in the next 10 years and that the budget surplus would be $5.6 trillion, about $1 trillion more than its last forecast. "The dip in the economy is expected to be short-lived," said Barry B. Anderson, deputy director of the budget office, telling Congress not to let cyclical weakness obscure long-term strength.

HEADLINE: Sanctions' Ledger: Benefit or Harm? 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Sanctions Are a Weapon We Need," by Aryeh Neier (Op-Ed, Jan. 28): 
 Mr. Neier is wrong about the need for sanctions. 
First, in the overwhelming majority of cases, they don't work. Second, it is virtually axiomatic that sanctions, to the extent that they are at all effective, hurt the people of a country more than their rulers. Third, even though they always come clothed in the rhetoric of freedom and human dignity, they are imposed by the United States in highly inconsistent and politically motivated ways.
The United States is not the arbiter of what is morally right in the world. Our national policies reflect self-interest and lack of understanding about other parts of the world as often as not. Our lack of consistent principles in applying sanctions that damage the lives of millions just generates one more legitimate reason for resentment against us in the world.

Through the Looking Glass, Darkly

BYLINE:  By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

 BODY:
Last week provided ample proof that the markets have more in common with "Alice in Wonderland" than the real world.
 From a market perspective, the early part of the week was promising. 
The Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the second time in a month. Two weak economic reports -- one showing the slowest manufacturing pace in nine years and one indicating a sharp decline in consumer confidence -- suggested that further rate cuts were likely. 
 The January unemployment report, issued on Friday, showed a surprising surge in new jobs and deflated some of the market's rally. Investors worried that the report might not take further action on rates.
 For the week, the Dow industrials ended at 10,864.10, up 204.12 points or 1.9 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500 finished at 1,349.47, off 5.48 points or 0.4 percent. The Nasdaq fell further, partly because of the fourth-quarter loss at Amazon.com, the e-commerce leader. The Nasdaq fell to 2,660.50, off 120.80 points or 4.3 percent.
 The unemployment report also snapped a three-day rally in the Treasuries market. The yield on the 10-year bond finished at 5.14 percent, down from 5.26 percent the previous week. DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

HEADLINE: New Home for Delaware's Noted Chancery Court 

BYLINE:  By MAUREEN MILFORD

DATELINE: WILMINGTON, Del. 

 BODY:
WHEN the corporate raider T. Boone Pickens made a hostile bid for the Newmont Mining Corporation during the takeover frenzy of the late 1980's, the battle ended up in Delaware's Dickensian-sounding Court of Chancery.
 But the day the Texas deal maker showed up for a hearing, the proceedings had to be moved to a courtroom in the federal building. Chancery -- the most important state court in the country when it comes to corporate law -- could not fit all the arbitragers, members of the news media and spectators into one of its cozy courtrooms in the 1916 Daniel L. Herrmann Courthouse on Rodney Square. 
 More recently, in a trade secrets case involving Merck & Company and SmithKline Beecham P.L.C., lawyers brought so much technology into the courtroom that the building's electrical systems was overtaxed and a brownout ensued.
Despite its power to determine the outcome of multibillion dollar business matters, Chancery Court has had to make do for decades. 
Now, work is progressing on a $132.4 million courthouse at Fourth and King streets in which Chancery Court will have the top billing, with state-of-the-art courtrooms on the highest floor. The 570,000-square-foot building on 5.5 acres is the largest single public-building project in Delaware's history, illustrating how much the state champions its court system, particularly the specialized business court.
Chancery Court, an unusual entity founded as a court of equity as opposed to a court of law, which traces its heritage to medieval England, is one reason Delaware is the paper home to nearly half of the Fortune 500 companies. And corporations chartered in Delaware pay franchise taxes, which represent 22 percent of the state's operating budget, according to Sabrina D. Hill, assistant secretary of state.
"We want to have an adequate and safe courthouse for our residents, but also we recognize the need for dignified surroundings for people who come from all over the world to litigate in our Court of Chancery," said Delaware Supreme Court Chief Justice Norman E. Veasey.
The land was cleared more than 30 years ago as part of urban renewal efforts, and the steel framing of the 12-story building has altered the skyline in the southern end of the city's central business district.
The architecture of the New Castle County Courthouse by HLM Design of Orlando, Fla., will lack the massive fluted columns and granite facade of the 177,600-square-foot Herrmann building, designed by Palmer & Hornbostel of New York. Instead, the brick, glass and aluminum-panel courthouse promises to deliver the latest in technology and security.
"The new building will give us large courtrooms -- which we desperately need -- but the technology will be something that will assist the court in maintaining its reputation for promptness," said Chancellor William B. Chandler III, the court's chief judge.
Technologies include electronic filing, real-time transcription, digital voice recording, computer animation and video teleconferencing.
BESIDES Chancery, the building will house three other trial courts -- Family Court, Court of Common Pleas and Superior Court -- when it opens in September 2002. The Supreme Court is in Dover, the state capital.
Chancery Court has played a large role in establishing the national reputation of Delaware's court system, the chief justice of the United States, William H. Rehnquist, said in 1992 at the time of the court's 200th anniversary.
The court is so highly specialized and its decisions so scholarly that corporations' legal counsels refer to Delaware rulings to order their companies' actions to avoid litigation. "This recognition confers on the Court in Chancery one of the highest forms of praise a judiciary can receive," Mr. Rehnquist said.
Today, approximately 70 percent of all the filings relate to corporate law and other alternative business entities, like limited liability companies.
Because of various twists dating to the birth of Delaware's Chancery Court in 1792, the state has one of the purest forms of a court of chancery in the world, more like its ancient ancestor of equitable jurisprudence in England, according to the former Chancellor William T. Allen, who is now head of the Center for Law and Business at New York University School of Law.
The court handles no criminal, family or tort matters. It has no juries and is not bound by strict statutes of limitations. Judges may issue temporary restraining orders, injunctions and other equitable relief. 
In medieval England, as the common law courts became calcified with procedure, parties who felt they should have prevailed under principles of fairness would appeal to the king for relief. Cases were referred to the lord chancellor for review. Usually a church official schooled in canon law, the chancellor could tailor a remedy to fit the specific facts, said the former state Supreme Court Justice William T. Quillen.
"The English chancellor relied heavily on the common law, but would do what his conscience perceived was morally right where the common law would cause hardship in a particular case," reads a history written by Mr. Quillen and the Wilmington lawyer Michael J. Hanrahan.
Between 1400 to 1672, chancery developed into a full-fledged court of equity, with flexible procedures similar to ecclesiastical courts. Across the Atlantic, many of the original states eliminated their Courts of Chancery during the Revolution, viewing them as instruments of the Crown.
Delaware, with no such bias, created the Court of Chancery in its constitution.
Most states merged their equity and law courts in the 19th century. In Delaware, however, the legislature began to designate Chancery as a forum for certain corporate matters. Soon after passage of the General Corporation Law in 1899, the court began adjudicating significant corporate cases.
Only a handful of states still have chancery courts completely separate from their law courts, none comparable to Delaware's unique court, said Charles M. Elson, director of the Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. 
"Hands down, it's the most important corporate court in the country," Mr. Elson said.
The new courthouse should provide adequate space through 2020. The four Chancery courtrooms range in size from 1,200 to 1,800 square feet -- nearly tripling the current space. The court will also have access to a 3,000-square-foot courtroom on a lower floor.
Chambers for the chancellor and four vice chancellors, which will have views of the Delaware River, will be on the floor beneath the courtrooms. Vice Chancellor Stephen P. Lamb, representing the court during construction, said the new courthouse will include conference rooms and offices for clerks, things that do not exist now.
PRIVATE elevators off a secured parking lot on Walnut Street behind the building will allow judges to avoid walking through the courthouse. There will also be a 1,100-car parking garage for employees, jurors and the public. 
Much of the courthouse planning focused on the circulation of judges, jurors, criminal defendants, litigants and the public. Great pains were taken to create a design that separated the groups, said Paul F. Ignudo Sr., director of the state division of facilities management. Family Court essentially has its own wing, perpendicular to the rest of the T-shaped building.
MBNA America, the credit card company headquartered on Rodney Square, has contracted to buy the elegant Herrmann building, whose construction was engineered by John Jacob Raskob, a DuPont Company executive and builder of the Empire State Building. The old court building was designed in the classical style of the City Beautiful Movement.
The bank has not completed plans for the building but will probably renovate the once-elegant pink marble and Indiana limestone interior, said David W. Spartin, bank vice chairman.
Some in the legal community are unhappy about moving from the old courthouse despite its shopworn interior, feeling it could have been expanded at the rear, preserving the original facade.
Richard K. Herrmann, a Wilmington lawyer and the son of the chief justice for whom the courthouse is named, objects to the move, although he worked on the technology for the new courthouse.
"Quite frankly," he said, "I think it's unfortunate we're losing the fine tradition and location in exchange for technology. You can have both."

Guns And Bitterness

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
What do Medicare and the military have in common? Both are about to be betrayed in the name of tax cuts.
 Start with the military. During the campaign George W. Bush warned audiences that America's military was in decline. "Not since the years before Pearl Harbor has our investment in national defense been so low as a percentage" of the gross domestic product, he declared. Strangely, if you looked at the numbers put out by his economic team, you found that he actually proposed to reduce that percentage further, spending substantially less on defense than his opponent. 
 Nonetheless, the military overwhelmingly supported Mr. Bush; officers thought that they had an understanding -- nudge nudge, wink wink, say no more -- that defense spending would quickly expand once he reached the White House. Indeed, senior officers have been telling Congress that they need a 30 percent increase in their budget. (Do they? Not my department.)
Guess again. Last week, according to newspaper reports, Mr. Bush told lawmakers that there would be "no new money this year for defense." Karen Hughes, a counselor to Mr. Bush, conceded that "we may in fact need resources" for the military -- may? after all that martial rhetoric? -- but made it clear that there was no rush. One officer bitterly declared, "It sounds like campaign promise No. 1 being broken."
Then there's Medicare. The Medicare system is currently running surpluses, but almost everyone agrees that the Medicare surplus, like the Social Security surplus, should not be considered available for tax cuts or new spending. The two programs both rely on taxes paid by working-age Americans to pay for benefits to current retirees, and both face a demographic crisis as the baby boomers get older. Their current surpluses are therefore, as everyone acknowledges, a necessary, even inadequate, provision for the difficult decades ahead.
Everyone acknowledges this, except the administration, which -- unlike members of its own party in Congress -- refuses to rule out raiding the Medicare surplus.
But isn't the federal government awash in surpluses? Hasn't Alan Greenspan told us that our big economic problem is how to give the money away, lest politicians end up owning the stock market? If there's plenty of money for tax cuts, why won't the administration give the military at least some of what it wants and promise to keep its hand out of the Medicare cookie jar?
Because someone in the White House is aware of the truth, which is that there isn't plenty of money after all.
Here's the arithmetic: the Congressional Budget Office has projected a 10-year surplus of $5.6 trillion. (I don't believe it, but never mind.) Take the Social Security and Medicare surpluses off the table, however, and you are left with only $2.7 trillion. That may sound like a lot, but the projected cost of Mr. Bush's tax cut has also grown, for reasons that are important but too boring to explain. It would now use up around $2 trillion of that surplus.
And what's left depends on the totally unrealistic assumption that federal spending, including defense spending, will not grow at all over the next decade, despite a growing population and a growing economy. Give the military what it says it needs, and we're already well into deficit -- and that doesn't include missile defense, not to mention prescription drug coverage, new education programs and all that. Oh, and what about the trillion dollars of Social Security money that Mr. Bush has proposed to spend twice?
Nonetheless, Congress is about to go into a tax-cut feeding frenzy, adding huge tax breaks for corporations to Mr. Bush's proposal. The spectacle will be distressing, but it will be over quickly. Pretty soon, quite possibly as soon as this summer, we'll be worrying about deficits, not surpluses.
Of course, some conservatives would say that's the point, that we need to starve the government to shrink it. But what the federal government actually spends its money on is retirement, health care and defense; the rest is small change. So guess what gets shrunk? And if the military elite is shocked to find that this administration considers eliminating the inheritance tax more important than providing new weapons systems, that it is more concerned with the security of estates than the security of the state -- well, that's what you get when you trust in winks and nudges instead of checking the numbers.

HEADLINE: Free-Tuition Program Transforms a University 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: ATHENS, Ga., Feb. 1 

 BODY:
In about eight weeks, the calls from furious parents will start to accumulate on the desk of Michael F. Adams, the president of the University of Georgia, in what has recently become a painful annual ritual. Doesn't he know they are alumni, Bulldog boosters, season ticket holders, prodigious writers of checks? How could he possibly refuse to admit their child to their alma mater?
 "You wouldn't want to hear the calls I get in April," Mr. Adams said this week. "Nobody likes having to deny admission to families with long-standing supporters. But we have to be upfront about what has happened here." 
 And so he has to tell them, not without a certain amount of pride, that the university has been transformed since their day. It is no longer the sleepy party school that would readily accept the offspring of any halfway prominent family in the state. Seemingly overnight, one of the South's largest public universities has become enormously competitive, able to pick and choose from among the region's best high school seniors, insisting on test scores that would have been unimaginably high less than a decade ago. 
The principal reason is a free tuition program used by almost every freshman at the university and paid for by proceeds from the Georgia lottery. Known as the Hope Scholarship, it pays for all tuition and fees at any state college or university for Georgia residents with at least a B average. Since it was enacted in 1993, it has proved a powerful financial incentive for the state's top students to bypass universities like Duke, Vanderbilt and North Carolina and remain in the state.
The average SAT score for incoming freshmen has increased to 1203 this year from 1086 in 1993, compared with the national average of 1019 now. For the first time, Georgia ranks in the top 20 public universities on lists like those compiled by U.S. News & World Report, equivalent to schools like Ohio State and Purdue.
"I couldn't get in anymore if I tried," said Nancy Freeman, a 1970 graduate who lives in Atlanta. "But we're about to put our fourth child through UGA on a Hope Scholarship, and we are just thrilled about it. The academic level has gone way beyond our expectations, and it was all free. For our kids, going there was a no-brainer." Current in-state tuition at the university is $3,276 a year.
Merit-based scholarships like the Hope program are becoming increasingly popular around the country, now used in 13 states, but after seven years as the pioneer program of its kind, the Hope system in Georgia is yielding several lessons.
Though it has substantially improved the academic quality of the state's top colleges, it has not significantly increased the overall number of students going to college. Instead, it simply keeps more college-bound students in the state. It has not increased the number of minority students at an elite institution like Georgia, though it has allowed more minority students to attend college. And the pressure to to maintain the scholarship often prompts students to drop difficult courses, and to take a lighter course load.
Most starkly, the scholarships represent an enormous transfer of money -- $1.2 billion since 1993 -- from lottery players, who tend to live in the poorest counties of the state, to 504,000 college students, who come from the wealthiest counties. The program has become one of the most popular middle-class entitlements, and politicians who champion it are often rewarded at the ballot box. 
The program has clearly succeeded in one of its principal goals -- keeping top students in the state. Its creator, Gov. Zell Miller (now a United States senator), campaigned on a belief that the brightest students were leaving the state and needed an incentive to stay. A new study by two University of Georgia economists found that the Hope program had increased enrollment by 10 percent at four-year public schools in the state, and by 20 percent at private schools, where the scholarship subsidizes students' tuition.
Since the Hope program began, the average SAT scores of college freshmen remaining in the state has increased by nearly 10 percent, putting Georgia freshmen at the same level as the national average for the first time beginning in 1998. The number of the brightest students staying in the state -- those with SAT scores of at least 1500 out of a possible 1600 -- has increased to 76 percent from 23 percent in 1993.
But the program has not expanded the overall number of students attending college, said Christopher Cornwell, one of the authors of the study, because it is based entirely on merit, not on need. Poor students who want to attend college can still rely on the federal Pell grants, while wealthier students, who probably would have attended college anyway, now do so free in Georgia.
"It's not too surprising that a merit scholarship like this one would tend to be given to students who would have gone to college anyway, particularly because higher educational achievement correlates to higher family income," Mr. Cornwell said. "The whole point was to improve the state's economy by getting the hardest-working students to stay here."
Last July, aware of the problem, the state expanded the program so that students who are eligible for both the Pell grants and the Hope scholarship can get both; previously, the scholarship was reduced by the amount of the grant.
The study found that the Hope program had increased the enrollment of black students at four-year public institutions around Georgia by 24 percent. Mr. Cornwell said those students were probably from families above the Pell income limits who would not have otherwise gone to college.
But those new black students are for the most part not going to the University of Georgia, the elite level of the state's public college system. Exactly 40 years after the university was desegregated, black enrollment remains stagnant at 6 percent, less than half the percentages at the Universities of Alabama, Mississippi and South Carolina, and the numbers are expected to decrease next year.
The university is fighting a series of court decisions prohibiting it from using race as a factor in admissions and effectively gutting its affirmative action program. But Mr. Adams acknowledged that the rise of Hope scholarships had played a role.
"Hope has made it somewhat more difficult to recruit African-American students, because so many of them come from educational backgrounds where they have not been as well prepared as they could have been," Mr. Adams said. "Some of that is a vestige of the two-tier system of the 50's and 60's, but it means we will have to work harder at recruiting."
Black students say the dominance of the mostly white fraternity system on campus makes life uncomfortable for them and has discouraged high school seniors from applying. Adora Ozumba, a pre-med senior from Nigeria, said someone shouted a racial epithet at an outdoor gathering of black students a few days ago. Michael Anthony Thomas, a senior from Atlanta who was the first black editor of the student newspaper, said he sensed less diversity on campus now than when he first arrived, though he credited the administration with trying to improve the atmosphere.
"There are still too many students with a 1950's mentality here, like the ones who put a big Confederate flag up on the porch of their fraternity," he said. "You'd think that brighter students would mean there'd be more tolerance, but this is still Georgia."
But students white and black said the university was a more serious place than it used to be now that everyone must sustain a B average to maintain the free tuition. Faculty members say students are clearly more conscientious than in the past, if not necessarily better prepared.
"I'm seeing better writing than I used to, and a lot more concern about their grades," said Delmer D. Dunn, Regents professor of political science. "I feel more confident now in giving them more and requiring more." Some instructors say the scholarships have increased the pressure on them to inflate grades, although grades have also gone up because of a brighter student body.
About 60 percent of students at the university retain their scholarships after their freshman year, double the state rate. Both figures are expected to increase in future years now that the state has tightened the requirements for a scholarship in core high school courses, reducing the overall pool of scholarship students but improving the group's academic level.
Of more concern to the school at the moment is the number of students who are dropping courses halfway through the term if they anticipate earning a grade that would lower their average. The university's own strategic plan notes that undergraduates are taking fewer credit hours per semester than they used to, a trend that is directly attributed to the scholarships and that students are perfectly willing to confirm.
"Everyone's always trying to keep their Hope," said Shannon McGhee, a junior from Alpharetta. "If they don't think they'll get a good grade, they drop the course. They figure, hey, if I don't keep it, I'm going to end up going home anyway."

HEADLINE: Bush Aides Debate Ways To Press China Over Rights 

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 

 BODY:
The Bush administration is debating how hard to press China on human rights, and may be tempted to drop condemnation of China at an annual human rights meeting next month in preference for what some see as a more pragmatic approach to extracting reforms from the Chinese.
 During most of the Clinton administration, the United States was at the forefront of reprimanding China at the United Nations Human Rights Commission, a strategy that the Chinese always tried to block to stave off embarrassment. 
 This year, as China faces a vote by the International Olympic Committee in July on whether Beijing will be host for the 2008 Olympics, the Chinese government has offered a number of inducements -- including ratification of a United Nations rights covenant -- to persuade Washington to drop the traditional resolution.
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said at his confirmation hearing that a recommendation to President Bush on whether the United States would support a resolution at the commission would be "the No. 1 item on our plate," but he did not say what he would do about it. 
In a meeting with the departing Chinese ambassador, Li Zhaoxing, General Powell warned that he would raise human rights issues and do so "frankly," a State Department spokesman said. China needs to follow "the rule of law and to be exposed to the powerful forces of free enterprise systems and democracy," General Powell told Mr. Li.
The words differed little from those of the former secretary of state, Madeleine K. Albright, but they carried particular import coming the day after five followers of the Falun Gong spiritual movement set themselves on fire in Tiananmen Square.
But administration officials said that first foray into the China human rights debate gave no clues about the attitude toward the annual resolution of condemnation in Geneva.
General Powell faces an array of liberal and conservative human rights advocates who want the administration to support a resolution -- even though, as in the past, it is almost certain to be defeated. These advocates argue that little will change in China if the United States accepts the alternatives, and that China will gain a moral victory by not being reprimanded.
The annual human rights report by the State Department, due at the end of this month, is expected to say -- as it did last year -- that the human rights situation in China has continued to deteriorate, with religious persecution particularly intense, and thus to increase pressure on General Powell for introducing a resolution.
The annual Geneva meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Commission begins on March 19, but lobbying is already at a high pitch. Last week, leaders of seven human rights groups, including Human Rights Watch and the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Center for Human Rights, wrote to General Powell and Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, urging them to press ahead with the human rights resolution.
One factor General Powell must consider, officials and human rights advocates said, is whether the United States can do more to improve human rights in China by accepting some of the Chinese proposals.
The Chinese have offered, for instance, to ratify the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which would oblige them to accept visits from officials assigned to hold China to international standards. The Chinese, however, would agree to ratify the covenant only without the section that calls for the right to form trade unions.
The Chinese have also signaled that they might be ready to allow the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit prisons in China and to allow the United States Customs Service access to suspected prison labor sites.
Another gesture by the Chinese, according to human rights experts, is a memorandum of understanding reached with Mary Robinson, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, which will allow for Chinese and United Nations experts to meet to discuss reform of China's re-education labor camps.
The first of these gatherings is scheduled for late this month, just before the Geneva assembly -- timing that human rights advocates say should not diminish an effort to condemn the Chinese at the assembly.
As General Powell considers his options, he is in the process of choosing an assistant secretary for human rights, who will organize the complicated diplomacy of winning support for a resolution at Geneva. Among candidates who have been interviewed are Lorne W. Craner, the president of the International Republican Institute, which monitors elections abroad, and J. Kenneth Blackwell, secretary of state of Ohio, an African-American who served as ambassador to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in the first Bush administration.

HEADLINE: Improvement Districts Balk At City Plan For New Fee 

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
A proposal by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to charge business improvement districts a fee for services they have not had to pay for previously has rekindled tensions between City Hall and the public-private partnerships.
 Although they are reluctant to take on the mayor publicly, executives of some of the city's 41 business improvement districts, which provide security, sanitation, marketing and other services in commercial areas, say they are rankled by the plan to impose an administrative fee amounting to 2 percent of their budgets. The fee proposal was included in the mayor's Jan. 25 budget message. 
 The fees would amount to only about $1.1 million for all 41 groups, but some group officials said they would pose a hardship because the groups have not been allowed to increase their budgets for three years. The money for business improvement districts is collected from property owners and businesses, but because it is part of the city tax bill, any increases are subject to approval by the City Council and the mayor. 
"We're already stretched thin," said Brendan Sexton, the president of the Times Square Business Improvement District, which has an annual budget of $5.5 million. "To get a cash money decrease is definitely moving backwards."
The executive director of the North Flatbush Avenue Business Improvement District in Brooklyn, Richard Russo, said that the fee would have a "debilitating" effect on his small group, whose annual budget of $93,000 is not enough to cover extra security or street lamps. Mr. Russo said he would probably have to stop supplying the plastic shopping bags with the group's slogan, "Serving Diversity," which merchants say helps give an identity to the mile-long shopping strip between Atlantic Avenue and Grand Army Plaza. "We're having difficulty paying for them as it is," he said.
A spokeswoman for the mayor, Sunny Mindel, stressed that the budget process for fiscal year 2002 was still in its early stages. "This is a proposed budget," she said. "As such, everything is up for review. But because the BID's do receive services for free, this is one of the things we're looking at." Among the services the city provides to the business improvement districts are oversight and tax collection, and city officials would not provide further details about the proposed fee.
Richard A. Briffault, the vice dean of Columbia Law School and an authority on business improvement districts, said the administrative fees might be warranted if the money is actually used to expand oversight of the groups to make sure that they are responding to property owners' needs. "It wouldn't be appropriate if this was just a way of raising money," Mr. Briffault said.
Executives of the business groups said the proposed fee caught them off guard, but relations between many of them and the mayor have been strained for several years.
In 1998, Daniel A. Biederman resigned as president of the Grand Central Partnership, the city's largest business improvement district, after Mr. Giuliani accused him of amassing too much power. Mr. Biederman, who has remained president of two other groups, the 34th Street Partnership and the Bryant Park Business Improvement District, would not comment on the plan.
Mr. Giuliani replaced Mr. Biederman at the Grand Central Partnership with Alfred C. Cerullo 3rd, his former commissioner of finance. Other close associates of the mayor are also business improvement district leaders, including David Gmach, the executive director of the 14th Street Business Improvement District, who was a top aide to former Deputy Mayor Randy Mastro, and Lou Carbonetti, the executive director of the Fulton Mall Improvement Association, who is the father of Anthony V. Carbonetti, the mayor's chief of staff.
In 1999, Rudy Washington, the deputy mayor for community development and business services, said the business groups could not justify increasing their assessments because they needlessly duplicated existing city services. Taking issue with such criticism, business group officials say their contributions are obvious. As one example, city officials have talked for years about the need for public toilets. Last month, however, the 34th Street Partnership beat them to it by providing two pay toilets in Greeley Square.

HEADLINE: ON THE CONTRARY; 
How New Campaign Laws Would Help the Economy

BYLINE:  By DANIEL AKST; Daniel Akst's column tilts at conventional business wisdom and appears the first Sunday of each month. E-mail: culmoney@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
TOO many comedians are making fun of George W. Bush's brainpower without any basis for their jibes. Why not give him a little quiz instead? O.K., Mr. President, which of the following would help the economy most?
* A big tax cut skewed toward the rich. 
 * Opening sensitive federal lands to logging and drilling. 
 * Campaign finance reform that would curtail the role of money in politics.
You don't have to be an economist to know the answer. Campaign finance reform is one of the most important things the government can do to improve the long-run economic performance of the United States.
Reducing the influence of money in politics isn't usually considered an economic issue, but it is by far the best of the three choices. Most economists, after all, are justly skeptical of a huge tax cut as a timely economic stimulant, and sacrificing the environment for more cheap oil won't seem like such a good idea when the greenhouse effect turns Wilkes-Barre, Pa., into oceanfront property. 
But just imagine how effectively the economy would hum along if not burdened by the dead weight of the subsidies, tax breaks and market-impeding regulations that arise from the legal influence-peddling known as campaign fund-raising. 
Consider how much better off we would be if American agriculture were freed of the market orders and price supports that the government has piled on over the years to the detriment of competitors and consumers. Or how much more sensible (and less costly) the tort system would be if lawyers could not speak as loudly as they do with their wallets.
Another economic benefit of true campaign finance reform would be a simpler tax code, without so many special breaks for the wealthy. Not only might this make investment decisions more rational, but it could save some of the $125 billion a year that it costs for all American taxpayers to comply with the current arcane rules. That figure is from the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, which estimates that the 4.3 billion hours consumed annually by this miserable task is equivalent to the labor of more than two million people. "The performance of the economy is dramatically affected by the state of tax law," the foundation says. 
But why stop at campaign finance reform? Many other things could be done to bolster the economy without even mentioning a tax cut or consulting Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman.
For one, we could spend more on science. There is strong evidence that research spending -- and having more scientists -- leads to greater economic productivity. Over all, federal research-and-development expenditures are just $83 billion a year. That may sound like a lot, but it is less than a single year's revenue at I.B.M. The budget of the National Institutes of Health is less than 1 percent of total federal outlays.
Speaking of health, how about some kind of national health insurance? Our wasteful and inequitable system is a major drag on the economy, while leaving more than 40 million Americans with no medical insurance at all, according to the Census Bureau. Sooner or later, we will have to embrace some combination of single-buyer purchasing of drugs, market competition and mandatory coverage to keep medical costs from seriously retarding growth. Why not get it over with?
Goading Americans to save more would help, too. Taxing consumption instead of income would encourage earning and investing, and we should reconsider the multiple taxes now levied on income. Corporations pay taxes on their profits, while we pay taxes on the ensuing dividends and capital gains.
The rich want us to change that, but in return we should sharply limit the deductibility of home mortgage interest, which, as constituted, benefits mainly them. This deduction is responsible for America's gross overinvestment in housing; if people did not have a huge tax incentive to buy giant homes (which they are often too busy to spend any time in), their capital might find its way instead into new plant and equipment that could increase productivity and national wealth. 
FINALLY, in the category of "pin the externality on the donkey," why not discourage dangerous cars by making sure that owners of sport utility vehicles somehow pay for the pollution and highway carnage they cause? After all, the lives we save may be economically productive ones.
And Mr. President, there is a bonus. Adopt any of these measures, and maybe, just maybe, the late-night comics will ease up a little. At least the economists won't be laughing.

In God We Trust. In Government We Hope for the Best

BYLINE:  By LAURIE GOODSTEIN 

 BODY:
ON his radio show last week, Jay Sekulow said he was swamped with calls from listeners around the country eager to talk about President Bush's new initiative to funnel government dollars and support to religious social service programs.
 Mr. Sekulow's audience consists largely of conservative Christians, and he is chief counsel of the American Center for Law and Justice, a frequent adversary of the A.C.L.U. His listeners are those most likely to applaud Mr. Bush for opening the government's coffers to church charities. So what were they concerned about? 
 The separation of church and state.
Many Americans are indeed enthusiastic about stepping up government support to religious programs so they can better tackle seemingly intractable social problems. But, as polls indicate, across the political spectrum Americans are wary of anything that appears to tamper with the First Amendment. Those on the left worry about religion meddling with government. Those on the right, like Mr. Sekulow's callers, worry about government meddling with religion. 
Americans may not be able to recite the amendment, or perhaps even explain it, but they are instinctively uncomfortable when their government appears to promote one religion over another, or allows discrimination based on religion, or interferes in the freedom of a church or synagogue or mosque. If executed carelessly, Mr. Bush's plan could spring all three of those traps.
"This is an area that is filled with land mines," said Mark Penn, a Democratic pollster. "Looking at public opinion data, it could be summed up as 'Yes, but don't go too far.' "
Yet, by devoting Week 2 of his presidency to creating a new White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, President Bush is betting that most Americans care more about helping poor people than they do about the First Amendment. The conventional wisdom in the White House is that the only people alarmed about a potential breach in the divide between church and state will be aggressive civil libertarians, some agnostic Ivy League professors and liberal editorial writers.
So, as the plan was rolled out last week, the White House did not articulate clear answers to many of the questions the proposal had provoked. By Thursday, Mr. Bush sought to assure the public, saying at a prayer breakfast, "As president, I'm interested in what is constitutional, and I'm interested in what works."
To address the perception that he is championing primarily evangelical Christian programs, the president said: "We do not impose any religion. We welcome all religions," a stance that raised the specter of government funding for the Nation of Islam's prison programs, which triggered a strong letter from a major Jewish organization, the Anti-Defamation League.
In theory, Americans like the idea of expanding the reach of religious social services. Mr. Bush pushed it in his presidential campaign. He was tapping into the widespread hope that spiritual approaches can succeed where secular ones have failed in helping the homeless, welfare recipients, prisoners, addicts and wayward teenagers. If a heroin addict can be cured with prayer, Americans say, let him pray. Like Mr. Bush, they are interested in what works.
ANNA GREENBERG, an assistant professor of public policy who studies American attitudes toward religion at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, said: "Americans are basically moderate. They will say, 'I see nothing wrong with religion being part of our public life and values. I just don't want anyone to tell me how to worship or to tell other people how to worship.' "
A poll conducted in November by Public Agenda, a nonprofit research group, asked more than 1,500 Americans whether it was a good idea to increase government financing for religious groups that help the homeless and drug addicts. Forty-four percent said it was a good idea, even if the programs promoted religious messages; 23 percent said it was a good idea, but only if programs avoided religious messages; and 31 percent said it was a bad idea. 
The cornerstone of the president's plan is that religious programs will not be required to censor their religious teachings in order to receive government contracts. The source for this, too, is in the First Amendment -- that government shall not prohibit religious expression.
So, for example, while Mr. Bush was governor of Texas, the state gave $8,000 to a job training program that required students to study Scripture and taught them that accepting Jesus Christ as their savior would help prepare them for employment. 
The state of Texas and now the White House say funding fundamentally religious programs like this is fine if they can show results, and if clients have alternatives. The rub is in the reality. The job training program in Texas was the only one in the county, said James Harrington of the Texas Civil Rights Project, a nonprofit group suing the state on constitutional grounds.
"The county had only enough money for one job training program, so these unemployed people would have had to drive 60 miles if they didn't like the Christian program," said Mr. Harrington. "The alternative wasn't down the street. You had to go to the next county."
Americans are likely to be uneasy about scenarios like that, said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster. "It has to do with their sense of whether or not the services will be provided fairly, and with whether or not people have other options. They don't in general like it when religious institutions are the only choice, because if you don't like that religion, you've got no place else to go."
Several pollsters explained that Americans answer questions about First Amendment issues differently when the implications are spelled out. Asked if they support school prayer, a resounding number say yes. Asked if the school board or a teacher should tell their child when and how to pray, the same people say no.
The Public Agenda survey found that only 19 percent of respondents said schools should avoid sponsoring prayers entirely. The rest broke down this way: 53 percent said it would be best if schools would mandate not prayer, but a moment of silence; 20 percent wanted students to recite a prayer that refers to God; and only 6 percent said they wanted a prayer that mentions Jesus. Given that more than 80 percent of the American population is Christian, that is a strong hint that people do not want even their own creed set as a standard.
Finally, the White House may face opposition from those Americans who believe the separation of church and state is good for the church.
As Cal Thomas, the conservative columnist, wrote last week, "What concerns me is that religious organizations might be tempted, or forced, to dilute their life-transforming message to get government subsidies, thus negating the primary reason for their success. They also risk becoming an appendage of the party in power."
Americans will allow Mr. Bush to experiment, but they will be watching closely to see if he crosses constitutional boundaries.

HEADLINE: The Mayor's Book Deal 

 BODY:
It is disappointing that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has become the second New York politician in little more than a month to enter into a compromising book deal. Although the mayor's hefty $3 million advance from Talk Miramax Books, a subsidiary of the Walt Disney Company, does not match Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's recent $8 million contract with a publishing subsidiary of Viacom to write her memoir, it raises similar concerns. Both authors should have declined to accept large up-front payments while still in office, as such payments can too easily be seen as bids for favorable treatment. Instead, they should have limited themselves to royalties on books actually sold, a better indication that they are being paid what their books have earned. 
 The best course of all for Mr. Giuliani, since he has only 11 months left in his term, would have been to wait until he was out of office to sign a contract. Such restraint would have been an example for others and more in keeping with the mayor's emphasis on high standards for public officials. 
 In agreeing to accept a large advance to write two volumes, a memoir and a how-to guide to city management, the mayor has put himself in a financial relationship with an entertainment conglomerate whose varied business interests regularly require action or approval by City Hall or city agencies. Mr. Giuliani's pledge that he will stay away from matters relating to Disney is plainly necessary under the circumstances. But it is an inadequate antidote given the possibility of favoritism when officials below his level decide on economic assistance, filming permits or other discretionary favors the Disney Company might seek. 
The mayor, like Mrs. Clinton, is refusing to reveal the entire contents of his contract, including the size and timing of his advance payments. That sort of stonewalling is unacceptable from a mayor in a position to bestow favors on the very corporate interests that have now agreed to make him wealthy. The advance offered to Mr. Giuliani would be prohibited if he were a member of the House of Representatives. But it is not barred by city ethics rules -- a gap that obviously needs addressing before the next mayor takes office in January 2002.
Meanwhile, we hope that Mr. Giuliani's old prosecutor's passion for elevating the ethical standards of government will re-emerge and that he will see the civic need to renounce any advance. He should instead limit his payments to royalties on actual book sales when his epics finally appear. That will be after he leaves office -- and is no longer in a position to help the Disney Company.

HEADLINE: Gas-Rich Desert Will Test Bush Resolve 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: ROCK SPRINGS, Wyo., Jan. 31 

 BODY:
As a test of the new approach that President Bush has pledged on public lands, a good gauge will be what happens north of here, across an enormous, unfenced swath of high desert prized both for its rugged beauty and for the natural gas that lies beneath.
 For four years, the land, known as the Jack Morrow Hills, has been off limits to energy exploration, while the Bureau of Land Management tried to come up with a plan to balance conservation and development. Just before leaving office, the Clinton administration rejected one proposal and, in an extraordinary step, ordered that a new plan give top priority to conservation goals. 
 But now the fate of the Jack Morrow Hills is in the hands of a Bush administration that is giving top priority to closing what it contends is a big gap in the nation's energy supply. And in a region where most people live off what is pulled from the ground, many people say they hope the final decision will help to reverse a wave of government action that, in President Bill Clinton's final month, put scores of millions of acres of federal land out of reach to mining, logging and drilling. 
"To just lock up the land and have it for the sake of saying it's out there doesn't make a lot of sense to me," John W. Hay III, president of the Rock Springs National Bank and head of the local cattlemen's association, said. "But we have a change in administrations, and my guess is that we will have some rational people who see that there is room for multiple use." Across the West, many of Mr. Bush's allies have disparaged Mr. Clinton's approach as amounting to a land grab, and the new president himself has made plain his view that his predecessor overreached. At least some of the land that Mr. Clinton ordered protected, Mr. Bush said in a pre-inauguration interview, should be reassigned to allow development if it could be done in an environmentally sensitive way.
With an eye toward possible reversals, the new administration is reviewing all of Mr. Clinton's last-minute actions, including rules that banned logging and road building across nearly a third of the nation's national forest land and orders that created more than a dozen national monuments.
But rather than mount an across-the-board challenge, people who have been watching the process say, Mr. Bush is most likely to make his stand in places like the Jack Morrow Hills, where overturning the Clinton approach would be relatively easy and where development could clearly serve energy needs.
"A former secretary of the interior told the B.L.M. to go back to the drawing board, and the new secretary of the interior can say heck no," said Johanna Wald, a lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council, which is among the organizations campaigning to keep the Clinton protections in place.
At stake in the Jack Morrow Hills, Ms. Wald and others contend, is not just energy, but the fate of a vast habitat that environmental groups prefer to call the red desert, an area of shifting sand dunes, red rocks and soaring buttes that is home to some of North America's largest herds of desert elk, antelope and wild horses.
A substantial part of the area's 600,000 acres has a high likelihood of containing significant natural gas supplies, the Bureau of Land Management study concluded last June. But many nearby areas are already being drilled, and environmental advocates contend that any benefits of exploration in the hills will be outweighed by the certain costs of interfering with a fragile habitat.
"It's an oxymoron to say that you can make an oil well environmentally sensitive," said Tom Bell, a local historian who is a leader among those who have fought for years to gain better protection for the area.
Only six weeks ago, one of the Clinton administration's final actions had environmental campaigners who believe the land should be permanently protected from development hoping that they had finally won their battle. In contravening a draft plan by the federal Bureau of Land Management, which recommended that the Jack Morrow Hills be reopened to limited oil and gas exploration, the departing interior secretary, Bruce Babbitt, ordered in a Dec. 22 memorandum that the top priority in a revised proposal should be conservation.
"The presence of finite mineral resources should not deprive future generations of the natural and aesthetic wonders of the Great Divide Basin," Mr. Babbitt wrote in the directive, in which he instructed that "an appropriate decision will be made to protect this unique area and its outstanding resources."
The Bush administration has not signaled whether it intends to overrule that directive. But Mr. Bush and his deputies, including Vice President Dick Cheney, a Wyoming native, have said that decisions about public lands should keep in mind the need to meet a surge in the demand for natural gas, the cleanest of the fossil fuels.
At least 95 percent of the power plants under construction will be fueled by natural gas, and in large part for that reason a 1999 study by the National Petroleum Council predicted that American demand for natural gas would increase by about 30 percent by 2010, with much of the new supply to come from the Rocky Mountain regions like Wyoming, which is soon to outpace Texas as the country's leading producer of natural gas.
As across the West, a vast majority of Wyoming land believed to shelter new reserves of oil and gas is owned by the federal government, so the Bush administration's decisions about access are bound to have a direct impact on energy supplies. In the Rockies, according to the 1999 study -- which was commissioned by the Energy Department -- about 137 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, or 10 percent of the country's total reserves, is available only subject to federal restrictions.
And in Rock Springs, a city of 20,000 whose economy is almost entirely dependent on oil, gas, coal and a mineral known as trona, the dominant view is that any costs of energy development will be far outweighed by the benefits. "You can keep the habitat and you can go after the resources without affecting people's livelihood," said Shane Heavin, a roughneck who was driving over the frozen sand dunes one recent morning to check on some of the few dozen oil and gas wells in in operation.
Those who believe that energy development and the natural habitat can coexist point to the desert elk herd that is at least five times bigger now than when oil and gas exploration began about 1950. Now, scattered pipelines are visible across the desert sands and isolated wells stand out as industrial islands in the landscape, but advocates of renewed drilling say that goal and nature can easily coexist.
"Our analysis has basically shown that we can balance oil and gas production and providing habitat for elk," said John S. McKee, the director of the local Bureau of Land Management office, whose analysis was overruled by Mr. Babbitt. With an air of criticism, Mr. McKee described Mr. Babbitt's memo as "not normal," but added: "That was an order from the secretary, and whether it can be undone, I won't speculate on."
Others in Wyoming have been more vehement in their denunciations. "He was telling us what the outcome should be before anyone had done the analysis, and that's not scientific," Dru Brower, a vice president of the Petroleum Association of Wyoming, said.
For the oil and gas industry, the history of decisions on public lands in the Rockies under the Clinton administration was mostly a chronicle of defeat.
An effort by the Marathon Oil Company to develop gas reserves on federal lands across a vast area of northern Colorado was rejected at the last minute by the Bureau of Land Management, whose decision was upheld in 1999 by the Supreme Court. In 1997, a local forest service official put off limits the entire Lewis and Clark National Forest in Montana, along an energy-rich area known as the Rocky Mountain Front.
Mr. Clinton went a big step further with the forest-protection plan, made final in early January, that barred new road building and logging across nearly 60 million acres of national forest. That plan did not prohibit new drilling, and it allowed energy operations to stay in place, but industry officials say that its effect in terms of access will be to all but prevent new oil and gas operations.
Even more severe in its impact, the officials say, has been Mr. Clinton's decision to use his executive power to establish national monuments in states like Utah, Colorado, Idaho and Montana, giving those areas a status that carries with it a virtual prohibition on oil and gas exploration.
An unusual deal struck in the 1950's, in negotiations surrounding the establishment of Grand Teton National Park, has established Wyoming as one of only two states (the other is Alaska) in which a president cannot use his power under the Antiquities Act of 1906 to unilaterally designate a national monument. If it were not for that prohibition, people close to Mr. Babbitt say, the interior secretary would have almost certainly recommended that Mr. Clinton protect the Jack Morrow Hills by making it a monument, just as he did in his final weeks in office in protecting places like the Missouri Breaks in Montana, along a 149-mile stretch of the Missouri River, giving them a status that can be reversed only by a Congressional vote. Without that power in Wyoming, Mr. Babbitt and the Clinton administration resorted to an authority that can be much more easily overturned, leaving the door open for a possible reversal by Gale A. Norton, the new interior secretary.
"You can't have Wyoming be a pristine, untouched area and still be a major natural gas producer," said Russell L. Kirlin, the regional manager for Questar, a natural gas company. "You have to decide what you want."

HEADLINE: Convention Town 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "The Con Con: No Solution? No Problem," by John Tierney (Big City column, Jan. 30):
 The Jacob K. Javits Convention Center ranks 17th in size in North America -- only a third of the convention space in Chicago and less than even Cleveland or Rosemont, Ill. 
Ouch! 
 Despite this bleak fact, New York City is set to welcome 39 million visitors in 2001, a 35 percent jump from 1996. These guests are pumping more than $23 billion a year into our city, representing $3,200 for every city resident and 277,000 jobs. 
As to profitability of conventions, delegates spent $2.2 billion in 1999, and according to Trade Show Week, convention business is growing, not dwindling. Imagine the infusion of out-of-town dollars if we could increase convention capacity. 
Furthermore, trade shows are booked up to eight years in advance, cushioning the city from any future and much-predicted economic downturn. 
We need to get started now.

HEADLINE: Tax Cuts for Today 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Medicine for the Economy" (editorial, Feb. 1):
 The purpose of a tax cut in the face of risks of recession this year should be to support personal incomes and economic growth this year, not to match hypothetical revenues to spending needs over the decade ahead. 
Cutting taxes mainly for the sweet hereafter could actually delay private spending plans and make our immediate economic problems worse. 
 Congressional Democrats should favor a substantial, but near-term, tax cut whose benefits flow mainly to working families. The proper way to limit the scope of tax cuts for the long term is to phase them down over time, knowing that future Congresses can extend them if needed. The basic structure of estate, capital gains and progressive income taxes at the federal level should be left alone.

HEADLINE: Here's to Bad Times 

BYLINE:  By David Callahan; David Callahan, research director at Demos, a public policy organization, is co-editor of "Quality of Life 2000: The New Politics of Work, Family and Community."

 BODY:
Consumer confidence is plummeting and companies are cutting back, but I, for one, am not mourning. The 90's boom left me both financially battered and psychically troubled, and I don't think I'm alone. As the economy has slowed, I'll confess that my main reaction has been relief.
 In the past five years, while the New York economy surged, the rent on my apartment in Manhattan nearly doubled. I've hung on, but barely. New York has become less and less affordable for middle-class people like me who don't happen to work on Wall Street or in corporate law firms. One-bedroom apartments are hard to find for less than $2,500 a month. And ownership seems impossible: in the last quarter of 2000, the average sale price of a co-op or condo in Manhattan below 96th Street was $787,708 -- up from $395,035 in 1990. 
 Total wages and salaries for workers in the city, meanwhile, increased by only 19 percent between 1989 and 1998, according to the Fiscal Policy Institute. Low-income workers experienced the smallest gains. And as rising real estate prices have sent middle-class New Yorkers into poorer areas, those a rung or two lower on the economic ladder have been pushed aside. Many low-income people are now doubled or tripled up in conditions that Jacob Riis would recognize. Others are rent-poor, forced to choose every month between food, rent and medicine.
New York is not alone. You might make good money at Yahoo, but try buying a house in Silicon Valley, where groups of computer programmers share ranch houses while janitors live in garages or sleep on buses.
Commercial rents went skyward in the 90's, too, with devastating effects on nonprofit organizations in many cities. The good times have been anything but good if you run a dance school, a theater or a public service organization with a lease that expired in the past two years in one of the places plugged into the new economy.
Now, one thing looks certain: real estate costs will come down. It's happening already in Manhattan. For renters and prospective home buyers like me, whose jobs are secure, that means the cooling economy has tangible financial benefits. To be sure, I feel bad for the swelling ranks of people who have been laid off. But until we find a way to share the country's wealth more equitably during boom times and make sure that income gains aren't wiped out by rising costs in housing and health care, it's hard to get too excited about surges in national prosperity.
There is a larger solace, too, in the signs of recession. The economy of the late 1990's offered the promise of such extraordinary wealth that it inevitably brought out the worst in people. Materialistic values came to pervade our culture. The ideal of working hard over many years to achieve wealth lost traction. The pressure to pursue wealth instead of other goals grew enormously as the media focused on those winning big in the new economy. It became easy to feel that missing the gold rush was plain stupid.
I've seen the resulting distortion of values everywhere in Generation X -- my generation -- and in those coming after it. It's hard to stick to a goal related to something other than money -- working at an artistically creative or socially useful job, for example -- if you can't afford to rent a one-bedroom apartment. It is even harder when everybody else seems to be getting rich and there's no support in the mass culture for your choice. Who wants to be a schoolteacher when you can be a millionaire?
No, I won't miss the boom. I won't miss the killer rent increases or the news stories about the latest dot-com billionaire or the feeling that I'm a fool for working in the nonprofit sector. As I see it, the good times are coming, not going.

HEADLINE: New Economy; 
Two pioneers in the study of e-business are creating a new cyberlab. And no one is calling them crazy anymore.

BYLINE:  By John Schwartz 

 BODY:
IT'S not every business professor whose photo appears on the lusty Web site Am I Hot or Not. The site (www.amihotornot .com) invites men and women to send in photos for all the online world to see. Viewers then rate each entry for its sex appeal.
 So what is that picture of Prof. Donna L. Hoffman of Vanderbilt's Owen Graduate School of Management doing there? Actually, her husband and partner in research, Prof. Thomas P. Novak, posted it -- not out of some kinky exhibitionist urge, but because he wanted to see how visitors to the oddly compelling site responded to a variety of images. It's what makes Ms. Hoffman and Mr. Novak such dogged investigators of all things Netly: they love to fiddle with the online medium. 
 Ms. Hoffman notes with a laugh that her rating on the site is rather low -- less than a 3 out of a possible 10. But what does that "Baywatch"-besotted crowd know? 
Within their field of research, Ms. Hoffman and Mr. Novak are, in fact, about as hot as it gets. And now they are about to embark on a new venture that could raise the temperature higher still: Vanderbilt is helping underwrite a new "eLab," a center proposed by Ms. Hoffman and Mr. Novak that will give researchers a chance to study the way people interact with Web sites as they surf. If it works, the eLab could be the first research tool to really get at what makes people tick -- and click -- online.
The new venture reflects years of frustration with trying to make sense of the Net. Ms. Hoffman and Mr. Novak were among the first college professors to recognize that Internet-based business could be a legitimate field of study, and in 1994 they established the first graduate business school e-commerce research program, Project 2000. 
They had been on the Internet for years already in those clunky days before the World Wide Web made online exploration so easy. When they downloaded the earliest browser, Mosaic, in 1993, "it was amazing," Ms. Hoffman recalled. "It was goose bumps, and you're jumping and your adrenaline's pumping," she said. 
They started thinking about how to apply their academic training in consumer psychology and methods of measuring consumer behavior to the new medium. The Internet opened a new field in which to test their statistical tools, and Ms. Hoffman said they had the freedom of pioneers to wander and to experiment: "We said, 'This is what we're going to study -- we've found it. This is how we can make an impact on society.' "
Although other scholars would also end up producing excellent research on e-business, Ms. Hoffman recalls that at the time many colleagues ridiculed her and Mr. Novak as fad chasers.
These days, Ms. Hoffman and Mr. Novak seem to be the ones laughing. Their program got the attention of some of the best-known companies in the online and offline worlds as business tried to get its own brain around the Internet. Paul Allen, the Microsoft co-founder, financed research, as did Sun Microsystems and CDNow.
While they were doing groundbreaking research, they were also making headlines. When Time magazine published an ill-advised cover story in 1995 about pornography on the Internet, relying heavily on a study by an undergraduate at Carnegie Mellon University, Ms. Hoffman's exacting analysis of both the report and the Time article showed them to be deeply flawed. The magazine partly retracted the story, based largely on the Hoffman critique.
When the Carnegie Mellon study nonetheless provided ammunition for lawmakers who passed the Communications Decency Act in 1996, Ms. Hoffman once again stepped into the fight by criticizing the law in testimony before a panel of federal judges in Philadelphia. When the court struck down the act as an unconstitutional restriction of First Amendment rights, the judges cited Ms. Hoffman's testimony. Since then, Ms. Hoffman and Mr. Novak have weighed in on various big issues, including arguments over the true size of the Internet and the width of the so-called digital divide between the rich and the poor. 
The new eLab will help Ms. Hoffman and Mr. Novak realize their vision of rigorous research on the virtual world. Vanderbilt has put up $1.05 million to start the program, and the researchers hope to raise $20 million to keep it going. 
Once the program is set up, possibly by the fall semester, the students and researchers will create Web sites that will be open to the outside world. As visitors wander through the sites, their actions will be closely monitored, with small changes to the sites to see reactions. It is exactly the kind of research that Ms. Hoffman would have loved to conduct with the corporations she has worked with over the years. But no real business could stand by while a college professor tinkered with the store, no more than Wal-Mart would let a researcher rearrange half of its aisles. 
Eventually, Ms. Hoffman suggests, the eLab might even sell products so that researchers can come face to face with one of the biggest issues in e-commerce: why do so many people study and gather goods online and then simply walk away from their virtual shopping carts without buying?
In the language of research, Ms. Hoffman is taking the world of market experimentation and moving from a controlled environment to something that more closely resembles a field experiment: watching how things happen in the real world.
That path, while enticing, could hold dangers, said Andrew B. Whinston. He is director of the Center for Research in Electronic Commerce at the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin -- another highly regarded institution that studies online business. Without commenting directly on the Vanderbilt eLab, Mr. Whinston said his students had done Internet research in a more closed-environment online lab with a known population of visitors, meaning "the factors that you want to study are very much under your control."
Isn't opening a new center to study the Internet in the middle of the dot-com bust a classic example of bad timing? Not at all, says the Vanderbilt business school's dean, William G. Christie. Now is the time to take a deep breath and figure out how to come up with proper business models and smart commercial behavior, he said.
"E-commerce is here to stay," Mr. Christie added, "and now it's time to do it correctly. ELab will help people do that."
Ms. Hoffman isn't talking yet about what the first Web sites will be in her virtual virtual world. But she's willing to give one tantalizing hint: one might be modeled, to a degree, on Am I Hot or Not.

Hallmark's 99-cent cards, for those who don't care quite enough to send the very best, sell well.

BYLINE:  By Patricia Winters Lauro 

 BODY:
MARITA WESELY-CLOUGH of Hallmark Cards Inc. knew she was onto something when she saw garage sales proliferating in affluent suburbs and heard teenagers bragging about great deals at discount stores.
 Recognizing that America loves a good deal ultimately led Hallmark to introduce a successful line of 99-cent cards called Warm Wishes that are simple, direct messages in economical greeting cards designed mostly for casual relationships. 
 The Warm Wishes line is just one example of how Hallmark keeps close watch on cultural trends and then takes those insights and transforms them into greeting cards. It is similar to the way advertising agencies identify emerging moods and feelings in society and then use that information to design advertising. Like advertising, greeting cards have to immediately connect with consumers by capturing a tone of voice, a language and a mood that resonates, explains John Beeder, vice president of marketing greeting cards at Hallmark. 
The irony and sarcasm captured in commercials like last month's E*Trade spot on the Super Bowl that sent up dot-com failures or Budweiser's "What are you doing?" commercial making fun of yuppies trying to do "Whassup?" is also popular in many Hallmark greeting cards. One example is the ornery "Maxine" character known for her cynical, yet offbeat view on life, who has become so popular that Hallmark is about to start an entire line of Maxine cards and licensed merchandise.
The trick for Hallmark -- and the same for agencies and marketers everywhere -- is to capture the emerging trends as they gain acceptance in mainstream culture. Nothing dates a commercial faster than last year's buzz word or fashion, and the same is true in a greeting card.
To prevent that, Hallmark employs Ms. Wesely-Clough, officially the director of creative strategy development at Hallmark, a privately held company based in Kansas City, Mo., but she is also the company's chief trends analyst. She and her two-person staff make forecasts and synthesize them into reports that are widely distributed throughout Hallmark to be used by designers, writers and marketing executives for new cards and other products.
Looking into her crystal ball for 2001, Ms. Wesely-Clough sees a continuing consumer demand for a good deal. That's one reason Warm Wishes became the nation's sixth most successful new nonfood product last year, according to Information Resources Inc., which said that thousands of new products come out every year.
"It's now considered sophisticated and savvy to find the best deal at the lowest price," said Ms. Wesely-Clough. 
Hallmark also forecasts a backlash against the 1990's penchant for over-sizing everything, from super-sized fast food to oversized furniture. "People are overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of it all," said Ms. Wesely-Clough.
Experiential marketing -- where retailers offer "transformational experiences" that leave consumers rejuvenated or emotionally moved -- is also hot. 
"Super-shocks" in entertainment and media will continue, Ms. Wesely-Clough predicts, as extreme sports like the XFL, over-the-top adventure movies and reality-based television shows like "Survivor" proliferate. Shock is one way to get attention in an over-commercialized world, she said.
And in a new twist, Hallmark sees a bit of a backlash against America's celebrity culture. Instead, the company has identified a need among people to find ordinary role models and is starting a card line that rewards "everyday heroes" like firefighters, teachers and volunteers. That trend is already under way in advertising, which seems to be using fewer celebrities.
"Americans yearn to recognize the ones who step up and volunteer, who come through with no monetary gain in sight -- ordinary people doing extraordinary things," Ms. Wesely-Clough said.
Ms. Wesely-Clough and her staff come upon these insights by traveling, reading, visiting museums, going to trade shows and art exhibits, closely watching advertising and, always, talking to people, she said. The research is then checked out by Hallmark's business research department, which uses more formal, quantitative tests such as random sampling to understand consumer's feelings. For instance, while Ms. Wesely-Clough was seeing a penchant for steals and deals in America, the company's business research department found consumers were looking for casual cards using informal language to give to people to whom they were not particularly close, said Jay Dittmann, Hallmark's business research vice president.
"It's not just that the lower price is appropriate," said Mr. Dittmann. "It's been so popular because the message is on target with what people want to say."
Indeed, it's often been said that advertising reflects society, and so do greeting cards. "I think both Hallmark and its main competitor, American Greetings, both do a good job of knowing what people want," said Sheldon Grodsky, president of Grodsky & Associates, securities analysts based in South Orange, N.J. "It's a bit of a guessing game. Still there's a lot of art involved."
Common Threads, which features a fusion of ethnic influences, was introduced in 1997 after Hallmark noticed that multiculturalism was spreading rapidly through the country's heartland. In the 1980's, when one celebrity after the next announced an addiction and subsequent recoveries, Hallmark saw that the topic was becoming acceptable to discuss, and began a line of recovery and rehabilitation cards. Last year, it started a complete line of cards for what are known as blended families, created by second and third marriages. 
Of course, Hallmark has had its misses. Divorce cards to name one example. Hallmark offered its first divorce card in the 1950's, and it bombed. America wasn't ready. Then in the "go-go" 1980's, with real estate and stock prices booming, Hallmark tried again, this time with a line of humorous divorce cards, but consumers found them too light for such a serious issue. The divorce cards that sell well now are more often expressions of support, said Rachel Bolton, Hallmark's spokeswoman.
So advertisers take note, if you want to know what is acceptable in American society, take a look at a greeting card.

HEADLINE: Patents; 
Many companies will forgopatents in an effort to safeguard their trade secrets.

BYLINE:  By Sabra Chartrand 

 BODY:
A COUPLE who bought their house nearly 30 years ago from Harland Sanders, founder of Kentucky Fried Chicken, learned last week that a handwritten note they discovered in their basement in 1999 did not reveal Mr. Sanders's famous secret recipe. 
 While the couple, Tommy and Cherry Settle, of Shelbyville, Ky., may have been disappointed that the scribbled list of 11 herbs and spices was not the legendary fried chicken formula, they were probably relieved to escape a lawsuit initiated by the KFC Corporation, owner of the chicken fast-food chain. 
 The Settles had asked KFC, which is owned by Tricon Global Restaurants Inc., to authenticate the note so they could auction it. Instead, the company sued to stop any sale. But after examining the note, KFC announced it was "nowhere close" to the 62-year-old secret recipe and dropped the lawsuit. 
If KFC's initial reaction seemed harsh, that is because the Colonel's Original Recipe, as it is known by trademark, is locked in a company safe and treated as a closely guarded trade secret. The ingredients are said to be known only to a handful of employees who have signed confidentiality pledges.
As with Coca-Cola's syrup formula or the McDonald's Big Mac special sauce, the secrecy surrounding the recipe has become an inherent part of its value. And that means a company like KFC has the law on its side in defending its trade secret -- and plenty of incentive to protect the mystery that has become one if its most valuable assets. 
The recipe, like many other business practices, resources or products, is intellectual property. But it is the kind of property that is better served as a trade secret than as a patent or copyright. That is because a trade secret can grant proprietary rights in perpetuity, or for as long as the owner is able to maintain the secrecy. A patent, on the other hand, has a shelf life of 20 years from the time an application is filed. And while a trade secret can remain an enigma, a patent application requires the inventor to describe exactly how his invention works.
Trade secrets can include an intangible process, technique or method. A trade secret can be a quantifiable design, composition, formula or pattern. It can be a physical device or mechanism. Chemical formulas, manufacturing processes or business information can be considered trade secrets.
And even if the ingredients in a chemical recipe like a soft drink syrup or fried chicken batter are discovered, the ratios involved or the way they are combined can remain a trade secret.
The KFC recipe is one of the more famous trade secrets. But such intangible assets are an increasingly important part of the United States economy, especially in the areas of telecommunications, software and biotechnology. A source code or biochemical formula can be as valuable to a company today as minerals or real estate were a generation ago. 
And while the digital age has revolutionized business practices, it has also created new ways to steal or transfer trade secrets that can be easily scanned, copied and downloaded. 
To protect trade secrets, many owners deliberately choose not to patent their ideas, since patent applications must include an explanation of how to make and use the invention. 
The advantage of applying for a patent, of course, is that in return for such disclosure the inventor wins a patent that he can use to stop anyone from infringing on his idea.
And until last year, inventors could rely on the Patent and Trademark Office to keep a patent application secret until it was granted. If the application was rejected, the invention remained confidential.
But last year, the United States initiated a new practice of publishing patent applications 18 months after they are filed.
Anyone who makes commercial use of a trade secret and later decides to apply for a patent must do so within a year. After that, the invention is no longer eligible for a patent. An idea can, however, have a copyright and also be a trade secret. The United States Copyright Office allows material to be divided so that some parts can be revealed while others are kept secret.
Since trade secrets are intellectual property, courts have ruled that software algorithms, customer lists, financial data, Wall Street formulas, names of suppliers and even blueprints can qualify. What makes them unique as intellectual property is the economic value derived from their being kept secret, and corporations have been known to spend millions to defend them.
Or forsake millions. In the 1970's, Coca-Cola withdrew from India rather than comply with a law in that country that would have compelled the soft drink manufacturer to transfer technology -- in this case, its syrup formula -- to an Indian-owned company.
There are disadvantages to trade secrets, compared with patents, because just about anything can be analyzed, reverse-engineered and copied. And patents and trade secrets are not equals in a courtroom; patents are accepted as valid, whereas trade secrets must be authenticated first.
To defend a trade secret under most states' laws, the owner has to show that a reasonable effort has been made to maintain the secrecy. Companies can require employees, suppliers and subcontractors to sign nondisclosure, confidentiality or noncompete agreements. They can divide a process or formula among workers, making sure that no one has knowledge of the entire secret. 
In most cases, the courts look at how many people inside and outside a business know about the secret, what kind of precautions the owner takes to preserve the secrecy, the value the owner gains against his competitors from holding the secret, and how much trouble and expense someone else would incur to crack the secret.
Patents, trademarks and copyrights fall under federal law, but trade secrets are covered by state law. That practice can be traced to the 19th century, when common law protected trade secrets. Most states have adopted specific laws since then, which differ from place to place, though a few still use common law. In 1996, the Economic Espionage Act made theft of trade secrets a federal crime.
Despite the increasing importance of trade secrets to world economies, there is no global law on trade secrets, or even a universal definition of a trade secret. Patents, copyrights and trademarks are addressed in comprehensive international legal treaties; trade secrets are not included. What can be protected as a trade secret differs from country to country and, in some nations, trade secrets have no legal standing at all.
Global "harmonization" of intellectual property laws has been a top American policy priority in recent years, but trade secrets are still at a disadvantage. Germany and Japan require public trials for lawsuits, for example, and anyone seeking redress must first reveal his trade secret. In other countries, confidential data is revealed when submitted for government review of safety or effectiveness. 
Back in Kentucky, the Settles said they had not asked KFC for any money, but only wanted the company to authenticate the recipe they found in their basement. But secrecy plays a a substantial role at KFC.
The company most certainly would have persisted in its lawsuit, despite the availability of countless recipes claiming to mimic the fast-food chain's products. An online recipe archive at the University of California at Berkeley has a search category called "the Kentucky Fried Chicken Copycat Recipes area," which features one titled "The Colonel's Secret."

HEADLINE: Ecuador's Use of Dollars Brings Dollars' Problems 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: QUITO, Ecuador, Jan. 27 

 BODY:
A year ago, the government announced that it was abandoning the sucre as the national currency and adopting the American dollar as the solution to its chronic economic problems. While the promised benefits have been slow to arrive for ordinary Ecuadoreans, the move has proved an unexpected boon to two very dangerous groups: drug traffickers and counterfeiters in neighboring Colombia. 
 Colombia, the world's largest source not only of cocaine but also of bogus American currency, produces 40 percent of the fake dollars worldwide, American officials say. Almost overnight, its counterfeiters were presented with a new market of 12.5 million people right on their doorstep. Not ones to miss an opportunity, they cranked up the presses. 
 Now, as other Latin American countries also switch to the dollar -- El Salvador did on Jan. 1 and Guatemala will on May 1 -- the problem of counterfeiting is expected to grow, American officials say. And the move to the dollar is only likely to accelerate as negotiations with the United States for a hemispheric trade agreement progress, with several other small Central American and Caribbean nations reportedly considering the switch. 
"There is just a lot more counterfeit currency circulating in Latin America right now, and a lot of it has to do with the fact that countries like Ecuador are now accepting the dollar," said Alex Echo, supervisor of the international team at the Miami office of the United States Secret Service. "The Colombians are a tough adversary who keep up with the latest technology to improve their product and put out a lot of currency, so you can only catch so much of it." 
Before Ecuador adopted the dollar, Mr. Echo explained, "you had to go to an exchange house to get dollars, and the people there were very good at spotting fakes because it was their livelihood." But now "everyone has to accept dollars, and a lot of people just do not have that trained eye," he added. 
As a result, "our seizures have gone up in the region, and that's natural," Mr. Echo added. "The populace needs to get used to the new currency, and it is going to be a little while before everyone feels comfortable." 
American officials say the chances that any counterfeit currency circulating here will leak back into the United States are slim, because American bank personnel are expert at detecting fakes. But dollarization in Latin America is nonetheless proving a challenge, confronting American officials with "a lot of factors that you'd never see in a classroom," a Treasury official acknowledged. 
For Ecuador, adopting the dollar was a way of imposing strict fiscal discipline, in effect by turning monetary policy over to the United States Federal Reserve Board. Other nations are considering the shift for similar reasons. But the increasing circulation of bogus money has proved an unanticipated complication, with the Colombians quickly learning how to reproduce even the new design of American bills, which was first implemented in 1996 largely to thwart counterfeiting. 
Until Ecuador unexpectedly took the leap to the dollar, which led to the overthrow of President Jamil Mahuad, Panama was the only country in the Western Hemisphere that officially used the dollar as its currency. But Panama has used dollars for nearly a century -- meaning its people are familiar with greenbacks and are more savvy about detecting fakes -- and it has only one-fifth the population of Ecuador. 
"Asking people to change their currency is like asking them to change their language or religion," said Fernando Guzman, deputy governor of Ecuador's Central Bank. "We were doing something that no one else had done, we were doing it rapidly, and we had no one to guide us or tell us of their experience." 
To help Ecuador deal with the problems, a United States government team representing the Federal Reserve, the Secret Service and the Treasury Department visited here in the fall. One result, Mr. Guzman said, was that instead of destroying counterfeit bills, Ecuador now "sends our bad notes intact to the United States so that their characteristics can be studied and identified."
Government officials here and in the United States are far less forthcoming, however, about the laundering of drug money, and will say little more than that they are improving cooperation. But the dimensions of the problem are evident.
In recent years, the cocaine and heroin trades have been so profitable that Colombian drug cartels have earned more dollars than they know what to do with.
Indeed, traffickers there have been so eager to exchange their dollars for pesos that Colombia may be the only country in the world in which the black market rate for dollars is lower than the legal rate.
With their domestic market all but saturated and the United States more vigilant than ever, Colombian trafficking groups have also been looking for new places where they can buy up legitimate businesses to launder their earnings. The combination of a weak legal structure and its use of the dollar quickly made Ecuador an attractive target.
"It's much easier now for someone to launder their money in Ecuador," said Pablo Lucio-Paredes, author of "The Dollarization Book: What Everyone Should Know," a best seller here. "Before you had to change your money into sucres, which was cumbersome and increased the risk that you might lose money" because the value of the sucre was slipping daily. "Now, unfortunately, there is no risk at all because the whole country is using nothing but dollars."
To prepare Ecuadoreans for the transition to the dollar, which is to conclude in March with the withdrawal of the last sucre bills, the government here has printed guidebooks in both Spanish and Quechua, the main Indian language here. The booklets explain what each American bill looks like and provide tips on how to identify fake ones. 
But the transition appears to have been complicated by the country's poverty. One of every eight Ecuadoreans is illiterate, according to government figures, and in the past those people have relied on the different colors in which denominations of the sucre were printed as a guide to the value of the notes.
"It still bothers me that the American bills are all just one color," said Amalia Quishpe, a vendor of vegetables at a market here who grew up in the interior and did not get past the second grade. "I've had to learn to recognize the different faces on the bills, and until I did, I got fooled a few times." 
Afraid of being bamboozled by counterfeiters, many stores here are refusing to accept large denomination bills. "I won't take anything larger than a $20 bill," said Luis Edgardo Melendez, owner of a photo-supply shop here. "The first time that the bank rejected a $100 bill that I had accepted as genuine was lesson enough for me."
Even coins, though not generally counterfeited, have proved to be a major headache. Financial transactions in Ecuador, where the minimum wage is under $100 a month, involve much smaller sums than in the United States, and thus the demand for coins has been greater than the government's ability to meet it. 
For one thing, coins are heavy, and the government has had difficulty finding planes that can fly the necessary amounts to remote areas. In addition, American coins do not show their values in figures. "That has proved a big problem for people here who can't speak English or can't read," Mr. Guzman said. 
To meet the demand, Ecuador has begun minting coins of its own that are the same size, color, composition and value as American coins. But those coins are beginning to show up in parking meters and vending machines in American cities (though the United States government considers the problem a minor one). 
If Ecuador's government had it to do all over again, Mr. Lucio-Paredes said, it might take things more slowly and do more advance work. At the very least, other countries might consider that path if they hope to avoid similar problems, he said. 
"One way to dollarize is to do what El Salvador is doing right now, from a position of strength in an atmosphere of stability," he said. "Or you can do it as Ecuador did, on the brink of economic chaos, with a lot of problems in government finances and the bank system, as a sort of life-saving measure. Obviously the most difficult circumstances are those Ecuador chose."

The Recession Speaks

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE; Bob Herbert is on vacation.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
I am Recession and am pleased to see your apprehensive face once again. Ask me anything.
 How can you be so sure that you are here? 
 I rise in inverse proportion to consumer confidence, which is demonstrably plummeting. As more people believe I'm here, I am more here. 
Is that all there is to your re-emergence -- mob psychology? Are you not a self-fulfilling prophecy of the don't-blame-us Bush economic team?
The G.O.P. will call me the Clinton Recession, and Democrats will call me the Bush Recession. That political spin has nothing to do with me. I am Recession, and I don't have a first name.
Does that mean that Chairman Greenspan's two recent slashings of interest rates won't work -- that you are unstoppable?
Yes. You heard Alan say that economic growth, which was over 5 percent last year, is "very close to zero" today. I'd say we'll have two, maybe three quarters of actual decline. You call it "negative growth" because you're afraid to use my name.
Aren't you overlooking the stimulus of Bush's $1.6 trillion retroactive tax cut? Won't combined fiscal and monetary stimulus jack up demand, start a housing boom and make our landing so soft we'll hardly notice that times are hard?
Let me tell you about decade-long budget projections, kid. You can project surpluses as far as the eye can see, but just a few years ago all the expert eye could see was deficits. The one figure you'll never get out of your economists is the rate of increase of their projections of surplus, which has just exceeded the rate of decrease of economic growth. Is that too complicated for you?
Yes.
Simply stated, all those estimates are pie in the sky. When I get a good grip on you, tax revenues plunge and the surpluses disappear -- as well they should, to see me go. And future Congresses change everything to fit new circumstances. It's silly to think that any policies on spending or income redistribution decided today will stay fixed for 10 years. Wake up from such faith-based economics and smell the reality.
You mean the whopping tax reduction won't slow you down at all?
It's a sales gimmick to stop the growth of government and the stultifying redistribution of wealth, you ninny. The only tax cut that would actually add to the surplus is the one on capital gains. Some $20 trillion in unrealized gains is frozen in people's portfolios; if you cut that tax rate in half, you'd encourage reinvestment and collect a bundle while helping hustle me offstage. But that won't happen. Have good cheer -- Recession's here.
You push up unemployment over 6 percent, bring on demands to lower the minimum wage, force families to pinch pennies -- and you call that cheery?
Except in those relatively few cases when breadwinners lose their jobs -- sorry about that -- I defend family buying power, which is already beginning to erode as oil prices stay up. You may not like my economic correctness, but you need my periodic visitations to check inflation. 
And with me on the downturn job, service makes a comeback. Call a plumber and get him the same day; bang on the pipes and the super shows up hungry for a tip. Nor can inefficient media moguls merge themselves out of earnings trouble. I'm no rude beast slouching toward Wall Street; on the contrary, I restore sense to stock multiples and thereby prevent crash -- extremely unsoft -- landings.
How do we get back to the fun part of the business cycle?
Most people who saw their assets rise during the 90's boom figured that was the same as saving, so the country as a whole now saves nothing and inflation is not feared because it seems to have little to erode. But the only way to save is to refrain from spending all you make. So sock what you can in bonds or stocks that pay dividends, because that real saving provides investment capital and buying power. 
How soon can we look forward to your departure?
Only when the Gloomy Guses think I'm here to stay. At that point, nothing recedes like Recession.

HEADLINE: Progress on Money Laundering 

 BODY:
In its final week, the Clinton administration, after lengthy discussions with leading banks, announced new measures that banks may take to deter corrupt foreign leaders and their business associates from hiding stolen wealth in the United States. The voluntary guidelines, if followed, will represent a welcome recognition of the central role that official corruption plays in the impoverishment of much of the world and in the proliferation of criminal syndicates in today's global economy. But they fall short of providing the legal tools that prosecutors need to combat the problem effectively. 
 Washington in the last few years was a leading advocate of tighter global restrictions on money laundering, but its effectiveness was undermined by the fact that American banks were themselves leading conduits for illicit money. A series of Congressional investigations, including one to be released today, have found that despite growing international attention and tighter money-laundering controls, as much as $1 trillion in criminal proceeds is laundered through banks worldwide each year, with about half of that moved through American banks. 
 Under the agreement announced last month, regulators will recommend that banks and brokerage houses apply "enhanced scrutiny" to accounts linked to foreign leaders and their business partners when they deposit large sums. Banks would notify the authorities when suspicious transactions occurred. The measures would become mandatory for a financial institution if investigators found that it helped launder corrupt wealth by ignoring the guidelines.
Unfortunately, there is still no criminal penalty for laundering the funds of corrupt dictators. America's money-laundering statutes define laundering as a crime if the money comes from drug trafficking, terrorism or bank fraud. But handling the deposits of corrupt foreign officials is not illegal. That loophole needs to be closed.
Last year the Clinton administration introduced legislation that would have broadened money-laundering statutes to cover bank transactions involving money that comes from official corruption. It died in Congress under pressure from banks. The Bush administration should consider reviving that effort. Banks are understandably wary of legal restrictions that raise costs and discourage depositors, particularly in their lucrative private banking divisions. But America cannot condemn corruption abroad while allowing its own banks to make fortunes off it.

Dear Investors: YourVotes Cost Us Money

BYLINE:  By TIM RACE 

 BODY:
The prolonged presidential vote count in Florida seems to have had more far-reaching effects than anyone might have guessed. 
 During those five weeks, people apparently were not much in the mood to spend money. Or save money. Or trade stocks online. Or buy toys online. Or order personalized lawn ornaments. Or read books. Or gamble in casinos. And few had the spunk to play Super Street Fighter II on Sega Dreamcast video-game consoles. 
 Or so imply a number of companies, in their recent explanations why their businesses were weak late last year. Sega Enterprises, for example, alluded to the nation's chad hangover as the company explained last week why it would halt production of its poor-selling Dreamcast machine. The election uncertainty, said a Sega spokesman, damped consumer confidence, which in turn cut into sales of the Dreamcast.
Oh sure, the Federal Reserve cited energy prices as a major culprit in the economic slowdown. And the Conference Board, a business research organization, pointed to the stock market plunge and a recent wave of layoffs as depressing consumer confidence to the lowest level since May 1993. 
But for many companies whose fourth-quarter results were not what they had hoped, Florida's voters must shoulder part of the blame. 
Here is a sampling of the companies of all stripes that have recently cited the election uncertainty as a reason for their shortfalls:
*Etoys, an online retailer.
*The Charles Schwab Corporation and Ameritrade, two of the leading online stock-trading companies.
*Beyond.com, a builder of online stores for other companies.
*Fidelity Bancorp, the parent of Fidelity Federal Savings Bank.
*The Lillian Vernon Corporation, a catalog retailer. 
*Barnes & Noble, the bookseller.
*Fahnestock Viner Holdings, a Canadian brokerage firm and investment bank.
*The Aztar Corporation, owner of the Ramada Express Hotel and Casino in Laughlin, Nev. TIM RACE

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
Ricoh Tries to Put Multiple Brands Under One Roof

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
Until this year, the Ricoh Corporation may well have been the copier industry's best kept secret.
 Have you used a Savin, Gestetner or Lanier copier? They are identical machines, all made by Ricoh, the $2 billion American subsidiary of the Ricoh Company, the Japanese maker of cameras, copiers and printers. 
 Ricoh's various brands command about 14 percent of the total copier market in the United States, and nearly 20 percent for digital machines. But compared with Japan, where Ricoh is the best-selling copier brand around, Ricoh's market strength is little recognized in this country. Even investors pay it little mind. Ricoh's American depository receipts are fairly lightly traded, although the share price has rebounded from its 52-week low of $75.50 in October, closing last Friday at $95.75. 
Now, though, Ricoh is intent on making a name for itself in the United States. Over the last few years, it has been steadily buying up the companies whose products it makes, and it acquired the final holdout, Lanier Worldwide, in December.
Now, with all those brands part of the family, Ricoh is busily revamping its sales and back-office operations, adding dealerships, fleshing out its product line and mounting its most expensive radio and print advertising campaign ever, using the tag line "Dependable Digital."
"Finally, Ricoh will be one legal entity with one operating system, and, finally, we can break out from being a small player in a copier-centric environment to a big player in a network-centric environment," said Jim Ivy, president of Ricoh's Office Products Group.
Ricoh, to be sure, is not ditching its vaunted brands in favor of some elusive, cohesive image. Why would it? When they were independent, each company concentrated on a different market: Savin, for example, is strong in government and education circles, while Gestetner is a big player in hospitals. Ricoh has no desire to tamper with that loyalty, any more than General Motors would want to reposition the Corvette and the Cadillac as generic G.M. brands.
But just as most car buyers know that G.M.'s engineering and deep pockets stand behind Cadillacs and Corvettes alike, Ricoh wants copier buyers to know that every Savin, Gestetner, Lanier or Ricoh Aficio -- the one brand Ricoh has always sold itself -- comes with Ricoh technology, service and support.
Ricoh's ultimate goal is to get its name into the corporate American consciousness, and then use the name awareness to sell every document-processing product or service that a company could need in the digital-network age.
The new approach does bring risks. One of Ricoh's competitive advantages has always been that its products were sold at a discount to its competitors. And one reason Ricoh could hold prices down when Savin, Lanier and Gestetner were independent is that those companies footed the advertising, marketing and distribution bills -- even as Ricoh benefited from the economies of scale that came with manufacturing all their machines. 
Last year Ricoh did notch its prices up a bit, in part to pay for its new advertising push. So far, there is no evidence that the price increase hurt sales. But with the economy now slowing, some analysts wonder whether any office equipment maker can hold the line on prices.
In another sense, though, the timing of Ricoh's new push is propitious. The Xerox Corporation, long the market leader, has a huge installed base of analog copiers, and until a year ago, it was fairly successful at getting those customers to trade up to higher-priced digital copiers.
But Xerox is grappling with the aftermaths of a bungled sales-force reorganization and a mismanaged attempt to consolidate customer administration offices. Lately, as Xerox management has been preoccupied with planning layoffs and trying to sell assets to raise much-needed cash, companies like Canon, I.B.M., Heidelberger, Toshiba and, yes, Ricoh, have been wooing many of those customers away. 
Xerox has been "out there convincing their customers to get a new digital machine, and that just opens the door for us," Mr. Ivy said. "If this were a sitcom, people would say the plot is too suspiciously pat."
And yet, simply stealing market share from Xerox in the copier market could be a Pyrrhic victory: The overall market for copiers is in decline, now that printers are taking on many tasks that copiers once handled. 
And customers are clamoring for one-stop shopping. They want to buy an entire document processing system -- printers and copiers and fax machines, slow and fast machines, color and black-and-white -- from a company that can provide products, service and supplies to each of their branch offices. And, more often these days, they want that company to set up and manage the entire corporate document processing system.
Ricoh, like most of its competitors, is emphasizing this full-menu approach for good reason. The profits to be made on selling copiers and printers are negligible at best. The real money lies in the high-margin service contracts and consumables like inks. 
"We have to change the mindset of our salespeople and our customers away from the box to selling full document-management solutions," said Katsumi Yoshida, chief executive of Ricoh, which is based in West Caldwell, N.J.
Ricoh is doing its best to get word out to its own troops. The company is taking eight warehouses that are currently segregated by brand and consolidating them into three mega-distribution centers that will stock generic machines. Only after a customer orders, say, a Lanier or Aficio, will a brand label be slapped on, just before shipping.
Ricoh is also melding its sales forces and tinkering with their compensation, so that salespeople do not push only one specific machine or brand. It is also streamlining its back-office systems so that salespeople, who previously spent 70 percent of their time on paperwork, can instead spend that time with customers. 
And, the company is finally giving the sales staff a full range of products to sell. Until now, Ricoh concentrated almost entirely on mid-speed machines -- the category of copiers that generally sell for a top price of $26,500, and have top speeds of between 45 and 69 pages a minute. It now offers a range of slower copiers, selling in the $2,800-to-$7,000 price range, that analysts say are competing effectively against Canon and Xerox in the small-office market. 
This year, Ricoh also plans to introduce a 105-page-a-minute machine that, at $100,000, will be a comparable bargain to the 110-page-a-minute machines from several competitors that can cost more than $200,000. 
Ricoh also offers software that speeds up the process of sending scanned documents from laptops or desktops to copiers, and that stores edited copies of the documents in the copier. It even has a new document management product called ECabinet, a $14,000 device that can automatically archive any fax, e-mail or other document that touches the network. Other companies have comparable products now, but analysts say Ricoh offered them first, and often has the lowest prices.
Printers will soon complete the product line. In April, Ricoh carved out a separate printer division to sell Ricoh laser printers -- big sellers in Japan -- in the United States, as well as to develop new printer products. In early January, the company hired Ann E. Moser, who has worked in the printer divisions of I.B.M., Lexmark and Xerox, as vice president of its new group. 
Ricoh does not yet offer ink-jet printers, which cost less than laser printers. But it may buy ink jets from another company to sell under one of its brands. And some of its Savin dealers have started carrying Hewlett-Packard inkjet printers.
"By offering printers, Ricoh completes a product line that few can match," said Benjamin A. Reitzes, an analyst with UBS Warburg. 
For now, though, copiers remain Ricoh's bread-and-butter items. In 1998, Ricoh became the first copier manufacturer to offeran 85-page-per-minute copier for a price as low as $48,500, and analysts say it is still selling strong. 
"High-speed copiers are the copier market's sweet spot, and Ricoh was there first," said Jack L. Kelly, an analyst with Goldman Sachs.
Ricoh was also one of the first copier manufacturers to offer a "tandem" feature that lets customers hook two 85-page copiers together, enabling them to deliver the volume and speed of a Docutech -- Xerox's highest-speed, highest-margin and most expensive product line -- at a third of the Docutech's price. Ricoh also was the first to show customers how to cluster machines -- that is, hook up a mix of color and black-and-white machines of various speeds, and use software that automatically directs any copying job to the appropriate copier. 
"Clustering and tandeming lets you do huge volumes cheaply, and Ricoh is making that argument quite vocally and successfully," said Steven H. Reynolds, a digital copier industry analyst at Lyra Research. 
Competitors are not sitting idle, of course. Brian L. Merriman, president of the big copier distributor Danka Worldwide, said Canon was about to introduce an 85-page-per-minute copier, and that Toshiba's 80-page-per-minute machine was starting to sell well. "Ricoh makes a good product, but its growth is going to slow considerably," he said. 
And even Xerox is filling in the gaps in its product line. It has a formidable array of both color and black-and-white copiers in the mid-to-high-speed range, and has said it will soon introduce a new line of relatively inexpensive copiers, with a top speed of 35 pages a minute. Color versions of the low-priced line are in the wings for midyear.
"Xerox is still the premier brand, and we'll recover from any tarnish on it real soon," said Paul A. Hartley, a Xerox vice president.
Not if Ricoh can help it. Ricoh's brand advertising really takes the competitive gloves off. One example: A new ad for Ricoh's Savin copiers asks, in bold letters, "Is Your Connection With Xerox Getting a Little Frayed?"
In October Ricoh mounted its $32 million "Dependable Digital" corporate campaign that does more than twit the competition. The new Ricoh ads stress the breadth of tasks -- copy full reports, collate documents and such -- that Ricoh's products can do, rather than the technology inside the machine. 
"Customers are telling us they care more about what's coming out of the system than what's inside the product," Mr. Ivy said. 
Marketing to end-users is a major change for Ricoh. Until now, Ricoh had always relied on so-called push marketing -- ads and promotions aimed at getting dealers to push Ricoh products at customers.
But Ricoh's new campaign is aimed at pulling customers into the dealerships to ask for Ricoh-branded products by name. "Brand awareness gives a certain perceived sense of quality, reliability and responsibility," said Donovan O. Dixon, senior document management industry analyst at Gartner Dataquest.
The big unanswered question now, though, is whether Ricoh can keep introducing new products at the pace the market demands. The company is grappling with a long-standing conservative culture that was loath to send a product to market before it had been tested and retested. Analysts say Ricoh could have gotten its 85-page machine to market two years earlier, if it had been willing to take risks. 
It is a criticism Mr. Ivy readily accepts. "We've let plenty of opportunities slide because we spent too much time aiming before firing," he said. "Now we're going to aim, fire, adjust, then aim and fire again."

HEADLINE: Bush Wants Tax Cut Sooner To Aid Economy This Year 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4 

 BODY:
In an effort to help get the faltering economy back on track, President Bush will try to speed up his tax cut, to put money into people's pockets this year, the White House's chief economic adviser said today.
 Lawrence B. Lindsey, who oversaw development of Mr. Bush's tax plan during the campaign and is coordinating economic policy for the administration, said the president would "absolutely" support efforts to accelerate the tax cut so it takes effect this year. 
 He did not offer any details, and it was unclear whether the administration intended to propose ways for Congress to speed the schedule for phasing in Mr. Bush's plan. The most widely mentioned idea was to reduce the money withheld from paychecks for income taxes. 
Mr. Bush had signaled before taking office that he was leaning toward accelerating his plan, and his advisers saw that as an attractive option, especially with the economy slowing.
In an interview today on "Fox News Sunday," Mr. Lindsey removed any doubt about accelerating the plan, which Mr. Bush intends to introduce formally on Thursday. It would reduce taxes by $1.6 trillion over 10 years by lowering all income-tax rates, doubling the child credit, giving a break to many two-income couples and repealing the estate tax over several years.
Members of Congress "want to see an acceleration of the tax cut, and so does the president," Mr. Lindsey said.
Mr. Lindsey said the president would hold his proposal to $1.6 trillion and indicated that the administration was wary of increasing the size and scope of the tax cut.
"No more, no less," Mr. Lindsey said when asked if the tax cut would be $1.6 trillion.
Asked why Mr. Bush did not support a reduction in the capital gains tax -- a goal of many conservatives in Congress -- Mr. Lindsey said Mr. Bush's plan focused on what the president believed were the worst problems in the tax code. Many entrepreneurs, he said, pay the top income-tax rate of 39.6 percent. The long-term capital gains rate is 20 percent, he said.
"We looked at the tax code, identified the most egregious parts, looked at the economy and felt that this was the combination of tax cuts that would give people the most relief, reform the tax system the most and give the economy the biggest boost," Mr. Lindsey said.
The administration has aggressively made a case that the slowdown in the economy provides more justification for an immediate tax cut. The idea is that allowing consumers to keep more of the money they earn will lead them to spend more, helping to slow or reverse a downturn that could become the first recession in a decade.
Many economists doubt that the tax relief can be enacted quickly enough to make much difference to the economy this year. Republican leaders in Congress say they probably cannot send a tax bill to Mr. Bush before this summer, suggesting that any changes in withholdings would take effect in late summer or early fall.
History suggests that the economy is likely to be recovering by then, especially since the Federal Reserve is already cutting interest rates and is considered likely to continue doing so in coming months.
But administration officials say that even the promise of tax relief will improve consumer confidence and help keep the economy from deteriorating.
Democrats continued today to insist on a smaller tax cut, saying a $1.6 trillion cut would leave nothing for other priorities, like prescription drug coverage for retirees, increasing spending on education and modernizing the military.
"We are for a tax cut, but we're for a tax cut that is affordable," Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, the senior Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee, told "Fox News Sunday."
Democrats in the Senate will probably have considerable influence over the tax legislation in a Senate evenly divided between the two parties. Although some Democrats are likely to back Mr. Bush's plan -- Senator Zell Miller of Georgia has already signed on as a co-sponsor -- there are moderate Republicans who say Mr. Bush's plan might be too expensive, given the uncertainty over whether the projected federal budget surplus of $5.6 trillion over the next decade will materialize.
The chairman of the budget committee, Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, said he expected Congress to adopt a budget that would provide $1.6 trillion for a tax cut. "That's what we can bear," Mr. Domenici said.

HEADLINE: Canada Determined to Be First Neighbor to Bush 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: OTTAWA, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
Worried that American attention is shifting south to Mexico, Canada's prime minister, Jean Chretien, visits the White House on Monday, capping a campaign of diplomatic elbowing to become the first foreign leader to meet President Bush.
 The prime minister's visit comes after Canada's foreign affairs minister, John Manley, raced to Washington to become the first foreign minister to meet Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and after Canada's defense minister, Art Eggleton, raced to Washington to become the first defense minister to meet Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld. 
 "We are not trying to impress anybody," Paul Martin, Canada's finance minister, said in an interview here, fresh from trumpeting Canada's economic progress in speeches in New York.
Although Canada remains the largest trading partner of the United States, eating up almost one-quarter of American exports, Canada's insecurity about Mexico is palpable. 
On Nov. 28, the day after Mr. Chretien's Liberals won Canada's elections and a rare, third consecutive mandate, Mr. Bush picked up the phone to congratulate a fellow North American leader. But instead of calling north to congratulate Mr. Chretien, the then-Texas governor called south to congratulate an old friend, Vicente Fox, on his approaching inauguration as president of Mexico.
Two weeks ago, Ottawa's brave smiles turned to panic when the White House announced that the new president was going to make his first foreign visit to Mexico, breaking a tradition maintained by the last three American presidents of making their first foreign visit to Canada. Canadian officials see a bond growing fast between the American and Mexican presidents, both owners of ranches in the same region.
"President Bush's decision to travel to Mexico as his first foreign visit is powerful evidence of the special place Mexico holds in our national priorities," General Powell said, announcing the visit.
Already the United States' second most important trading partner, Mexico often weighs heavier than Canada in the United States, where Mexico maintains nearly 50 consulates to promote trade and to help 20 million people of Mexican nationality or origin. Canada maintains 14 consulates and trade offices to promote trade and to help 700,000 people of Canadian origin, an assimilated group with little political influence.
Canada regularly loses the battle for American public opinion. Today, there are about 50 American reporters based in Mexico, but only 5 or so based in Canada. During the Chretien years, Business Week, The Los Angeles Times and The New York Times have withdrawn their reporters from Canada, largely attributing the move to high Canadian taxes.
Compounding Canada's difficulties in grabbing American attention -- at least in the eyes of Canada's conservatives -- is the fact that Mr. Chretien is confronting a president who is not only a southern-looking Texan, but one who is a Republican and a Bush.
In 1993, when he was campaigning for office, Mr. Chretien ridiculed the close ties between Mr. Bush's father and Brian Mulroney, a Conservative, who had served as prime minister.
Since leaving office, Mr. Mulroney and the elder Mr. Bush have maintained a close family friendship, with Mr. Mulroney sitting on the board of the Bush presidential library, and George and Barbara Bush traveling to Montreal in September to attend the marriage of Brian and Mila Mulroney's daughter, Caroline.
In contrast, last year Mr. Chretien and his nephew, Raymond, who was serving as Canada's ambassador to Washington, made comments that were interpreted by many Republicans as tilting toward Al Gore, the candidate of the Liberals' traditional American allies, the Democrats.
Mr. Mulroney, who is on a first-name basis with General Powell and Vice President Dick Cheney, said in an interview this week with the National Post, Canada's conservative newspaper, that he talked recently with "the highest reaches of the administration," impressing on them "the importance of the Canadian relationship."
But, "Mulroney may have poisoned the well for Chretien with the Bushes," said Christopher M. Sands, the Canada director for the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Reflecting new ideological alignments, the White House is hiring as a presidential speechwriter David Frum, a conservative columnist for The National Post.
While personalities influence international relations, both governments are expected to pursue national self interests in maintaining cordial relations as they preside over the world's busiest trading relationship, about $1.3 billion a day. Mr. Sands said from Washington, "Bush is a corporate M.B.A., so he will be nice to the No. 1 customer."
Under Mr. Chretien and Mr. Martin, Canada is also getting its financial house in better order. In 1998, Canada eradicated its budget deficit, and now it has started to reduce its towering debt, which stands at about half of its gross domestic product, down from 71 percent in 1995.
Mr. Martin pushed through tax cuts before the election that reduced personal taxes, cut the average capital gains rate to 23 percent -- lower than in the United States -- and put average corporate tax rates on track to fall in two years to 32 percent, also lower than American rates.

HEADLINE: Bush Warning on Spending Cools a Wishful Pentagon 

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO and STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4 

 BODY:
With his vow to keep Pentagon spending lean in the coming year, President Bush issued a stern and unexpected challenge to members of Congress and the military who believe that America's armed forces need a rapid and large infusion of money if the nation is to remain a global superpower.
 For months, an array of influential politicians and top Pentagon officials have argued that the military must invest tens of billions of additional dollars each year to replace aging fighter planes, warships and helicopters. 
 But Mr. Bush splashed skepticism on their demands last week by warning that he would not let modernization dollars flow until Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld finished a sweeping review of the Pentagon's cold war strategies, a painstaking process that could sharply revise accepted wisdom about the military's needs.
In doing so, Mr. Bush clearly showed that he was not prepared to accept on face value the frequently voiced arguments in Congress and in the Pentagon that the United States must increase military spending $50 billion to $100 billion each year to reverse a dangerous decline in its military power. 
Mr. Rumsfeld and his skeletal staff have barely begun their review, and it is far from clear how extensive it will be. But Mr. Bush's slowdown orders have already forced military commanders to begin revising optimistic budget proposals downward. Rather than pushing for the sky, they are now thinking about delaying equipment purchases and scaling back wish lists they had prepared in anticipation of lavish new spending, officials said.
Those Pentagon officials have also stopped circulating position papers on Capitol Hill that had outlined $8 billion or more in additional spending they claimed to need for just the current year. It appears likely, however, that to pay for rising health care and fuel costs in the military, Congress will approve a smaller adjustment in this year's Pentagon budget.
Although Mr. Bush did not rule out eventual increases, his approach sharply contrasts with that of President Ronald Reagan. In his first months in office two decades ago, Mr. Reagan pushed through immediate increases in the Pentagon budget, including what ultimately became the largest single-year increase in military spending since the Vietnam War, 12 percent.
Mr. Bush told Congressional Republicans in Williamsburg, Va., on Friday, "It's incumbent upon those of us in the executive branch -- Secretary Rumsfeld and our policy team -- to present to you a blueprint about what the military ought to look like and what the priorities ought to be." 
"You may like it, you may not like it," Mr. Bush added, "but good appropriations will really only occur if there is a strategic vision."
Mr. Bush's plan is all the more surprising because in last year's campaign he repeatedly accused the Clinton administration of allowing a serious erosion in military readiness and morale. In the campaign, however, he pledged only a modest $4.5 billion a year increase in military spending, of which $1 billion would be for an immediate pay increase. Aides have said he is still committed to new spending for pay and military housing.
Nevertheless, his remarks last week stunned and dismayed people in Congress and the military industry who had anticipated a post-inauguration flow of cash into the Pentagon's coffers.
"I was surprised," said Eric D. Newsom, an assistant secretary of state under President Bill Clinton and now vice president for national security affairs with the United States Chamber of Commerce. "I can certainly understand that they would want to be careful and study the new budget they have been given," Mr. Newsom said. "But I'm a little disappointed in that I think the need for more defense spending is so apparent."
In appearing to make military spending a lower priority than tax-cutting and education, Mr. Bush may risk angering conservatives and veterans groups that supported his election, some Republicans say. But Mr. Bush has also clearly left the door open to appeasing those core Republicans by sharply increasing the Pentagon budget before the 2004 election.

Too Little for Too Much
For all the debate over the size of the Pentagon budget, there is broad agreement among military experts that it is not large enough to meet the demands placed on the armed forces, from patrolling the skies over Iraq to plying the waters of the South China Sea. 
To bring the two into line, Mr. Bush could simply spend more money, or he could revise strategic policy to drastically change the shape, size and budgets of the armed forces. 
But doing that would almost certainly involve the kinds of politically difficult decisions that Congress and the Pentagon have tended to resist, from canceling weapons programs to closing bases to reducing commitments overseas to restructuring the services themselves.
"If you want to execute the current defense program, you have to put more money into it," said Andrew F. Krepinevich, director of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a private research group that studies military issues. "But that begs the question of whether we are investing in the right strategies."
Mr. Krepinevich's group says that to meet its current mission, the Pentagon needs to increase military spending by $10 billion a year in the short term, rising to $40 billion or more toward the end of the decade. But his projections are on the low end of the scale, with some experts contending that the Pentagon needs an additional $100 billion or more each year starting now. 
In outlining the problem in a speech at the National Press Club here in December, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry H. Shelton of the Army, advocated raising spending by $30 billion to $40 billion a year on new weapons and equipment alone. The Pentagon already spends more than $60 billion annually on acquiring equipment.
General Shelton's proposal would mean a 10 percent or greater increase in today's $309 billion Pentagon budget, without accounting for increases in pay, fuel costs, health care benefits and other routine expenses that inexorably drive up military spending every year.
And all those proposals for additional military spending do not include the estimated $60 billion or more for building a national missile defense system, which Mr. Bush and Mr. Rumsfeld have made a top priority. This year the Pentagon is spending just $2.8 billion on developing that missile shield.
Representative Ike Skelton of Missouri, the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, offered a typical assessment of the problem in a recent interview. "All the programs are coming due: shipbuilding, health care, aircraft, maintenance," he said. "I don't know where you come out at. But it's a pretty high figure."

Buying New, or Fixing Old
Few programs better exemplify the problems of modernization than the Air Force's F-22 fighter plane. With its supersonic cruising speed and stealthy design, the F-22 is intended to replace the fleet of F-15 fighters, which have an average age of about 15 years and are rapidly approaching retirement.
But the F-22 is so expensive -- by some estimates $180 million a plane -- that the Air Force cannot afford enough of them to replace all of its F-15's. And that means older fighters will be kept in service longer, increasing costs for maintenance and spare parts. The F-22's steep price will also reduce the money available for other important aircraft, like midair refueling and reconnaissance planes.
Similar problems confront the other services. 
Perennial shortfalls of $1 billion or more in the Navy's shipbuilding account have reduced annual ship purchases to about six a year from the Navy's goal of nine, at which rate the fleet will shrink in the coming decades to about 200 ships from its current 316.
The Marines want to replace their Vietnam-era helicopters with tilt-rotor V-22 Ospreys, a $30 billion program that has been plagued by crashes and charges of corruption. And the Army wants to build 1,213 Comanche helicopters at $39 billion. Yet both services recently reported not having enough money this year for basic things like base maintenance, spare parts and salary bonuses.
And in one of the biggest programs of all, the Pentagon has proposed spending $200 billion to buy 3,000 Joint Strike Fighter planes to be used by all the services, though it is not clear that all the services really want the planes. 
Even before the Soviet Union ceased to exist, the military had begun to shrink from its cold war highs under President Reagan. The Department of Defense budget peaked in 1985 at $436 billion, measured in today's dollars, compared with $296 billion this year (excluding $13 billion that the Department of Energy spends on maintaining the nation's nuclear weapons).
Through the early 1990's, military spending fell steadily as the Army cut its combat divisions to 10 from 18, the Air Force went from 22 fighter wings to 12, and the Navy from nearly 600 ships to a little more than 300 today. By 1996, spending on procurement, as measured in current dollars, had fallen to the lowest level since the beginning of the Korean War.

Mission Improbable
After years of seeing "peace dividends" control spending and help balance the federal budget, senior commanders began to warn in 1998 that the current force could not sustain itself and its missions without significant increases.
The question is, for what? 
Since 1991, when Vice President Dick Cheney was Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell was the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the nation's military strategy has more or less remained the same. It requires the armed services to be prepared to fight and win two major wars in separate regions at nearly the same time -- against, say, North Korea and Iraq.
Military officials say that requirement has become increasingly onerous as American forces have been committed to an array of other missions -- from patrolling so-called no-flight zones in Iraq, which President Bush's father first ordered, to the peacekeeping missions that President Clinton ordered in Bosnia and Kosovo.
At the same time, they say, those other missions have increased the strain on today's forces, which do not have the time, money or equipment to do all that is asked of them.
In his campaign, Mr. Bush suggested that he would withdraw United States troops from the Balkans, though that would provide minuscule savings compared with what the chiefs are asking for. And it would do nothing to address the question of how to modernize the force. 
Some experts inside and outside the Pentagon say that Mr. Bush could solve the Pentagon's modernization problem by simply revising the nation's military strategy.
Neither Iraq nor North Korea has a military as powerful as both countries did a decade ago, Iraq because of the Persian Gulf war of 1991 and North Korea because of a decaying economy. And yet the Pentagon still plans as if it would have to dispatch a force nearly as large as the 700,000 American troops it sent to repel Iraq's invasion of Kuwait a decade ago.

Armed With Assumptions
Altering the core assumptions behind the strategy even slightly could mean the armed services would need to equip fewer forces with less equipment. In a new book called "Holding the Line" (Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press), seven military experts argue that the Pentagon's budget could even decline slightly in the years ahead by a restructuring of the forces and their missions; for instance, the elimination of the Navy's presence in the Mediterranean.
"We've spent a lot of time and money to make the Med an American lake," said James T. Quinlivan, one of the book's contributors and a senior analyst at the Rand Corporation.
Other experts contend that the services should simply continue buying the kinds of weapons they already have, like F-15 fighters, which cost half or less than half what F-22's cost yet are still considered among the best fighter jets in the world. The savings could then be invested in developing far more advanced weapons, like unmanned aircraft.
President Bush has not clearly defined his strategy for the American military, but in last year's campaign he repeatedly spoke of transforming the armed forces. And he dropped hints that he was prepared to abandon some existing programs for ones that promise greater technological advancement. 
Of course, canceling or just changing weapons programs is one of the most difficult things to do in Washington. But many people believe that Mr. Bush, as a Republican who ran on a platform of modernizing the military, would have the political standing to make such hard choices. 
"There's an old saying: be careful what you ask for, you may get it," Mr. Krepinevich said. "And I think a lot of people in the Pentagon are thinking that now. Only Nixon could go to China, and only a Republican can whack the defense budget."

HEADLINE: In Big Bang's Echoes, Clues to the Cosmos 

BYLINE:  By JAMES GLANZ 

 BODY:
A dappled glow from the explosive birth of the universe is teasing astronomers with its mysteries and apparent contradictions, as it has again and again since two scientists at Bell Laboratories in Holmdel, N.J., discovered it accidentally in 1965.
 The discovery of this radiation, in the form of a hiss in the microwave part of the radio spectrum arriving from all directions of space, firmly cemented the Big Bang -- a picture in which the universe began in a great explosion more than 10 billion years ago -- in its current position as the leading theory of cosmic birth. 
 "It's the oldest light in the universe," said Dr. Wayne Hu, a cosmologist at the University of Chicago. "We're looking at the universe as it was back then." 
Because of its great age and its starkly direct link to cosmic origins, the light has been used, like pottery shards or fossilized footprints, to create a partial reconstruction of the young universe. Since 1965, observations from satellites in space, from balloons high in the atmosphere and with earthbound instruments have established that the gases of the primordial universe were extraordinarily uniform -- but that there were also enough ripply patches so that swarms of stars and galaxies could later coalesce from them.
Over the last few years, by peering at those ripples with extraordinary precision, scientists have begun using them not just as general indicators of primordial conditions, but as measuring sticks for determining the basic statistics of the entire cosmos, like the total amount of matter and energy it contains.
Now, with the launching of a new $145 million NASA satellite for observing the microwave background scheduled for June 30, scientists plan to widen the scope and precision of this program so far that it will become a kind of "cosmic genome project," said Dr. Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at the University of Pennsylvania.
"The cosmic microwave background is to cosmology what DNA is to biology," Dr. Tegmark said. The ripples, or anisotropies, "constitute a cosmic DNA in the sense that they encode the blueprints for the evolution of the universe," he said. "They are the seeds from which stars and galaxies grew."
The satellite, called the Microwave Anisotropy Probe, or MAP, should examine that cosmic DNA finely enough to produce separate accountings of the various kinds of matter in the universe -- the ordinary stuff of which stars, planets and people are made, and the much weirder "dark matter" that has never been seen directly but that is believed to make up most of the mass in the universe.
The observations may also provide a new measure of how fast the universe is expanding as a legacy of the Big Bang explosion, and say something about what set off the explosion in the first place.
MAP is the successor to the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite, or COBE (pronounced COH-bee), which captured the world's attention in 1992 when it discovered the ripples. But the amount of data expected to be collected in two years by MAP is so much greater, said Dr. Edward L. Wright, an astronomer at the University of California at Los Angeles who has been involved in both missions, that "it's like having COBE for 4,000 years."
The new satellite will have other advantages as well, since it will be able to see much finer features in the ripples and will be placed in an orbit much farther from the crackling confusion of Earth and its atmosphere than COBE was. The result should be a stunningly detailed map of the microwave sky.
"It will be the cleanest and clearest picture of the infant universe ever obtained," said Dr. Lyman A. Page, a Princeton physicist who is also involved in the MAP mission.
But the microwave background is creating some fresh puzzlement for scientists as they prepare for the space mission. New observations from balloons and from the ground have produced doubts as to whether some predicted features of the radiation are missing, and whether various experiments are in contradiction with one another on their results.
The most extreme possibility suggested by the new observations is that there is something crucially wrong in a theory called inflation, scientists' leading picture of what happened in the earliest moments of the Big Bang. More likely, most scientists say, uncertainties in some of the experiments have created apparent contradictions that will be resolved by the time MAP flies, allowing it to make precision measurements rather than pick up the pieces of a theory whose credibility has been shattered.
But Dr. Charles L. Bennett, an astronomer at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., who is the MAP mission's lead scientist, said MAP itself could shuffle the cosmic deck. "MAP could definitely produce surprises and might well do so," Dr. Bennett said.
Another MAP scientist at Princeton, Dr. David Spergel, pointed out that however the current controversies resolved themselves, few cosmologists believed that all important questions about cosmic birth had been answered correctly by the existing theory. New data are sure to highlight any of its weaknesses, he said.
"It could turn out that our ideas about cosmology are incomplete, that inflation is like the old quantum mechanics," Dr. Spergel said, referring to the years before 1926, when a scientific revolution clarified the workings of the atomic realm. That outcome, he said, would suggest that inflation is "a rough description of what's going on, but it doesn't have any fundamental basis."
The theory of inflation, whose basic outlines were discovered in 1980 by Dr. Alan Guth, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is as audacious as it has been successful at predicting many of the observations so far of the microwave background radiation.
In its simplest version, the theory, whose first workable and consistent form was developed in 1982 by Dr. Paul Steinhardt of Princeton, Dr. Andreas Albrecht of the University of California at Davis, and, independently, Dr. Andrei Linde, now of Stanford, posits that at some moment 10 billion years ago, a tiny speck of primordial nothingness was somehow filled with intense energy with bizarre properties.
Exactly how the mote of energy, called an inflaton field (pronounced IN-flah-tahn), would have appeared remains in contention. But advanced theories predict that if it did appear, the field would have stretched the fabric of space like a balloon, then exploded with unimaginable violence into a ball of hot elementary particles and light, setting off the Big Bang.
The ball would have been almost uniform, but tiny variations, called quantum fluctuations, in the original mote of energy should have left traces on the exploding ball, setting it ringing. "The early universe is like an organ pipe with characteristic resonances," Dr. Spergel said. "In inflation, you bang that organ pipe hard, once." The main tone and its harmonics, he said, take the form of huge acoustic waves -- closely related to ordinary sound waves in air -- in the hot primordial gases.
As the universe expanded and cooled, it would have continued to resonate. And when it was about 300,000 years old, it should have cooled enough for electrons and ions, or atomic nuclei, to combine into atoms. At that point, the universe would become transparent and light bearing the imprint of those waves, or ripples, would be free to travel through space, arriving at Earth billions of years later as the cosmic microwave background radiation.
The first prediction that some sort of radiation should be left over from the Big Bang was made by the physicist George Gamow and colleagues in the 1940's. "Amazingly, nobody had picked up on this and gone out to look for it," said Dr. David T. Wilkinson, a physicist at Princeton. But another Princeton physicist, Robert H. Dicke, revived the idea and set a few young colleagues, including Dr. Wilkinson, looking for it.
In 1965, during lunch, Dr. Dicke took a phone call. "He hung up the phone and said, 'Well, boys, we've been scooped,' " Dr. Wilkinson said.
Using sensitive radio equipment designed for another purpose, Arno A. Penzias and Robert W. Wilson at Bell Laboratories (now part of Lucent Technologies) had stumbled on the radiation. "It could have been pigeon droppings or a dead squirrel or anything else in there," said Dr. Wilkinson, who has been involved in COBE and MAP, but the scientists eventually eliminated everything but a cosmic source. They received a Nobel Prize for the discovery in 1978.
With their equipment, Penzias and Wilson could see only a smooth glow. COBE scientists announced that they had seen the first hints of the ripples in 1992, giving the theory of inflation a huge boost. But COBE could not see finely enough to distinguish the predicted main tone or its harmonics, so other scientists set out to map the spectrum of the ripples, or the range of their sizes as seen against the sky, in more detail.
The goal of that work went beyond verifying inflation, since the spectrum should function as a yardstick for measuring some of the most important cosmic characteristics. For example, cosmologists believe they can roughly calculate the size of the waves corresponding to the main tone in the early universe. As seen on the sky, those ripples should span about 1 degree, or about twice the width of the full moon, assuming the light from them travels to earth on straight lines.
But according to Einstein's general theory of relativity, the gravity of the matter and energy can bend light rays, causing them to converge or diverge. Then the cosmos would become a kind of lens, shrinking or magnifying the apparent size of the ripples. Only if the universe contains a particular amount of matter and energy, corresponding to a "flat" cosmic geometry, do the rays travel in straight lines.
This "flat" cosmos happens to be the one that inflation, with its stretching of space, should produce. And beginning in the mid-1990's, notably in ground-based experiments led by Dr. Page, a peak in the spectrum near 1 degree began to appear. By late in 1999, other experiments had verified the existence of the first peak.
"This first peak is very real," said Dr. John Carlstrom, an astrophysicist at the University of Chicago. "Then the name of the game is, 'Are the other peaks there?' "
Those other peaks correspond to the organ pipe's higher harmonics, which "had better be there" if inflation is right, said Dr. Hu of Chicago. On that point, some of the current experiments seem to be in conflict, with at least one showing a prominent second peak but another suggesting that it is either small or nonexistent.
Dr. Anthony Readhead, an astronomer at the California Institute of Technology who leads an experiment in Chile called the Cosmic Background Imager, said his team had seen clear evidence for the signal. But he said that he was at a loss to explain the apparent conflict with another major experiment.
Though Dr. Readhead was too polite to say so, a persistent disagreement would either mean that one experiment was wrong or that scientists were locked in some fundamental misunderstanding.
Long before MAP's first results become available, new data on some of the harmonics should arrive from several ground and balloon observations, including the Degree Angular Scale Interferometer, a South Pole experiment led by Dr. Carlstrom and Dr. Mark Dragovan of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
But with its great precision, "I think MAP will be the final arbiter," Dr. Bennett said. He and others added that if the harmonics were found, their characteristics should allow scientists to go beyond measuring just the amount of matter and energy and begin separating it into various categories.
For instance, the relative "loudness," or peak heights, of the main note and the harmonics, gives a measure of the amount of ordinary matter in the universe, because of the way it sloshed in and out of the troughs of the waves. More subtle features of the spectrum could give a new measure of the Hubble constant, or the rate at which the universe is expanding.
So important is the microwave background for cosmology that new experiments beyond MAP are being planned. The European Space Agency plans to fly a satellite called Planck, perhaps by 2007, while numerous ground experiments are being designed to examine extremely fine features of the radiation that may carry other messages.
Still, scientists should remember that the cosmos is not as clear-cut as basic cosmological models suggest, said Dr. Steinhardt, who studies a type of energy called quintessence that some theories suggest could be filling the universe.
Such possibilities, he said, would mean that reading off the characteristics of the cosmos from the fluctuation spectrum would be much more difficult than many scientists imagine. "There's an awful lot of unexplored territory there," Dr. Steinhardt said. "I'd almost be disappointed if we didn't find some surprises."

It is thought to be heat leftover from the Big Bang. TINY RIPPLESThe temperature differences show up as ripples of green and blue on the simulation below, which shows what the MAP data might look like. Scientists hope they will reveal a lot about the universe, including its large scale geometry. MICROWAVE ANISOTROPY PROBE (MAP)The probe is scheduled to be launched in June. It will measure temperature differences, or anisotropy, in the cosmic microwave background, on a fine scale. HOW IT FORMED After the Big Bang explosion, the universe was an expanding, superhot soup of particles that gradually cooled. Several hundred thousand years later, hydrogen atoms formed, and light waves began to propagate across space. Over the next 10 billion years, these light waves expanded with the universe and are now known as the cosmic microwave background. UNIVERSE'S GEOMETRY The spectrum of the ripples indicates the universe(TM)s geometry, and the new maps could confirm its "flatness." Possible geometries are represented below. A closed universe is positively curved, and parallel lines eventually intersect. An open universe is negatively curved, and parallel lines diverge. In a flat universe, the rules of familiar Euclidean geometry apply, so parallel lines remain parallel.(pg. F1)

HEADLINE: American Communists Come Home, on Microfilm 

BYLINE:  By IRVIN MOLOTSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5 

 BODY:
In 1993, John Haynes, a historian at the Library of Congress, was in Russia meeting with the head of that nation's archives when he was startled by a sudden remark.
 "Did you know that the Comintern has the American Communist Party records?" the Russian official, Kirill M. Anderson, asked Mr. Haynes. The Soviet Comintern controlled the Communist parties in the United States and in other foreign countries. 
 Mr. Haynes replied that American scholars didn't even know that the records existed. 
"They stuck me in an office and wheeled in a cart with these files," he recalled. "They were literally dust-covered folders. I blew off the dust, untied the ribbon and pulled out the papers. These were the American party's own records: letters, summaries of agendas, discussions, decisions, arguments over expense reports, like 'We're going to get the money to you but, by the way, this looks out of line.' They were the real records, not copies."
Mr. Haynes learned that from the 1920's to the 40's officers of the Communist Party in the United States routinely shipped their records to the Soviet Union for safekeeping.
In 1998 the Russian archives agreed for a $100,000 fee to make microfilm copies of the material. Now the papers have come home, in the form of 435,165 microfilmed pages at the Library of Congress.
Because scholars have seen just a fraction of the reports, which were delivered in batches to Washington last year, it is too soon to tell whether they will result in any major discoveries. Mr. Haynes has already published figures that show that the drop in American Communist membership resulting from the Hitler-Stalin pact of 1939 was not as great as previously thought.
Some of the records have a familiar ring. A Soviet leader tells American Communists in 1919 to expose President Woodrow Wilson "as a hypocrite and murderer, in order to discredit him with the masses." In a 1920 report a Communist boasts of doing better than the Socialist Party: "In instances we have held larger mass meetings than the S.P. ever held in its balmiest days. These mass meetings have gone forward without interference to now. We have conscripted the best of speakers and they are making national tours. Results have been exceptionally good." 
The writer adds, "It is probably known to you that the officialdom of the A. F. of L. is so reactionary," a reference to the union organization. 
A 1931 statement called for a boycott of the 1932 Olympic Games, which were held in the United States. "The National Provisional Counter Olympic Committee declares that the Olympic games are the creation of a few self-appointed millionaires, counts, army officers and Amateur Athletic Union job holders. The games serve the purpose of distracting the attention of the masses of the sport-loving youth of the United States and the entire world, most of whom are suffering under the burden of the economic crisis, from their own immediate problems. It is calculated to keep the minds of the masses on the question of Olympic victories and star performances rather than on the problem of keeping body and soul together. . . 'WIN FAIR OR FOUL, BUT WIN!' is the commonly accepted slogan of the Olympic games." 
Then the writer complains that the Soviet Union was not been invited to participate.
Allen Weinstein, president of the Washington-based Center for Democracy, which works with the Russian government to promote democratic reform in Russia, said that the records would provide Americans with "a remarkable historical reference," but that those expecting to find answers to persistent riddles like the Hiss and Rosenberg spy cases were likely to be disappointed.
Professor Weinstein, who is the author with Alexander Vassiliev of "The Haunted Wood: Soviet Espionage in America -- the Stalin Era" (Random House, 1999), said that whatever records the Soviet Union retained in those cases would be in the files of the K.G.B. and military intelligence, not of the Communist Party in the United States.
Still, Harvey Klehr, a historian at Emory University described the materials as "certainly the most thorough resource that scholars have had on the history of American Communism." 
Professor Klehr worked with Mr. Haynes in getting the archive to the United States and has written books with him on its contents ("The Secret World of American Communism," with a third author, Fridrikh Igorevich Firsov, published by Yale University Press in 1995).
"Everything in the past had been bits and pieces, stray documents," Professor Klehr said. "It's really a marvelous resource. When we were told that the Russians had the American Communist records, we were both skeptical. We were afraid it was just a file of clippings from The Daily Worker."
But there it was, millions upon millions of words. Most of it is in English, the exceptions being some of the earliest documents, written when many American Communists were foreign-born and wrote in their native languages. By the 1930's the majority of party members were American-born.
The archive is rich in material about women, particularly Emma Goldman, and labor unions, civil liberties and court cases. "It just makes you salivate," said Ellen Schrecker, professor of history at Yeshiva University and author of "Many Are the Crimes: McCarthyism in America" (Little, Brown, 1998). Mr. Haynes said that perhaps a dozen Americans had looked at the archive's originals in Moscow and perhaps a dozen more had seen the microfilm copies in the Library of Congress. 
There is no index of names, so it is difficult to find information on individuals. The Library of Congress has compiled a 166-page guide that lists general subjects in chronological order, but it will be years before the complete value of the trove will be realized.
As the records accumulated, the American Communists packed them up and shipped them to Moscow, Mr. Haynes said. The party was not illegal and there was no restriction on exporting such files, so the papers are thought to have simply been sent by freight until World War II broke out in 1939 and Soviet diplomats probably sent them out in pouches. 
Few people in Moscow evidently took the time to read them, and they were eventually placed in storage in western Siberia to be largely forgotten until Mr. Anderson, the Russian archivist, mentioned them to Mr. Haynes.
"It was a weird feeling to see this material pop up, material that I never expected to see," Professor Klehr said. "I'm not even sure members of the Communist Party knew it existed."

HEADLINE: Investment Opportunity. Strings Attached.; 
Musician and 15 Partners Join Forces to Acquire a Multimillion-Dollar Violin

BYLINE:  By SUSAN ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
 Five years ago Robert McDuffie found the instrument of his dreams: a 1735 Guarneri del Gesu violin known as the Ladenburg, whose list of players has included the 19th-century virtuosos Nicolo Paganini and Ludwig Spohr. It came with a sheaf of papers attesting to its pedigree; it was in mint condition. 
 "I had fallen in love," said Mr. McDuffie, 42, an affable Georgia-born New Yorker. This was the instrument that would take him to the next level of his burgeoning career. 
"It was more than an extension of my body," he remembered thinking. "It was an extension of my musical personality." 
There was only one problem. The price was $3.5 million.
The instrument's owner, Dietmar Machold of Machold Rare Violins, with offices near Lincoln Center, agreed to let Mr. McDuffie keep playing the Ladenburg (named for the German banking family that owned it in the mid-19th century) while he looked for a way to pay for it. That long and arduous quest, full of false starts and harsh doses of reality, came to a successful conclusion yesterday in the office of the Wall Street law firm Seward & Kissel. There, a group of 16 investors calling itself 1735 del Gesu Partners L.P., officially purchased the Ladenburg from Mr. Machold for the express purpose of leasing it to Mr. McDuffie. 
There are 16 partners in all, including Mr. McDuffie and Mr. Machold; the shares cost $100,000 each. Mr. McDuffie does not pay rent; his obligation is to play the violin, so it will maintain its value, and to pay for its maintenance and insurance, which he estimates at $15,000 to $20,000 a year. At the end of the 25-year lease (actually 23; it is retroactive to 1998), Mr. McDuffie is to return the instrument to the partnership, which intends to sell it, presumably at a profit.
The violin was appraised in 1999 for $3.5 million by the violin consultant in Christie's musical instrument department. It has already more than doubled in value since Mr. Machold purchased it from a collector in Europe under a confidential arrangement for $1.2 million in 1989. Were it to continue increasing in value at that rate (about 10 percent a year), an optimistic projection, the partners would wind up with about $25.7 million after taxes. A more conservative rate of 5.5 percent a year would yield close to $10.3 million. 
The price of rare violins makes it virtually impossible for individuals to afford them. In Europe, the Middle East, and Japan, governments or businesses purchase these instruments and lend them for little or no fee. The Fuji Corporation owned the Jupiter Stradivari that Midori played in 1991. Mr. Machold estimated he has sold $25 million worth of string instruments to the National Bank of Austria, including seven Stradivari and two Guarneri del Gesu violins, which are on loan to, among others, members of the Vienna Philharmonic. 
Giuseppe Guarneri (1699-1774), considered the greatest member of his family of Italian instrument makers, was known as Gesu (Jesus) because he signed his handiwork with a cross. His violin is preferred by most soloists over the more common Stradivari, primarily for its ability to soar over an orchestra. Midori, Anne-Sophie Mutter and Pinchas Zukerman play them, as did Jascha Heifetz and Fritz Kreisler. Mr. McDuffie said about 100 del Gesu violins still exist, as opposed to nearly 700 Stradivari. 
Mr. Machold, who also has offices in Bremen, Germany; Zurich; Vienna; and Tokyo, is eager to point out the potential for huge profits. "Prices never go down for these instruments," said Mr. Machold, who holds 3.5 of the $100,000 shares. "They only go up." But the other partners take a less sanguine view. 
"I certainly didn't commit with the expectation that it's going to provide an economic return that is better than other alternatives," said John Townsend, a del Gesu partner who is also a partner in Goldman, Sachs, the investment bankers. "That really isn't what it's about for me. It's about my friendship with Bobby and my interest in his career. The more I learned about the importance of this instrument to how he defines himself as an artist, the more I realized that we had to find a way to make this happen."
Mr. McDuffie realized that he would have to come out from behind the violin to attract investors, he said. "As one family member said to me, 'It's going to be hard to convince business people in America that a piece of wood costs $3.5 million.' And that turned out to be true. I had to come to terms with the fact that these people were investing in me, more than they were in the violin. It became very personal."
A well-established, highly respected violinist who has performed extensively in the United States, Europe and Asia, Mr. McDuffie favors contemporary repertory -- this season he is playing concertos by both John Adams and Philip Glass -- yet is adept with the lyrical war horses of Mendelssohn and Bruch as well.
The partners range from heavy-hitting Wall Street types to parents of Mr. McDuffie's 10-year-old daughter's classmates to the commissioner of the National Football League. About the only thing they have in common -- aside from some spare cash -- is an interest in Mr. McDuffie and his career.
"We wanted Bobby to continue his rise to the top of his profession," said the N.F.L. commissioner, Paul Tagliabue, a longtime friend. "And this seemed like the only way it was going to get done. There has to be some way for talented Americans to have access to these instruments."
While it is hard to imagine an American bank buying a rare violin and lending it for altruistic purposes, there are individual American collectors, like Herbert Axelrod in Allenhurst, N.J., who lend instruments from their collections. Leasing an instrument from a limited partnership is, by all accounts, unique. 
Mr. McDuffie said he arrived at the idea after a great deal of trial and error, not to mention disillusionment. Five years ago, "I actually thought finding $3.5 million would be a slam dunk," he said. "I had fallen in love with the violin of my dreams, and I thought I could tap into the Southern 'We're so proud of you, Bobby' thing." Mr. McDuffie is from Macon, Ga.; his wife, Camille, a book publicist, is from Atlanta, where her father, Mack Taylor, now retired, was arguably the city's most successful real estate magnate.
Early in 1996 Mr. McDuffie approached James B. Williams, a family friend who at the time was chairman of SunTrust Banks Inc. in Atlanta. "I was sure SunTrust would buy this violin, and I would promote the bank all around the world," Mr. McDuffie said. "But then Jimmy said, 'Well, it's great you play in Hong Kong, but we don't really care about Hong Kong.' "
Then there was the bank loan strategy, with 18 partners paying $10,000 each annually on a 6 percent loan. "That never got off the ground either," Mr. McDuffie said. "But it did make me realize I was in for a rough ride."
Having arrived at the limited partnership plan by the summer of 1998, he went looking for investors. A series of by-invitation-only soirees ensued in the designer homes of well-heeled friends and family members. To draw up his guest lists, "I pulled out the Rolodex," said Mr. McDuffie, who would play and talk about the instrument. Then Mr. Machold would discuss its pedigree (and his own).
Mr. Tagliabue and his wife, Chan, were at the first party, in January 1999. They were not quite ready to invest, they said, but they were intrigued enough to be hosts for additional gatherings. One took place in February 2000 in Atlanta at the home of Mr. Taylor. Guests included Senator Sam Nunn; Taylor Smith, owner of the Atlanta Falcons; and the bassist for the band R.E.M., Mike Mills, a childhood friend of Mr. McDuffie's.
"I've always been moved by Bobby's playing," said Mr. Mills, who became a partner. "I saw it as a remarkable chance to join in with a real diverse group of people and see an old friend of mine better able to express his talent."
The guest list at the final evening, last May at the Tagliabues' New York apartment, included a friend of the commissioner's who agreed to add the final $1 million to the pot. (He insisted on anonymity.) At last Mr. McDuffie and the partnership had reached their goal. 
"Giving money to a project like this is so much more personal than just sending a check to the Metropolitan," said Mr. Machold. But the partners do not get the same tax break. Mr. Tagliabue jokingly called his investment "a charitable contribution without a deduction."
Still, as Mr. Machold pointed out: "You do get your money back after 23 years. And there's the player. You can touch him."
Mr. McDuffie said he would perform at two private concerts a year for his partners, who will be kept up to date on his career through a newsletter. They will also be invited to an annual event at Mr. Machold's Castle Eichbuchl in southern Austria. 
"I can see more people, as they think about their commitment to the arts, doing this," said Mr. Townsend. "Instead of buying a $100,000 painting, why not invest in a violin? Especially if they have a personal relationship with the artist."

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Feb. 6 about a group investment in the 18th-century instrument played by the violinist Robert McDuffie misstated the birth and death years of its maker, Giuseppe Guarneri, known as Gesu. He lived from 1698 to 1744 -- not 1699 to 1774.

HEADLINE: Europe Is One -- Until Disaster Strikes 

BYLINE:  By Tony Judt; Tony Judt is director of the Remarque Institute at New York University.

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
There are two versions of what is happening in Europe. One asserts that things couldn't be going better for the European Union. The Germans are in the driver's seat, confidently leading everyone else (including the reluctant French) toward a larger, more integrated community. The German foreign minister is bursting with ambitious projects for a European presidency and a European constitution. Productivity is up, unemployment down. Wim Duisenberg, president of the European Central Bank, can hardly contain his satisfaction at the prospect of a recession in the United States and the resurgence of the euro. The hour of Europe has struck. We are the masters now!
 Seen through a darker glass, however, the Continent is awash in scandal. Well-attested charges of influence-peddling, graft, money laundering and illegal party funding have brought down senior ministers and retired statesmen in Britain, Germany and France. The Italian and Belgian courts are still poring over the lurid political crimes of decades past. The political class in West Europe stands lower in public esteem than at any point in recent memory. And then there is the crisis in public health. 
 Today's European medical scandals take two forms. The first is government irresponsibility. The worst case involved H.I.V.-tainted blood in French hospital transfusions in the mid-1980's: 4,000 mostly hemophiliac patients were given the blood, and hundreds died. A blood-screening test was available from an American company, but the French health ministry had banned it -- preferring to wait, the families of the victims charged, for a competing French product to come on the market. In a trial concluded last year, the ministers concerned were held blameless even though the facts about the government's response were not in dispute. One of those tried, Laurent Fabius, is now the French finance minister.
The other kind of scandal involves administrative incompetence and private greed. Across the Continent there is a steadily rising panic about bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease. Cattle appear to get mad cow because they were fed recycled bits of dead sheep and other animals. Humans who eat infected cattle risk contracting a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; so far 92 people have died -- 88 of them in Britain, where the disease was first diagnosed and where 180,000 cases of mad cow have been found in cattle to date.
Faced with an incipient epidemic, the British government finally came clean two years ago, had all older cattle killed and instituted universal testing of livestock. In other affected countries, the initial reaction was the same as in Britain: It isn't happening, and if it is, don't acknowledge it. Public ignorance was preferable to the only expedient response, which was to slaughter all the infected herds, test the remaining cattle and publicize the known risks. That remedy is hugely expensive and a disaster for the farmers.
French and other European governments confined themselves to banning the import of British livestock and cattle feed, politically popular measures that did little to halt the spread of the disease. Then came the news that mad cow had spread to continental Europe and that four more individuals had died from Creutzfeldt-Jakob. Meat consumption collapsed, and prices with it. Farmers were angry and desperate. 
Finally, the Europeans began to act. The Germans, who had insouciantly denied that the problem even concerned them, admitted the presence of mad cows on their soil and last week announced a plan to slaughter 400,000 cattle. And on Dec. 4, the European Union banned the use of animal products in cattle feed and ordered the removal of all cattle over the age of 30 months unless they were tested and proved to be disease-free. Because testing capacity is limited, more than two million cattle are likely to be slaughtered.
The mad cow scandal ought to be a tremendous opportunity for Brussels to flex its muscles. After all, the one thing an oversize bureaucracy should be good at is protecting public health. National governments are in thrall to electorates, pressure groups and self-interest, but the European Commission answers to no one and can thus do the right thing without impediment.
Unfortunately, reality is otherwise. The only way European governments will accede to the recent commission directives is if the European Union takes the blame -- and foots the bill (the belated German agreement to destroy suspect herds is contingent on Brussels footing half the $300 million cost). But this means countries must increase their own contributions to the union's budget, which they are extremely reluctant to do.
Instead, European governments proceed incrementally, stonewalling and blaming foreign governments for their domestic predicaments. France still bans British beef. The Finnish representatives in Brussels agreed only with great reluctance to the latest European Union directives. Their animals, they insisted (as the French and Germans had), were unaffected.
The outcome is thus the opposite of what might be expected. Brussels issues orders, which are then loudly protested in each individual country, and then the E.U. is condemned by press and public for being ineffective. The E.U. seems to be just an abstraction -- except when it is blamed in the tabloids for allowing diseased meat and other pollution across unpoliced national borders. Meanwhile, hapless European consumers can turn only to their own governments. Tony Blair, Lionel Jospin and Gerhard Schroder may seem irresponsible, cynical and even incompetent, but at least they are familiar and local: you can always vent your fear and fury on them at the next election.
Peter Sutherland, a former European commissioner from Ireland, recently dismissed polls suggesting that Europeans are increasingly skeptical about European integration. These worries, he intimated, were an insignificant hangover from the benighted "petty nationalisms" of the past. That is one view of Europe today. If only it were true.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS; 
30-Year Treasuries Rise a Bit On Speculation Sales Will End

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury bonds prices were mixed yesterday with the 30-year bond rising on speculation the government's sale of 30-year debt this week may be one of the last.
 Investors clamored for bonds since a Treasury advisory panel last week held an informal vote to eliminate sales of the debt after August. That would enhance the value of bonds whose prices are already buoyed as the government buys back the high-cost debt with money from budget surpluses. 
 "There is an antique bid for the 30-year" bond, said Sam Paddison, who helps manage $16 billion at Evergreen Institutional Asset Management in Philadelphia. "They are all going to go and buy them because there aren't going to be anymore," though they may already be overvalued, he said.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 9/32, to 111 1/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.49 percent from 5.51 percent on Friday.
The 10-year Treasury note fell 6/32, to a price of 104 11/32. Its yield rose to 5.17 percent from 5.14 percent.
Bonds gained 21.3 percent last year as the Treasury bought back $30 billion of the debt, a program that has continued this year.
Treasury notes did not get the same boost, and fell as some bond dealers sold current issues to force prices lower on the $22 billion in 4 3/4- and 10-year debt set for sale today and tomorrow, traders said. Another $10 billion in 30-year bonds is set for Thursday. Primary dealers are required to bid, though not buy, at government sales.

HEADLINE: Obtaining Loans Got Harder in Last 3 Months, Survey Says 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5 

 BODY:
Worried bankers kept toughening their terms for loans to businesses and consumers the last three months as they grew more concerned that they might not be repaid, according to a Federal Reserve survey released today.
 "In general, banks indicated that the most important reasons for tightening standards and terms were a worsening economic outlook and a reduced tolerance for risk," said the report, which surveyed 57 large American banks and 24 branches of foreign-owned banks operating in the United States. 
 The results of the previous such survey were issued in mid-November. The new one said 60 percent of domestic banks tightened terms for lending to larger companies the last three months, and 80 percent of foreign banks imposed stiffer terms for customers seeking commercial and industrial loans. 
"Lending terms also firmed noticeably on the consumer side," the survey reported. It said "a much larger fraction of domestic banks" had tightened their terms for consumer loans than in November, although they had not changed standards for home mortgage loans.
The Fed said banks reported weaker demand for loans, but noted that mortgage applications on average had remained steady after falling in the November survey.
"Changes in demand for residential mortgages were quite disparate across respondents, with 30 percent reporting stronger demand and an equal fraction reporting weakness," the Fed said. "By contrast, about 33 percent of banks, on net, reported weaker demand for home mortgages in the November survey."
The report echoed Fed studies from previous months that said banks were exercising more caution in lending. In November, the Fed reported that 44 percent of domestic banks and 80 percent of foreign banks had tightened their lending standards the previous three months.
Lending standards have become stricter because the economy has slowed from its previous blistering pace. A slowing economy raises the risk that firms and individuals may be unable to repay loans if profits and incomes falter.
Some economists have said that bank lending standards became too slack the last several years and that tightening loan conditions would be a healthy development.
But some analysts worry that the United States may soon be faced with lending standards that are so tight that companies and consumers cannot obtain loans. Such a development could harm the already fragile economy by reducing business investment and consumer spending, two key drivers of the record economic expansion.

HEADLINE: Empty Aisles and Empty Stores; 
What Happens When Anchor Stores Weigh Anchor?

BYLINE:  By LESLIE KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
Bradlees was the first to give up the fight. Then Montgomery Ward's, the long-troubled retailer, declared bankruptcy in late December, concluding that consumer spending was too soft to prop it up through the upcoming year. Soon after retailers like J. C. Penney, Sears, ShopKo, and OfficeMax all announced store closings.
 It is not unusual for some bad news to pop up in the retailing business right after Christmas -- many troubled stores insist on hanging on through December in hopes that the holiday spending surge will deliver a Frank Capra-style miracle. But this year's wave of distress is deeper and broader than any in a decade, according to lenders, liquidators and bankruptcy experts. The problems signal that the nation's merchants and their suppliers, already over-extended, are probably about to experience a painful shake-out, where chains are forced to close or scale back their ambitions. 
 "Bradlees and Montgomery are the edge of the curve," said Harvey Miller, who is in charge of the restructuring practice at the law firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges. "What they are demonstrating is that there are major weaknesses in the market." 
Moody's Investors Service said the likelihood that publicly held retail companies will default sometime this year on a bank loan, outstanding bond or other form of debt has doubled from the beginning of 2000. That represents a surge in weakness that makes retailing the second-most-vulnerable industry -- behind telecommunications -- said David Hamilton, a risk analyst at Moody's.
The list of retailers whose stocks, bonds, or bank debt has sunk to distressed levels in the last year is long and ugly. Depressed prices do not, of course, indicate that bankruptcy is imminent, or even that store closures will be necessary, but they do usually indicate that a company's financial position has become particularly fragile.
The indicators are everywhere.
There has been a rise in the number of companies whose bank debt is suddenly thought to be worth a lot less than it was just a few months ago. "In the last year there has been a greater number of distressed loans in the retail sector," said Marc Lasry, managing director of Amroc Investments Inc., the country's largest broker-dealer of distressed debt.
A bank that owns part of a loan to Warnaco, the manufacturer of Calvin Klein jeans and underwear, for example, recently offered to sell the loan to any bidder that would pay 55 cents on the dollar. It got no takers, according to Amroc, which facilitates private trades of bank debt.
The private market for the bank debt of Revlon has also sunk beneath 90 cents on the dollar, Amroc said. 
Credits ratings are falling almost as quickly as the Nasdaq was last year. In the past four months alone, Moody's has downgraded the debt of both Saks and ShopKo Stores from investment quality to junk. Dillard's and J. C. Penney, are having their credit reviewed by Moody's. If they are downgraded, both would see their credit slip from investment grade to junk.
And while stock prices for retailers as a whole have risen lately, partly on expectations that the recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve will help revive consumer confidence and partly due to stronger-than-expected January sales, many retailers are suffering from sharply lower prices on Wall Street.
Among the stocks trading beneath the bargain basement price of 50 cents a share are Lechter's, the houseware chain, and Today's Man, which was delisted from Nasdaq in July. 
Delia's, a retailer to teenage girls, is off its 52-week high of $13.75 a share and is trading under $5. Last November, Delia's merged with iTurf, an e-commerce operation it had actually launched itself and then spun off as its own entity. The company's spokesperson, Amanda Mullin, said, "We do not believe that evaluating the company on the basis of the stock price of a single pre-merger entity is an accurate reflection of the combined entity's performance."
There are plenty of strong retailers out there, of course. No one thinks skilled operators like Wal-Mart Stores, Target and Gap cannot thrive in a downturn. They may actually benefit from carnage elsewhere. A wave of bankruptcies not only leaves less competition, but also offers an abundance of empty stores and brand name trademarks that can be snapped up for a bargain. 
Yet even as the Fed is attempting to ride to the rescue, industry gatherings are rife with whispers about the weakest of the weak, about chains closing some stores in hopes of saving the rest, and of consolidations across the retailing landscape aimed at eliminating some of the excess retailing space that sprouted in the boom of the 1990's.
"I've been doing this for 14 years," said Stewart Cohen, a partner in the Ozer Group, a liquidation and restructuring firm based in Needham, Mass., "and there is nothing like what we have experienced in the last 30 days in terms of the number of stores and the billions of inventory up for liquidation."
Numerous factors are putting pressure on the industry. First and foremost is the economy. Consumer confidence in the nation's near-term economic health has plummeted to its lowest point since 1993, the Conference Board, a business research concern in New York, reported last week. Retailing is always among the first to feel the effects of a consumer pullback in lower sales and profits.
Retailers are also being hurt by their own over-enthusiasm. During the boom of the second half of the 1990's, retail companies expanded operations at a brisk, some say suicidal, pace. Retail square footage in this coutry increased by nearly a billion square feet, or 10 percent, for the five years from 1995 to 2000, according to Economy.com, a consulting firm based in West Chester, Pa., that closely follows national and regional economic trends.
The Ames Department Store chain is an example of a merchant that has paid a price for its optimism. In 1998, the chain snapped up the 155 outlets of Hills Stores to add to 301 of its own. It was a bold move considering that regional department stores like Ames were just beginning to face crushing competition from national competitors like Wal-Mart and Target and that Ames itself had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1990, a result of too much debt from a previous acquisition.
When the economy went flat in 2000, Ames found itself struggling and in November of last year it announced it would close 32 stores, 31 of them from the Hills acquisition. The price of Ames' stock and its bonds tumbled in 2000 and were trading at very depressed levels until January of this year when GE Capital extended an $800 million line of credit.
"Maybe projections should have been more pessimistic," said Rolando de Aguiar, the company's chief financial and administrative officer, "but back then people just did not believe we could come out of a year with 6.2 percent growth and go flat."
Ames is far from alone in paying for industry expansion. Lenders are increasingly anxious about the mid-decade boom.
"There is no doubt that credit is tightening," said Andrew Moser, senior managing director at Wells Fargo Retail Finance, one of the nation's leading asset-based lenders to retailers. "In many of the nation's top banks, the level of nonperforming loans has increased continuously. So there is a lot of pressure internally from within these institutions or from regulators to re-evaluate loan portfolios."
Speeding the rate and severity of the credit cutback is the fact that the retail lending community has itself consolidated considerably in the last decade, leaving the fate of needy merchants primarily in the hands of fewer than a dozen major banks and other lenders known as factors.
And for the weakest retailers -- those contemplating bankruptcy -- the incentive for their lenders is to file early and get ahead of other retailers who might have fire sales that depress the value of everyone's inventories of clothing, housewares and the like. If enough merchants have been mortally wounded, it could depress prices long into the future.
"To the extent that there is a significant number of store closings, it could create a spiral effect," said Robert Pressman, chief executive, of Newmark Retail Financial Advisors, a consulting firm. "If a lot of retailers run going-out-of-business sales at once, the value of the inventory drops and it becomes a general industry problem."
The question now is whether the weakness among some retailers can be contained. It is possible that the cut in interest rates by the Fed will spur consumers to spend, thus slowing or stopping the cycle of bankruptcies. 
But at the mall level, store closings can also hurt merchants located nearby.
"With store closings by Penney's and Ward's taking place at the same time, you are going to see gigantic empty stores in malls, all on the market at the same time," said Larry Gottlieb, who runs the bankruptcy department at the law firm of Kronish Lieb Weiner and Hellman in New York. "What happens to businesses in the malls with two empty anchors?"

HEADLINE: Tunnel Vision; 
A Die-Hard Few Cling to Those Tokens

BYLINE:  By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
They are creatures of habit. They remember better days gone by. They don't trust technology. They frustrate economic theorists, refusing to change their behavior in exchange for a bargain.
 In the language of marketing, they are known as the nonadopters. 
 The rest of us can think of them as the token people.
And they are a dwindling breed, one that knows its days are numbered. New York City Transit reported last month that MetroCard users now represent more than 81 percent of the fare-paying public. The agency also said recently that within the next two years it expected to start phasing out tokens, which have served as tiny relics of the true New York since the first ones were minted in 1953.
Most people with reservations about switching have already put them aside in the seven years since the MetroCard was introduced.
But the token people, like the last old settlers to come down from the hills, are the ones who say they will hold out until the last token slot is welded shut.
"Other people can do what they want to do," said Jimmy Harris, a 50-year-old porter, who grew almost defiant the other day at the Times Square subway station when asked why he does not use MetroCards. "I like tokens, that's why."
All around them, the token people have seen their friends and co-workers slowly lose that certain jingle in their pockets.
Of course, this switch has not always been easy for the millions who have made it.
Staking out a token booth for a couple of hours, one can still detect a high level of affection for the token, an affection that seems mostly to do with urban practicality.
Flimsy cards can get bent. They can get lost in wallets, wallets that must be pulled out and exposed to thieves while lost cards are being fumbled for. The cards can also lose their magnetic whatchamacallit or require you to swipe them 10 times. But, unless you happen to get caught in a metal press on your way to the turnstile, your token will always work.
The other benefit to the token in many riders' minds is that it requires no math. One token equals one ride. It does not offer a discount, but it will also never be hiding an extra ride within it somewhere that you have forgotten about.
M. A. Horn, a credit manager, really, really did not want to switch. And he's still mad about it. "They forced me to do it," he exclaimed the other day outside a Times Square turnstile. "And they force me to buy lots of trips. If I don't, then I'm passing up free trips. And then I'm a fool." (Mr. Horn has clearly spent too much time thinking about this. He called a reporter later to explain that he had calculated that a penniless homeless person would have to redeem 300 bottles or cans to gather enough money to purchase a $15 MetroCard, the cheapest card that offers a volume discount. "Think of that!" Mr. Horn said.)
Norman Siegel, a civil liberties lawyer, did not want to switch either. Like everyone else, he gave in mostly because of the discounts. But he still does not use a credit card when he buys his MetroCard. And he still worries, every time he stands before a MetroCard machine, about the ability of the government to track people who use the card.
"I don't want them knowing where I'm going, even though I'm as innocent as anyone in the city and as lawful as anyone in the city," he said. "And you don't have to be paranoid to think that way."
Many of the true token people feel the same way, except they will not be dissuaded by discounts.
Carlos Fernandez, 23, a senior at the State University of New York in Purchase, reported by e-mail that when he tried out the MetroCard, he felt as if he were entering a kind of government-controlled "Area 51, where every little bit of information and detail is scrutinized."
In his message, he added: "Who will be there to open the gate manually when the M.T.A. computers befall a belated Y2K? In the era of online hackers, one can never be too certain."
Nick Liopiros, a waiter, is among that rarest of token people, one who has never even tried a MetroCard. "Forty one years in city, only token," he said. "This MetroCard, no. Never." He added: "With me is strong habit."
But that might be changing. Mr. Liopiros was asked if he felt a certain amount of pride in stubbornly passing up the discounts offered by the MetroCard. His countenance quickly changed. He leaned his stubbly face in close to the questioner.
"They give discount?"

HEADLINE: Setting Tempo at a Charter School; 
Bronx Prep Offers a Teacher Plenty of Room to Improvise

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN 

 BODY:
He is the maitre d'hotel, sprinkling firm handshakes around the breakfast buffet of Cheerios and apple juice. He is the drill sergeant, conducting backpack inspections at lunch.
 He is the Pied Piper leading star pupils in the island rap song "Who Let the Dogs Out" as they traipse across a movie theater parking lot, the reading coach tapping drumstick to table as struggling students sound out each word: wait, paint, sail, main, fail. 
 And on Saturday mornings, that music spilling down the stairs comes from the third-floor classroom where Jesus Concepcion conducts an orchestra of 57 youngsters who first picked up instruments when they met him last summer.
Hired as a 10-hour-a-week music teacher when the Bronx Preparatory Charter School opened its doors in August in the Morrisania section of the South Bronx, Mr. Concepcion has become the school's go-to guy. Now on staff full-time, his business cards say director of enrichment, but Mr. Concepcion also teaches and tutors reading and math as well as arts appreciation, and sets the disciplinary tone with a tough-love blend of terror and teasing that has won the hearts of the black and Latino children he calls "my son," "my brother," "my queen." 
Like any startup, a charter school in its first year confronts many challenges -- say, breakfast supervision -- not quite anticipated by the business plan. That, in turn, provides young staff members like Mr. Concepcion, 27, an uncertified teacher with an emergency teaching credential, the chance to reinvent themselves in roles -- say, reading teacher -- they had not imagined.
"We didn't sit down and say, 'You do this, and you do that,' " he said with a shrug. "I was never told that I had to do breakfast and I had to do lunch. It just happened because I was there. And now I have to be there."
There are extraordinary teachers picking up extra tasks at every successful school. But charter schools, in which entrepreneurs create ambitious educational programs that use public funds but are free of most state regulation, demand such flexibility, initiative and long hours from everyone. A recent study by Caroline Hoxby, a Harvard economist, found that charter school employees teach 13.4 hours a week more than what is required, compared with 8.6 extra hours per week for their public school counterparts.
At Bronx Prep, the schedule can switch weekly, even daily, with teachers forced to cover others' classes on a few minutes' notice. Like Mr. Concepcion, everyone runs at least one reading section, using an intensive phonics program. 
In August, there were computer work stations to assemble. This fall, the entire staff helped write the school's accountability plan, and now teachers are having dinner meetings to plan recruiting and curriculum for next year.
Before anybody discussed holiday decorations, a reading teacher had gift-wrapped classroom doors in shiny paper and big bows. A math teacher is helping design Bronx Prep's expansion through high school. On Sundays, the science teacher often shops for supplies, while a reading teacher sometimes takes girls to the movies. And when a boy's alcoholic father died last fall, Mr. Concepcion brought the child home to Cliffside Park, N.J., for the weekend.
"He demonstrates what charter schools crave in a startup team," Kristin Kearns Jordan, Bronx Prep's director, said of Mr. Concepcion, known as Mr. C. "Recognizing a need and jumping in."
On the day Bronx Prep's 100 fifth and sixth graders returned from a two-week winter break, Mr. C had 90 free minutes between 7:30 a.m. breakfast and 5 p.m. dismissal.
He helped Ms. Jordan teach the word of the day, "justice," at a morning meeting; ran his two 15-student phonics sessions; had two periods of arts appreciation, each with 50 pupils; met with his advisory group for 45 minutes; and conducted an hourlong orchestra rehearsal. 
Someone was out sick, so he also inherited the entire sixth grade for an hour and a half just before lunch.
With Martin Luther King's Birthday approaching, Mr. Concepcion found a crutch in a video biography of the civil rights hero. But the television he lugged upstairs was broken. By the time a second TV worked, the VCR refused to. Children were coming through the door, and he had no lesson plan.
"Take out your 'I have a dream' speech,' " the impromptu social-studies teacher ad-libbed. Soon, pupils packed into tight rows were reciting Dr. King's words, stumbling through the new vocabulary -- "promissory note," "emancipation," "tranquillity," "invigorating" -- and debating the unfinished civil rights agenda.
"What do you want?" Mr. Concepcion asked the class.
Johnny Menzies offered, "We want to be able to vote, to have expensive jobs, to live in fancy houses, to have everything the white man has."
Eric Sanchez added, "We want to be able to be truly equal." 
Mr. Concepcion, who is half Dominican and half Puerto Rican and grew up just a few blocks from the school, prodded further: "What are we still fighting for?"
Tayisha Western proclaimed, "Freedom."
Johnny said, "To be able to wear whatever you want without being judged by what you wear."
Joseph Cordero added, "To pick your own job."
Whether teaching history or the origins of the bass and treble clefs, Mr. Concepcion keeps tight control of his classroom with a sharp eye and booming voice, easily engaging even groups of 50 or 100 children. 
He mixes charm and chastisement as easily as he switches from English to fluent Spanish, and breaks lessons into digestible parts, reviewing relentlessly. Routinely singling out students by name, he alternates between hollering and heh-heh-heh, eyes bulging in anger one minute, teeth bared in a smile the next.
A dapper dresser who buys discount designer shoes in the Dominican Republic and wears a shiny watch and a bracelet plus a ring on each hand, Mr. C keeps a meticulous classroom of swept floors, chairs in perfect lines. It is often freezing in his third-floor domain, but coats are forbidden. Students' backs must never touch their chairs. Gum is verboten. Every index finger must follow along when someone reads aloud.
The children, eager to please a teacher they love, respond with almost undivided attention. In a reading session one morning, fifth graders tapped feet in time as they shouted sounds and words like cheerleaders at a football game.
When Mr. C stepped into the hallway to meet a surprise visitor, they continued uninterrupted.
"The trick to being a good teacher is to be able to break it down for people," he explained. "There's that gift of being able to dominate their attention and being able to draw them in.
"I think I could teach anything."
Mr. Concepcion is one of several defining elements of Bronx Prep imported from the KIPP Academy, a charter school about a mile away that has earned national recognition and is being replicated around the country. Bronx Prep's principal, Marina Bernard Damiba, was among the founding teachers at KIPP, which stands for the Knowledge Is Power Program; in addition to Mr. Concepcion, she brought a reading teacher with her and has hired KIPP's professional developer, Frederick Shannon, as a consultant.
Both schools have long hours and an extended school year. Both use the "Shannon Plan," organizing every lesson around a clear aim, which is written on the board along with an agenda, and assessing monthly reading skills with pre- and post-tests. The walls of both buildings are papered with inspirational sayings -- "Team always beats individual" is a KIPP staple, "TEAM: Together Everyone Achieves More" a Bronx Prep motto.
And both have impressive orchestral programs featuring violins, a rarity in such poor, minority neighborhoods.
Yet if the schools look like sisters, they are estranged. In bringing capitalism to public education, the charter movement also creates intense competition -- for attention, for private funds, for talent. So while leaders of both schools say their mutual success will benefit the community, they do not cooperate in tackling shared problems like the search for a long-term facility. In fact, they seldom speak.
Much of the enmity surrounds Mr. Concepcion, who originally planned to remain at KIPP full-time this year, moonlighting at Bronx Prep (he also works a few hours a week at Aquinas High School in the Bronx). 
But at KIPP, he was second fiddle to Charles Randall, a renowned orchestra director who had taught young Jesus to play the violin back in sixth grade at Intermediate School 166, a public school nearby, and plans to retire next year. Mr. Concepcion quit KIPP just before Labor Day, seeing more opportunity in Bronx Prep, which plans to expand through grade 12. "Just the idea that it was going to be my baby," he said. 
Mr. C's love affair with music began as a grade-school crush. "There was this pretty girl in the orchestra," he said. "Her name was Melissa Torres. I said, I want to be in the orchestra, I want to play whatever she's playing. You know what happens with kids, we started to hate each other," he said, laughing. "She was first chair. By the end of sixth grade, I had the chair."
He soon joined the elite citywide orchestra, and was admitted to La Guardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts, then Manhattan School of Music. Just a year old when his father, a guitarist, committed suicide, landing his mother, a nurse's aide, on welfare, Mr. Concepcion proudly repaid his private violin tutor $600 for hours of discount lessons once he had grown up. Soon Mr. Concepcion realized he favored conducting over playing, and teaching most of all. "Most of my kids don't have an ear," he said of the children he auditioned this summer by asking them to repeat a series of clapping rhythms. "I didn't have an ear -- but I had a love for it."
Bronx Prep planned a 40-student orchestra, but now 57 crowd in for rehearsals three afternoons a week and on Saturday mornings, while others pester Mr. C every day trying to join (the school has spent about $40,000 on equipment). As they enter the room, the children chant, "Stick count four, stick count four," and stomp out four beats before sitting in unison. Often, after the group plays well, Mr. C will say, "Do it again, it was probably a mistake."
One Saturday, Ayana Gotay, a fifth-grade violinist, showed up 25 minutes late for rehearsal, so Mr. Concepcion -- after screaming at her -- made her stand at the front of the room, hands folded, for 25 minutes. When Sharif Jamel, a drummer had a "bad rhythm day," Mr. C gave him two leaves of a plant to bang together. Robert Brunner, a keyboardist, was suspended a few days before the winter concert for not doing his homework.
"I'm not going to accept anything less than perfect," Mr. Concepcion erupted one day, catching a drummer off tempo. "You were daydreaming, and you went on automatic. When you're a musician, you can't do that."
He quizzed the violinists, solo, on "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star." Alex Marcano got booted from the first chair because he did not have rosin in his case. One by one, they squeaked out the notes, Mr. Concepcion interrupting after each mistake to rotate players, until Christian Green, a quiet sixth grader, ended up in the hot seat.
"There's a title for that chair, it's concert master," Mr. Concepcion said. "The person who's sitting there is there because they busted their butts to get there. You are setting the example for all of the orchestra."

HEADLINE: DiFrancesco Faces Cameras In New Jersey 

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Feb. 5 

 BODY:
Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco today told New Jersey residents that he would fight to lower property taxes, end racial profiling and improve children's health, all in his first few months in office, while he assured state lawmakers that he would work closely with them, a break from the practice of his predecessor, Christie Whitman.
 Mr. DiFrancesco, the Republican president of the State Senate who is also a candidate for a full term as governor in this year's elections, billed his first televised speech to the Legislature as a message to the people of New Jersey. 
But he appealed most directly to the assembled lawmakers, calling on them to put "people ahead of politics."
"I do believe in consensus," he said, adding: "While my title may have changed, I promise that my commitment to this partnership will never end." The line prompted his only standing ovation.
If Mr. DiFrancesco's talk of bipartisanship echoed President Bush's, his small-bore agenda seemed to borrow liberally from Mrs. Whitman, who resigned on Wednesday to lead the federal Environmental Protection Agency. 
The acting governor proposed a new "workplace basic skills program" to help those at the bottom end of the economic ladder make themselves more marketable to employers. And he said he would ask his new education commissioner to set up "the very best teacher training, retention and recruitment program in the nation."
"New Jersey is already the best place in which to live, work and raise a family," Mr. DiFrancesco said, repeating Mrs. Whitman's well-worn line. "Let's also make it the best place to teach a child."
While Mr. DiFrancesco praised his predecessor, he also unveiled a style markedly different from that of Mrs. Whitman, who was given to entering the Assembly chamber surrounded by bodyguards and whose aristocratic bearing could be irritating to lawmakers. Reading from notes rather than from a teleprompter, Mr. DiFrancesco spoke plainly, referred several times to his late parents, who immigrated from Italy, and mocked his receding hairline.
But Mrs. Whitman came to Trenton in 1993 as an outsider, while Mr. DiFrancesco has worked here his entire legislative life. And although he had made a point of inviting the public to attend his address today, all but a few seats were filled by lobbyists and political operatives.
Mr. DiFrancesco also confronted the contentious issue of racial profiling, albeit delicately, at a time when Democrats like James E. McGreevey, the Woodbridge mayor who is running for governor, are vowing to hold him accountable for the Whitman administration's failures.
Mr. DiFrancesco neither placed blame nor took responsibility, but spoke generally of calling on New Jersey's tradition of embracing in diversity "as we face the ugly truth of racial profiling."
"This unjustified and unjustifiable practice has divided this state and has hurt the reputation of New Jersey's upstanding law enforcement officers," he said. "It is time for answers, for outreach and for solutions."
Mr. DiFrancesco did not say how he would end racial profiling, but said he awaited the recommendations of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has begun interviewing witnesses in private and is expected to hold public hearings within weeks. "Our commitment to end racial profiling is unwavering," Mr. DiFrancesco said. "But just as strong is our commitment to stand behind the members of law enforcement who deserve our support because they've earned it."
Mr. DiFrancesco devoted much of his 21-minute speech to his previously announced plan to provide greater property tax rebates to homeowners. He wants to double the New Jersey Saver rebate to nearly $500 a year, and to raise the maximum Homestead Rebate, for the elderly and disabled, to $750 from $500.
"Seniors have waited 10 years for an increase," he said. "That's too long. And to make sure they never have to wait again, let's index the Homestead Rebate to inflation. Costs have gone up for our seniors. Help for our seniors must also keep pace."
Democrats were quick to note that Mr. DiFrancesco seemed to sound more like one of them than a Republican, pointing to his proposals for new spending, like a loosely described plan for improving the health of disadvantaged children.
Mr. DiFrancesco said he would travel the state to develop and promote the new "KidsNeeds" program, along with community and religious organizations, teachers, welfare caseworkers and doctors, but he gave no details.
Mr. DiFrancesco's political opponents were quick to point out what was missing from his speech.
Mayor Bret D. Schundler of Jersey City, who is challenging him in the Republican primary, said Mr. DiFrancesco's property tax relief plan avoided any serious effort at reform, because it amounted to keeping income taxes high to reduce property taxes.
"What people want is honest property tax relief," he said. "And what we're giving them is we take with the left hand and give it back with the right, and they know that's not honest tax relief."
Mr. McGreevey, the Democratic candidate, faulted Mr. DiFrancesco's plans for saying nothing of New Jersey's soaring debt burden over the last seven years, and called his proposals too little, too late.
"To announce in February of an election year that 'We'll focus upon property taxes, education and water quality,' after having served as Senate president for nine years, is to underscore his inability or unwillingness to grapple with these threshold issues for the entirety of the Whitman administration," he said. "And with all due respect, where have you been?"

HEADLINE: In Stagnant Japan, Economic and Social Ills Match 

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 5 

 BODY:
For anyone living in gloomy Japan these days, it is easy to forget that just 12 years ago, this country was seen by the United States and much of the world as a juggernaut, 10 feet tall and rising.
 From academic journals to the popular imagination, Japan was perceived as a ruthless predator that borrowed American technology and factory methods to take over the industries of yesterday, today and tomorrow, from steel, transistor radios and televisions, to automobiles, semiconductors and computers. 
 Whether they praised or criticized Japan's methods, the most influential books in the 1980's -- with titles like "Japan as No. 1" -- predicted that Japan would dominate virtually every industry worth being in, and that a United States in decline would be left to play a supporting role.
But the two countries could hardly have followed more different paths, and after more than a decade of slow growth, bankruptcy and record unemployment in Japan, and a resurgence in the United States, the change in the views about Japan is as revealing as any statistic.
With Japan's edge being dulled in industry after industry, either by the United States or by newer rivals in Asia, one of the most widely talked about Japan books these days, written jointly by two Japanese and one American scholar, bears the stark title "Can Japan Compete?" 
And increasingly, experts say Japan will only be able to compete if it looks at the problems more broadly, addressing not just its economic institutions but its politics and the very way Japanese live their lives.
At a discussion devoted to Japan at the recent gathering of economic leaders in Davos, Switzerland, there was much grim talk about the depressed stock prices, the possibility of a banking collapse and what has become a perennial flirtation with recession. In his closing remarks at the session, a leading Japanese industrialist, Minoru Makihara, the chairman of Mitsubishi, reportedly raised a copy of "Can Japan Compete?" and recommended it to the audience.
"The title says it all," said Hirotaka Takeuchi, one of the authors and dean of the new School of International Corporate Strategy at Hito tsubashi University in Tokyo. "Of course the answer is, 'Yes.' But the real question is: Will Japan compete? Does it have the will to compete? The government has basically mistrusted competition, and we are paying the price for that now."
The dramatic sweep of this reversal of fortunes between the world's two largest economies was also captured symbolically in a bit of news last week: The Sega Corporation, a pioneer in an industry that has long been a Japanese franchise, announced that it would stop making video-game consoles, concentrating instead on providing software for newer competitors, including recent entrants into the field like Palm Inc. and Microsoft.
Although they are virtual corporate newborns, Palm and its technological sibling Handspring together already have more than half the market value of Sony, the leader in video-game technology and the most prestigious name in Japanese consumer electronics.
Just as Americans became used to having Toyotas in their driveways and Sonys in their living rooms, Japanese are increasingly having to come to terms with products that say Intel or emit Microsoft's chimes, and with American chains like Starbucks and Costco, which are proliferating. 
For some Japanese, the transition is not comfortable.
If Japan's recent problems were limited to a single industry, like games, they could be brushed off. Instead, in broad fields that have long been strongholds of Japanese industry -- from electronics to auto parts to computer chips -- there has been a decline or a conspicuous leveling in performance.
Indeed, this mirrors Japan's overall economy. While the United States grew at an annual clip of 3.6 percent from 1992 to 2000, Japan limped along at a 1 percent growth rate.
The collapse of stock prices here in 1990 is usually considered the starting point for the crisis. But in a recent analysis titled "Shrinking Japan," the American economist Richard Katz, citing World Bank statistics, showed that the percentage of global exports coming from Japan peaked at 8.8 percent in 1986.
"Japan is virtually the only major country whose exports as a share of G.D.P. were no higher in 1999 (10.4 percent) than in the 1950's (11 percent)," Mr. Katz wrote in the newsletter The Oriental Economist. The share of gross domestic product that American exports accounted for doubled over a similar period, and now slightly exceeds Japan's. 
In fact, the most worrying elements of Japan's economic condition are not reflected in trade data at all but are reflected in internal data: Whether one considers bankruptcies, unemployment or funds for the national pension system, Japan is approaching postwar lows. 
The fearful talk in Tokyo financial circles for more than a month now has been the possible collapse of the banking system. Banks never recovered from the bursting of Japan's speculative bubble in 1990 and remain saddled with an untold (and undisclosed) sea of unrecoverable debts. If defaulting creditors set off a wave of failures, it would mark the second time in two years that Japan has experienced a banking crisis.
"The danger for Japan is not cataclysm," Mr. Katz said in an interview. "The danger is corrosion. There is a great reluctance to believe that the system is broke, and people are living proof of the adage, If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
There is one statistic that seems to have caught people's attention, and it may be the most damaging and difficult to deal with: the shrinking population. Japan has one of the highest percentages of older people in the world, with almost one in five -- 26 million people -- over 65. And their numbers are growing about 1 million a year.
At the same time Japan's fertility rate, the average number of births per woman of child-bearing age, dropped to 1.34 last year, the lowest since 1947 and far lower than the 2.08 needed to maintain a stable population. The number of Japanese is now expected to fall from 127 million now to 100 million by 2050, and only 67 million by the end of the century.
As it stands now, if current trends continue, today's teenagers could face two and a half times the current rates of taxation and expect 30 percent less in pension benefits just to keep the system afloat.
The list of purely economic problems is well known, from the debt hangover caused by foolhardy lending during the bubble, to the heavy regulation that affects almost every aspect of life, to the expensive subsidies that have long cushioned large sectors from competition.
But increasingly, economists and experts are saying Japan's problems are first and foremost political: This is the only major industrial democracy that for the last half century -- except for one brief interruption -- has been governed by the same political group, the Liberal Democratic Party.
And the Liberal Democrats' biggest legacy, economists say, is an aversion to a free market and, above all, to competition.
Just last month, as stock prices in Tokyo flirted again with a 10-year low, Shizuka Kamei, one of the party's most powerful politicians, proposed that the government even find a way to prop up Japanese stocks. 
"There are stupid people who say stupid things, like, 'Just leave it to the market,' " he said. "That's no joke. In a situation where stocks fall for reasons which have nothing to do with the economy, politicians must shoulder their responsibilities."
But Tadashi Nakamae, an economist who is president of Nakamae International Economic Research, and a fierce critic of the government, said, "Japan has had a more socialist economy than, say, the Eastern Europeans.
"Our ruling philosophy has been the convoy system, which means that every company must grow together at the same pace, without true winners or losers. As long as Japan was growing fast, we were blinded to the negative side of this system. But it's time to realize that this kind of structure is impossible to maintain."
Many economists are no less scathing in their criticism of the advice that the United States has offered to Japan. 
The Clinton administration advised Japan to irrigate the economy through heavy deficit spending to avoid a steep recession. Economists say this spending has wasted huge sums of money on public works of dubious utility and merely postponed the day of reckoning for thousands of unprofitable protected companies.
The Bush administration has already quietly shifted the direction of Washington's advice, suggesting that Japan begin reducing its huge fiscal deficits and hinting that the United States will help keep the dollar strong. That, in theory, would help Japanese exporters. 
But growing numbers of economists say the postwar obsession with exports here is a major part of the problem. According to this view, the welfare of Japanese people has been sacrificed in the name of mobilizing the nation's capital toward exports instead of developing goods for local consumption. Japan's electronic brands are known worldwide, but many middle-class Japanese do not own a clothes dryer or a dishwasher. 
Thus, this argument goes, the Japanese have been stuck with tiny, expensive homes in overcrowded neighborhoods, high prices for consumer goods and few affordable options for day care for children or the elderly, which meant women had to remain homemakers to care for both their children and their parents. 
"The Japanese focus has never been on making Japanese richer, their lives happier or more convenient and predictable," said Haruo Shimada, an economist at Keio University. "All of our energy has been focused on competing with the United States. 
"Japan's government has done all sorts of things to help export industry in this cause, but almost nothing for ordinary people. Our future growth will come from an untapped market: investing in satisfying the family, making life happier for people."

LAKE GROVE: POLICE ENCOUNTERS DESCRIBED -- Four women spoke publicly for the first time yesterday about what they described as abusive encounters with Suffolk County police officers. The Suffolk County Police Department's Internal Affairs Bureau and the F.B.I. interviewed the women yesterday. One woman, who gave her name only as Ellie, identified an officer who she said had kissed and fondled her during a traffic stop 15 years ago, then harassed her again in 1998 while she was working at a highway construction site. The police would not comment on that case other than to say that the officer still works at the Fifth Precinct in Patchogue, had been investigated by the Internal Affairs Bureau and was at one point suspended from duty. The officer she named is not the same officer accused of making women disrobe after recent traffic stops. Tina Kelley (NYT)

HAUPPAUGE: HANDICAPPED-PARKING FINES -- A Suffolk County legislator, Andrew Crecca, announced yesterday that he was introducing a bill to raise the fine for parking illegally in spaces reserved for handicapped drivers by at least $100. Under the measure, the county's share of the fine would rise to $150 from $50 for first-time offenders and to $200 from $50 for repeat violators, said Mr. Crecca, a Republican. The state also imposes a penalty, ranging from $50 to $150. Al Baker (NYT)

GARDEN CITY: TAX EVASION CHARGE -- The former head of the union that represents officers with the rank of sergeant and above in Nassau County was charged in a federal indictment yesterday with conspiracy to evade income taxes and filing false tax returns, federal officials said. The charges against the former president of the Nassau Superior Officers Association, William Pattison, grew out of an investigation into a failed health insurance deal that cost the county $40 million in overruns, a federal official said.

ALBANY: PATAKI NAMES SENIOR AIDE -- Gov. George E. Pataki named John P. Cahill, the state's environmental commissioner, to the post of senior policy adviser yesterday. Mr. Cahill, 42, will fill the post occupied by Zenia Mucha, who left the governor's office to take a job with ABC News. Mr. Pataki said Mr. Cahill -- whose new salary is $156,000, up from $136,000 -- would handle a broad portfolio of issues, but said little about the details of the job. Somini Sengupta (NYT)

MANHATTAN: VOCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS -- Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy is urging the State Board of Regents to exempt vocational students from some of the state's strict new graduation requirements. In a letter to the Regents dated last Thursday, Mr. Levy recommended that vocational students be required to pass only the English and mathematics exams, and not the science, American history and world history exams required of other students. In addition, he wrote, vocational students should be offered alternative assessments that measure their grasp of whatever trade they are learning. Most vocational students are now required to pass all five Regents exams.Abby Goodnough (NYT)

CONNECTICUT

HARTFORD: TRIBAL RECOGNITION CRITICIZED -- Following similar calls from state officials, Senator Christopher J. Dodd said he planned to ask the interior secretary, Gail Norton, to review how the Bureau of Indian Affairs considers applications for tribal recognition. Senator Dodd said he would also propose a law to change the bureau's recognition process to make it more responsive to states and towns that would be affected by tribal claims. Paul Zielbauer (NYT)

HARTFORD: ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN SEEN -- State Comptroller Nancy Wyman, in her annual report on state finances, warned yesterday of an economic slowdown and recommended measures to counteract its effect on government. These include increasing the state's emergency budget reserve by a projected $213 million. (NYT)

NEW JERSEY

JERSEY CITY: CARBON MONOXIDE KILLS THREE -- Three men who were using a gasoline-powered generator inside a house were found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning there yesterday morning, the authorities said. The men were described by neighbors as house-sitters and may have been working on the house, at 301 Claremont Avenue, said Battalion Chief George Johns of the Fire Department. The house was almost bare and had no power, and the men were using the generator to run the furnace and the lights, despite warnings on gas generators that they are not to be used in enclosed spaces, Chief Johns said. "It's like running a car engine," he said, adding that an autopsy found very high levels of carbon monoxide in the men's blood. The victims' bodies were found by a friend who went to the house around 7:30 a.m., Chief Johns said. The authorities released the name of only one of the victims, Robert Lee Jones.

NEWARK: SLAIN MAN IDENTIFIED -- Although nearly 300 patrons packed the nightclub where a teenager was shot and killed and seven other people were wounded Sunday, no one has come forward as a witness, the police said. Sgt. Amilkar Velez, a spokesman for the Newark police, said Tyrone Shelton, 17, of Newark was killed in the 2 a.m. shooting at the Jetaway Launge on 16th Avenue. Steve Strunsky (NYT)

NEWARK: NEW JUDICIAL DISTRICT URGED -- Southern New Jersey would have a new judicial district under a bill introduced by Senator Jon S. Corzine that calls for the reorganization of the state's federal judicial system. Mr. Corzine said the 13 counties that would make up the Southern District of New Jersey would have a combined caseload that is higher than all but 36 of the 93 federal court districts.

HEADLINE: The Stock Market Has Made Inmate 90T1282 a Rich Man 

BYLINE:  By TINA KELLEY 

DATELINE: ELMIRA, N.Y. 

 BODY:
On his tax returns, Michael Mathie writes "investor" in the blank reserved for occupation. He claims to have traded more than $8 million in securities since 1998. In 1999, his adjusted gross income was $899,969, all but a sliver in capital gains. He has also invested in a house for his family on Long Island and bought four cars, including a $97,000 Dodge Viper. Plus a garage to keep it in. 
 But here at the Elmira Correctional Facility, a maximum-security state prison where the guards call him "our resident millionaire," Mr. Mathie is formally known as Inmate 90T1282, who has completed almost 12 years of a 10- to 30-year sentence for manslaughter. He is also known for advising and helping pay for other inmates' legal efforts and for providing free legal advice to his fellow prisoners and stock tips to anyone who asks. Given his successes on Wall Street, people listen. 
 "It runs the whole gamut, from lawyers to inmates to everybody," he said in a recent interview. 
Inmates cannot run their own business from prison, but, as a state prison official said, they do not give up their right to free speech. Mr. Mathie's investing is not considered a business because he does not actually conduct the transactions. His father does, making this one of the odder tales of America's infatuation with the stock market.
Mr. Mathie, 33, has no Internet connection, no cell phone, not even a phone in his cell. He makes his trades by calling his father collect from a pay telephone -- up to 10 times a day when the market is more vigorous. His father then places trades on the Internet.
"I could be paying a mortgage with what I pay MCI," he said, adding that he pays his father $500 to $1,200 a month for the calls.
He remembers investing in China Prosperity International Holdings, now China Converge, a foreign company that trades on the Nasdaq, when China's proposed membership in the World Trade Organization was a hot topic. 
"It went from $1 to $10, and the next day it was $18, so I threw $50,000 at it, and called back at 10:30 or 11, and it was at $70," he said. "So I cleared $150,000 and got my $50,000 back in two and a half hours." 
He has also taken his lumps, mostly in paper losses, when tech stocks tanked. He gets chills when he recalls the market plunge of August 1998, when he lost $750,000 in market value in 20 minutes. 
But he remains a true-believing bull, and predicts that the Nasdaq will top 6,500 by the end of 2002, up from its current 2,643. "Definitely, we're not headed for no recession, and if we do go into a recession, it's because of the media," he said. "It's a self-fulfilling prophecy." 
Mr. Mathie, a slight man who looks more like a clerk than a killer, was well acquainted with risk -- but not the financial kind -- when he landed in jail in 1989. He was 21, a high school dropout and former cocaine addict. He and three others had been charged in the murder of Paul Vincent Lamariana, 49, who was hit in the head with a tire iron, choked with an electrical cord, stuffed in plastic bags, wrapped in carpeting and dumped by a road in Oak Beach, Suffolk County. Mr. Mathie admitted that he had hit Mr. Lamariana with the tire iron and choked him. 
Mr. Mathie said that he felt remorseful about the killing, and that some in the group of four friends believed that Mr. Lamariana was abusing the daughter of one of them. He has made inquiries about how he could help Mr. Lamariana's family. 
Contacted in California, Mr. Lamariana's mother declined to speak to a reporter. 
Mr. Mathie pleaded guilty to manslaughter and conspiracy, but said he did so to get out of pretrial detention in the Suffolk County Jail, where he said he was raped and repeatedly sexually abused by the chief of internal security, Roy Fries. 
In 1996, Mr. Mathie won a $750,000 settlement in a federal civil suit; the judge who oversaw the case ruled that the evidence was "overwhelming" and called Mr. Fries's acts "an outrageous abuse of power and authority." No criminal charges were filed, the Suffolk County district attorney's office said, because there was insufficient evidence. (Mr. Fries is retired and did not respond to two phone messages left at his home in Lindenhurst.) 
On appeal, Mr. Mathie's award was reduced to about $500,000. With $75,000 of that, he began trading stocks. 
Jim Flateau, a spokesman for the state's Department of Correctional Services, said inmates are not allowed to have computers or to run businesses from prisons. 
"Certainly, since the transaction is occurring outside prison, it's not something over which we would exercise any control," he said. "Inmates have a First Amendment right to discuss whatever they want on the phone," so long as it is legal. 
Such behind-bars business is very unusual, said Robert Gangi, executive director of the Correctional Association of New York, a nonprofit policy analysis group. 
"Most inmates wouldn't know a stock exchange from a soccer ball," he said. 
Under the "Son of Sam" law, prisoners are not allowed to profit financially from their crimes. An unsuccessful bill proposed by Gov. George E. Pataki in 2000 would have revised the law to allow crime victims to sue convicts for money and property from any source. That bill will be proposed again this year, said Caroline Quartararo, a spokeswoman for the state's Crime Victims Board.
In the meantime, Mr. Mathie continues his daily routine, turning on the television in his cell at 4 a.m. to watch news of the European markets on ABC and PBS; there is no cable for convicts. He receives about a dozen publications that help him make his investment decisions, including The Wall Street Journal, Barron's, Investor's Business Daily, Value Line Investment Survey and Individual Investor. The guards who deliver his mail complain that he gets too much. 
"I compensate them," Mr. Mathie said. "They want to know what stock tips to go on, for their retirement portfolios and so forth." 
He favors a diversified approach. Some of his favorite stocks? Corning, which he expects to double in price; Juniper Networks; JDS Uniphase; and AT&T, which is planning to split into four divisions.
"You can't beat that with a stick," he said. "It's a good long-term hold." 
Technology stocks have been kind to him, and he said he considered their recent turn downward to be "a fabulous buying opportunity." He is particularly fond of Yahoo. 
"Yahoo paid for the Viper," he said, referring to his new 450-horsepower convertible. "I had a picture of one on my wall for three years. I got sick of looking at the picture on my wall, and I ordered one. I put a $1,000 deposit on my Visa, and sent my sister over there. She paid the rest in cash. Same with the garage," a prefab model at his sister's house. 
He has also purchased a Lincoln and a Suburban for each of his two sisters, and a $145,000 house in his Suffolk County hometown, Islip Terrace, for his father, one sister, brother-in-law and nephew. 
He helps other prisoners by putting up money when needed. For example, Mr. Mathie said, he has given $2,000 to pay for the DNA testing of evidence that one inmate, Frank Sterling, believes could clear him of his murder conviction. In addition, he has posted a $25,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of the killer of Steven Maida, the son of a family friend. 
Mr. Mathie has also sent $5,000 to the Office of Prison Ministry of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre, in part to provide a special Christmas breakfast and presents for residents in juvenile detention. When he gets out of prison, he said, he hopes to start a nonprofit organization to help young people. He was denied parole in 2000, and his next parole hearing is in June. 
A Columbia psychology professor and an expert in coping with trauma, Leah Blumberg Lapidus, said Mr. Mathie suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and "massive flashbacks" from his time in the Suffolk County Jail, adding that he needed counseling at least twice a week. 
She testified at a recent trial in which Mr. Mathie maintained that he needed treatment for stress, and she found him ready for parole. 
Thomas F. Liotti, Mr. Mathie's lawyer, also said he should be released. "Way back when he had his legal problems, he probably had those problems because of bad judgment," Mr. Liotti said. "Now it looks to me that he has terrific judgment." 
Mr. Mathie said one of his first priorities outside prison would be to finish college, which he started in prison. Now that the market is slowing, he calls his father only about once a day. But he remains optimistic. 
"I don't believe the fundamentals have changed much," he said. And he offered a prognosis of the first half of the year for the market that perhaps also applies to himself as he heads toward his next parole hearing. 
"The first two quarters until June are going to be tough," he said. "You've just got to stick with it. You've got to have an iron gut."

HEADLINE: A Ford Heir Struggles For Control 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 5 

 BODY:
William Clay Ford Jr., the chairman of the Ford Motor Company, has been frustrated in recent months at being left out of decisions at the company that bears his family's name, people close to Ford's leadership said. 
 Mr. Ford last autumn even raised the idea of appointing a chief operating officer, which would have made him less dependent for information on Jacques Nasser, the company's chief executive and president, these people said. Mr. Nasser opposed the creation of the post, and the idea -- which the company has not talked about publicly -- has been shelved for now. 
 Mr. Ford is not dissatisfied with Mr. Nasser's performance, people close to the two men said, but rather is frustrated at sometimes being left out of the loop on the company's day-to-day operations. 
Indeed, several people said Mr. Ford was particularly irritated that some vice presidents and group vice presidents who report to Mr. Nasser had been cagey about sharing information with him, as well. In recent days, Mr. Ford has begun asking some of them to meet with him regularly.
"He's upset about it; he'd like to be more involved," one of the people close to the company's leadership said. Mr. Ford and Mr. Nasser declined today to provide comment on their working relationship.
A great-grandson of the company's founder, Henry Ford, Mr. Ford, 43, has been chosen by his cousins, aunts and father to represent Ford family interests at what, in terms of sales, remains the world's largest family-controlled enterprise. 
He also has the strong support of Ford Motor's outside directors, the result of having served as chairman of the board's finance committee before he and Mr. Nasser assumed their current posts in January 1999.
And he was trained from boyhood to run a car company, going directly from Princeton University into a succession of nearly two dozen increasingly important posts at Ford Motor.
But Mr. Ford is finding that his title alone does not assure him control of the vast bureaucracy of a company with 335,000 employees. 
In the nearly two decades between the retirement of Mr. Ford's uncle, Henry Ford II, and Mr. Ford's ascension to the top job, the company was run by a succession of professional managers. They sought to limit the influence of the family, which holds a special class of stock giving it 40 percent of the votes at the company. Alexander Trotman, Ford's chairman and chief executive until the end of 1998, struggled unsuccessfully with the board to prevent Mr. Ford from becoming chairman.
Mr. Ford was conspicuous by his absence from public view during most of the tempest last autumn over the recall of Firestone tires supplied with Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles. He never went before television cameras during the controversy, limiting himself to a single conference call with reporters on Sept. 14. He said then that Ford's management initially handled the recall, and that he had not wanted to undercut management by jumping in when the issue turned into a national debate over auto safety and the credibility of Ford Motor and Firestone.
Until then, Mr. Ford had met frequently, but informally, with the layer of executives directly below Mr. Nasser. Those meetings ended when the executives became caught up in managing the tire recall, leaving Mr. Ford feeling increasingly isolated, people close to the company's leadership said. 
Mr. Ford's low visibility has not been confined to the Firestone problems. A little over a year ago, he was at center stage -- standing in an auditorium at the North American International Auto Show here and introducing prototypes for future vehicles. 
This winter, Mr. Ford has been much less visible. He spent much of December shaking up the management of the Detroit Lions football team, which his family owns. Then he badly injured his shoulder in a skiing accident on Jan. 2, preventing him not only from visiting the auto show but also from giving a planned party in Washington for President Bush's inauguration.
Mr. Ford is now back in the office and is expected to recover fully, though he is temporarily unable to drive because of the shoulder injury, which required surgery.
But even before the accident, Mr. Ford had not been scheduled to unveil any Ford vehicles at this year's Detroit auto show.
"There wasn't anything that fit perfectly; that wasn't contrived," said Jason Vines, the Ford Motor Company's vice president for public affairs.
Some auto analysts say that the company is missing an opportunity by not finding more of a role for Mr. Ford, given his access to government and financial leaders and his surprisingly common touch. "He could be better utilized here," said Stephen Girsky, who follows Ford for Morgan Stanley, "even if it's more in a public relations-type fashion."
Some members of the company's old guard are uncomfortable with Mr. Ford's strong emphasis on environmental responsibility, and leery of letting him speak publicly. This has been particularly true since the Ford annual meeting in Atlanta last May, when he said that sport utility vehicles posed serious safety and environmental problems that the company would have to address. 
Mr. Ford has been much less visible in public since then. And though Mr. Vines said the lower visibility was not the result of a policy decision, Mr. Ford's comments clearly fed distrust of him among both some longtime Ford executives and executives at rival automakers.
Mr. Ford's critics in the industry contend that "sometimes he's a goody two-shoes green; other times, he's a businessman," a person close to Ford Motor leaders said.
Mr. Ford has consistently argued that environmental responsibility makes business sense, because it enhances the reputation of Ford Motor brands.
"It's not a flavor of the month, it's a flavor of a lifetime, it's a flavor of a career," he said in the September conference call with reporters.
Mr. Nasser has supported Mr. Ford's position, but expresses the idea differently. Ask him about the environment, and the result is a 10-minute monologue about how companies in a global, Web-linked economy must do whatever is necessary to prevent their brands from becoming tarnished by poor behavior in any country.
Mr. Ford's dalliance with the idea of appointing a chief operating officer foundered, in part, on the lack of obvious candidates. And if Mr. Ford were to sour on Mr. Nasser, there would be few obvious alternatives to him, either. 
Mr. Nasser has pushed out both of the most obvious contenders: John Devine, who was Ford's chief financial officer and is now vice chairman and chief financial officer of General Motors; and Peter Pestillo, who was Ford's vice chairman and is now chairman and chief executive of the Visteon Corporation, an auto parts maker spun off by Ford last summer.
Though Ford Motor has outperformed its rivals in profitability over the last year, it has had several stumbles lately. It is not clear how much, if at all, these can be attributed to Mr. Nasser's efforts to run the company without a strong number two. 
Mr. Nasser was heavily criticized last summer for initially resisting a request from Congress to testify about the Firestone matter. His decision to appear in television advertisements about the tires was widely questioned. (He speaks with a strong Australian accent.) 
Ford's recent introduction of the Escape sport utility vehicle has been marred by recalls, while the introduction of a new Ford Explorer has been repeatedly postponed this winter, partly because of concerns about quality.
Mr. Nasser himself is deeply unpopular within the company. He has removed thousands of midlevel managers by requiring executives to evaluate their subordinates on a curve and then to tell some that they have little future -- a shock at a company long known for its collegial ways.
While the idea of naming a chief operating officer has been shelved for now because of Mr. Nasser's opposition, it has not been discarded forever, one of the people close to Ford's leadership said, and adding:
"Is it in the cards? Maybe. Is it imminent? No."

HEADLINE: British Airways Posts a Profit; Will Continue Cutting Fleet 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER 

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 5 

 BODY:
British Airways returned to profitability in its third fiscal quarter, helped by a strategy of raising prices for premium services like seats that convert into beds on long-haul flights, while trimming overall capacity. 
 The less-is-more approach was begun by Robert Ayling, who presided over the airline's first full-year loss before resigning as chief executive last March. His successor, Rod Eddington, continued the plan and, perhaps more important, won support for it among British Airways employees at a time when European rivals were adding capacity. 
 A spokesman for the airline, Nick Claydon, said today that it expects to have reduced capacity 3 percent by the time the fiscal year ends on March 31, and by 9 percent further in the next fiscal year. Both the number and size of planes will be reduced, mainly at the expense of economy-class customers.
The resulting 3.1 percent reduction in unit costs other than fuel helped the British Air surpass analysts' forecasts, with a quarterly pretax profit of $:65 million ($96 million) on revenue of $:2.29 billion ($3.38 billion). The airline lost $:60 million in the comparable quarter a year earlier.
Still, worries about how British Airways will fare as the United States economy slows seemed to depress investor interest, and its stock price slid nearly 8 percent here, to $:4.21, or $6.21.
Other issues loom for British Airways, including its prospects for long-term growth through acquisitions and alliances. A deal for KLM unraveled in September, and regulators in the United States have kept British Airways and American Airlines from working together as closely as they would like.
Chris Tarry, an analyst with Commerzbank, said he expects demand on North Atlantic routes, which supply two-fifths of British Airways' revenue and profit, to continue growing, though he is skeptical that British Airways will succeed in substantially tightening its relationship with American Airlines any time soon. 
Mr. Eddington and Donald J. Carty, his counterpart at American's parent, the AMR Corporation, met last month in Phoenix, Ariz., to explore ideas like creating a single reservations center for all members of the airlines' One World alliance, and doing more joint purchasing of supplies. But Mr. Tarry of Commerzbank called such steps incremental.
Mr. Claydon, the British Airways spokesman, said the two big carriers had no immediate plans to lobby with United States regulators for antitrust immunity, which some other airline alliances have on a limited basis. "For now," he said, "Rod is focused on getting the core business right."
In part, that includes selling Go, British Airways' reduced-fare airline. The short list of prospective buyers has been winnowed to 6 from 24 who made preliminary offers.

HEADLINE: Washington's Other Mr. Powell 

 BODY:
George W. Bush has named Michael Powell to be the new chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, making the Powells one of Washington's most powerful father-son teams in a long time. The powers held by the secretary of state are well known. Less obvious is the importance of the F.C.C., the traffic cop to the nation's information technologies. The agency was created seven decades ago to insure an orderly allocation of the airwaves, and its power and responsibilities have increased greatly with the explosive growth of the Internet, wireless communications and cable and broadcast television. Not knowing what will come next, or even how today's technologies will intersect tomorrow, is what makes the F.C.C.'s regulatory work so conceptually challenging. 
 Mr. Powell is well qualified for the task, having been one of the five F.C.C. commissioners since 1997. He previously served as chief of staff to Joel Klein, head of the Justice Department's antitrust office, and as a law clerk for a federal judge on the District of Columbia Circuit. It is an impressive resume for a 37-year-old Republican who turned to the law after his military career was cut short by a near-fatal jeep accident. 
 As a commissioner, Mr. Powell has been a firm believer in the self-regulating nature of markets. But we hope that as chairman he will take a more expansive view of the commission's role. He is right to fear premature regulation of nascent technologies, but a number of issues that are likely to dominate his tenure as chairman will require aggressive regulatory action to encourage competition. This will be true, for instance, in the continuing struggle to force the regional Bell companies to open up their local markets to competitors. 
Mr. Powell's predecessor, William E. Kennard, tried to keep markets open to a diversity of voices and new competitors. Consumer groups are concerned that Mr. Powell will reverse course and allow a greater concentration of market power in the hands of the most economically powerful companies. Mr. Powell, for example, has been critical of rules that limit the number of TV stations broadcasters can own in a market or across the country. On another front, his hands-off regulatory approach may not be the best means to foster wireless Internet services and interactive television. 
Consistent with his philosophy, Mr. Powell voted against some conditions designed to protect competition in the merger of America Online with Time Warner. The AOL deal was approved by a 5-to-0 vote on Jan. 11, and the conditions by a 3-to-2 vote, with Mr. Powell as one of the dissenters. But he should not even have voted on this issue. Mr. Powell's father was an AOL director until the day of the vote, holding options to buy 320,000 shares of the company. 
Mr. Powell said he never discussed AOL matters with his father, and neither federal law nor commission rules required him to recuse himself. Still, his failure to do so strikes us as a lapse in judgment given the apparent conflict of interest. General Powell announced the day after the vote that he would be exercising those options, which will net him millions. That will clear his son of a continuing problem on AOL matters. But Michael Powell will need to exercise better judgment during his tenure as F.C.C. chairman.

HEADLINE: Defense Veteran Chosen as No. 2 at Pentagon 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5 

 BODY:
Paul D. Wolfowitz found himself at the center of a political firestorm eight years ago when as under secretary of defense for policy he drafted a document calling on the United States to use its military might as the lone superpower to prevent the rise of strategic competitors.
 Foreign capitals denounced the notion, and the first Bush administration quietly excised it from its post-cold-war strategy, but the episode cemented Dr. Wolfowitz's reputation as a conservative intellectual known for hawkish views on everything from Russia to Iraq to national missile defense. 
 Today, President Bush announced that he intended to return Dr. Wolfowitz to the Pentagon, this time as deputy secretary of defense, responsible for managing the Pentagon's sprawling bureaucracy and, perhaps more than his predecessors, involving himself in foreign policy. Dr. Wolfowitz's nomination requires Senate confirmation. 
"Wolfowitz will be stronger from a policy point of view than many of his predecessors," said Lawrence J. Korb, vice president of the Council on Foreign Relations and former assistant secretary of defense in the Reagan administration. "He's very close to the vice president and the president. A lot of people who've had that job have never met the president before."
Dr. Wolfowitz, now 57, rejoins a cadre of senior national security officials returning to office after eight years in political exile. 
As under secretary of defense for policy from 1989 to 1993 -- essentially the Pentagon's third-ranking position -- he worked closely with Dick Cheney, now the vice president, and Gen. Colin L. Powell, now secretary of state. Dr. Wolfowitz was particularly instrumental during the Persian Gulf war, bolstering Mr. Cheney's case for an aggressive response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and managing sensitive diplomacy with key allies like Israel.
Dr. Wolfowitz has also over the years worked closely with his new boss, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld. When Mr. Rumsfeld took over Senator Bob Dole's flailing presidential campaign in 1996, he tapped Dr. Wolfowitz as the campaign's foreign policy adviser -- a role he reprised last year as one of "the Vulcans," Mr. Bush's closest advisers in that field.
He also served as a member of the Rumsfeld Commission, the panel that in 1998 warned that the United States was increasingly vulnerable to attack by long-range ballistic missiles from countries like North Korea, Iran and Iraq. The commission's report became one of the most influential documents in American military planning.
Dr. Wolfowitz had himself been a candidate for the top job at the Pentagon, as well as that at the Central Intelligence Agency. However, some in the Bush transition team questioned whether his intellectual rigor and academic approach would prove ineffective in reining in the Pentagon's bureaucracy -- an important part of the deputy's job.
There is no question, however, that he brings considerable experience to the job. Mr. Korb referred to Dr. Wolfowitz as "the most qualified person nominated to be No. 2 at the Pentagon." 
Born in Brooklyn and raised in Ithaca, N.Y., Dr. Wolfowitz studied mathematics and chemistry at Cornell University and later earned a master's degree and a doctorate from the University of Chicago in political science and economics.
From 1973 to 1977, he worked in the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, serving for a time as a special assistant during the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, or SALT. He later served as an assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs and as ambassador to Indonesia during the Reagan administration before joining the first Bush administration.
Dr. Wolfowitz became dean of the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University in 1994.
He is known for sharp, hawkish views. In 1998, he told a Senate committee that the United States should arm opponents of Saddam Hussein and provide air cover, if necessary, as they liberated the country. "Anti-tank weapons, in particular, could have a powerful equalizing effect," he said at the time.

HEADLINE: BUSH TO PROPOSE MAKING A TAX CUT EFFECTIVE IN 2001 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5 

 BODY:
President Bush said today that he wanted substantial parts of his tax-cut plan to apply retroactively to the beginning of this year -- a full year ahead of what he proposed during the campaign -- as a means of shoring up the faltering economy.
 Administration officials said they were considering a variety of ways to have the tax cut take effect on an accelerated basis and so put additional money into taxpayers' pockets as quickly as possible. Among the ideas is to send taxpayers a one-time payment that would reflect their expected tax savings for a part of this year, Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said in an interview today. 
 At the beginning of a week in which Mr. Bush has scheduled a series of events to help him build support for his plan to cut taxes by $1.6 trillion over the next decade, administration officials said he intended as a matter of principle to submit to Congress on Thursday the exact proposal that he advocated during the presidential campaign. 
But they made clear that the president would support efforts in Congress to speed the schedule under which the tax cut would be phased in, and its benefits passed along to individuals, despite doubts among economists including Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, that such a move would help the economy in time to make a difference in this slowdown. 
Asked by reporters at the White House today whether he favored making his tax cut retroactive to the start of this year, Mr. Bush said yes.
"A lot of members of Congress have talked to me about that, and I do," he said, flanked by families he said would benefit from his plan. "And we look forward to working with Congress to expedite money into the pockets of the American people. I strongly believe that a tax relief plan is an important part of helping our country's economy recover."
Even some of Mr. Bush's Capitol Hill allies are skeptical of the assertion that the tax cut would be of substantial help in reviving the economy. "If we do it earlier, I don't think we're really stimulating the economy," said one Republican, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. "I think we're putting in place at an earlier time basic tax restructuring."
Mr. Bush said he would resist pressure from members of his own party, as well as from lobbyists and interest groups, to stuff this year's tax bill with provisions other than those he has proposed. 
Republican leaders on Capitol Hill have said over the last several weeks that the tax cut could grow bigger than $1.6 trillion and that there is considerable support for proposals not included in Mr. Bush's plan, like a reduction in the capital gains tax and breaks for businesses.
"Some in Congress view this as an opportunity to load up the tax relief plan with their own vision of tax relief," Mr. Bush said. "And I want the members of Congress and the American people to hear loud and clear: This is the right size plan, it is the right approach, and I'm going to defend it mightily."
Democrats said it would be a mistake to count on the surplus to finance a large tax cut, given the inherent uncertainty in long-term economic and budget projections.
In testimony prepared for delivery to the Senate Budget Committee on Tuesday, David M. Walker, who heads the General Accounting Office, the nonpartisan agency that conducts audits for Congress, said that "no one should design tax or spending policy pegged to the precise numbers in any 10-year forecast."
Democrats have shifted their sights to limiting the size of the tax cut, and to focusing more of its benefits on low- and middle-income people than Mr. Bush's proposal would. Although the White House says that in percentage terms many lower-income taxpayers would see a larger reduction in their tax bills than would the wealthy, the biggest share of Mr. Bush's cut would go to affluent taxpayers, those who pay the most in taxes.
"If you make over $300,000 a year, this tax cut means you get to buy a new Lexus," said the Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota. "If you make $50,000 a year, you get to buy a muffler on your used car."
It is likely that Mr. Bush's plan will be altered as the tax committees in the House and the Senate write their own legislation, and it is possible that the White House's proposal will be scaled back. 
In an indication of the difficulties the proposal could face, a bipartisan group of five senators said today that any tax cut should be contingent on the projected surplus's materializing on schedule. They were Senators Evan Bayh of Indiana, Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana and Dianne Feinstein of California, all Democrats, and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, both Republicans.
But the administration has so far shown no willingness to compromise.
Lawrence B. Lindsey, the White House's economic adviser, said in an interview that the projected surplus was large enough in coming years to accommodate an acceleration of two of the Bush plan's main components: the reduction in all personal income tax rates and a doubling, to $1,000, of the per-child credit.
Under the plan Mr. Bush set out during the campaign, income tax rates would be reduced gradually over the next five years, and the child credit would be increased gradually over the same period. 
Mr. Lindsey said the administration was not proposing specific changes to the timetable at this point. But he maintained that even after setting aside the portion of the projected surplus that would come from Social Security, "there is enough flexibility to move a significant portion of the rate cuts and the child credit forward."
In addition to cutting income tax rates and doubling the child credit, Mr. Bush's plan would give a break to many two-income couples, repeal the tax on large estates, allow more people to deduct charitable contributions and extend a credit for corporate research and development.
There is general agreement among economists that the stimulus of a tax cut can help in theory to revive a weak economy. But there is also agreement that in practice the stimulus usually comes too late to do much good. That is all the more so in the case of the Bush tax cut, many economists say, because it is taxpayers in the lower brackets who are most likely to spend whatever they save in taxes, and they would not be getting back enough to stimulate the economy, at least in the short run.
At his confirmation hearing last month, Mr. O'Neill, who as treasury secretary is one of the administration's primary salesmen for the tax cut, said there were better reasons than immediate fiscal stimulus to reduce taxes. Mr. O'Neill said at the time that he would not "make a huge case that this is the instrument to ensure that we don't go into recession," although he was referring to Mr. Bush's original schedule, under which no tax cut would have taken effect until next year.
It would be hard for Congress to pass a tax bill before late spring or early summer, and it would probably be late summer or fall before the effect of the cuts would be felt by taxpayers even if the administration and Congress found a way to expedite the process.
Moreover, the tax cut would amount to only $20 billion in the first year under the schedule originally set out by Mr. Bush -- a tiny drop in an economy that is expected to produce more than $10 trillion of goods and services this year, and not enough to do much good if the nation is sinking into a recession.
On the other hand, the greater the early economic punch that Mr. Bush tries to achieve by loading more of the legislation's benefits into the next year or two, the more trouble he will have meeting his own goal of holding the package's total size to $1.6 trillion over the next decade.
Accelerating the tax plan would also create a number of other problems that administration officials said they had not fully worked out.
The obvious way to put additional money into people's pockets this year would be to change the tables that determine how much employers withhold from paychecks toward income tax liability. 
But the withholding tables cannot be changed until after the tax cut becomes law, probably not before summer. And if withholding levels are reduced for the rest of the year to reflect a cut that applies to a full year's income, withholding levels would have to rise again in January, a step that Republicans said they wanted to avoid because it would feel to many people like a tax increase.
As a result, Mr. O'Neill said, the administration is considering whether it can send all taxpayers a check later this year that would approximate the amount by which they had been over-withheld up until that point. The withholding tables would then be reduced just to reflect the diminished tax liability on earnings from that point on.
"Is it feasible to think about a one-time catch-up payment before you phase in a rest-of-the-year withholding-table change?" Mr. O'Neill said. "There are a lot of important technical questions about how you can do that, but we're looking at it."

A16) Chart: "DETAILS: Looking Closer at the Tax Cut"On Thursday, President Bush intends to send Congress his plan to cut taxes by $1.6 trillion over the next decade. The administration says the proposal will exactly match Mr. Bush's campaign proposal. But Mr. Bush has made clear that he will support an effort in Congress to speed up the schedule under which individual income tax rates are reduced and the child credit is increased. HOW IT WOULD BE PAID FORMr. Bush's proposal would be paid for out of the projected budget surplus, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates at $5.6 trillion for the next 10 years. Of that amount, though, about $2.5 trillion would come from Social Security and by the agreement of the two parties is off limits for tax cuts or new spending. Democrats say an additional $400 billion, which comes from Medicare, should also be off limits, although the White House disagrees, leaving between $2.7 trillion and $3.1 trillion for tax cuts and other needs. MAIN PROVISIONS CHANGES IN TAX RATES -- Would reduce and simplify all marginal tax rates by2006. CURRENT TAX RATES15.0 %28.031.036.039.6 PROPOSED NEW RATES10.015.025.033.0 ESTATE TAX -- Would gradually repeal it by 2009.

MARRIAGE PENALTY -- Would create a deduction for two-income families, allowing a 10 percent deduction for the first $30,000 of the lower-earning spouse's income by 2006. CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS -- Would allow taxpayers who do not itemize to deduct charitable contributions, subject to some income limitations. R. & D. CREDIT -- Would make permanent a tax credit for business research and development.

HEADLINE: McCain Joining Democrats To Offer Health Rights Bill 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5 

 BODY:
Senator John McCain, the maverick Republican who irritated many leaders of his own party in his quest for the presidency, will join Democrats this week in proposing legislation intended to break a three-year impasse over patients' rights. 
 Mr. McCain has come up with what he calls a compromise, hammered out in weeks of negotiations with Democratic senators, including liberals like Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and moderates like John Edwards of North Carolina and Bob Graham of Florida. 
 In an interview today, Mr. Graham said: "We've now got a plan that will get the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster in the Senate. The House had a strong majority for a similar plan in 1999. We are closer to enactment of a patients' bill of rights than at any time since it's been considered in Congress." 
The issue will be an important test for moderate Republicans like Senator Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island. Jeffrey Neal, a spokesman for Mr. Chafee, said the senator "definitely supports" the McCain-Kennedy bill.
The bill, to be unveiled on Tuesday, defines a wide variety of patients' rights, including access to emergency care and medical specialists. Patients would also receive new rights to sue insurance companies and health maintenance organizations that improperly deny claims or cause injuries. 
Though promoted as a compromise, the bill does little to appease insurers and employers, who have staunchly resisted any legislation expanding the right to sue.
"This legislation is a recipe for more litigation, more liability and higher costs," said Karen M. Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health Plans, the chief lobby for H.M.O.'s.
People on all sides of the debate say that prospects for enactment of a patient's bill of rights have increased with the inauguration of President Bush. But in expanding the right to sue, the compromise legislation appears to go somewhat further than anything he has endorsed. 
Under the bill, some lawsuits, involving disputes over the terms of a contract, would go to federal court. Other claims, involving questions of medical judgment and the need for a specific service, would be heard in state court. Plaintiffs often prefer state court because experience suggests that they can win larger damages there.
The federal court would decide questions like these: Is John Doe enrolled in the local Blue Cross health plan? Is a particular benefit covered under the contract? Is the co-payment $5 or $10? State courts, by contrast, would decide whether a patient had been injured by the negligence of an H.M.O.
Mr. McCain, an Arizonan, and Democratic senators intend to portray their proposal as a significant compromise that could help break the deadlock on patients' rights by imposing some limits on punitive damages and by limiting the liability of employers. Employers would be protected from liability unless they directly participated in a decision on a claim for benefits.
Senator McCain may pull several Republican senators with him. But H.M.O.'s and insurance companies said they opposed the bill because, like the one passed by the House in 1999, it would expand the patient's right to sue.
Under the draft legislation, a health plan could be required to pay a "civil assessment," similar to punitive damages, up to $5 million if a patient established in federal court that a defendant had shown "bad faith and flagrant disregard" for the patient's rights.
If a patient was injured because of a health plan's failure to exercise "ordinary care," the patient could sue under state law for economic damages and pain and suffering. The patient could also recover punitive damages if the defendant acted in "willful or wanton disregard" for the patient's rights. 
H.M.O.'s would generally be protected against punitive damages if they followed the recommendations of an independent panel of medical experts. But patients could bypass such administrative appeals and go directly to court if they asserted that the delay would cause "immediate and irreparable harm or death."
Mr. McCain's eagerness to work with Democrats on patients' rights may make it more difficult for Democrats to cut a deal on campaign finance laws with Senate Republican leaders, who have no desire to let Mr. McCain set their agenda.
A White House official said President Bush would send a letter to Congress this week urging lawmakers to adopt a patients' bill of rights, though without endorsing a specific piece of legislation.

HEADLINE: Statehouse Stalemate Delays Relief from Tax on Heating Fuel 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 5 

 BODY:
The State Senate and the Assembly both passed bills today authorizing the New York City Council to suspend the city's 4 percent sales tax on heating oil and natural gas this winter, but the two measures differ slightly, leaving it unclear when consumers might see an actual tax reduction.
 In December, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani asked the Legislature to grant the city the ability to roll back taxes temporarily on heating oil for 60 days this winter, giving a break to consumers dealing with high energy prices. 
 But the speaker of the Assembly, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, let it be known early last week that he intended to urge passage of a bill that would also allow the city to suspend taxes on natural gas.
Mr. Silver also said he wanted to give New York City the same power other cities around the state already have to change fuel taxes as they like, whenever they like. 
On Thursday, Mr. Giuliani, in a closed-door meeting with senators, agreed to add natural gas to the city's proposal, which has been championed in the Senate by Roy M. Goodman, a Manhattan Republican. This afternoon, the Senate unanimously passed Mr. Goodman's bill.
The Senate measure would enable the City Council to vote to suspend the tax on natural gas and heating oil for a single 60-day period. It would cost the city $28 million in lost revenues.
The state granted most local governments the authority to control their own sales taxes years ago. However, the city government does not have the power to reduce sales taxes without Albany's approval because those revenues backed bonds issued in the 1970's to bail the city out of its financial crisis.
But minutes after the Senate acted, the Assembly passed, 149-0, a version of the bill that would let the city repeal the sales tax not only on oil and natural gas, but also on all other forms of energy used for heating, like steam and electricity. The Assembly bill would give the Council the flexibility to suspend the tax on any fuel for a short time or repeal it indefinitely, aides to Mr. Silver said.
Senator Goodman said the Legislature was locked in a stalemate because the Assembly decided not to pass the Senate version backed by the mayor.
The Giuliani administration has not taken a position on the Assembly's proposal. Deputy Mayor Joseph J. Lhota said the mayor wanted to read the Assembly bill before commenting.
"We withdrew our bill last Thursday morning and replaced it with a 60-day moratorium on both home heating oil and natural gas," Mr. Lhota said. "That is our bill, our preferred bill." 
It remained unclear today whether the Democrats who control the Assembly and the Republicans who control the Senate can reach an agreement on a single bill. Unlike in Congress, legislative leaders in Albany rarely resolve their differences in conference committees.
One consequence of the competing bills is that residents and landlords may have to wait for relief on their fuel bills. Legislative aides said the City Council and the mayor could speed up the process by sending an unequivocal message to the Legislature about what the city wants, but since Mr. Giuliani and the Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone, appear to be supporting different bills, that could take some time.
Senator Goodman said: "We will do everything we can to try to provide this relief as soon as possible. We want to do it while it's cold. It doesn't do much good to do it in the middle of the summer."
Mr. Vallone is leaning toward supporting the Assembly's bill, said his spokesman, Jordan Barowitz.
"What the City Council is looking for is discretion and flexibility," he said. "All the other localities in the state can roll back taxes when emergencies arrive. The City Council wants that same power."

The War Saddam Won

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: DOHA, Qatar 

 BODY:
The Bush team has a full-fledged public relations disaster on its hands in the Arab world.
 From the smallest pistachio seller here on the shores of the Persian Gulf to the highest Arab ministers, there is not only total opposition to any Bush plans to tighten sanctions on Saddam Hussein until he is squeezed out of power, but in fact virtually unanimous support for lifting sanctions immediately. 
 America has lost the propaganda war with Saddam. Period. And before the sanctions regime collapses entirely, the U.S. needs to find a way to at least salvage an international ban on all weapons sales to Iraq, with border inspections, so that Saddam's military power is contained -- and forget about using endless economic sanctions to get rid of him. They are not sustainable. 
Especially after Ariel Sharon wins the Israeli election today. Judging from many conversations here, the Arab street is poised to say to the Bush team: "Let me get this straight. You want us to join America in imposing sanctions on the Iraqi leader who smashed Kuwait, while America accepts the Israeli leader who smashed Lebanon? Not a chance."
The U.S. effort to isolate Saddam has died of many causes. For one, Saddam totally outfoxed Washington in the propaganda war. All you hear and read in the media here is that the sanctions are starving the Iraqi people -- which is true. But the U.S. counter-arguments that by complying with U.N. resolutions Saddam could get those sanctions lifted at any time are never heard. Preoccupied with the peace process, no senior U.S. officials have made their case in any sustained way here, and it shows.
You would never know from talking to people in the gulf that just a few weeks ago Saddam Hussein's son Uday put forward a "working paper" to the Iraqi National Assembly calling for a new emblem that showed Kuwait "as an integral part of greater Iraq." You would never know that Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, recently declared that "Kuwait got what it deserved." You would never know that during the period from June to December 2000, despite all the hunger among the Iraqi people, the U.N. reported that Saddam bought only $4.2 billion worth of food and medicine for his people -- even though under the U.N. oil-for-food program he had $7.8 billion to spend. 
No, all you hear now are the sorts of arguments that Egypt's foreign minister, Amr Moussa, made at the Davos Forum last week: "We can't expect that the people of Iraq live under sanctions forever. . . . Since the war, public opinion in the Arab world has moved 180 degrees." Many here would agree. 
Even if Colin Powell came to the gulf to make the right arguments, he would have an uphill battle. For one thing, Washington has forgotten how different Iraq looks from the Arab world. The leaders of the small Persian Gulf sheikdoms are very good at calculating the balance of power. They know the difference between the mirage and the oasis, and they know that as long as Saddam is posing no immediate military threat to them, his army is still a useful counterweight to their more dangerous historic enemy -- Iran.
At the same time, on the Arab street the notion that at least one Arab country, Iraq, has weapons of mass destruction that can balance Israel's is very popular. Moreover, the daily Arab TV diet of pictures of the Palestinian uprising and the Israeli retaliations has produced a gut desire on the Arab street to poke a finger in America's eye.
Finally, the Arab street no longer accepts the logic of sanctions -- that if you squeeze Iraq long enough the Iraqi people will oust Saddam. It is widely felt that Arab leaders can never be ousted by the "people." It never happens in this neighborhood. As one Qatari intellectual said to me: "If your sanctions on Castro have not worked for 40 years to get rid of him, and he is right next to you, why do you believe that they will work to get rid of Saddam?" For the most part, the Iraqi opposition groups (funded by the U.S.) are viewed as corrupt outsiders who would be rejected by the Iraqi body politic in the unlikely event they ever did oust Saddam. 
Bottom line: If Colin Powell tries really hard, launches a real P.R. campaign against Saddam, he might be able to hold together the sanctions long enough to get them lifted in an orderly way and replaced by a U.N. ban on all military sales to Iraq. If you think otherwise, well, I have some lakefront property on the Saudi-Qatari border I'd like to sell you.

HEADLINE: O'Neill Offers a New Approach to Japan 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5 

 BODY:
President Bush's treasury secretary described a new approach today for dealing with Japan as the world's largest and second-largest economies appear headed into decline, suggesting he would abandon Washington's constant stream of advice to the government in Tokyo and try working directly with Japanese executives he came to know while running Alcoa.
 In an interview this morning, the new secretary, Paul H. O'Neill, also said that he thought the Clinton administration's efforts to rescue the Russian economy when the ruble collapsed in 1998 were "crazy," and he strongly suggested he would refrain from participating in multibillion-dollar economic bailouts aimed chiefly at stabilizing the currencies of countries where corruption and mismanagement led to crisis. 
 Mr. O'Neill's description of his new approach to Japan appears in keeping with President Bush's repeated insistence that he would conduct a "humble" foreign policy, in which the United States lectured less and listened more. The Treasury Secretary's comments indicated that he would advocate intervening less often in the economies of other nations, as opposed to the Clinton White House, which often did so as it tried to shape a post-cold war global economy. 
But Japan will be an early and critical test of whether that approach is feasible. Once again the world's second-largest economy is slipping into recession, after a decade of dead-slow or no growth. But this time the problem takes on added dimensions, because the United States economy is also slowing.
The combined effect of slumps in both nations, which together make up roughly 40 percent of the world economy, is already being felt around the globe. Yet politicians and bureaucrats in Japan appear to be invoking the same prescriptions now -- hundreds of billions of dollars more in deficit spending by the government -- that have repeatedly failed to start the country growing again.
Mr. O'Neill said he was "still working" on how to approach Japan, but he made it clear he saw pursuing traditional conversations with Japanese politicians but would try to also seek solutions with "industrial people I have worked with who know the real economy."
He rejected any approach that "presumes these are the kind of issues that can be dealt with from the top of one government to the top of another." 
"That," he said, "is a kind of royal view of the world."
"It's important not to give a government-to-government lecture that says 'We're smarter than anyone else,' " Mr. O'Neill said. "I don't find that productive. In most places they will tell you to go to hell. In Japan, they will smile and not do anything."
He said, for example, that he was not interested in lengthy, vague discussion of Japan's myriad regulations. Instead, he said, he wanted to introduce "price competition" to Japan, noting that it was exactly that kind of competition from abroad that reformed American industry in the late 1980's and early 1990's.
At the same time, though, the same Japanese executives with whom Mr. O'Neill says he wants to deal directly have spent years fighting low-priced competition, both foreign and domestic. 
In many ways, the approach to the international economy that Mr. O'Neill described reflects the drastically different background he brings to the job. President Clinton's first treasury secretary, Lloyd Bentsen, was a former senator who enjoyed international diplomacy. His second, Robert E. Rubin, had grown up on Wall Street and focused heavily on the effects of markets, exchange rates and government policy. The third, Lawrence H. Summers, was a Harvard economist whose instincts were to look at a country's macroeconomic and monetary policies.
But Mr. O'Neill is interested in the factory floor, in productivity, and in products. That is evident in his office. He has replaced the traditional computer displays behind the treasury secretary's desk with four large, flat-screen panels. At 8 this morning, he was examining prices on the metals market in London -- "I like to start the day by seeing how London is opening." Another showed stock prices in the United States; Alcoa's trading symbol was the first listed.
"I have to get rid of that now that I'm here," he said with a laugh. 
A third screen had a constant update of his e-mail. Already he has made it clear to the Treasury that he plans to run the place on corporate hours. He gets into work around 6:30 a.m., aides say, keeps strictly to a schedule, and tells his staff that any briefing papers that make it to him past 5 p.m. may miss him as he heads home.
Today Mr. O'Neill made it clear that one of the Clinton administration ideas he would have killed, had he been in office, was the failed attempt to rescue Russia. While the International Monetary Fund led the effort to prop up the ruble, it was the Treasury that pushed to provide the loans to Moscow in return for promised reforms -- promises that evaporated even before the currency crumbled.
"It's awfully easy to be outside and be a critic," Mr. O'Neill said. "I don't know what the insiders thought they were doing when they did Russia. But now permit me to be an outsider again. From an outsider's point of view I thought what occurred was crazy. It made no sense to me, and this is based on my own experience of being in and with, and trying to become a factor in the Russian economy."
In an apparent reference to the Russian businessmen often called oligarchs, who converted their rubles into dollars and shipped them out of the country just before the I.M.F. and Treasury effort failed, he said: "In the world of fungible money, if you don't hold on to your money until its converted into something tangible, you are likely to lose it. And so when you send money in a wire transfer, or send it in on a plane that gets refueled and takes off somewhere else you shouldn't be too surprised if you didn't accomplish what you thought you were trying to do."
A senior official of the I.M.F. acknowledged that the Russian bailout was a failure, but said that it was a legitimate risk given the potential global effects of a crash of the country's currency. That was also the argument the Clinton administration made in 1998, noting that the Russian debacle triggered a run on markets around the world, the collapse of a major American hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management, and a rush by industrial nations around the world to cut interest rates to stabilize the world's currencies. 
"Currency stabilization for who's benefit?" he said. "I really don't understand why someone would take billions of dollars and give it to people who willfully created their own economic mess."
In the future, Mr. O'Neill said, he would press the I.M.F. -- which arranges emergency rescues and has emerged as a major player in determining how nations organize their economic affairs -- to blow the whistle on nations that it believes are headed toward economic disaster.
He made the same case recently in a private meeting with the leaders of the I.M.F. They emerged from the meeting with Mr. O'Neill less than fully convinced. While the fund has begun to make public its assessments of how well countries are managing their economic affairs, it has always been leery of publicly singling out wayward countries.
In part that is because the countries are members of the organization (the United States, however, is the largest single shareholder). I.M.F. officials also say that if countries are fearful of public humiliation, they will not come clean about their fiscal problems. And some I.M.F. officials fear that a published list of nations that are mismanaging their economies would lead any rational foreign investors to pull out their capital -- touching off the kind of crisis the I.M.F. is trying to avoid. 
But Mr. O'Neill, who speaks with the bluntness of an executive interested in uncovering a glitch in the manufacturing line and getting it fixed, says he is not interested in sugar-coating bad economic news. 
Honest assessments, he said, "might be a useful device." "And it puts the institutions," he added, referring to the I.M.F. and others, "in a position where they don't work in smoke and mirrors, they have to call things as they are -- which may be politically inconvenient for people."

BYLINE:  By GAIL COLLINS 

 BODY:
The New York State governor's race is already under way, a 21-month endurance test designed for all the voters who felt the last presidential contest ended far too soon.
 Andrew Cuomo returned home from his stint as secretary of housing and urban development last week, and instantly announced he was running for his father Mario's old job. He made his big revelation at a party at an upscale shoe store owned by his brother-in-law, Kenneth Cole. The waiters dispensed flutes of champagne and fancy hors d'oeuvres, and the fact that they were not tackled the second they came into the room confirmed suspicions that the guests were not your normal crowd of Democratic regulars. 
 Mr. Cuomo has a campaign but no New York address, although he's looking for a house in the suburbs of Westchester County, where the Clintons live. (People who run for statewide office here spend the bulk of their campaigns talking about how much they love upstate New York, but it never seems to occur to any of them to put down roots in Utica.)
The forces supporting Comptroller H. Carl McCall for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination have seized on Mr. Cuomo's eight-year absence as proof that he's an interloper. These are the same people, you understand, who gave the world the Hillary Rodham Clinton Senate campaign.
"We really don't need any outsiders this time," said Representative Charles Rangel last week, at a $1,000-a-plate dinner for Mr. McCall. Mr. Rangel, the first New York politician to urge Mrs. Clinton to get in the race, did everything but call Mr. Cuomo a carpetbagger.
"We don't need a welcome-home party for Carl McCall," agreed Attorney General Eliot Spitzer. He was introduced by Mr. Rangel, who gave a playful speech suggesting ways his fellow Democrats could tell if Mr. Spitzer was planning on indicting them.
In his remarks, Mr. McCall blasted the Republican governor, George Pataki, for "lack of direction," and vowed to improve the upstate economy and "make this the great state the Empire State can be." Mr. Cuomo, by contrast, blasted Mr. Pataki for "lost opportunities," vowed to improve the upstate economy and promised that "2002 is going to be the year that the Empire State strikes back." Obviously, this will be a race that is fought completely on the issues, and personalities will not make any difference whatsoever.
Mr. Cuomo's welcome-home party had an aura of exclusivity that politicians seldom strive for except when they're attempting to collect large sums of campaign contributions. You had your surly bouncers, your TV cameras held behind a rope line and speeches from high-profile co-hosts, including Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg and Martin Luther King III, who had the unfortunate habit of repeatedly pointing out that he doesn't live in New York.
Since Mr. Cuomo is both the son of a former governor and the husband of one of Robert Kennedy's daughters, the theme was dynastic succession, something this state understands very well. Washington may think it's leading the way in elevating sons of elected officials to office, but New York is Nepotism Central. The upcoming City Council races are absolutely stuffed with sons and daughters of term-limited incumbents. Some of them are so youthful that the feel is less "Next Generation" than "Bringing Up Baby."
This month there's a special election in the Bronx for a City Council seat being vacated by Jose Rivera, a Democrat who just moved up (or at least north) to the State Legislature. Mr. Rivera's 22-year-old son, a college student, is running for the seat. His opponent's campaign is being managed by the Council member Pedro G. Espada, the son of State Senator Pedro Espada Jr. The City Council speaker, Peter Vallone, who is running for mayor, is supporting Peter Vallone Jr. as his successor, and Comptroller Alan Hevesi, who's running as well, has already installed a son in the State Senate.
It's hard to decide if this is a healthy sign. At least there are some kids who see politics up close and don't come to loathe it. (Don't hold your breath waiting for Chelsea Clinton or the Bush girls to pick up the torch.) But you wonder if politics is becoming one of those insular occupations that nobody would think of pursuing unless it ran in the family -- like tightrope walking or hog farming.

Russia Warns of Arms Race Over U.S. Missile Shield
Defense Minister Igor D. Sergeyev warned that Russia was ready to resort to a new arms race to ensure that its strategic rocket forces would not be undermined by United States antimissile plans. The warning came two days after American officials told their European counterparts that the United States intended -- after extensive consultations -- to develop a national missile shield. A3

HEADLINE: Miss Manners Would Be Appalled 

BYLINE:  By AMIE PARNES 

 BODY:
One would think he would have had more sense. The chief executive of a Fortune 500 company, posing for a photo with executives of a Japanese corporation at the end of arduous negotiations in Tokyo to seal a business deal, stuck his hand behind one of his colleagues' heads and made rabbit ears.
 Funny in America, maybe. Not at all amusing in Japan. The deal later fell through. "You don't really know the effect your behavior might have" said Sue Fox, president of Etiquette Survival Inc. in Las Gadas, Calif., and co-author of "Business Etiquette for Dummies," who tells the story. 
 That may be an extreme example, but business consultants say the American workplace is suffering an epidemic of bad manners these days. Some blame the Internet culture of casual dress and pizza-on-the-run, others the general decline in civility. Whatever the cause, though, they warn, even minor lapses in etiquette can crimp an otherwise promising career.
That insight came to Arlene Chien in a Santa Clara, Calif., restaurant after work. Ms. Chien, a senior sales trainer for the Guidant Corporation, a maker of medical devices, and several colleagues had just given their orders when the waitress arrived with a basket of fresh bread.
Before she could help herself to a slice, the bread was gone. Ms. Chien remembers watching her table mates devour every last crumb and thinking how impolite they were, when suddenly she realized she had been guilty of the same behavior in the past. Then she had a disquieting thought. "What if we were out with clients?" she recalled wondering. "What would they think of us? We didn't really know what the proper rules were when dining."
They decided to find out by taking a course in table manners.
Ravi Singh, 26, a materials analyst at Applied Materials, a San Jose, Calif., maker of semiconductor equipment, is also aware of the connection between job security and workplace etiquette. But it was no sudden revelation. "I always thought about the movie 'Pretty Woman,' " Mr. Singh said. "The character Julia Roberts played didn't have a clue about holding a fork and a knife. I never wanted that to be me."
Besides, he said, he has seen any number of colleagues lose out on promotions or flunk job interviews because of some social gaffe or another. He did not want to suffer a similar fate, he said, so he routinely takes lessons in proper protocol and encourages his colleagues to do the same.
Mr. Singh thinks that training helped him win two promotions at Applied Materials the last year and a half. In one lunch interview with a future boss, he was able to concentrate on what he said because he did not have to worry about what he was doing, and thus made a better impression, he said.
"I was able to ask good questions and really inquire about the job because I wasn't focused on my dining skills," Mr. Singh said.
Knowing how to act has become even more important today than just six months ago, he says, as mass layoffs at dot-coms and a weakening economy are making job seekers more desperate and employers more discerning.
"Before now, all you had to do was basically show up to work and produce and sooner or later you'd get promoted," he said. "Now every little thing helps. Having etiquette skills makes me a better candidate than the next guy who doesn't."
Aware of the negative impact that loutish behavior can have in business, more companies of all sizes are hiring etiquette consultants to give crash courses in decorum to their employees, career counselors say. 
"People are becoming more and more aware of the need for professionalism," said Michael J. Gage, director of the University of Miami's Toppel Career Placement Center, which holds classes twice a semester on workplace etiquette. "We've increased the number of courses we offer here because of the high demand. We've received dozens and dozens of requests."
In recent months, the message that good manners can bolster one's career has become a trendy topic in books. In 1999, HarperCollins released "The Etiquette Advantage in Business," by Peggy and Peter Post. And this year, IDG Books, the Dummies book series, published Ms. Fox's tome.
The message is simple, if exacting. "What you really want to do is make sure you, the employee, are perfect in everything that you do. Don't give the boss any reason to give you the pink slip," Ms. Fox said.
To that end, the experts teach the proper way to do everything from holding a fork to eating soup to dressing down on casual Friday. Some important do's: sitting upright at business meetings with both feet planted firmly on the floor; knowing how to order a good wine at a business meal; being a good listener; and mentioning the names of people you talk to at business meetings.
And some equally important don'ts: handing business cards out like candy; answering a cellular phone in the middle of a business lunch or dinner; and eating hot, spicy foods in an office cubicle where colleagues are forced to breathe the aromas.
Also, body contact is out. "The corporate kiss on the cheek is dead," said Audrey Kardon, a corporate etiquette specialist in Palm Beach. "And the good ol' boy slap on the back has been dead for years."
In most cases, you do not really have to take a course. You just have to show common courtesy and use common sense.
For example, it helps to stay alert. Ms. Fox relates the tale of an executive whose attention apparently wandered at a business meeting when a woman with a male first name was introduced. She was the other company's president, but the executive assumed the man sitting next to her was in charge, and addressed him rather than her throughout the negotiations.
Annoyed at his ignorance, one of her top aides urged her to scuttle the talks.
Ms. Chien says most people understand the basics of etiquette, like not eating with their mouth full at a lunch with potential clients. But a little study is probably necessary to master the finer points, she said.
"Many people don't know that you're not supposed to talk about business until you get to the dessert part of the meal," Ms. Chien said. "When you know this, that's when you know you've taken your business to a higher level."

Lands Without Plenty: Images of Asia

BYLINE:  By ALEX KUCZYNSKI 

 BODY:
IF a Big Mac tells only part of the story of eating in America -- where hunting, gathering and cultivating food means logging on to the Internet, ordering overpriced takeout or strolling through the neighborhood singles' supermarket -- the food of India, China, Vietnam and Nepal tells a more complicated tale. When there are 3.6 billion fellow Asians clamoring for lunch, everyone had better work. 
 Or so the story goes as told by the images in a new exhibition at the Asia Society about the delicacies, and necessities, of Asian cuisine. The show, "Can We Feed Ourselves?" -- a collection of 52 photos by Hiroji Kubota -- has a clear political point: there is a crisis of nutrition in Asia. Or, as the somewhat morbidly enthusiastic tour guide announced last Saturday as she shepherded a group through the collection, "Did you know that 35 million infants die of malnutrition every day on the planet?" (Not to play down the gravity of the hunger issue, but the number is 35,000, according to Mr. Kubota's postscript in the exhibition catalog.) 
 Behind that compelling figure, though, is the sheer economic complexity of feeding 3.6 billion people. Mr. Kubota, a photographer for Magnum, tries to convey this, not to mention the occasionally provocative and sometimes just plainly poetic image. 
There is the photo of fishermen in Daqing, China, searching for carp through ice that is six feet thick. Their cheeks are coated with a sheen of frost, and when the fish are flipped onto the surface, where the air temperature is minus 30 degrees, they freeze instantly. There is a Chinese farmer hacking away at an endless landscape of yellow-brown loam, in what looks like a fruitless attempt to coax anything edible from the earth. And there is a woman in Jiangxi Province, China, squinting at a naked duck, a skein of string in her mouth, her job being to rip out any remaining feathers. The caption reports that in addition to her modest daily pay, she receives 7 cents a duck, and a skilled woman can process 80 ducks a day. That's $5.60. 
There is beauty, too: a Balinese farmer pushing his two oxen in a field, Bali's holiest mountain against the Kodachrome-blue sky; a girl milking her goats in Mongolia, her foot tucked demurely under her like the young subject of an Impressionist painting.
The notion of some Asian meals invokes complex feelings for Americans. After all, not many Americans eat dog or cat. And so a photo of a cat -- looking so fluffily pretty and pampered you can practically hear Lauren Bacall's voice-over for Fancy Feast -- on sale as food would disturb many Americans. The photographs of dogs roasting on a spit and water buffalo carcasses spread out on a soiled sheet for sale might also shock. But why should they? Most of us would eat a steak from a cow with a white hide, which is anathema to Indians. And it would be just as unsettling to visit the factory where a fast-food chain manufactures the cheese analog and special sauce that transform a hamburger into a Big Mac.
The exhibition runs through April 1 at the Asia Society, 59th Street and Park Avenue; admission is $4, $2 for students and senior citizens, and free from noon to 2 p.m. Tuesdays through Fridays.
Is there a single food that merits its own magazine? Can you imagine Yogurt Weekly, Cheesecake Quarterly or Kumquat Digest? 
The chili pepper has apparently merited its own magazine since 1987, one with a circulation that has grown to 100,000, about the same as The New Republic's, but not quite Bon Appetit's 1.2 million. And Chile Pepper magazine is intriguing despite its limited subject matter. Where else can you learn that Indian scientists have been searching for the chilies with the highest levels of capsaicin, the ingredient that gives the chili its kick, for use in riot-control agents? Or get a recipe for Jump-Up Bussu Soup? (Bussu are small Jamaican river snails.) Or read about the culinary history of the affair between Gov. Earl Long of Louisiana and the stripper Blaze Starr? (Hint: they were not eating cookies in bed.) 
Joel Gregory, the editor in chief and publisher, said last week that sales have been robust ever since baby boomers started to look for less fattening and more flavorful ways to cook. 
But baby boomers are aging, and even if they love salsa and jambalaya, their gastrointestinal tracts may not appreciate major infusions of spice. So Mr. Gregory has joined in a marketing partnership with Pepcid Complete, a heartburn medication. Last month, Johnson & Johnson, the company that manufactures Pepcid, and the magazine gave a barbecue at the New York Stock Exchange, providing passers-by with packets of Pepcid along with free barbecue (don't hold the pepper sauce) from a 72-foot smoker imported from Texas. 
"There are folks who enjoy too much of a good thing, and we feel like it is sort of a natural relationship for us to be in a marketing partnership with Pepcid," Mr. Gregory said. "I guess we're the cause and they're the cure."

HEADLINE: Trade Feud On Bananas Not as Clear As It Looks 

BYLINE:  By BRIAN LAVERY 

DATELINE: DUBLIN, Feb. 6 

 BODY:
In the simmering eight-year trade feud over bananas, the two sides have publicly staked out simple positions: the European Union maintains import quotas to protect the fragile economies of former colonies where bananas are grown, while the United States is foursquare for unfettered trade. Likewise with the position of the war's biggest apparent casualty, Chiquita Brands, which said last month that it was near bankruptcy, and that it was suing the European Commission over the quotas.
 A closer look at the European banana market yields a very different picture, and some curious paradoxes -- among them, that Chiquita sells more bananas in Europe than any other company; that three of the top four companies in the market are American; that Europe has already decided to stop explicitly favoring its colonies' produce; and that neither Chiquita nor the United States government seems to really want unrestricted banana imports in Europe. 
 "It's very confusing," said Liam Igoe, a food industry analyst at Goodbody Stockbrokers. "It's like an onion: you peel away layers, and layers, and layers." 
Things will become even stranger in April, analysts say, when the European Union plans to replace its current quota system with a first-come- first-served approach. Company quotas will fluctuate week to week based on when their bananas arrive, raising the specter of a weekly trans-Atlantic banana boat race. Chiquita says that plan is unfair, too.
The company that would appear to be on the offsetting side of Chiquita's woes, reaping the benefits of trade protection, is Fyffes, based in Dublin, the importer that dominates the European produce market. Along with marketing about 5 percent of all fruit and vegetables coming into the European Union, Fyffes is the only major European banana importer. Analysts estimate that its share of the banana market is a close second to Chiquita's. (By Fyffes's slightly different reckoning, it, Chiquita, Del Monte and Dole are neck and neck.)
Yet there is little evidence that the quota system is producing windfalls for Fyffes: net income fell 40 percent in the six months ended in October. Paul Meade, a food industry analyst with NCB Stockbrokers, said he expected Fyffes to report "pretty poor" annual results in March.
Profits in the banana trade generally have suffered lately, in part because of adverse exchange-rate movements -- importers' costs are largely paid in dollars, especially shipping, while their European revenue comes in euros -- and partly because of a global glut of bananas, a problem European executives lay at Chiquita's door.
"The E.U. is the only profitable banana market in the world, because it's protected," Mr. Meade said. "It's somewhat of a fallacy that the Americans want the regime disbanded." Instead, he said, Chiquita simply wants a bigger quota.
European fruit executives and analysts said Chiquita's troubles stemmed from a series of strategic missteps, starting with overeager expansion in Europe in the late 1980's and early 1990's, around the time European economic integration was gathering steam.
Chiquita invested heavily in anticipation of a vast open market across Western Europe that it hoped to dominate. The bet proved a poor one when banana quotas were imposed in 1993. Meanwhile, the retreat of communism from Eastern Europe was opening up a market with rapidly growing demand, but Chiquita was poorly placed to exploit it because its plantations and ripening centers were too far away.
More recently, Chiquita has piled up debt by expanding production in Latin America, where bananas grow larger but are less sweet than those grown in the Caribbean basin.
"Chiquita had made a number of mistakes along the way strategically," Mr. Igoe said.
Chiquita and Fyffes are very different combatants in the trade battle. While Chiquita is quite active politically in Washington, Fyffes has no office in Brussels, where the European Union is based, and spends less than 50,000 euros ($46,900) annually for political contributions, said Philip Halpenny, Fyffes' corporate secretary. "It certainly would be nothing like what is alleged to go on in the U.S. by the U.S. banana companies," he said. "We don't need the hassle of being asked, 'Why did you contribute that?' "
Fyffes is in better financial shape than Chiquita, with modest debt and a cash reserve of $80 million. To cut costs, it has restructured its supplier relationships and closed banana warehouses in England run by Geest, which is half-owned by Fyffes. And it is open to new strategic moves, Mr. Halpenny said, like teaming up with other companies to share shipping expenses, the bane of an industry that relies on a fragile and time-sensitive cargo.
But Fyffes, too, has had setbacks recently, notably in an Internet business-to-business venture, WorldofFruit.com, that briefly sent Fyffes stock soaring last February. The Internet unit has struggled to grow beyond being merely an adjunct to Fyffes's own business. Last month, it announced a handful of layoffs and a ceiling on further investment. And Fyffes stock has returned to earth, closing yesterday at 0.98 euros.

In a Society of Their Own, Children Are Learning

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN 

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN 

 BODY:
Jorge Tirado had the skills. "I am a good writer, so I can write tickets," he told the chief of police during his job interview.
He had the experience. On his resume, under hobbies, it lists "acting like a bodyguard" for the newly elected president, Kuni Muto.
 And attitude? 
 "I need to work on my temperature and my respect," he admitted. 
"Your temperature?" asked the chief, Diana Cardona, looking down her nose over blue-rimmed glasses as she suppressed a giggle. "You mean your temper?"
"Yes, I will work hard to calm myself down," the humbled applicant said. "I would not let girls pass by me if they're running in the halls. Or boys. Even if they're my best friend."
After a firm handshake, Jorge, a 12-year-old seventh grader aspiring to a career in law enforcement, got the job, one of seven newly sworn officers who will patrol the halls here at Amistad Academy under the command of Chief Cardona, also age 12. Five of Jorge's schoolmates were hired as tellers for the bank, which will soon be set up in one of the classrooms, and 18 will work at the museum, whose exhibits will adorn an alcove outside the cafeteria. Sixteen got jobs in the court -- normally the library -- as judges, bailiffs and, assuming they pass the Amistad bar exam, lawyers.
They are all part of "microsociety," an effort to link lessons to life, in which pupils have jobs, pay taxes, run businesses, make laws and punish lawbreakers -- at least for a few hours a week, after traditional classes. Amistad, a charter school in its second year, joins at least 200 schools in 40 states experimenting with the approach, which began as one New York City teacher's attempt to control unruly fifth graders in the 1960's and has won praise for making school more relevant and fun, while also building practical skills transportable to the adult world.
A 1998 study of 15 microsociety schools in six states, conducted by a professor at Drexel University in Philadelphia, suggested that it might also help boost student achievement: students at two-thirds of the schools posted gains on standardized math and reading tests that were greater -- as much as 21 percent -- than their peers'.
At Amistad, microsociety is a critical element of a curriculum designed to prepare a poor minority population for competitive colleges, careers and citizenship.
Eighty-four percent of Amistad's 135 fifth, sixth and seventh graders qualify for the federal free lunch program, and they enter the school, on average, performing two years behind grade level. Most of the day is spent on familiar subjects, with reading and math taught in groups of 6 to 16. The school raised its average test scores last year two and a half levels in math and one and a half in reading.
But Amistad's director, Dacia Toll, said that her students "need a running start," and that reading, writing and math are simply not enough. Amistad is organized around a set of core values: respect, enthusiasm, achievement, citizenship and hard work, whose acronym, Reach, is posted everywhere the eye turns. Microsociety brings those values to life, and keeps eyes on the prize of long-term success.
"It's the most powerful thing we can do in terms of career aspirations," said Ms. Toll, 28, who founded Amistad after graduating from nearby Yale Law School. "I can be a lawyer. Why? Well, I was a lawyer in sixth and seventh grades; it was fun.
"You can't teach citizenship by saying, 'Turn to Page 287 and let's read the preamble to the Constitution,' " she added. "We really wanted these kids to understand what it means to be a citizen of a society."
For the 13 Amistad students who remain unemployed, hampered by poor grades or bad reputations or interview stutters, that means applying for second-, third-, maybe eighth-choice jobs, until they can persuade one of the student managers to give them a chance. Or they could try persuading the 12-member legislature, with two representatives from each classroom, to establish an unemployment agency.
"We'll have lobbyists pretty soon," Ms. Toll said with a laugh.
The microsociety concept was born in Brooklyn in 1967, when George Richmond, a rookie teacher frustrated by his pupils' lack of motivation, started paying them in fake money for attendance and achievement, then created a fantasy world where they could earn and spend. Dr. Richmond's 1973 book inspired parents and teachers in Lowell, Mass., to open the first microsociety school in 1981. Over the next decade, handfuls of imitators sprouted in several states, with some, like a school in Yonkers, housed in special buildings resembling a marketplace or small town.
The movement took off in 1996, when the federal government approved the microsociety concept as one of several whole-school overhauls eligible for three-year grants of $150,000. Dr. Richmond's nonprofit organization, Micro-Society Inc., in Philadelphia, runs summer training workshops for about 400 teachers a year. About 60 percent of the participants are elementary schools, and the rest middle schools like Amistad.
Each program is different, as student entrepreneurs shape their societies. In Texas, younger pupils rent older ones to read to them in the library. In Savannah, Ga., kids pay to play basketball against their teachers. At a performing arts school in Florida, one student made and sold an exercise video. In Lowell one year, a boy who wrote a string of bad checks at the Christmas auction had his wages garnisheed and was sentenced to community service.
"It's very theoretical for a kid in a classroom to make that connection between reading and math and what's happening in the outside world," said Marc Michaelson, a civics teacher and director of Amistad's program. "But in micro, it's very simple to make that connection; it comes screaming at you."
Last year, Amistad students elected delegates to a constitutional convention, which spent months honing a document whose bill of rights includes a guarantee that taxes will not rise above 40 percent of income. Last fall, Kuni, a quiet sixth grader with an impeccable transcript, beat five seventh-grade opponents -- including one who handed out chocolate chip cookies -- by focusing his campaign on the younger students, promising to appoint at least one from each grade to his cabinet.
In art class, students are designing the currency, which will carry the faces of heroes they selected, including Marian Wright Edelman of the Children's Defense fund; the legendary Puerto Rican baseball player Roberto Clemente; and Sengbe Pieh, the leader of the revolt aboard the slave ship for which the school is named.
Teachers selected managers for each sector, then the job fair began.
"The first one I interviewed, her head was down and she was mumbling, I couldn't hear her, and she didn't ask any questions," said Jessica Zullo, the museum's head tour guide. "The second one I interviewed, she gave me a nice firm handshake, she looked me in the eye, she wrote a nice thank-you note." In class, Jessica added, "every time there's something to do, she's right there trying to help me out."
Jessica, who is 11, applied to be a manager because "I like being in charge." In real life, she, like several other micropoliticians, wants to be president. "You have to start out a lawyer, then you have to be a judge, then you become a legislator, then governor, then you can be president," Jessica explained.
"I have two more years left here," she pointed out. "Next year I'll be a legislator, then the year after that, I'll run for president."
She may as well wait. Article III, Section 3 of the microsociety's constitution sets a one-year term limit for president.

HEADLINE: Commercial Real Estate; 
Planned Office Complex: Big and Easy to Get To

BYLINE:  By SANA SIWOLOP 

 BODY:
After sitting fallow for 15 years, a 35-acre property that lies south of Black Rock Turnpike and east of Kings Highway East in Fairfield, Conn., is now the proposed site for a $250 million, eight-building office-and-retail complex. Real estate executives say it would be the largest commercial development ever in the town and one of the largest in the state.
 Despite having an enviable site right off Interstate 95, the property has long been an eyesore. The United Parcel Service bought the land in the mid-1980's with the goal of turning the 40-year-old foundry there into a major distribution center. But those plans were never realized, and for 15 years the land, which used to belong to the Bullard Company, a machinery maker, has been unused. U.P.S. recently sold the property to Blackrock Realty, a developer based in Stamford that is not associated with either the Manhattan-based BlackRock investment management firm or the similarly named real estate brokerage firm, also in Manhattan. 
 Planning has been under way since last summer for the complex project, which is a collaboration by the town of Fairfield, the state and Blackrock, a partnership formed by the Rugby Realty Company of Teterboro, N.J., and Kurt Wittek, a Stamford developer. 
Current plans call for the complex to have 1.1 million square feet of office space, 120,000 square feet of retail space, a new Metro-North Railroad station and parking for 1,200 commuter cars.
The project, which is scheduled to be completed in 2010, faces a few remaining hurdles. For one, while Blackrock already has the support of the town and the state, it is awaiting the formal approval of the town's planning and conservation departments as well as certain divisions within the state's Department of Transportation. 
Nevertheless, the state has already committed $16.2 million for the project, and Fairfield is considering adding $12 million, for a total of $28.2 million. That money would go toward building a platform for the new train station as well as a local access road and bridge. Blackrock, meanwhile, would be responsible for building the train depot and for the environmental cleanup of the entire site, an effort that would include restoring roughly 11 acres of open space adjacent to Ash Creek to a functioning wetland. 
John G. Metsopoulos, first selectman of Fairfield, said the project would solve some problems in the town, including a shortage of commuter parking and a federal mandate that Fairfield have at least one train station that can serve disabled travelers. While downtown Fairfield already has a Metro-North station, which is about a mile away from Blackrock's proposed depot, it cannot accommodate either more commuters or disabled travelers, he said. 
Mr. Metsopoulos also agreed with the findings of a recent economic impact report, commissioned by Blackrock, which estimated that the project would eventually bring 4,300 jobs into the Fairfield area, as well as $6 million in annual tax revenues. According to the report, the old Bullard site now produces tax revenues of about $100,000. 
"I think this project will have a very strong economic impact in our area," said Mr. Metsopoulos, who added that when he was a child, the Bullard foundry was a symbol of the vitality of the Fairfield and Bridgeport area. 
Blackrock executives say they want to restore that vitality. After first converting the old foundry building into three floors of office and retail space, they hope eventually to build seven additional office buildings, a health club and a hotel. Their plans also call for building a 2,000-foot-long nature walk as well as an additional 4,500 parking spaces for the office and retail users. 
Still, the proposed train station is what Blackrock's executives hope will set their development apart from other office parks.
"Office users now looking for space have to make an apples-or-oranges decision, either staying downtown, where they have various amenities and ease of access to public transport, or moving to a suburban office park," said Aaron D. Stauber, managing director of Rugby Realty. "This project incorporates the best of both worlds."
But the project may also help address the growing demand for office space northeast of Greenwich and Stamford. Real estate executives say this demand is being driven not just by high rents in those locations but also by the desire of many companies to relocate to an area that is already home to a large number of their workers, many of whom cannot afford to live farther south and west. 
"Right now there is a 1 percent vacancy rate for high-quality office space in the Fairfield area," said Daniel A. Mambrino, a senior director at Cushman & Wakefield of Connecticut. According to Mr. Mambrino, who helped to broker the recent sale of the U.P.S. property, the asking price for office space in the area has risen about $10 in each of the past two years and is now running in the low $30's per square foot. 
Mr. Wittek said his company was already in discussions with potential tenants now in Fairfield County. 
"We think our project is uniquely positioned to solve a number of problems for companies and their employees," he said. "The size of our property means we can change our plans to accommodate the needs of unique tenants, as well as attract world-class companies. But this is also a site that is 30 seconds off of I-95, in an area where overall development is headed."

Technology Gains, but Dow Slips After Topping 11,000

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Technology stocks rose yesterday, but the Dow Jones industrial average's rally above the key 11,000-point level lost steam and blue chips closed slightly lower.
 "The underlying premise is that the economy is going to be a lot better in the second half" because of the Federal Reserve's easing of interest rates, said Alfred Kugel, senior investment strategist at Stein Roe & Farnham. "Therefore, you don't want to be too negative on technology, but try to pick your spot." 
 Bargain hunters bought shares of beaten-down computer chip companies like Intel and personal computer makers like Dell Computer. Wall Street keenly awaited the results from the technology bellwether Cisco Systems, which, after the close, reported a 48 percent increase in profits, but still missed analysts' sales and earnings estimates by a penny a share. 
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 8.43 points, or 0.10 percent, to 10,957.42, after rallying early in the day above the 11,000 mark. The index has risen above that watermark several times in the last few months, but has not closed above it since mid-September.
The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index rose 21.28 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,664.49, after climbing more than 2 percent earlier. The Nasdaq bounced back after falling more than 4 percent on Friday as investors worried about the slowing United States economy and dwindling corporate earnings in the high-tech sector.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index shed 2.05 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,352.26.
The Dow's technology components, like I.B.M., bolstered the index, which was weighed down by faltering financial stocks like J. P. Morgan Chase, which closed down $2.32, at $52.28.
Both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq showed strength earlier in the day. But the rally lost momentum as investors locked in profits, especially after the Dow's rise above 11,000 faltered, analysts said.
"The Dow had a triple-digit gain yesterday, so once it got above 11,000 and could not hold, the profit taking comes in," Mr. Kugel said.
The possibility that the Dow could break out of its trading range helped the Nasdaq, noted Barry Hyman of Weatherly Securities.
"There is a correspondent spillover effect, in terms of the effect of how interest rates going lower can help the economy and growth stocks," Mr. Hyman said. "I think it is very important that the Dow closes above 11,000 to give us that technical break in the market to the upside."
Cisco Systems gained $1.19, to close at $35.75, but its shares fell to $34.38 in after-hours trading after the company reported its results.
Antitrust regulators cleared Dow Chemical's $7.3 billion purchase of Union Carbide after Dow agreed to sell a key plastics technology and divest itself of three other chemical businesses. Shares of Dow fell 79 cents, to $32.60, while Union Carbide fell 52 cents, to $52.25.

HEADLINE: MANAGEMENT; 
His Rear-View Mirror Reflects Big Business

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
Lloyd D. Ward, the former chief executive of the Maytag Corporation, is sitting in a cramped office here, talking about how he is going to make a household name out of a company most people have never heard of.
 After 15 stormy months at the top of Maytag, Mr. Ward resigned last November and then stunned corporate America by accepting a job as chairman and chief executive of an Internet start-up called iMotors, an online seller of used cars. 
 It was a giant step down from a brand-name maker of home appliances with 25,000 employees and $4 billion in annual sales to a privately held venture with 600 employees and tens of million of dollars in revenue. But Mr. Ward said he did not care that he jumped from an old-economy stalwart to a dot-com just when everyone else seemed to be fleeing in the opposite direction. 
On the contrary, he says, he relishes the challenge. "Someone said to me, 'Don't you feel like you've gone through a demotion?' I said, 'That doesn't even compute with me,' " he recalled. "If it's about performance and discovery, the opportunity I now have is the best opportunity of all the ones I looked at. This is the best for me."
Mr. Ward, 52, became only the second African-American to run a Fortune 500 company when he took over Maytag. Franklin D. Raines, chief executive of Fannie Mae, was the first. Now, he has set an even more extraordinary goal for himself: to become the first African-American to create such a company. He says he will turn iMotors, which finds, refurbishes, certifies and then resells used cars on the Web, into the Dell Computer of the car industry.
The dot-com world is littered with the wreckage of grandiose projects that have crashed into old-economy realities, of course, and skeptics say iMotors is a prime candidate to join the casualty toll. Car sales on the Web have fared poorly over the last few years, they say, and iMotors cannot hope to succeed unless it creates a national system with a widely recognized brand name. To do that, it will not only have to raise a huge amount of money but also capture the public's imagination.
"It certainly is a long shot, but there is a glimmer of hope," said Baba Shetty, an analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. Selling cars over the Web is tough, Mr. Shetty said, because while consumers like to glean pricing information from the Internet, they prefer trooping off to car dealers to inspect the actual merchandise.
Mr. Ward brushes aside such concerns. "I think iMotors will be a Fortune 500 company," he said in an interview at his office in San Francisco over a turkey and cranberry sandwich. "I'm not sure it'll be a Fortune 100 company."
This is no fly-by-night outfit, he says. Over the last two years, iMotors has raised about $137 million, and is backed by several big venture capital firms including one controlled by Paul G. Allen, the Microsoft co-founder. And last October, it beefed up its executive ranks by hiring Kiran Patel, the former chief financial officer at Cummins Engine, the diesel engine maker.
Mr. Ward, with an extensive corporate pedigree, is by far its biggest catch. He joined Maytag as executive vice president in 1996 after stints at Procter & Gamble, the Ford Motor Company and PepsiCo. After he was elevated to chief executive, a cover story in Business Week called him "one of the most driven men in America." And after he left Maytag, he was wooed by a bevy of would-be employers, including a Fortune 100 company, before going to iMotors.
Even so, for all of Mr. Ward's talk of exploiting the speed and versatility of the Internet at iMotors to sell a big-ticket consumer product, critics say that is what he tried and failed to do at Maytag. There, he pushed Internet ventures, like Outdoorliving .com, a Web site devoted to selling Maytag grills as well as delivering steaks and seafood to customers' homes, and he championed a partnership with Microsoft to develop appliances that interact with television and the Internet.
Nicholas Heymann, an analyst at Prudential, said Mr. Ward was a great promoter, wowing Wall Street with visions of Maytag's electronic future, only to let them down later. "The guy was a super e-dude. He had all these e-groups out there talking about how Maytag's goal was to enhance the joy of living," Mr. Heymann said. "Lloyd came in and got all these people gassed up."
At least some Maytag insiders share that view. "Lloyd's very charismatic, you get him in meetings and he energizes people," a senior executive said. The problem was, this executive said, "he went off on tangents."
"He'll grab onto something and he'll run with it and he'll forget the old stuff."
Outdoorliving.com, for example, the executive said, "isn't a bad business school concept, but it's not Maytag."
Mr. Ward did not dispute the executive's assessment.
To some extent, Mr. Ward was the victim of bad luck, or perhaps, bad timing. Even as he took over Maytag in the summer of 1999 and set the goal of doubling revenue within five years, sales were showing signs of weakening. Within a year, Circuit City, a major retailer, stopped selling home appliances, and in August 2000, Heilig & Meyers, another national chain that carried Maytag products, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and shut down a third of its nearly 900 stores. Maytag's Dixie-Narco vending-machine unit, meantime, was hurt by softening demand for soft drinks.
Mr. Ward also sought to cut costs by farming out administrative work and he instituted a quality-control regimen that he called "lean Sigma," a variation of the Six Sigma program made famous at General Electric. But as it became increasingly apparent that the company would fall short of his rosy profit forecasts, its share price fell sharply and several top executives departed. In his final months, employee morale was sapped by newspaper reports that the company was planning to move its headquarters to Chicago from Newton, Iowa, and that it was in merger talks with Electrolux, the Swedish maker of household appliances.
On Nov. 9, Mr. Ward abruptly resigned, citing "strategic differences" with the board. He was replaced by Leonard A. Hadley, his predecessor at Maytag, who is serving as interim chief executive. Mr. Hadley, who has made it clear that he intends to keep Maytag in Iowa, quickly shuttered several of the ventures started by Mr. Ward, including Outdoorliving.com.
Mr. Ward said he had no regrets about the way things ended. "I have no misgivings, malice or bad feelings about Maytag," he said. "The thing I feel very good about is the board and I were upfront and forthright. We looked things squarely in the eye; there was nothing clandestine. These were the rougher discussions you had to have in these challenging times."
Besides, he said, even though he may have moved too fast at Maytag, the experience taught him that he needed to be somewhere at the intersection of the new and the old economies. Within five days of his resignation, he received feelers from a number of corporations and universities and even from political professionals who wondered if he was interested in running for public office, he says.
"I'm interviewing at one of the Fortune 100 companies," he said. "I'm in this incredible office, this awesome mahogany palace in a wonderful setting. Everything at your fingertips, all the resources."
But he was most intrigued by the offer from iMotors, because it promised the opportunity of building a corporate culture, rather than altering or reforming one. He visited the company's three refurbishing plants with his wife, Lita, and one of his two sons, who had run an Internet start-up that failed, he said, and thus had a keen eye for bubbles ready to burst.
This was not one of them, in his view. He liked iMotors, he says, because it was a hybrid, a blend of the old bricks and mortar and the digital age. So Mr. Ward, who says he follows the value-investing philosophy of Warren E. Buffett, became convinced the iMotors model of buying used cars that have been on the road for no more than five years, sprucing them up in its own factories and then selling the "premium-priced, premium cars" over the Internet, was not just viable, it was potentially lucrative.
"As part of my exploration I go to every factory," Mr. Ward said. "I shake hands with the workers, I listen to their stories; I see the dents, dings and scuffs, and I see it come out of the factory like new. I saw the product under a fluorescent light and it was magical. I said, 'There is a value-added product.' "
He says he does not underestimate the hurdles ahead. He knows that creating a major business in an online space where few auto companies have succeeded will not be easy. Nor will branding iMotors as the leading company in a category, used cars, that the public does not look fondly upon.
"The used-car experience is one of little trust," Mr. Ward said, "and it's in need of significant re-engineering."
Joining iMotors also completes a personal journey for Mr. Ward, who grew up poor in Romulus, Mich., just outside of Detroit. As a boy, his father had dreamed of opening an auto mechanic shop with his sons called Ward & Sons. But he died in 1967, at 47.
"That's one reason I can take a job like this," Mr. Ward said. "It's a little bit taking me back to my roots."
Mr. Ward is spending his time now worrying about cash flow, and trying to bring discipline to a company that is hoping to raise another round of money. Most of the corporate perks he knew at Maytag are gone. There are no corporate jets, no speech writers and not even a secretary for him at iMotors. He orders his own meals, answers his own e-mail messages and sometimes makes his own rental car arrangements.
None of that matters, he says, because he is in charge of something new. "I've always wanted to be an entrepreneur," he said. "I've spent 30 years in big business, but in many ways I've always been an intrepreneur -- an entrepreneur working inside a big company -- and so it seemed like a good time to do this."
Besides, he says, he can always go back. "I'm telling you," he said confidently, leaning back in his chair, "I will run a Fortune 100 company before my journey is over."

Ex-Drug Dealer Gets Help In Keeping a Legal Job

BYLINE:  By AARON DONOVAN 

 BODY:
David Harris's drug-dealing friends knew they had a winner when he told them he had never been arrested. They asked him to help them sell drugs and assured him that if the police ever caught him, he would not go to jail. "My friends said, 'David, you have no record,' " he recalled. " 'How would you like to make some quick money and get high?' "
 To Mr. Harris, a developmentally disabled man from the Bronx who had a young son, David Jr., but no job, it sounded like a good idea, though he had reservations. "I knew eventually I was going to get killed or get in trouble," he said recently. 
 Eventually he did get in trouble, but his friends who told him that he would not be given a prison sentence were right. When he was arrested in 1987 for drug possession, the judge gave him a few months' probation.
But he kept dealing drugs, and in 1989, when he was arrested a second time, the judge sentenced him to eight months on Rikers Island.
And when he was arrested for the third time, in 1995, he was given two to six years, which he began serving in prisons upstate.
"Every time I came home from prison, I always went back," Mr. Harris said, "because I had no help."
A prison staff member told officials of the State Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities about Mr. Harris, and they began to search for a program that could help him. They suggested that he be put in the Arthur Kill Correctional Facility on Staten Island to be closer to programs in the city and began telling nonprofit agencies about him in the hope that one would volunteer to help him.
Information about his case came to the attention of Caryn Sicignano, an intake coordinator for FEGS, formerly the Federation Employment and Guidance Service. FEGS, which specializes in job training for the unemployed, is a beneficiary agency of UJA-Federation of New York, one of the seven local charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. 
Ms. Sicignano visited Mr. Harris at Arthur Kill and told him that when he got out, FEGS would help him get a job and guidance. "She was like a mother to me," said Mr. Harris, 37. "For someone from the other side to come and visit me, it was like a joy. I will never forget her."
He was released last June into the custody of FEGS, which put him in supervised housing. 
"They weren't going to let him out of prison into the street," Ms. Sicignano said. "He needed a 24-hour -- or close to it -- supervised setting."
He was also enrolled in a short-term job-training program. It teaches developmentally disabled adults the communications skills they need to get a job and how to travel by subway and bus, and puts many in short-term jobs working in soup kitchens and the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in the Bronx. "David was a very big help to us," said Nigel Nero, the job-training program supervisor. "He has a lot of abilities."
After days at the program, he returns home to a three-bedroom apartment in the Norwood section of the Bronx that he shares with two other men enrolled in FEGS programs. FEGS staff members visit daily to make sure the men are taking the medications they need, teach them how to cook and help residents get ready for work by waking them up in the morning and by supervising as they eat breakfast and get washed and dressed for the day.
On Monday, Mr. Harris got a job as a Manhattan foot messenger. Now that he has a job and is living in a stable environment, he can focus more attention on David Jr., 18, a freshman at Columbia who lives with his mother in Harlem. The two speak on the phone every day.
"I'm very proud for him to be the only one from the family that grew up to go to college," Mr. Harris said. "I couldn't believe it until I went on campus to see it myself."

TOSHIBA CUTS PROFIT OUTLOOK

BYLINE:  By Miki Tanikawa 

 BODY:
 The Toshiba Corporation warned that its group net profit for the year ending in March will be 30 percent lower than had been previously forecast because of falling sales and prices of chips and PC's caused by the slowing economy in the United States. Toshiba, a leading Japanese chip maker, lowered its profit forecast to 96 billion yen ($837 million) from 137 billion yen. The company lowered its revenue forecast 3.9 percent, to 5.98 trillion yen ($52 billion). Toshiba also said its American unit would lay off 500 assembly line workers and engineers at its computer-making plant in Irvine, Calif., and shift much of the work to Asia.

HEADLINE: Women's Health Is No Longer a Man's World 

BYLINE:  By TAMAR LEWIN 

 BODY:
When Dr. David Garfinkel joined a New Jersey ob-gyn practice in 1996, his contract provided for a $65,000 raise his second year and a share in the practice the third year. But Dr. Garfinkel received no raise -- and in January 1998, he was told that he would not become a shareholder in the practice, Morristown Obstetrics & Gynecology Associates. 
 "They said that because I was male, I wasn't drawing as many patients as they'd expected," he said. 
 Two months later, Dr. Garfinkel was fired. He responded by opening his own practice, right next door -- and suing for breach of contract and sex discrimination. 
The Morristown practice he is suing refused to comment on the case, but the lawyer representing the practice said Dr. Garfinkel's firing had nothing to do with his sex. 
"Dr. Garfinkel was let go for economic reasons," said the lawyer, Glenn Montgomery. "He was brought in at a salary twice what a normal beginning doctor would get, because he said he had a big following, and it turned out he didn't have that following."
Whatever the facts of Dr. Garfinkel's case, no one denies that the field is changing rapidly, and Dr. Garfinkel is by no means the only man in it feeling that his professional prospects have been chilled by the winds of social change across the nation -- and the increasing availability of, and patient preference for, female ob-gyns. 
Though men still dominate the field -- about 64 percent of the doctors practicing obstetrics and gynecology are male -- most of the doctors now training in the specialty are women. This year, women have filled 70.3 percent of the nation's ob-gyn residencies, compared with slightly less than half 10 years ago. And the shift is apparently intensifying. 
"From what I hear, most program directors found that that 80 to 90 percent of their residency applicants this year are females," said Dr. John Musich, chairman of the Council on Resident Education in Obstetrics and Gynecology. "It's a huge issue for male medical students. We can't force patients to see a particular gender, and there are women who feel that women are more sensitive as physicians to female complaints than men might be. It's reality, and we have to deal with it." 
Dr. Erin Tracy, of Massachusetts General Hospital, chairwoman of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Junior Fellow Advisory Council, said her group had become concerned about how few men were now choosing the specialty of caring for women. 
"At some medical schools, male medical students are being discouraged from going into ob-gyn," Dr. Tracy said. "It really is reverse discrimination. We don't want this to be a specialty just for women." 
Recently, a few men have begun to fight back, arguing in court and other forums that the preference for women constitutes sex discrimination. 
It is a novel legal argument: sex discrimination against male doctors, by male doctors, in a field where most practitioners are male. And it tests the limits of a longstanding tenet of employment law, namely, that customer preferences generally do not justify discrimination in hiring or employment. 
Most doctors and patients believe that women should be able to choose a female physician. How that plays out in hiring is complicated, especially for private practices competing for patients. Recruiters say there is strong demand for female doctors, both from all-women practice groups and from older male doctors hoping to attract new patients by adding a woman to their practice. 
"There's a lot of very fine male gynecologists out there, but many women find it easier to talk to another woman when the subject is sexuality or menopause or pregnancy," said Dr. Susan Klugman of the all-women Montefiore Larchmont Women's Center. "And it's perfectly understandable. Find me a lot of men who'll go to a female urologist for their yearly prostate exam." 
Given patient preferences, is it wrong for a practice with an opening to favor female applicants? 
"That's for the lawyers to work out," said Dr. Klugman. "All I know is that many of our patients tell us how glad they are to be able to see women, who know exactly what they're going through." 
Dr. Tracy rejects that approach to choosing a doctor. 
"It's unrealistic for women to say that their doctor has to have gone through labor to understand labor," she said. "They'd never expect their cancer doctor to have had cancer." 
It was precisely the desire to market to women's preferences for female doctors that led to his firing, Dr. Garfinkel contends, adding that the practice hired three female doctors and no men after him.
Dr. Garfinkel's case is now before the New Jersey Supreme Court on a procedural question. 
In similar cases over the last year, courts have rejected sex-bias claims by fired male ob-gyns. In a federal appeals ruling in Connecticut last August, and a federal district decision in New York in September, judges found that there were nondiscriminatory reasons for the firings. 
In the New York case, Dr. Mircea Veleanu argued, in part, that the Beth Israel Medical Center practice with which he had been associated, discriminated against him by accommodating female patients who had requested female doctors. 
In dismissing Dr. Veleanu's claims, the court cited past cases, involving wash-room attendants and male nurses, that recognized a justification for sex-based requirements in certain jobs.
"That a medical entity may seek to respond to some medical treatment requests of its female patients -- an expression of preference particular to the health care field -- does not, of itself, indicate that it discriminates against male doctors," Judge Victor Marrero of Federal District Court wrote in the decision. 
Many young male doctors are aware of the bias against them each time they see advertisements in professional journals saying "female ob-gyn group seeks associate," or "seeking board certified ob-gyn to join all-female private practice." 
"I've learned that they're not looking for me if the ad says they need an ob-gyn in an all-female practice," said Dr. Randy Fink, chief resident at Women and Infants Hospital in Providence, R.I. "I've sent C.V.'s, and haven't heard back. It does bother me. I don't see how it's different from an ad saying 'physician wanted to join all-Caucasian practice.' "
Dr. Fink said he was discouraged from becoming a gynecologist at every step of the process. 
"When I talked about choosing ob-gyn, people would say, 'You're never going to have a job,' or tell me that all their patients want to see a woman," he said, adding that the issue also arose again in his first residency interview. "There was a woman who sat down and said, 'What gives you the right to take care of women?' " 
Dr. Fink is about to join a two-woman practice in Florida. But, he said, the preference for women has quietly defined the job prospects of those he has trained with. 
"In the group of seven residents here, five of us have lined up jobs, and here's one woman who has not found a job because she hasn't looked, and one man who hasn't found a job because he wants Boston, and he's getting told there are no jobs," he said last month. "But the woman is getting calls from Boston practices several times a week. It's all market driven." 
Recruiters are keenly aware of the preference for female ob-gyns and of the need to walk a careful line in giving clients what they want without breaking the law.
"Some people who come to us will say that they're looking for a woman, but we remind them that we will send them all qualified candidates," said Julie Sherriff of Sherriff & Associates, a physician search firm in Kansas. "Sometimes, they do end up hiring a man even if that's not what they initially said they wanted. But females have an edge because once the word gets out that a female has joined a practice, within a month or two, max, their practice is full." 
Dr. Garfinkel's practice, meanwhile, has grown enough for him to hire another doctor -- a man. 
It is not lost on Dr. Garfinkel and others in the medical community that male doctors may be facing what women seeking work in male-dominated fields experienced not so long ago.
"I think it's similar to certain fields where women have to work harder to prove themselves," he said. "Men in this field have to be more sensitive." 
Given the long history of male control of female medicine, that may be a good thing. But every social change exacts a price.
"Whenever the topic of discrimination comes up, there are all these women to talk about how, when they were the only women, they had to fight and claw their way to the top, as if turning the tables makes it O.K.," Dr. Fink said. "But it doesn't."

HEADLINE: Despite Recovery Efforts, Sunbeam Filesfor Chapter 11 

BYLINE:  By RIVA D. ATLAS and JANE TANNER 

 BODY:
The Sunbeam Corporation filed yesterday for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, the latest step in a nearly three-year effort to recover from an accounting scandal and a series of acquisitions that left it with $2.6 billion in debt.
 The filing came as little surprise to investors in Sunbeam's stock, which sold for 51 cents a share yesterday when the New York Stock Exchange suspended trading in it and began working to delist it. The stock traded for as much as $6 a share last March. 
 With just $15 million in cash as of Feb. 2, according to yesterday's filing in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, Sunbeam had little choice but to file for bankruptcy protection. "They were so dangerously leveraged, they had too much wind in their face to overcome," said Rommel Dionisio, an analyst with Friedman, Billings & Ramsey. "There was no breathing room, no margin for error." 
As part of the reorganization plan for the company, which makes Oster blenders, Coleman camping equipment and Sunbeam household appliances, banks that made a combined commitment to lend $1.7 billion have agreed to provide another $285 million to let Sunbeam stay in business. This arrangement, known as debtor-in-possession financing, gives the lenders first claim on a company's assets. Since Sunbeam is still losing money, banks are unlikely to lend more without this secured status, loan traders said.
Sunbeam's problems became apparent in 1998, when it was discovered that Albert J. Dunlap, a turnaround expert who was then the company's chief executive, had artificially bolstered sales by getting retailers to accept more goods than they could possibly sell.
At the same time, Sunbeam was struggling with a load of debt, including the $1.7 billion bank loan it had taken on earlier that year after making three acquisitions. The loan was made by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company, the First Union Corporation and the Bank of America Corporation. After Sunbeam's accounting irregularities became known, the banks were unable to sell portions of the loan to other lenders, as is customary with syndicated loans.
Sunbeam's current chief executive, Jerry W. Levin, who replaced Mr. Dunlap, has struggled to revive profits, even as he has negotiated with lenders to cut the debt. Mr. Levin also had to cope with shareholder lawsuits and an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Last November, Sunbeam said that the federal agency expected to file charges against the company.
Before joining Sunbeam, Mr. Levin was a strategist for the financier Ronald O. Perelman, who owns 14.1 million shares, or about 14 percent, of Sunbeam. Mr. Perelman acquired the shares in February 1998, when Sunbeam bought the Coleman Company, which made camping gear, from his holding company, MacAndrews & Forbes. The sale closed just weeks before Sunbeam's accounting irregularities became apparent.
"Like every other stockholder, MacAndrews & Forbes was victimized by what happened at Sunbeam," a spokesman for Mr. Perelman said yesterday.
While Mr. Levin restored some stability to Sunbeam and repaired relationships with suppliers and discount retailers, the company's sales were still down 9.6 percent in the first nine months of 2000. The company blamed a weak economy.
Mr. Levin, who has been negotiating with the banks for several months to restructure the terms of their loan, said yesterday in an interview that the lenders would ultimately control Sunbeam. "The company will be owned 100 percent by the banks," he said.
Both Bank of America and First Union said in the third quarter of 2000 that they expected to write down the value of a large corporate loan before the end of the year. While neither bank would identify the borrower, it is widely believed to be Sunbeam.
A spokeswoman for First Union and a spokesman for Bank of America declined to comment on the bankruptcy filing. A spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley said only that "Sunbeam's filing was well anticipated, and we are comfortable with our asset mark."
Since First Union and Bank of America are believed to have marked down the value of their Sunbeam loans, traders of bank debt have been anticipating that the banks will look to sell off portions of the loan. In recent weeks, a $50 million piece of the loan changed hands, said several executives active in the loan market, who thought Bank of America was the seller. The price was thought to be around 50 cents on the dollar, they said.
Some traders say the banks will have a rough time salvaging much of their investment. Since the piece of the Bank of America loan was traded, the price offered for the debt has fallen even further, traders said. 
Mr. Levin, who has two years left on his contract, said he intended to see the reorganization through.
"We're committed to stay through the process," he said.

Bums and Rushes

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
"Hurry up!" say the Bush people. "We need tax cuts now! In fact, we need them yesterday!"
 No, seriously. The administration has declared not only that it wants to accelerate tax cuts, but that it wants to make the cuts retroactive to the beginning of this year. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill has suggested that later this year he may be mailing out checks, refunding the "excess" taxes paid before those retroactive tax cuts actually become law. 
 Think of it as a bum's rush -- an attempt to run tax-cut skeptics out of town before they have a chance to make their case. But the attempt itself is a giveaway; it shows why the tax cut Mr. Bush proposes is not what the country needs.
Let's say right away -- in fact, let's make this observation retroactive to Jan. 1 -- that claims that tax cuts can be accelerated without reducing our soon-to-be-gone budget surplus are disingenuous. George W. Bush's economists have always tried to hold down the headline number on tax cuts by delaying the start of the big tax breaks. The $1.3 trillion number you heard about during the campaign, which has since grown to $1.6 trillion, depended on the assumption that many of the tax breaks would phase in only very slowly. Accelerate the phase-in, and the number becomes a lot bigger.
Furthermore, early tax cuts take a larger bite out of surplus projections. That $1.6 trillion cut is really $2 trillion off the surplus, because tax cuts reduce the rate at which the government pays off its debt and therefore raise its interest payments; the earlier the cut, the larger that effect. Each dollar of tax cuts this year will actually slash about $1.80 off the 10-year surplus.
The real story, however, is not the cost of this proposal but the way it undermines the whole rationale for tax cuts tilted toward the rich.
Conservatives used to be supply-siders -- they wanted tax cuts in order to increase the incentive to work hard, take risks and all that. But a retroactive tax cut, a cut in the taxes due on the income you have already earned, can't provide an incentive to earn more. Goodbye Reaganomics, hello crude demand-side Keynesianism. 
And if pumping up consumer demand is the rationale for tax cuts, why must they go mainly to the very, very affluent?
If incentives are the issue, what you want to do is reduce marginal tax rates, the rates taxpayers pay on any additional income they earn. And it's hard to reduce marginal rates without giving disproportionately large tax cuts to people with high incomes. That, say conservatives, is why their tax-cut proposals always provide such large benefits to the top 1 or 2 percent of the income distribution. It's all about incentives, they claim, and it just so happens that the biggest positive impact is on the lifestyles of the rich. 
But a retroactive tax cut, one that applies to income you've already earned, can't have any incentive effects; so why tilt it toward the top? If the purpose of a tax cut is simply to put more money into people's pockets, why not put it into the pockets of those who really need it? One simple proposal would be to make Mr. O'Neill's checks proportional not to income taxes but to Social Security and Medicare contributions; after all, four out of five families pay more in these payroll taxes than they do in income tax.
But Mr. Bush surely won't accept any such proposal, because the alleged need for economic stimulus is only an excuse. Senator Charles Grassley, chairman of the Finance Committee, was refreshingly frank: "If we do it earlier, I don't think we're really stimulating the economy. I think we're putting in place at an earlier time basic tax restructuring." In other words, all this talk about the need for fast tax cuts is an attempt to give skeptics the bum's rush, using panic over a short-term slowdown to hustle through long-run tax cuts that will do nothing to fight that slowdown.
It's a tactic Mr. Bush's people clearly like; they're doing the same thing on environmental policy, trying to use California's electricity crisis to hustle through a weakening of environmental protection in Alaska and elsewhere. It's up to the Democrats, and perhaps a few principled Republicans, to demonstrate that they aren't bums, and they won't be rushed.

 EUROPE

FRANCE: KOUCHNER RESUMES POST
Bernard Kouchner, the outspoken former United Nations chief adminstrator in Kosovo, has gotten his old job back as France's health minister. Dr. Kouchner -- a physician who was co-founder of Doctors Without Borders -- had been health minister for two years when he left for Kosovo in July 1999, soon after NATO troops entered the Serbian province after the bombing campaign to end the oppression of ethnic Albanians. Alessandra Stanley (NYT)

YUGOSLAVIA: TALKS WITH REBELS OFFERED
The Yugoslav government adopted a plan that includes negotiations with ethnic Albanian rebels and the phased demilitarization of the tense region of southern Serbia along the boundary with Kosovo. The decision followed a night of heavy artillery exchanges between the Yugoslav army and Albanian separatists.Carlotta Gall (NYT)

FRANCE: FUGITIVE EXTRADICTED
Alfred Sivren, a French businessman suspected of being at the center of a major corruption scandal, arrived in France after being extradicted from Germany. Mr. Sivren, a top executive at the former state-run Elf Acquitaine oil company, had been on trial in absentia for two weeks before his arrest Friday in the Philippines. He is one of seven defendants in the case, which also involves former Foreign Minister Roland Dumas. (AP)

MIDDLE EAST

SYRIA: GREEN LIGHT FOR PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES
Syria approved the establishment of private universities, ending over half a century of socialist government monopoly over higher education. The decision came at a Baath Party meeting, led by President Bashar al-Assad, who has begun wide-ranging reforms since succeeding his late father Hafez al-Assad last year as Syria's ruler. (Reuters)

HAITI: U.N. SHUTS OFFICE
The United Nations closed its police training and human rights mission as its mandate expired. Secretary General Kofi Annan said last fall that the mission would not be extended, citing a lack of funds and a "political turmoil." (Agence France-Presse)

CUBA: JAILED CZECHS FREED
Two prominent Czechs jailed for more than three weeks headed home after they admitted breaking Cuban law. A Czech lawmaker, Ivan Pilip, and Jan Bubenik were arrested Jan. 12 after meeting with Cuban dissidents. They were released Monday night after drawing up an admission signed before diplomats from several nations. (AP)

MEXICO: GAINS FOR ENVIRONMENTALISTS
President Vicente Fox said the government would review the cases of two jailed enviromentalists to see if "injustice has been committed." The national human rights commission has said the prisoners, Rodolfo Montiel and Teodoro Cabrera, who had fought illegal logging in the state of Guerrero, may have been framed. Meanwhile, Mr. Montiel received a award from the Sierra Club, which cited his "extraordinary courage." Tim Weiner (NYT)

MEXICO: U.S. TO PAY PARALYZED MEXICAN
The United States Drug Enforcement Administration will pay $1.75 million in damages to a Mexican migrant shot and paralyzed by one of its agents, Mexico's foreign ministry said. Two years ago, the agent, Wilburt Honeycutt, shot Abecnego Monje Ortiz, then 18, as he tried to cross into Texas. Mr. Honeycutt is serving a 15-year prison term for aggravated assault. Tim Weiner (NYT)

AFRICA

ETHIOPIA, ERITREA: PEACE MOVE
Ethiopia and Eritrea agreed to a temporary buffer zone between them, removing a roadblock to the peace effort begun in December after a cease-fire ended their two-year border war, the United Nations said. The December agreement required Ethiopia to pull back its troops to positions it held before the war broke out in 1998 and Eritrea to withdraw to 15 miles from Ethiopian positions, but the moves were delayed by disputes over what territory the countries controlled before the conflict. (Reuters)

ASIA

JAPAN: E-MAIL FUROR
The commander of United States forces on the island of Okinawa aplogized for calling local officials "nuts" and "wimps" in e-mail sent to 13 fellow officers that was leaked to Japanese media. Lt. Gen. Earl Hailston was reportedly responding to a call by Okinawa's local assembly for a reduction in American troops. The assembly acted after the arrest in January of a Marine corporal for lifting a girl's skirt to photograph her underwear. (Reuters)

CHINA: CALLING ON WASHINGTON
China's top foreign policy official, Deputy Prime Minister Qian Qichen, plans to visit Washington next month for what are expected to be Beijing's first high-level exchanges with the new Bush administration. Mr. Qian is likely to press the United States to maintain a "one China" policy and to hold down arms deliveries to Taiwan. In October, President Bush is to make his first official visit to China for an Asia-Pacific economic meeting. Erik Eckholm (NYT)

SINGAPORE: LIMITS OF FREE SPEECH
The head of a local civil rights group, Jim Gomez, said he had been summoned by the police over a rally he had organized on Dec. 10 to mark International Human Rights Day. It was the second summons of a member of his group for activities held at "Speakers' Corner," an open-air venue inaugurated last year to experiment with the idea of free public speaking in Singapore. Seth Mydans (NYT)

INDIA: TOBACCO RESTRICTIONS
Parliamentary Affairs minister Pramod Mahajan said the government will introduce legislation this month to ban the sale of tobacco products to anyone under age 18, fine people for smoking in public spaces and end the sponsorship of cultural and sporting events by tobacco companies. He said treatment of tobacco-related ailments costs India almost $3 billion a year. Celia W. Dugger (NYT)

HEADLINE: Washington Talk; 
Celebrating the Birthday And Legacy of Reagan

BYLINE:  By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6 

 BODY:
It sometimes seems as if he never left.
 On the 90th birthday of Ronald Wilson Reagan, the capital he departed a dozen years ago is awash in debate over policies at the center of his presidency, from tax cuts to a missile defense shield, from free trade to the privatization of Social Security. 
 Mr. Reagan, his memories of Washington dimmed if not destroyed by Alzheimer's disease, was reported to have spent his birthday quietly at his home in Los Angeles, where he is recovering from a broken hip he suffered last month. "He's not in pain," Nancy Reagan said in an interview broadcast today on CNN. "He heals very quickly." 
But on the opposite side of the continent, in the city that was both home to the movement known as the Reagan Revolution and to the government bureaucracy it sought to dismantle, memories of the 40th president were as vivid today as ever.
Among the army of Reagan supporters and the legions of his critics who still populate Washington, there was agreement that ideas championed by the movie-star-turned-governor-turned-president still dominate the political landscape, especially with Republicans in control of both the White House and the Congress.
"Very few things that were said during the last campaign by George W. Bush could not have been said by Ronald Reagan," said Martin Anderson, who was Mr. Reagan's domestic and economic policy adviser in 1981 and 1982 and was a campaign adviser to Mr. Bush.
"If you look at rebuilding the military or missile defense -- that's Reagan," he said. "If you look at Social Security and using some of the tax payments to invest in the private market -- that's Reagan. If you look at educational vouchers -- that's Reagan. If you look at tax policy and cutting marginal tax rates -- that's Reagan."
Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, Mr. Reagan's United Nations delegate and now a professor of government at Georgetown University, said Mr. Reagan -- along with Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Boris N. Yeltsin -- deserved credit for ending the cold war. She rejected the argument often made by Democrats that the collapse of the Soviet Union had been inevitable, and that Mr. Reagan simply accelerated the process.
"I don't imagine that Ronald Reagan singlehandedly ended the cold war, no such thing, but I think his contributions were absolutely critical," she said, singling out his deployment of medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe and his advocacy of an antimissile shield.
Another politician who arrived in Washington along with Mr. Reagan in January 1981, Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, said the former president's legacy was found not in the long economic boom of recent years or the end of the cold war, but in the nation's continuing struggle with urban poverty, homelessness and AIDS.
"He got the government out of the business of helping people with housing, and today we have an exacerbated housing crisis because of it" Mr. Frank said. "He was terrible on race, he was terrible on gay issues, he ignored AIDS. He may personally have been a very nice man, but the policies -- to the extent that they had an effect -- were disastrous for vulnerable people."
And like many prominent economists, Mr. Frank said the Reagan legacy would forever be tarnished by the government deficits he piled up as a result of his tax cuts and military buildup. The total federal debt owed to the public rose during the eight years of his presidency from $712 billion to more than $2 trillion -- debt that is still being paid off. 
Mr. Frank was not invited to tonight's birthday celebration in Washington, which was being held at the gargantuan federal building along Pennsylvania Avenue named for Mr. Reagan.
The Reagan Alumni Association, a group of nearly 5,000 dues-paying veterans of the Reagan administration and his presidential campaigns, sponsors the event every year, and the $90-a-ticket, 90th birthday party was expected to be the biggest yet.
The guest list included newly appointed senior officials of the Bush administration, many of whom came to Washington 20 years ago because of Mr. Reagan. Some admitted they can sound a bit like cult members when they discuss the former president. More than a few have named children after him.
Grover Norquist, a conservative activist who helped lead the successful campaign to rename Washington National airport for Mr. Reagan, will probably recruit at the party for his next crusade: replacing Alexander Hamilton with Mr. Reagan on the $10 bill. "Hamilton was a great American, but it's time to move on," Mr. Norquist said.
Reagan Dunn, who recently arrived here from his native Washington State to take a job as a lawyer-adviser in the public affairs office of the Justice Department, is the 29-year-old son of Representative Jennifer Dunn, a Washington Republican and Reagan supporter from the early days of his political career.
Mr. Dunn was given the name to honor Mr. Reagan when he was still governor of California. "I wear it with great pride," Mr. Dunn said, adding that he saw many similarities between his namesake and the newest occupant of the White House. "George Bush has the same quality of integrity," he said.
President Bush -- the son of Mr. Reagan's vice president and a man often compared to Mr. Reagan because of their shared policy goals, folksy disposition and occasional difficulty with extemporaneous speech -- said in a statement that Mr. Reagan "changed the world."
"You came to the White House when the cold war was real," Mr. Bush said, reading the statement on CNN. "You came here at a time when our country needed confidence. You told us we could be strong again, at home and abroad. And when you left, we were."

HEADLINE: Bush to Open Country to Mexican Truckers 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
The Bush administration indicated yesterday that it would reverse a Clinton administration policy and begin allowing Mexican trucks to haul goods throughout the United States, notwithstanding concerns about the trucks' safety problems.
 Administration officials disclosed the plan on the same day that a dispute-resolution panel ruled that the United States was violating the North American Free Trade Agreement by not already allowing Mexican trucks to enter. 
 "The president has said that Nafta trucking provisions should be implemented, and we intend to do that," said Clair Buchan, a White House spokeswoman.
The proposed change, long sought by Mexico, comes just 10 days before Mr. Bush travels to Mexico. 
The president has not decided on the exact timing of the move, administration officials said, noting that it remained unclear whether he would agree to a limited opening of the border or a broad one.
The plan is expected to generate protests. Union officials voice fears that Mexican truckers, who often earn one-fourth as much as unionized American truckers, will take American jobs. And consumer groups, noting that 41 percent of Mexican trucks failed American inspections at the border, argue that the trucks will endanger Americans.
Bret Caldwell, a spokesman for the Teamsters union, said, "We will continue to fight the opening of the border until the Mexican government can guarantee their standards are higher and the U.S. can guarantee that we have the inspection facilities to keep unsafe trucks out."
The administration's move surprised some union leaders, because Mr. Bush has courted the Teamsters more than any other union.
Under Nafta, the United States was supposed to give broad access to Mexican trucks in 1995, but President Bill Clinton, under heavy pressure from his union allies, kept the provision from taking effect, saying Mexico had to do more to address safety problems first.
That year, the Mexican government, invoking Nafta's provisions, asked that a five-member panel be set up to determine whether Washington was violating the accord.
In its decision, the panel -- two Americans, two Mexicans and a British chairman -- unanimously ruled that the United States would be in violation if it did not begin considering applications from Mexican trucking companies. More than 160 applications are pending.
"The decision says the Department of Transportation must consider applications on individual merit and may not refuse authority across the board to all Mexican companies," said an American trade official who had read the decision, which is to be released today. 
The official said the panel made clear that the United States was entitled under Nafta to set its own safety standards and to ensure that Mexican trucking companies meet them.
"As we move forward, the United States will not compromise highway safety in any way," the official said.
Currently, Mexican truckers can drive up to 25 miles north of the border. Then they normally transfer their loads to American trucks. Each year, about five million commercial trucks cross the border, hauling about three-fourths of the $250 billion in United States-Mexico trade. 
Mexican officials say opening the border will save American consumers millions of dollars by lowering transportation costs. 
"The cost has been lost business opportunities for Mexican trucking companies," said Luis de la Calle, under secretary in Mexico's Economy Ministry. "The system we have today is archaic. To change tractors at the border creates lines, which means more lost time and greater costs of doing business."
A 1996 letter that Mr. Bush, then Texas' governor, signed with the governors of Arizona, California and New Mexico, said, "This transborder trucking delay robs the entire U.S.-Mexico border region of the full economic benefits that Nafta promises."
Under Nafta rules, the United States could continue to keep the trucks out, but then it would have to compensate Mexico by, for example, agreeing to let it impose punitive tariffs on some American goods.
Critics warned that opening the border could backfire politically for Mr. Bush if Mexican truckers caused accidents that killed Americans.
"It is imperative that we continue to limit access for these dangerous trucks even if it means paying trade sanctions," said Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, a consumer safety group. "It is impossible to inspect every truck, and we cannot knowingly put drivers at risk by inviting dangerous rigs onto U.S. highways."

Taxing My Patience

BYLINE:  By MAUREEN DOWD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
At first, I had separation anxiety.
 I missed all the chaos and intrigue, the lies and cover-ups and sweet talk and reconciliations and razzmatazz. 
 I stalked my ex. I couldn't help myself.
I drove up to Chappaqua and stood around for hours in the cold and slush of Bill's driveway. I bought a box of Pepperidge Farm Double Chocolate Chunk cookies at his favorite deli, hoping the aroma would lure him out of the house. 
Bill still had trouble written all over him. I still wanted to cover a guy who had trouble written all over him.
I wasn't ready for Junior. I wasn't looking forward to a lot of towel-snapping bonhomie, punctuality and discipline from the West Wing, and peace and quiet from the East Wing.
The future was looking depressingly like the past. Washington smells of mothballs -- a tax cut, recession fears, a Star Wars shield, energy woes, abortion curbs, Christian right-eousness, a rumor of war in the Middle East, the trio of Bush, Powell and Cheney saber-rattling at Saddam.
In this week of birthday homages to the Gipper, W. even resumed a Reaganesque theme-of-the-week to hawk a Reaganesque tax cut.
As Bill flew off to the Boca sunshine, I slunk back to rainy D.C. to face the music.
W. was busy peddling his tax cut with a lot of photo ops featuring working-class families.
To hear the Bush rhetoric, the tax cut was all about helping poor single waitress moms, grannies who can't pay their heating bills, lower-middle-class families that are maxing out credit cards for their kids' medical bills, and small businesses owned by women.
On Monday, President Bush made like the host of a game show and displayed a big blown-up check made out to "U.S. Taxpayer" for $1,600, the average benefit that he says the average family with two children would receive. He introduced three average families that would get anywhere from $1,055 to $3,266 in savings from his plan.
On Tuesday Mr. Bush went to McLean, Va., to visit an adorable store, Tree Top Toys and Books, and make the pitch that his tax plan would create capital so that other adorable businesses like this one, and trail-blazing female entrepreneurs like its owner, could thrive.
Today the president planned to have a reunion with the "tax families," as the families used as props on airport tarmacs during his campaign were called. At the White House he will be welcoming Tammy, a waitress at the Pit Stop Emporium; Ken, a repairman at Bennett's Garage; Joseph, a manager at Aldi Foods; Denise, a stay-at-home mom; and Michael, a driver for U.P.S.
I seem to recall President Bush vowing to restore integrity and honesty to Washington. Then shouldn't his photo ops this week have been a whole lot different?
On Monday he could have gathered Jack Welch, Bill Gates and Kenneth Lay, the chairman of Enron Energy Corporation, one of W.'s biggest corporate contributors. 
The president could have brandished a blown-up check made out to "U.S. Fatcats" for $160,000 and come clean about who will make out like bandits, courtesy of his bill: not the blue-collar crowd but the golden-parachute crowd, that elite 1 percentile that will get 40 percent of the cut.
Dick Cheney, lately of Halliburton, and Paul O'Neill, lately of Alcoa, could have been on hand to share inside tips about tax shelters, trust funds and stock option packages to defer income.
All the moguls' progeny could have smiled for the camera, since, if the Bush tax cut passes, they won't have to pay any of those niggling inheritance taxes on their parents' estates.
On Tuesday, instead of going to a toy store the president would have headed to the nearest Lexus dealership to show the sort of toys the wealthiest Americans could buy with their humongous tax cuts.
Today, instead of a reunion of his tax families, he could have gathered the fur-clad and Gulfstream-riding Pioneers, the rich Republicans who pumped $90 million, the biggest fundraising haul in history, into W.'s campaign, hoping for a tax windfall.
Lastly, in the spirit of bipartisanship, W. could have ushered out to the cameras a new millionaire who could use a good tax cut now that he's raking in $100,000 a pop for his speeches: my ex.

HEADLINE: Cisco Results Come In Short Of Forecast 

BYLINE:  By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 6 

 BODY:
Raising fears of a deepening economic slowdown in the United States, the Silicon Valley bellwether Cisco Systems Inc. fell short of Wall Street's already lowered expectations today, reporting revenue of $6.75 billion for the second quarter of its 2001 fiscal year.
 Wall Street analysts had expected Cisco to earn 19 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, but the company reported earnings today of 18 cents a share. That was still a 50 percent increase over the 12 cents a share reported in the second quarter of 2000. 
 Cisco, which has had 44 consecutive quarters of revenue growth, shocked the financial analysts that follow the company by saying today that it expected revenue to decline in the next quarter by as much as 5 percent. 
"I've followed the company since it went public, and I've never seen a down sequential revenue quarter," said Paul Johnson, a financial analyst at Robertson Stephens. "That took me by surprise."
Cisco's revenue rose 55 percent, up from $4.36 billion in the quarter a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, including research and development costs and amortization of goodwill and other acquisition-related charges, net income rose to $1.33 billion, an increase of 48 percent from $897 million a year ago.
It was the first time in three and a half years that the company had failed to meet or exceed earnings expectations. But Cisco executives, who have repeatedly told Wall Street that the company plans to grow by 30 percent to 50 percent a year, took pains to point to slowing purchases by American telecommunications service providers and manufacturing companies as the reason for Cisco's pessimistic forecast.
"While we were pleased with certain areas of our business," said John Chambers, Cisco's chief executive and chairman, "this quarter was even more challenging than we anticipated in light of the abrupt economic slowdown in the United States."
Mr. Chambers said the company responded to the downturn, which it saw in the beginning of December, by slowing its hiring and discretionary spending.
International financial markets had been awaiting Cisco's results, looking to the Internet infrastructure maker and its forecast for the rest of 2001 as an indicator of the direction of the economy.
The company, which has been widely viewed as a barometer of the strength or weakness of the Internet economy, finished regular trading at $35.75, up $1.19, on the Nasdaq market. In after-hours trading, Cisco fell to $34.38.
"The numbers are worse than we had expected, that's clearly a cause for concern," said Michael Ching, a financial analyst at Merrill Lynch. "We are going to need to recalibrate for the April quarter on this lower base." 
Other analysts wondered whether Cisco was seeing competitive pressures that it was not completely acknowledging. "If their competitors nail their numbers this quarter, then it will be an indication that leadership in the market has shifted," Mr. Johnson of Robertson Stephens said.
During a conference call with financial analysts this afternoon, Mr. Chambers said that although the next several quarters would be challenging, he expected the downturn to be a short one. 
He said he thought it would be limited to one or two quarters pending the actions of the Federal Reserve Bank and the quick passage of a tax cuts in Washington.
"The uncertainty on capital spending," Mr. Chambers said, "is leading us to widen the range of our projections."
He repeatedly pointed to the slowing purchases of new equipment by what he referred to as the "alternative" telecommunications service providers -- those companies that compete with the major telecommunications companies. Cisco has also seen slowing in some portions of the corporate market, particularly in the manufacturing sector, which Mr. Chambers said was for practical purposes already in a recession.
Cisco said that it expected its growth would be flat or would decline 5 percent in its third quarter and that growth would be flat in the fourth quarter. But it still expected total revenue growth for the year to reach 40 percent. Cisco also said that it expected gross margins to decline to 60 percent from about 63 percent and that it would add 1,500 to 2,000 workers in the next quarter based on job offers that have already been made. The company employs more than 40,000 workers worldwide.
Despite concerns about the American market, Mr. Chambers said Cisco was having robust growth in almost all the other areas of the world. He said that he had visited or spoken with 75 percent of the chief executives of the world's largest 500 companies and that they generally had expressed confidence in their spending expectations.
He also noted that he was pleased with the progress Cisco has made in China, where it has revenue of about $1 billion a year.
"We got a very strong endorsement from the president of China, which is very unusual," Mr. Chambers said. China is one of the most stable economies in Asia, he said, and with a growth rate expected to be 5 percent to 8 percent, China could become Cisco's second-largest market in the next three to five years.
During the conference call this afternoon, Cisco executives suggested that trends in the marketplace were favorable to the company, which supplies corporations with the basic equipment for high-speed data traffic. In particular, the company said, corporate buyers were leaning toward large suppliers who could create so-called "end to end" equipment systems.
The company said that it was beginning to see growth in the market for Internet telephony, where routing gear is used to carry voice telephone conversations.
Executives of Cisco pointed to several examples of large purchases of such equipment: a New Zealand government agency that had purchased 8,000 of the new Internet telephone handsets and associated switching gear and the Dow Chemical Company, which has purchased 40,000 phones.
Mr. Chambers said Cisco was now selling 2,000 Internet voice phones a day.

HEADLINE: Bush Urges Airlines to Reach Labor Pacts 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6 

 BODY:
President Bush urged the nation's four largest airlines and their workers today to avoid strikes this spring and said he would "explore all options" if they were unable to settle their differences.
 "I am worried about strikes at airlines," Mr. 
Bush said. "It could have a harmful effect on our economy." 
 In the next few months, Delta is expected to reach agreement with its pilots, American with its flight attendants and United and Northwest with their mechanics. The airlines carry more than two-thirds of the 588 million domestic passengers traveling on United States airlines annually.
The prospect of disruptions in spring break travel and summer vacations has attracted the attention of the White House, which last week began conferring with the National Mediation Board, the government agency that oversees labor relations in the airline and railroad industries, The Washington Post reported today.
The first potential strike could come as early as next month if an agreement is not reached between Northwest Airlines and the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association.

HEADLINE: Pardoned Fugitive Said to Be in Talks on Russian Deal 

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Feb. 6 

 BODY:
In what appears to be the culmination of a long history of business dealings in Russia, Marc Rich, the billionaire fugitive pardoned by President Bill Clinton before he left office, may sell his global commodity trading empire to a Russian group. 
 Marc Rich & Company Investment, which has offices in England and Switzerland, is in talks with Crown Trade and Finance, owned by the Alfa Group of Russia, to sell all or part of the trading company, people close to the talks said. 
 It is not yet clear how likely it is that the talks, which began late last year, will lead to a sale. Mr. Rich held negotiations with other buyers last year that came to nothing, these people said. But people who have met recently with Mr. Rich, who is 66, say that there is some urgency to the talks because he appears to be in poor health and wants to retire. 
The rises and falls of Mr. Rich's business dealings in Russia trace the evolution both of the global commodities trading business he helped create, and of the market economy in Russia, where he was the dominant player in the early 1990's.
Mr. Rich fled the United States in 1983 when federal prosecutors accused him of tax fraud and other illegal dealings, and now lives in Switzerland. The government said he and his partners exploited government price controls in the wake of the 1973 oil shock through a complex series of transactions that allowed him to reap excess trading profits and illegally move them offshore to avoid taxation. 
He later used a similar approach even more profitably in Russia in the early 1990's as the Soviet Union was collapsing. In the turmoil of the times, traders like Mr. Rich were able to buy oil at prices that were sometimes less than 1 percent of the prevailing world price, and then export it. Though officials who helped him may have acted improperly, it is not clear whether Mr. Rich's dealings themselves ever broke Russian law. 
"Russia was a Klondike for Mr. Rich," said Vladimir Lopukhin, who served briefly as Minister of Fuel and Energy in 1991 and 1992. "It was a time of complete confusion. There were so many administrative controls, and there were just as many special privileges. He felt like a fish in water here."
Opportunities abounded. Joint ventures with foreign companies gave Russian refineries special tax breaks and the right to export in unlimited quantities and ignore export quotas. Mr. Rich had at least four such joint ventures. 
Early economic changes in Russia gave directors freedom to conclude contracts, but did not give them an ownership stake in the companies or much accountability for their assets. That created strong incentives to siphon off assets and profits that theoretically belonged to the state. Traders like Mr. Rich, who had access to foreign capital and markets, eased the process, which continued until Russia began to sell its oil and gas companies to private investors in 1995. 
"Can I say that what he was doing was illegal? No," Mr. Lopukhin said. "He was always walking the fault line between legal and breaking the law." 
Russia, just after the fall of the Soviet Union, was a trader's paradise, especially for people like Mr. Rich and his partners, who had the experience to profit from the chaotic atmosphere and the ever-shifting legal climate. Former employees of the Rich firm describe unlimited expense accounts, extravagant spending and lavish coddling of the directors of Russian client companies. Flying a client company's director to London with a credit card, or treating him to a new set of teeth, could seal a deal; personal relationships meant everything, and prices meant little. 
At its peak, Mr. Rich's company occupied two floors in Moscow's high-rise international trade center. But in 1994, Mr. Rich was bought out by his partners, who renamed the venture Glencore International, and now occupy that space. Mr. Rich later founded a new company and opened a new office in Moscow in 1996, though he was never able to return to the old scale of operations. He had lost most of his crucial employees, and appeared to have had little success in choosing new ones. This second trading company is the one he is negotiating to sell.
And Russia's economy had changed in the meantime. Russian company owners had learned how to secure international financing on their own and sell to foreign buyers through their own trading companies. Gradually, the exporting business became more transparent, and oil companies have even begun holding auctions to choose the trader with the best price, an unheard-of practice five years ago.
Traders like Mr. Rich have also lost ground globally because so many more market participants have access to instant information through the Internet, leaving fewer opportunities for middlemen to profit.

HEADLINE: Disney Posts First-Quarter Drop in Net 

BYLINE:  By GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

 BODY:
The Walt Disney Company said yesterday that net income fell in its fiscal first quarter but operating income rose as profits from hit films and theme parks more than offset soft advertising revenue at its ABC and cable television networks and weaker sales at Disney stores.
 Over all, Disney reported net income of $63 million or 3 cents a share, in the quarter, which ended Dec. 31. That is down from $356 million for the quarter a year earleir; revenue rose 7 percent, to $7.3 billion. 
 The drop in net income was primarily attributable to a $253 million loss related to its 72 percent interest in the Internet Group, compared with a $161 million loss for the prior quarter. The company also suffered from a $228 million noncash accounting charge related to film advertising and $50 million charge related to derivative accounting. After stripping out those one-time costs, operating income rose 6 percent, to $1.3 billion.
Some analysts use operating income before Internet expenses and one-time charges to evaluate the health of the operating businesses. Disney's earnings per share before those costs were roughly 28 cents, beating a number of analysts' expectations. Still, at least two analysts said that softness in the ad market was already factored into the stock.
Several analysts said that much would depend on how the economy affected advertising spending in subsequent quarters. Disney's chief financial officer, Thomas Staggs, said the company anticipated single-digit growth in earnings per share for 2001; beyond that, he said that earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization would grow 13 percent to 15 percent, starting in 2002.
Because the consensus among analysts has been that Disney will earn 99 cents a share this year -- 10 percent more than last year -- a single-digit rise would lead them to reduce earnings estimates, one analyst said yesterday.
Operating income at the media networks, which accounted for 45 percent of Disney's operating income, fell 8 percent, to $590 million, the company said. The decline was a result of a soft first-quarter advertising market, lower ratings and higher programming costs. 
Shares of Disney rose $1.18, to $31.61.
Disney had warned investors that it faced problems at its Disney stores and said in its earnings statement that income at the consumer products division fell 13 percent, to $177 million. The declines at the Disney stores stemmed from lower comparative-store sales and decreased margins as a result of product markdowns because of a weak holiday market. Profits at the parks and resorts division rose 6 percent, to $385 million, as attendance reached new highs at attractions like Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla.
The company noted that the division's profits were crimped by increased spending at Disney's California Adventure, which is scheduled to open Thursday. The new park, adjacent to Disneyland, is intended in part to lure visitors for longer visits to the California theme park.

HEADLINE: Wachovia Bank Weighs Sale Of Its CreditCard Business 

BYLINE:  By RIVA D. ATLAS 

 BODY:
The Wachovia Corporation said yesterday that it might join a growing list of banks getting out of the credit card business, rather than compete with companies spending heavily to woo fickle consumers with promotions.
 With about $8 billion in receivables, Wachovia ranks as the 12th-largest issuer of bank credit cards, according to The Nilson Report, a publication in Oxnard, Calif., that tracks the credit card industry. 
 Wachovia, which has headquarters in Atlanta and Winston-Salem, N.C., said yesterday that it had hired Credit Suisse First Boston to evaluate "strategic alternatives" for its credit card business, including keeping it, selling it or forming a joint venture. 
Stock analysts said yesterday that they expected Wachovia to sell the operation. Richard Bove, an analyst at Raymond James & Associates, estimated that a sale could bring $8.6 billion. Mr. Bove upgraded the bank's stock to a "buy" yesterday.
Wachovia's shares, which have rallied 14 percent this year in part because of the Federal Reserve's decision to lower interest rates, fell 55 cents a share yesterday, to $66.15, amid a poor performance for bank stocks over all.
Credit cards accounted for 15 percent of the bank company's net income of $832 million last year.
With the credit card industry growing more competitive, Wachovia faced the possibility of falling behind unless it was willing to spend heavily on acquisitions and marketing. 
"We've been able to achieve 10 to 12 percent growth in receivables, but what we were forecasting going forward was in the single digits," said Beverly Wells, manager of retail financial services at Wachovia. "The amount of money it is taking to acquire and retain customers is getting higher, and that was threatening to erode the profitability of the business."
A number of banks and other card issuers have been exiting the business. Last year, $18 billion in Visa and MasterCard receivables were sold, with Citigroup and the MBNA Corporation acquiring 80 percent of the amount, according to Nilson. 
Ms. Wells declined to say yesterday what Wachovia would do with the proceeds of any sale. But Ruchi Madan, a stock analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, said the banking company could buy back stock or bolster reserves against potential loan losses.
In a research report published last week, Ms. Madan ranked Wachovia's adjusted reserves toward the bottom of the 30 largest banks in the United States. If, as she predicts, the bank applies some $200 million in proceeds from the credit card sale to its reserves, "Wachovia would fall smack in the middle of the pack."
A higher level of reserves would help Wachovia deal with a portfolio that included loans to several troubled companies facing asbestos litigation. Wachovia has made loans to Federal-Mogul, W. R. Grace, Owens-Illinois, Armstrong World Industries and Owens Corning, according to research by Lori Appelbaum, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company.

HEADLINE: Machines Let Resorts Please Skiers When Nature Won't 

BYLINE:  By JEFFREY SELINGO 

 BODY:
IN the past, when dry weather lingered in the Northeast in mid-February, that would have meant the cancellation of many a ski trip. But later this month, even if there is no hint of snow in the forecast, thousands of skiers will make their way to mountain resorts, comforted by ski reports on the radio announcing that all the trails are open. 
 They have snow-making to thank. 
 Mild winters with little snow once meant financial disaster for the ski industry. But in the past 30 years, the widespread use of snow-making equipment has provided so much stability to a ski resort's season that even traditionalists in the Swiss Alps and British Columbia have decided to install it. 
While natural snow is preferable for most resort owners, Mother Nature doesn't provide enough of it in many parts of the world for resorts to open early in the season and survive to early spring. "It used to be that the ski industry was satisfied with the economic performance of natural snow," said Curt Bender, a professor of ski area operations at Colorado Mountain College in Leadville, Colo. "But staying open 70 days a season is no longer acceptable. Nowadays, skiing is more of a business, and resorts are required to have that guarantee that they'll perform." 
Fake snow has become so popular among some resort owners that they sometimes look at nature as getting in the way, especially when it keeps skiers from getting to the mountain. "There's no question that a few inches of snow in Boston is a huge shot in the arm for resorts in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont," said Skip King, a vice president at American Skiing Company, the largest operator of ski resorts in the country. "But it's less critical than it once was. People know we can make snow."
Still, making snow is not cheap. It is typically the second-largest cost, after labor, for resorts. New systems can cost upward of $40,000 per acre to install and $1,700 per hour to operate. 
The earliest snow-making machines used leftovers from household plumbing supplies and irrigation equipment. Although the technology has improved, the basic concept of snow-making has remained the same. Making artificial snow mimics what happens in nature, but the snow is produced much more quickly: In one method, water is pumped to a snow gun, where compressed air blows the stream of water into tiny particles that are then shot out into the air, where they crystallize and fall to the ground as snow. 
Walter R. Schoenknecht, owner of Mohawk Mountain in Cornwall, Conn., was one of the first to turn to technology to make an end run around nature in the winter of 1949-50. With no natural snow in early January, Mr. Schoenknecht trucked in blocks of ice, broke it up with an ice-crusher and spread the chips over one slope. "We spent about $3,500, used nearly 500 tons of ice, but the important thing was that there was good skiing, and that the skiers were happy," he wrote in The American Ski Annual and Skiing Journal a year later. 
Machine-made snow was first mass-produced by three engineers -- Art Hunt, Dave Richey and Wayne Pierce -- on March 14, 1950, in Milford, Conn. Using a garden hose, a 10-horsepower compressor and a spray-gun nozzle, they produced about 20 inches of snow. They later patented their invention. 
"The first attempts in snow-making were oddball solutions to a lack of snow," said Jeffrey R. Leich, executive director of the New England Ski Museum in Franconia, N.H. Despite those early efforts, the widespread installation of snow-making machines did not start until the 1970's, he added. 
"For the most part, there was enough snow," Mr. Leich said, "and it wasn't seen as a competitive advantage to have snow-making machines. Now, it's unthinkable that you operate without snow-making." 
But there are more than financial costs to snow-making. In some states, environmental advocates have complained about power consumption and the reduction of water levels in lakes and rivers. A few state environmental agencies have required ski resorts to build large holding ponds to furnish water during parts of the season when natural water levels are low. 
Making snow is not as simple as running water through a hose. A lot depends on the weather, and it is not the temperature on your outside thermometer -- known as the dry bulb temperature -- that is important. What snow-making operators look at is the wet-bulb temperature, which is adjusted for humidity. 
When the humidity is high, water may not freeze even at temperatures lower than 32 degrees. And when the air is extremely dry, water can freeze even at temperatures higher than 32 degrees. So low air temperatures and low humidity are the optimal conditions for making snow. But the weather can change from one place on the mountain to the next. Until recently, when computers became better able to monitor and adjust snow-making machines, changes in temperature and humidity caused extra-wet or extra-fluffy snow to stream from the machines. Such problems gave machine-made snow a bad name, said Mr. King.
Today, ski resort operators like to say that there is virtually no difference between artificial and real snow -- and that machine-made snow is better in some cases. But experienced skiers say they can still tell the difference. 
"What man cannot create," said Craig Bury, of Washington, who has been skiing for 41 years, "is the champagne of snow for the advanced or expert skier, and that is light, dry, big, fluffy flakes."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Just Add Air and Water"Machine-made snow is just like the real thing -- it just costs more. There are two types of snow-making machines, air guns that use compressed air to break a stream of water into droplets, and fan guns that rely on a high-powered fan for most of the air supply. Air guns require that water and air lines be run along ski slopes, and use large (and costly) compressors and pumps. Fan guns require only water lines, but the guns themselves are more costly -- about $50,000 for a top of the line model. Here's a look at how a fan gun works. THE WEATHERAir temperature and humidity are critical factors in snowmaking. Generally, the lower the temperature and the drier the air, the more snow can be made. A top-of-the-line fan gun can use up to 10,000 gallons of water an hour in optimal conditions. MANIFOLD AND REGULATORControls the water pressure and nozzle rings, opening more or fewer rings depending upon weather conditions. NOZZLESA ring of atomizer nozzles produces a mist of very fine water droplets, using air supplied by the small compressor at the base of the gun. Larger droplets from the other nozzle rings freeze onto these smaller droplets, forming snow. CONTROL PANELFor adjusting snow quality and amount and coverage area. The gun can also be controlled wirelessly from a central computer using software that constantly adjusts for changing weather conditions. COVERING A SLOPEBarrel can rotate completely and tilt upward. Generally the longer and higher the throw the better, as it allows more time for snowflakes to form. MAKING SNOWSnowflakes start with nuclei, a particle or extremely fine droplet on which other droplets can freeze. But flake formation is affected by humidity -- droplets won't freeze as fast, or may not freeze at all, in very humid air. Snow gun produces atomized water droplets. Other droplets freeze around these nuclei. Cold, dry air, and a long throw, make for bigger flakes. Drawings (Frank O'Connell/The New York Times)(Source: Lenko)

HEADLINE: TELEVISION REVIEW; 
Sharecroppers' Promised Land

BYLINE:  By JULIE SALAMON 

 BODY:
A jaunty newsreel from the 1940's describes a mechanical "robot" that could pick as much cotton in an hour as a family could pick in a day. The commentator suggests, enthusiastically, that perhaps sharecropper families could move to Chicago and work for International Harvester, the manufacturer whose invention had destroyed their livelihood. The farm family staring grimly at the camera does not seem to find the prospects ahead quite so cheerful.
 The newsreel appears in "Goin' to Chicago," a documentary tonight on PBS that tells the story of more than five million Southern blacks who headed North between 1940 and 1970. That was the second wave of migration. The first wave took place from 1915 to 1925 and was motivated by racial segregation, vote deprivation, terrible poverty and crop-destroying boll weevils. The catalyst for the second was the automatic cotton picker. It virtually nullified the sharecropper system that kept the descendants of slaves in a state of semislavery -- though it also deprived them of a living. 
 For many, relocation would prove fruitful and then frustrating. The industries that offered opportunity for a time would eventually move to where labor was cheap -- paradoxically, often to the South. The ensuing poverty and unemployment seemed a double blow, because African-Americans had looked to the North as a hopeful destination. Now grandchildren of those migrants speak wistfully of the place their families came from. "People get hurt around here too much," says a boy living in Chicago's Cabrini-Green housing project.
"Goin' to Chicago" moves briskly through this large and important piece of history, which for years had largely been ignored. There isn't time in an hour to explain fully the complex economic and social forces that stymied the transplanted Southerners and their children after a buoyant beginning. For that, Nicholas Lemann's 1991 book, "The Promised Land," is an excellent resource. (His book was the basis for a five-hour series produced by BBC and Discovery Productions that appeared on the Discovery Channel in 1995.) So "Goin' to Chicago" isn't the first time the story has been told, or the most complete version, but it's illuminating all the same.
The documentary touches on the big themes but focuses on individual stories -- many of them told by a group of elderly people who return to Greenville, Miss., from Chicago for a reunion. These stories remind us that this may be history, but it lives. The reunion segments, which have the informal feeling of a home movie, remind us that the migration also produced optimism and accomplishment. The promised land may not have ended up flowing with milk and honey, but many people did manage to find a good life (as did many who stayed behind).
The producers rely on standard techniques like interviews and archival film. That's just fine, because the witnesses have strong stories to tell, and so do the pictures. The old people know how to use language to conjure a memory. A woman who grew up in a place called Sunflower County, Miss., gives a succinct definition of sharecropping: "It means you work 20 years for yourself and 20 years for somebody else." Another woman weeps remembering how hungry she was as a child, half a century earlier. Triggering her tears are Proustian recollections -- not of sweet cakes but of skimpy meals of turnips and beans. 
People moved all over the North, but this documentary focuses on Chicago, which took on mythological meaning to those who moved there. "Chicago was the heaven that you fantasized about," says one man. The city offered jobs in its stockyards and manufacturing plants. It had a black newspaper, The Chicago Defender, and lots of music played by great black musicians. While Chicago's industries prospered, so did its black community, though one man admits that the good life may have been exaggerated. "It was the kind of exaggeration people needed to maintain hope," he says.
The city was less welcoming when black people started to integrate neighborhoods. The documentary recalls those ugly moments with film showing hostile whites staring at their new black neighbors unloading their belongings. Old women describe how frightened they were as young girls to discover that their families' upward mobility was an affront to angry white people.
"Goin' to Chicago" is also filled with music, another vital tributary in this particular stream of history. Eventually, the blues, reflecting one kind of misery, gave way to rap, reflecting another. But there's much more to the story than misery-like resilience, bravado, humor, and the documentary reflects that, too.

HEADLINE: New Increases in Worker Output 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
Despite the slowing economy, American workers increased their productivity at an annual rate of 2.4 percent in the last three months of 2000, a gain that was higher than expected, the government reported yesterday.
 At the same time, workers' hourly compensation, adjusted for inflation, rose at an annual rate of 3.8 percent, its fastest growth since the first quarter of 1998. 
 Growth in productivity, a measure of the hourly output of goods and services per worker, has been remarkable for its robustness through much of the expansion over the last decade. The rate in the fourth quarter actually eased, for the second consecutive quarter. Still, the Labor Department said the rate remained high enough to complete a year of 4.3 percent growth over all, the strongest since 1983 and evidence that the productivity gains are lasting. 
"We have a structural improvement in productivity," Bruce Steinberg, chief economist for Merrill Lynch, said, crediting technological advances for the gains. The rise 17 years before was less meaningful, he said, explaining, "It's not at all a comparable year; 1983 is a recovery year from a recession, when productivity is artificially pumped."
The annual productivity growth rate in 2000 peaked in the second quarter at 6.3 percent. The growth rate slowed to 3 percent in the third quarter before dropping off to a gain of 2.4 percent in the last quarter.
Still, economists had expected productivity growth of only about 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter. Many said they were surprised by the stronger figure, which came in part because of the unexpectedly rapid decline in the number of hours worked, said Kathleen Stephansen, director of economic research at Credit Suisse First Boston.
Companies put their employees to work for 1.1 percent fewer hours than in the third quarter, the second consecutive quarterly drop in the number of hours. For the full year, growth in the number of hours worked was the lowest since 1992, as companies reduced workers' hours before resorting to layoffs.
Output of goods and services outside the farm sector grew only 1.2 percent in the fourth quarter, the slowest since the second quarter of 1995.
Viewed in the context of high energy costs, falling consumer confidence and disappointing corporate earnings, the productivity growth numbers tell of a squeeze as employers continued to push for more output in fewer hours, economists said.
"There was bad news for businesses in the compensation costs," said John Youngdahl, at Goldman, Sachs. "Their cost structures were moving up very rapidly."
On the topic of consumer spending, the Federal Reserve reported yesterday that in December Americans slowed their pace of increased use of installment credit, defined as borrowing meant to be repaid in four or more installments. Consumers put $3 billion, or 2.4 percent, more on such credit that they did in December 1999. In November, consumer credit had grown $13.9 billion, 11.1 percent more than in November 1999.

HEADLINE: Want a Tax Cut? You Bet. Well, Maybe Not. 

BYLINE:  By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: GRIFFIN, Ga., Feb. 6 

 BODY:
Not a single customer brightened the doorway today during a half-hour conversation with Marion C. Godard in the clothing store he has owned since 1949 in Griffin's seen-better-days downtown.
 Admittedly, Mr. Godard, 76, explained, Tuesdays are often slow. And, yes, a lot of the traffic that once kept North Hill Street bustling has moved out to the strip malls along the highways, where Kmart and Wal-Mart now effortlessly undercut mom and pop stores. 
 But Mr. Godard also senses some nervousness among his customers, senses that they might just be waiting to see whether the economy really flattens before they splurge on a new gray fedora. His January sales were down 15 percent from the previous January. And that is why Mr. Godard, like many of the other proprietors in this small city 45 miles south of Atlanta, is eager to see President Bush push for a hefty tax cut that will put some cash back in their customers' pockets.
"I know exactly where they could spend it," Mr. Godard said, stroking his thin brown tie.
A dozen interviews here, conducted just before Mr. Bush was to send his package to Congress on Thursday, produced a broad consensus about tax cuts: everyone wants one. And any lingering concern about the $1.6 trillion, 10-year cost of the Bush plan, or about its equity, seemed to have been subsumed by Mr. Bush's argument -- echoed last week by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan -- that the slowing economy demanded stimulation. 
Many have already thought about how they would spend the money produced by Mr. Bush's plan to cut income tax rates across the board, double the per-child credit, repeal the tax on large estates and give a break to many two-income couples, among other provisions. 
Tim C. Cramer, a lawyer, would put some of his savings into an individual retirement account, some into a college fund and some into a new bag of golf clubs. Larry W. Lillard, a property tax appraiser for Spalding County, would pay off some of his mortgage. April S. Crawley, a 21-year-old mill worker, would buy new clothes for her two children.
"They take $50 or $100 out of my $500 paycheck," Ms. Crawley said. "It's just like taking my children's livelihood, but I make sure all my bills are paid first before I buy them new clothes." 
Neal Boortz, a conservative talk radio host on WSB-AM in Atlanta, spent nearly his entire four-and-a-half-hour show today fielding calls about Mr. Bush's tax cut. Many callers, Mr. Boortz said, were skeptical that the surplus really existed, and many were also skeptical that Mr. Bush and the Republican majority in Congress would have the fortitude to enact a meaningful reduction.
But there was no lack of desire for a tax cut, Mr. Boortz said.
"I can honestly tell you," he said, "I haven't had one strong phone call from a person who thinks that a tax cut is not needed." 
And yet, when pressed, some of those interviewed here, even those who voted for Mr. Bush and who said they would gladly accept a tax cut, also said it might ultimately be more important to spend the federal surplus on other priorities. They listed paying down the national debt, investing in schools, rebuilding the military, shoring up Social Security and expanding Medicare coverage to include prescription drugs. 
That ambivalence -- the desire to dedicate the estimated $5.6 trillion surplus to both a tax cut and to new spending -- helped make the 2000 presidential election one of the closest in history. And both before and after Election Day, public opinion polls reinforced the sense of North Hill Street, that Americans wanted a tax cut and thought it would help the economy even as they admitted that other priorities should perhaps have taken precedence. 
Polls by CBS News, for instance, found consistently over the last three years that tax cuts were viewed as less important than other priorities. The most recent poll, taken in December, found that 15 percent of those surveyed said they would prefer a tax cut when asked to choose among various ways to spend the surplus. Nearly half said the money should be spent on Social Security and Medicare, as former President Bill Clinton had proposed, while 17 percent favored deficit reduction and 18 percent chose other options.
It is an age-old struggle between personal benefit and community benefit, and many Americans seemingly perceive that the economy today is neither sick enough nor well enough for either imperative to prevail. 
Jimmy G. Jackson left his job with United Parcel Service last year to open the Neighbor's Grill just down the block from Godard's clothing store. Business has been good enough so far, Mr. Jackson said, but he would love a tax cut so he could invest some money in advertising.
"Don't they have like a $5 trillion surplus?" he asked, his brawny arms planted on a well-sheened bar. "I think it should be put back into people's pockets rather than sent off to other countries. I'm a firm believer that you sweep off your own porch first."
So what about America's own porch? What about the needs at home? It makes Mr. Jackson wonder. "Is he going to cut Social Security, Medicaid, school lunches?" he asked. "Where's the money going to come from? Maybe he needs to pay off our bills. I'd be stupid to say I don't want the money, because everybody could use a little extra money. But maybe if he paid off the debt it would be better for the country."
J. Edward Bagby, an interior designer, said he certainly could use a tax cut given that he was still paying the Internal Revenue Service for his tax liability in 1995, 1996 and 1997.
"It's horrible when you're self-employed," Mr. Bagby said, standing among the ornate frames and fabrics in his shop. "One year, right at 60 percent of my income went for taxes."
And after a decade when even middle-class homeowners could afford his $3,500 consulting fees, Mr. Bagby said that he, like Mr. Godard, sensed that the warnings of a slowdown were taking root in consumer psychology. That, too, would seem to make him receptive to a tax cut.
"I'm a little worried that confidence is going to go down, that we're hearing about recession and the economy going down and that people are going to start holding on to their money," Mr. Bagby said.
And yet, he said he worried that Mr. Bush was moving too fast, and that his tax cut would be too large and weighted too heavily toward high earners. "I think that $1.6 trillion is an outrageous figure," Mr. Bagby said. "And maybe he should target more to middle-class Americans. I really think at this point it may be the wrong priority."

HEADLINE: Insurers Push Rates Higher For Medigap 

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
The rising costs of prescription drugs are driving up the premiums of insurance plans that supplement traditional Medicare and include drug coverage. The high costs of these so-called Medigap policies are forcing many elderly and disabled people out of the programs even as Medicare managed care plans and employers are retreating from providing drug coverage. 
 While there are wide variations among states and even insurance companies, officials in New York, Illinois and Wisconsin report big increases. 
 Medigap plans cover more than just drugs, helping pay for hospital and doctor charges not covered by Medicare. But it is the drug component of some of these policies that is driving the increase in premiums. For most of the dwindling numbers with Medigap drug coverage, there is no other available option. Michael Metzler, 44, who lives with his parents in Sullivan County, N.Y., on a $1,600 monthly disability stipend, said the increase would absorb 14 percent of his income. "I have no way to make it up," he said. 
How to provide new forms of government help with rising drug costs was an issue in the presidential campaign and is expected to attract renewed attention in Congress. In New York, Empire HealthChoice, the largest Medigap drug insurer, said it would raise premiums 31 percent on March 1 on Medigap policies with drug coverage. In letters to policyholders, Empire said it had underestimated rising medical costs even after 10 percent premium increases in each of the last two years.
"We anticipate that the increases may reduce enrollment somewhat," said Deborah Bohren, a spokeswoman for Empire HealthChoice, formerly called Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield.
Deborah Chollet, a health insurance economist with Mathematica, a nonprofit research firm, added, "These drug plans will become more and more expensive and less and less available."
The new Empire rates will range from $222 a month, or $2,664 a year, in Albany to $275 a month, or $3,300 a year, in New York City for a plan that pays half of drug costs after the first $250, up to $1,250 a year. 
Ms. Bohren said Empire lost $18 million on Medigap drug policies last year as Medigap policyholders increasingly reached the $1,250 maximum.
Medigap coverage is offered in 10 standard varieties. Two of the Medigap plans cover drugs up to $1,250 a year and one, typically the most expensive, covers drugs up to $3,000. 
About 12 million Americans older than 65 have drug coverage through employer retiree plans, 4 million are covered by Medicaid programs for low-income people, 560,000 have Medigap policies and 12 million more have no drug insurance. In 1999, about 58,000 had Medigap drug coverage in New York; 42,000 had such coverage in New Jersey.
Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee and Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana are planning to reintroduce a bipartisan proposal to give private insurers more responsibility for Medicare with a requirement for drug coverage. President Bush indicated approval for the Frist-Breaux approach during the campaign. 
Revising Medigap is already being studied by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which helped draft the existing Medigap categories under a mandate from Congress. "One proposal on the table would make all Medigap plans include drugs," said Kathleen Sebelius, the Kansas insurance commissioner and president of the association. 
But Mark Bartorelli, chief actuary of the AARP Medigap unit of the United Healthcare Insurance Company, said "seniors need to have reasonable choices." AARP, formerly the American Association of Retired Persons, raised premiums for Medigap drug coverage 10 percent in New York on Jan. 1.
Ms. Bohren said requiring drug coverage would "put Medigap out of the reach of more seniors by raising the cost of the other plans." 
Empire cut the price of a popular Medigap option that does not include drugs by 2 percent. New York regulations limit the percentage of Medigap premiums that a company may retain after paying for health care costs. But Diane Archer, president of the Medicare Rights Center in New York, a national nonprofit advocacy group, said it was "increasingly clear that private health insurers cannot offer affordable prescription drug coverage even to middle-income older and disabled Americans."
"Congress needs to expand Medicare to cover prescription drugs and leverage the government's purchasing power to negotiate fair prices," she said. 
In Wisconsin, which has its own formula for Medigap, the GE Life and Annuity Assurance Company has raised the annual premium for comprehensive coverage, including prescription drugs, 24 percent, to $2,339. In that total, drug coverage rose 35 percent, to $922. All Medigap insurers in Wisconsin must pay 80 percent of catastrophic drug costs of more than $6,200.
Medigap drug coverage increased 16 percent late last year in Arizona and 14.2 percent in Ohio, according to a telephone survey by the Medicare Rights Center. 
In Illinois, Life Investors raised Medigap drug rates by 20 percent and Monumental Life increased drug rates by 26 percent, said Gerald Lucht, an actuary with the state insurance department. AARP rates for drug coverage rose 7 percent, but AARP increased charges 17 percent for a new category covering "the worst risks," he said.
Mr. Bartorelli said AARP was the only insurer that offered a Medigap drug plan in every state, covering about 200,000 people.
The AARP plans have managed to hold down the cost increases to 10 percent or less. Except in New York, which does not permit denial of Medigap coverage, insurers can turn away applicants who are thought likely to have high drug costs.
A recent Towers survey found that costs had increased 14 percent this year in Medigap programs provided to retirees by large employers. Towers negotiates for 40 big employers with 1.5 million retirees and spouses. 
Almost all companies are shifting more drug costs to employees. Payments for drugs by employees rose 14 percent, to $16, on average, for each brand-name drug and $7 for each generic drug last year, according to a survey by William M. Mercer, the benefits consultant. Employees of one in four companies, which required higher payments for drugs not on a preferred list, paid $28 for each drug. 
"Almost everybody over 65 is using medication to a large degree," said Bob Eicher, a principal at the Towers Perrin benefits consulting firm. "It is not unusual to have over $10,000 a year of medication expense for people who are taking eight or nine medications in a given month."

HEADLINE: Bristol-Myers Squibb Names Marketing Official as Chief Executive 

BYLINE:  By MELODY PETERSEN 

 BODY:
Peter R. Dolan first made his mark by getting consumers to buy more Jello at General Foods. Now, after 13 years at Bristol-Myers Squibb, the pharmaceutical company, he has been named chief executive, becoming the latest marketing executive to run a major drug company.
 At 45, Mr. Dolan also becomes one of the youngest chief executives of any of the large drug makers. 
 The board of Bristol-Myers voted to promote Mr. Dolan, who is now the company's president, on Tuesday night. He will take over for Charles A. Heimbold Jr., the company's current chief executive and chairman, on May 1.
"This is pretty terrific," Mr. Dolan said in an interview yesterday morning.
He said he was both honored and humbled to be picked to run Bristol-Myers, the nation's fourth-largest pharmaceutical company. Bristol-Myers, based in Manhattan, sold $9 billion in prescription drugs in the United States last year, just behind Pfizer, Glaxo-SmithKline and Merck, said IMS Health, a company that tracks prescription drug information.
Mr. Dolan joins Jean-Pierre Garnier at GlaxoSmithKline and Sidney Taurel at Eli Lilly in being made chief executive after working their way up the corporate ranks mostly through sales and marketing.
And last summer, Novartis promoted Thomas Ebeling, a former marketing executive at Pepsi-Cola, to be global head of pharmaceuticals.
Mr. Dolan said his consumer marketing experience was important because drug companies could no longer rely on selling their drugs only by having their sales representatives visit physicians. Instead, companies must also reach out to consumers through advertising, he said, and to the governments and the managed care companies that pay for most drugs.
Already, Mr. Dolan has shown that he can convert his marketing expertise into higher sales. As president of the Mead Johnson Nutritional Group of Bristol-Myers in 1995, he made Enfamil the top-selling infant formula in the country by advertising the product to mothers in addition to promoting it to pediatricians.
Mr. Dolan is taking over at Bristol-Myers as the drug industry faces increasing criticism over the rising cost of medicines.
Senior citizens are pressing Congress to have Medicare help pay for prescription drugs. And some states, which now pay for drugs for the poor through the Medicaid program, are calling for drug companies to reduce their prices.
Bristol-Myers and other companies are also being pressed to make significant reductions in the prices of drugs that are needed to fight AIDS in Africa and other areas of the world.
At the same time, several of the company's drugs face possible competition from lower-priced generics. Its diabetes drug, Glucophage, and an anti-anxiety drug, BuSpar, could soon face competition. And sales of its cancer drug, Taxol, are falling after Ivax, a company that produces generic drugs, began selling a lower-cost version of that drug last year. 
Bristol-Myers has been one of the most aggressive drug companies in filing lawsuits and using other legal maneuvers to try to add months or years to the dates that the patents on its medicines are set to expire. The Federal Trade Commission said last year that it was investigating whether Bristol-Myers broke any federal laws as it tried to keep Ivax from selling its generic version of Taxol.
Mr. Dolan said the company had to take whatever legal actions were available to it to extend its patent rights or it would face the wrath of shareholders.
"We feel we're doing the right thing," he said.
Analysts had expected Mr. Dolan to be named chief executive, and generally praised the choice. "He has experience, youth and energy on his side," said Neil B. Sweig, an analyst at Ryan, Beck & Company. "But there's no denying that Bristol has problems to solve. He'll have no honeymoon." 
Bristol-Myers hired Mr. Dolan in 1988 as vice president for marketing at its Bristol-Myers Products division, after General Foods was acquired by Philip Morris.
"I decided I wanted to work at a health care company," he said, "rather than a tobacco company."
Mr. Dolan served as president of the Bristol-Myers European pharmaceutical business in 1997, and became the president of the company last year.
Recently, he was the creative force behind the advertisements for Taxol that featured Lance Armstrong, the cyclist who won the Tour de France after a battle with cancer, company executives say.
Mr. Dolan said his mother had died of ovarian cancer and his sister had ovarian and colon cancer, which were now in remission.
"The company's mission of extending and enhancing life is very personal to me," he said.
An avid cyclist himself, Mr. Dolan and his wife have ridden in the two-day 192-mile Pan-Massachusetts Challenge, a fund-raiser for the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, for the last five years.
In his spare time, Mr. Dolan skis, dives and plays tennis with his wife and two sons, ages 12 and 14. The family lives in Larchmont, N.Y.

HEADLINE: Book Calling Holocaust a Shakedown Starts a German Storm 

BYLINE:  By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: BERLIN, Feb. 7 

 BODY:
The publication of a book here today by an American historian declaring that the Holocaust has become an "extortion racket" through which some Jews blackmail Germany has ignited a stormy debate.
 A television documentary on the author, Norman Finkelstein, that was to have been carried on Monday was canceled at the last moment, and newspapers have been full of virulent discussion over whether the book is a "breath of fresh air," as one has put it, or a dangerous invitation to anti-Semitism. 
 "Germany is right to reject the use of the Nazi Holocaust as a weapon for political and economic gain," Mr. Finkelstein said at a packed news conference. "The Holocaust has long since ceased to be a source of moral and historical enlightenment. It has become a straight-out extortion racket." 
The author, whose parents were Holocaust survivors, was presenting the German translation of his book, "The Holocaust Industry" (Verso), published last year in the United States to a generally hostile reception. It was also published in Britain. Its central argument is that what he calls an "American-Jewish elite" has appropriated the Holocaust and debased it for financial gain.
The book's publication here comes at a particularly sensitive time. Long negotiations that culminated last year with an agreement for the German government to pay $4.8 billion to people coerced into working for the Nazis revealed growing impatience here with such quests for compensation.
Germany has also suffered a wave of anti-Semitic and xenophobic attacks over the past year. 
In this context, Piper Verlag, the publishers of Mr. Finkelstein's book, came under pressure to refrain from publication.
Ignoring the pressure, and sensing a commercial success, Piper Verlag has published 50,000 copies -- a large initial printing. It has come to the accompaniment of bitter criticism from leading German historians, including Michael Brenner of Ludwig-Maximilian University in Munich, who has described the book as the work of a pathological anti-Zionist who sees "Israel's conspiratorial influence everywhere."
Mr. Finkelstein, protected by security guards, and looking tense, said he was "concerned about the enthusiastic reception of my book that may occur in right-wing circles." His message is certain to be seized upon by rightists and other Germans simply impatient with the reduction of German history to the 12 Nazi years.
But the author, who teaches at Hunter College, said his worries about how the German right would use his book were outweighed by his determination to put "the Holocaust industry out of business" and so end what he called the "exploitation of my parents' memory."
By "Holocaust industry," Mr. Finkelstein appeared to be referring essentially to the World Jewish Congress and the Jewish Claims Conference, whose roles have been prominent in securing the latest compensation from the German government. 
Gideon Taylor, the executive vice president of the claims conference, rejected Mr. Finkelstein's accusations as "reckless and unsubstantiated allegations."
While some leading American historians have welcomed Mr. Finkelstein's determination to open up the subject of how the Holocaust is remembered for debate, they have generally been fiercely critical of his conspiracy theories about American Jews and contested the accuracy of the book.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL; 
Rivera's Agent Is Fired, Setting Back Negotiations

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
The Mariano Rivera salary arbitration hearing, scheduled for today, was postponed yesterday amid a corporate confrontation that resulted in the dismissal of the pitcher's agent. Rivera, the Yankees' premier reliever, is the player most immediately affected by the dispute, but it is a far-ranging conflict that touches the owner of the Texas Rangers and other agents.
 The hearing, which was tentatively rescheduled for next week, was postponed several hours before the SFX Sports Group announced that Jim Bronner, Rivera's primary agent, and Bob Gilhooley, Bronner's partner, had been fired "for cause." 
 A company spokesman declined to say what the cause was, but a lawyer close to SFX said it stemmed from an attempt by the agents to restructure their deals with SFX because of the position of Tom Hicks, the Rangers' owner, with the entertainment company's parent company. Hicks is vice chairman and a director of Clear Channel Communications. Bronner and Gilhooley had been concerned about the possible conflict his position presented. 
Another lawyer said it was more an economic issue. SFX was willing to give its baseball agents additional money as a result of its purchase by Clear Channel, the lawyer said, but Bronner and Gilhooley wanted more. "They overplayed their hand," he said.
SFX, the first lawyer said, tired of the agents' efforts and fired them. Bronner and Gilhooley, the company acknowledged, filed a lawsuit against it in Chicago. Bronner and Gilhooley did not return telephone calls seeking comment.
Rivera will continue to be represented by Speakers of Sport, the Chicago area agency that Bronner and Gilhooley began 25 years ago, then sold to SFX a year ago. His designated agent is Fernando Cuza, who along with four other agents of the firm, SFX said, had agreed to remain with SFX and represent the Bronner-Gilhooley clients.
If the Yankees and their closer go to a hearing, at which Rivera would seek a $10.25 million salary against the Yankees' bid of $9 million, Cuza said he would participate in it. But Rivera's case would be argued by Randy Hendricks, who is the head of SFX's baseball business and has vast arbitration experience. SFX bought the agency operated by Hendricks and his brother, Alan, in 1999. 
Cuza said yesterday that he hoped to conclude a deal with the Yankees before the hearing, which would most likely be held next Wednesday or Thursday.
"I've been talking with the Yankees since yesterday," Cuza said in a telephone interview. "We'd like to work something out before the hearing. I like our chances."
Although there was at least the possibility that Randy Hendricks would become involved in negotiations because he and his brother have a good relationship with the Yankees, Cuza said he expected to continue in the negotiating role.
The Yankees had developed a testy relationship with Bronner. They were unable to conclude a multiyear deal for Rivera a year ago, and they have had difficulty again this time. The Yankees had offered Rivera $36 million for four years, while Bronner, at Rivera's direction, had proposed a four-year deal in the $43 million area.
Bronner said this week that the Yankees had said they would make another offer but had not done so. "It's hard to resolve anything if they're not willing to negotiate," Bronner said.
SFX did not say what the crux of the agents' lawsuit against it was. At the time Clear Channel purchased SFX Entertainment, less than a month after SFX bought Speakers of Sport, Bronner and Gilhooley expressed concern about the conflict that Hicks's position with Clear Channel represented -- a team owner with agents as his employees. 
Bronner and Gilhooley would very likely seek to show that SFX breached its contract with them by selling to Clear Channel and attempt to void a clause in their sale agreement that prohibits them from competing with SFX for a designated period, most likely five years.
In its news release, SFX said it would move to dismiss the lawsuit.
