HEADLINE: Immigration Advocates Split Over Arizona Boycott

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

 BODY:
PHOENIX -- The boycott of Arizona is on. No, the boycott of Arizona is off. Deciding whether to visit this state, which may or may not be boycotted, is as disorienting as peering into the depths of the Grand Canyon.
After Arizona's passage of controversial immigration legislation in April 2010, musicians canceled Arizona concerts, tourists canceled Arizona vacations and convention organizers bypassed Arizona in favor of less politically toxic states. But the very activists who put the boycott in place, hurting the state's pocketbook in the process, are now divided over whether it ought to continue.
Some called for the boycott's end last year, after a federal judge blocked the most contentious elements of the immigration law. Others have peeled off more recently, with the National Council of La Raza, a Latino advocacy group, announcing last week that it no longer backed the boycott. Still other activists have dug in their heels, insisting that Arizona ought to remain off limits for the foreseeable future. 
''There's been confusion surrounding every aspect of this issue from the start,'' said Kristen Jarnagin, the spokeswoman for the Arizona Hotel and Lodging Association, whose members were battered by the boycott and want it officially and completely kaput. ''We're glad some say it's over. To the others, we'd hope they'd be as quick to retract the boycott as they were to get in line at the start.''
Whether it is on or off, studies have pointed to significant drops in convention and hotel business in Arizona since the boycott was declared. Besides that, activists point with pride to the letter that Arizona business leaders, fearing more protests, wrote to state lawmakers this year urging that they back off from even tougher immigration measures they were considering.
But the mixed signals are creating confusion among those who are sympathetic to the cause.
The singer Steve Earle, who joined the boycott last year, scheduled a concert in Tucson in July, thinking the boycott had been lifted. After being criticized, he canceled but expressed frustration as he did so.
Mr. Earle said in a statement that he wanted ''to do more research about the boycott and its effects because as someone who supports the immigrants rights movement, I am not convinced that it is useful to continue to stay away from progressive fans in the state.''
Other artists have decided to perform in Arizona, boycott or no boycott.
Los Lobos, which initially backed the boycott and canceled its Arizona shows last year, went ahead with a concert in May in Tucson. To show its opposition to the Arizona law, the band allowed immigrant rights groups to raffle off a signed guitar and to distribute literature to concertgoers in the lobby. Four groups joined in, but not Coalicion de Derechos Humanos, an immigrant rights group in Tucson, which issued a statement saying the concert would ''diffuse the effect that boycotts and event cancellations have.''
One of the early public officials to back away from the boycott was Representative Raul M. Grijalva, a Democrat from Tucson, who found his constituents up in arms about the prospect of even more economic suffering.
''I am telling people to come back to Arizona,'' Mr. Grijalva said last week. ''My opinion is the new strategy ought to be to invite people to come but to urge them to help change the political climate.''
The Service Employees International Union, an influential boycott proponent, ended its support for economic sanctions against Arizona in December. But the Sound Strike, a Los Angeles group that urged entertainers to steer clear of the state after the passage of Senate Bill 1070, said last week that the boycott continued.
Juan Ramos, a pastor at Love International, a large bilingual church in central Phoenix, recently persuaded a national group of evangelicals to hold its convention in Arizona, arguing that the boycott, which he never supported, was hurting the immigrants it was supposed to help.
But Kat Rodriguez, program director for Coalicion de Derechos Humanos, continues to recommend that tourists stay away, musicians cancel for-profit concerts and conventions look elsewhere for meeting space.
''Our interest is not boycotting for the sake of boycotting,'' Ms. Rodriguez said. ''We want the state not to continue with business as usual. People think S. B. 1070 was last year's news, but immigrants in this state are still suffering.''
The law never fully went into effect. A federal judge blocked the provision that required police officers to check the immigration status of those they stop who are suspected of being in the country illegally. The State of Arizona has appealed the case to the United States Supreme Court. Gov. Jan Brewer, who gained both political traction and scorn by signing the law, has condemned the boycotters as misguided, saying on one occasion, ''They're hurting the people they pretend they want to help.''
As it is, some activists say the boycott is over, others say it is on, and many take an intermediate stance in which they call on visitors to make a difference if they come to the state.
''We're looking for real actions and not just people coming here to play golf at some convention or go to the Grand Canyon for the views or Sedona to stand in front of the vortexes,'' Ms. Rodriguez said.
Many of the municipalities and school districts that joined in the boycott last year have not changed their stances. ''We're just watching the situation,'' said John Stiles, spokesman for Mayor R. T. Rybak of Minneapolis, who last year ordered department heads to steer clear of Arizona.
Unsure whether the boycott was still in effect, the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, the largest organization of Latino evangelical churches in the country, reached out to Arizona pastors before deciding to hold its conference in Tucson this month. Those pastors were eager for moral support, said the Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, president of the group.
''What prompted us to hold our summit in Arizona is that we don't want people to forget Arizona,'' Mr. Rodriguez said. ''We don't want the immigration issue on the back burner. We want to remind people that this is a state that attempted to incorporate racial profiling into its law.''
Javier Gonzalez, the organizer of the Sound Strike, said that the group had been holding concerts in Arizona throughout the boycott but that they were events from which the bulk of the proceeds went to immigrant rights groups.
''We need to look at the next step,'' Mr. Gonzalez acknowledged. ''There is a difference of opinion that exists. Some artists want to never play in Arizona again. Others want to know when they can go back.''
Lady Gaga's decision to forgo the boycott, even though she denounced the immigration law from the stage during her July 2010 concert in Phoenix, drew criticism from some activists. A concert planned this month in Phoenix by Manu Chao, a French singer of Spanish heritage, is drawing praise because it is free and in support of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network.
One reason the boycott has lost its effectiveness, some immigration advocates say, is that the legislation aimed at making life difficult for illegal immigrants has spread from Arizona nationwide.
''With Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina passing similar or more onerous legislation, the point of telling people not to visit Arizona is moot now,'' Mr. Grijalva, the Tucson Democrat, said. ''And I'm not sure it makes sense to have a long list of boycotted states.''

HEADLINE: House Hunting in ... Mexico

BYLINE: By VIRGINIA C. McGUIRE

 BODY:
A FOUR-BEDROOM COMPOUND WITH THREE HOUSES AND A TILED POOL NEAR CUERNAVACA, MEXICO
$880,000 (11 MILLION MEXICAN PESOS)
This four-bedroom five-bath compound comprises three buildings surrounded by palms and birds of paradise. The property is in Jiutepec, near Cuernavaca in the Mexican state of Morelos. Hot-pink bougainvillea climbs the stone walls on the facade of the main house, which was built in 2004. The living room has a double-height ceiling, hand-fired clay floor tiles, and wood-framed windows. Off the living room is a full bathroom. The kitchen has slate countertops, a double sink and a gas stove. The kitchen island tiles are hand-painted with fruits and vegetables, and the upper cabinets are set with beveled glass.
The master bedroom is in a loft above the living room, reached by a wooden staircase. The suite includes a sitting area, a private balcony, and a bedroom with polished oak floors and windows overlooking the swimming pool. The bathroom has a window seat, a claw-foot tub, and a separate shower laid with hand-painted ceramic tile. 
On the other side of the pool is a one-bedroom guest house with a bathroom and sitting area. Over a stream on the property, a footbridge leads to a two-bedroom guest cottage with two bathrooms, a rooftop terrace and kitchenette. A fourth building functions as servants' quarters.
Just off the living room, the swimming pool has a decorative sun motif tiled onto its floor, and there is a round hot tub. The property has two built-in aviaries, which are included in the sale price. The stream is dammed to form a carp pond. The compound is on a small private street called a privada, with a 24-hour security guard at the entrance. It's a nine-minute drive to the historic Cuernavaca city center, with its daily indoor market featuring local produce, meat and poultry, and fresh flowers. A nearby Costco offers an American shopping experience, and the luxury shops in Vista Hermosa are 15 minutes away by car.
Cuernavaca and Jiutepec are about an hour south of Mexico City, depending on traffic. There is a new international airport in Cuernavaca, and the nearest beach is two and a half hours away in Acapulco.
MARKET OVERVIEW
''The market is pretty dead, but it's improving,'' said Barbara Waugh, a 35-year veteran of the real estate business in Morelos and the owner of Barbara Waugh Properties. According to Andrea Dolch Espinosa de los Monteros, Ms. Waugh's business partner, the economic downturn started later in Mexico than it did in the United States. Since the beginning of 2011, many sellers have begun accepting offers 25 percent below asking price. However, Cuernavaca's proximity to Mexico City insulates it somewhat from economic woes experienced by Mexican destinations like San Miguel de Allende, which depends heavily on foreign tourists, Ms. Waugh said.
Concern about Mexico's well-known crime problems has also affected residential sales. ''Our market has been damaged by the United States travel warnings,'' said Georgia Spencer, owner and broker of Cuernavaca Real Estate and the listing agent for this property. ''But Cuernavaca is absolutely safe.''
The system of private streets manned by their own security is one response to crime. A house on a privada can cost anywhere from $250,000 to $2 million, Ms. Waugh said. ''Asking prices may be $3 million, but the actual sales price would be more like $2 million.'' Prices are largely based on the value of the land, which costs about 1,300 pesos per square meter ($104 per square foot, at 12.5 pesos to the dollar), according to Ms. Waugh.
WHO BUYS IN CUERNAVACA
''Our clients are mostly Mexicans right now,'' Ms. Waugh said, ''but the international market is still very strong.'' Many of the buyers work in Mexico City and spend their weekends in the Cuernavaca area. There are still a healthy number of American and Canadian buyers, although fewer since the economic downturn. Ms. Waugh said interest had recently come from French, Russian and Italian buyers in search of a retirement destination. The number of buyers from Asia has also increased.
BUYING BASICS
In Mexico, ''foreign buyers can own properties directly, except near the border and on the coast,'' said Ms. Spencer of Cuernavaca Real Estate. But they do need a permit from the federal government, which costs about $500 and can be acquired within a few days.
Transaction costs run 6.5 to 7 percent of the appraised value of the property, not the purchase price, and are paid directly to the notary who handles the sale. According to Jose Raul Gonzalez Ramirez, a lawyer specializing in real estate, this figure includes a municipal tax of 2.5 percent, plus the cost of a government-mandated appraisal, a title search, and the registration of the deed.
The municipal government in Cuernavaca now requires a licensed appraiser to evaluate each property before it is sold, according to Mr. Gonzalez Ramirez. This makes it more difficult for buyers or sellers to report a lower price to avoid paying taxes, a longtime practice that has kept needed tax revenue out of city coffers. Jiutepec and other nearby municipalities are working on similar provisions. Another new regulation will require real estate transactions above 100,000 pesos (about $8,000) to be paid by check or electronic transfer, eliminating large cash transactions, which are harder to track, Mr. Gonzalez Ramirez said.
The real estate agent's commission is usually paid by the seller, he added.
Luxury properties in Mexico were often priced in American dollars until about two years ago, Ms. Spencer said, when this practice changed because of fluctuations in currency values. Now most properties are priced in pesos.

HEADLINE: Do Individual Acts Help Save the Planet?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Going Green but Getting Nowhere,'' by Gernot Wagner (Op-Ed, Sept. 8):
Bringing your own bag to the supermarket may not do much to reduce carbon emissions, but it's an easy act that keeps people involved in a movement that desperately needs support.
Mr. Wagner writes that the changes necessary to avert climate change are so large that they are ''beyond the reach of individual action.'' One individual's actions, like voting, protesting, boycotting or donating a small amount to charity, won't solve big problems. But an individual's consumption decisions can influence those of others, and collectively individuals can lay the groundwork for social movements that will enable major policy shifts and help adapt our energy-intensive lifestyles to a changing planet. 
More important, despite Mr. Wagner's cold-hearted economic analysis, reducing one's pollution footprint is simply the right thing to do.
ARI PESKOE Washington, Sept. 8, 2011
To the Editor:
Global warming is one problem with thousands of causes and thousands of solutions.
Activists once believed we had to ''get the ball rolling'' with personal actions before we could gain public support for the tougher political solutions. Industry and politicians read the mood correctly and hopped aboard the ''individual action'' train. It was the perfect public relations solution: an endless diversion from real transformative change. And there is always a ribbon to cut, a new scheme to announce or an award to hand out.
But most important, it would be business as usual with no changes to the bottom line for the fossil fuel industry.
Individual action is important, but it requires a regulatory framework to drive real change. Those of us outside the United States look to the sole remaining superpower to do something ''super'' that's in its own best interest and rest of the world's, too.
All Americans have to lose is dependence on foreign oil, trillions in health care costs and a lot of unnecessary climate-related suffering.
JOHN BENNETT Executive Director Sierra Club Canada Ottawa, Sept. 9, 2011
To the Editor:
Gernot Wagner makes a valid point: individual actions alone will not solve our environmental problems. But I disagree with two of his assertions.
First, he says that every ton of carbon dioxide causes around $20 in damages. This surprisingly low estimate is based on a single study by government agencies that ignored the most serious threats from climate change. In a reanalysis of that study for the E3 Network, a colleague and I found that including the most important climate risks could raise the damages to almost $900 per ton of carbon dioxide.
Second, Mr. Wagner writes: ''Markets are truly free only when everyone pays the full price for his or her actions. Anything else is socialism.'' It's true that markets are not efficient unless everyone pays full price for his or her own pollution. But there are many ways to be inefficient without being socialist, as our pollution-intensive economy demonstrates daily.
FRANK ACKERMAN Somerville, Mass., Sept. 8, 2011
The writer is a senior economist at the Stockholm Environment Institute-U.S. Center at Tufts University.
To the Editor:
Gernot Wagner scoffs at those of us who bring our own bags to the store and ''reduce, reuse and recycle,'' arguing that these efforts will make less than a dent in the growing threat of global climate change. True enough. He says the only real solution is broad-based legislation, such as cap and trade. Fine.
But Mr. Wagner also concedes that cap and trade ''has been declared dead in Washington.'' So what would he have us do while we wait for Congress to see the light through the haze of carbon emissions? After all, we still have to buy groceries. Is it so impossible to reuse bags and also petition Congress?

HEADLINE: Bradford Is Expecting To Play Vs. Giants

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
St. Louis Rams quarterback Sam Bradford, who sustained a bruised right index finger in the season opener, made all the throws during a short practice Wednesday and said he hoped to play Monday against the Giants.
Bradford said that although there was some soreness, the finger felt ''10 times better'' than it did Monday, the day after the Rams' opening 31-13 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. The original plan did not call for him to do any throwing before Thursday, and he had not been that optimistic.
Now he said he was hopeful that his right hand would be 100 percent by Monday night. 
A special glove designed to increase blood flow to the injury may have helped get Bradford back on the field quickly.
''Everyone says I look like Michael Jackson,'' he said. ''I'm not really sure what it does.''
The Rams have plenty of other concerns. Cornerback Ron Bartell was placed on injured reserve with two fractures in his neck, further thinning a position with little depth. Wide receiver Danny Amendola wore a brace on his dislocated left elbow and could be out several weeks.
PACKERS END HAS SURGERY Green Bay Packers defensive end Mike Neal will miss significant time after having surgery on his left knee this week, Coach Mike McCarthy said.
There is still hope for Neal to return this season; McCarthy said he did not think he would need to go on injured reserve.
TEXANS' FOSTER PRACTICES Houston Texans running back Arian Foster returned to practice after missing the opener because of a hamstring injury that has bothered him for a month.
If Foster, the 2010 N.F.L. rushing leader, is able to play Sunday at Miami, Coach Gary Kubiak said he would not expect there to be any limitations on his play.
DALTON MAY START The rookie quarterback Andy Dalton was limited in practice to making handoffs because of his bruised right forearm, but the Cincinnati Bengals say he could start Sunday at Denver.
Coach Marvin Lewis said he would see how Dalton's arm held up in practice this week before deciding on his starter.
Dalton was injured in the Bengals' victory over Cleveland. His wrist and forearm bothered him so much that he could not grip the ball well, and he was replaced in the second half by Bruce Gradkowski.
MANY BRONCOS INJURED The Denver Broncos are practicing without numerous key players. Cornerback Champ Bailey (hamstring) and receiver Brandon Lloyd (groin) missed practice Wednesday along with two other starters, running back Knowshon Moreno (hamstring) and defensive end Elvis Dumervil (shoulder). All were hurt Monday night against Oakland.
They may join linebacker D. J. Williams (elbow), tight end Marcus Thomas (pectoral), receiver Demaryius Thomas (foot) and defensive tackle Ty Warren (triceps) on the sideline Sunday against the Bengals.
DOLPHINS RE-SIGN ALLEN Without cornerback Will Allen, the Miami Dolphins' pass defense against New England was dismal, so they re-signed him. Eleven days after being cut, he rejoined the Dolphins, who gave up a franchise-worst 517 yards passing to Tom Brady on Monday.
Allen replaces nickel back Benny Sapp, who was released a day after Wes Welker burned him on a 99-yard touchdown pass.
BILLS' TICKET SLUMP The Buffalo Bills have their lowest season-ticket sales in 10 years, and contributing factors include six straight losing seasons, a poor economy and the lockout, the team's chief executive, Russ Brandon, said. Buffalo was 4-12 last year and missed the playoffs for an 11th straight season.
Brandon said the Bills had sold 37,555 season tickets leading up to their home opener against Oakland on Sunday. That is about 1,000 more than the Bills sold in 2001. It is also about 6,500 short of last season's total.
EDWARDS FILES SLANDER SUIT San Francisco 49ers receiver Braylon Edwards filed a $14 million slander lawsuit in Oakland County, Mich., claiming allegations that he was directly involved in a fight at a suburban Detroit restaurant cost him a big guaranteed contract from another team.

HEADLINE: Indexes Rise as a Consensus on Greece Eases Fears

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
A promise by European leaders to help Greece avoid default sent stocks sharply higher on Wednesday, the third consecutive day of gains.
The leaders of Greece, France and Germany agreed in a teleconference that Greece was an integral part of the 17 members of the European Union that use the euro. Greece also said it would stick to agreements to trim its debts, a condition for getting more financial help. The statements were intended to calm fears that Greece was headed for default or might be forced to drop the euro.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 140.88 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 11,246.73. It was another day of choppy trading in the stock market. The Dow sank as many as 112 points within the first hour of trading, then rose steadily before falling back near the end of the session. 
''The news out of Europe is beginning to sound a bit more friendly,'' said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital, a brokerage firm in New York. Investors remain far from convinced that Europe's debt crisis will be solved.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 15.81 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,188.68. The Nasdaq composite rose 40.40 points, or 1.6 percent, to 2,572.55.
European stock indexes rose sharply in the hours leading up to the meeting as investors hoped the talks would be productive. The German DAX gained 3.4 percent and the French CAC-40 1.9 percent.
The threat of a Greek default and the damage it could wreak on financial markets has had investors on edge in the last two weeks, lifting Treasuries and weighing on stocks. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note hit a record low on Monday of 1.87 percent and the S.& P. 500 has risen only three days this month.
On Wednesday, the Treasury's benchmark 10-year note was unchanged at 101 6/32 and the yield remained at 1.99 percent.
Uri Landesman, president of the New York hedge fund Platinum Partners, said worries over Greece had gone too far. Mr. Landesman said he thought European countries would not let a Greek default create a larger financial crisis. ''They're just not going to let them go under,'' he said. ''That's just not happening. I think people have learned the lesson from letting Lehman Brothers fail.''
Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, distanced herself from comments this week by her vice chancellor and others who suggested a Greek bankruptcy was possible. European finance ministers will meet on Friday in Poland.
In company news that affected share prices, ConAgra Foods said it would withdraw its $5.17 billion bid for Ralcorp Holdings if the company did not consider its bid by Monday evening. Ralcorp has already rejected several bids from ConAgra since March. Shares of Ralcorp dropped 7 percent to $79.11. ConAgra fell 2.5 percent to $23.45.
The computer maker Dell rose 3 percent, to $14.86. Dell said Tuesday it would add $5 billion to its existing $2.1 billion stock buyback plan. Dell bought $1.1 billion of its stock in the second quarter.
Staples rose 3.5 percent to $14.60 after the company said it would buy up to $1.5 billion of its own stock.
The gains came despite a report that retail sales were flat in August. People spent less on autos, clothing and furniture as fears mounted that the country was slipping into a recession.
That report helped push oil prices down $1.30, to $88.91 a barrel. Weak retail spending suggests Americans will consume less fuel. The price of gold fell $3.30, to $1,823.50.

HEADLINE: Franchisee Challenges A Restaurant Chain, To the Benefit of Both

BYLINE: By EILENE ZIMMERMAN

 BODY:
When Zane Tankel bought his first Applebee's franchise in 1995 he was, for the most part, winging it.
He had been a serial entrepreneur since the 1980s, starting and selling a small commercial printing company and then a share of a drug-testing business. After buying and selling real estate for a few years, he decided to try franchising. Although he feared the role might be constraining, Mr. Tankel had heard that Applebee's was an entrepreneurial restaurant chain, and he went to its headquarters in suburban Kansas City, Kan., to meet with its chief executive.
Sixteen years later, Mr. Tankel owns 34 Applebee's. He has repeatedly challenged the corporation to accept changes to its formula -- from its uniforms to its menus. His first restaurant on Staten Island took in $3.5 million the year it opened, 1995 -- a time when the average Applebee's was taking in $2.2 million.
Today, his Times Square location has the highest annual revenue, about $13.5 million, of any Applebee's in the world. His 34 locations average $4.25 million in revenue, double Applebee's nationwide average. (The numbers were confirmed by Applebee's.) The following is a condensed version of a recent conversation. 
Q. You have said you loved building companies. Why did you buy a franchise?
A. I saw an opportunity. I went to visit the company's headquarters in Kansas and felt there was the opportunity to bring entrepreneurship to franchising, marrying the best of both worlds.
Q.You bought the right to start a store whose concept was created by someone else, with a set of protocols already in place. Is that entrepreneurship?
A. Maybe this kind of thing isn't for the average franchisee but we pushed the envelope right from the start, took those protocols to the next level, and I think that's entrepreneurship. We changed the uniforms for instance, got rid of the baggy shirts and ties. If you're sitting at a bar, you want the woman behind it to look good, not buttoned up.
I remember when we started karaoke nights in Staten Island. We had a huge line outside, but the franchisor didn't permit karaoke and they said we had to stop. I told them, 'I'm paying you a fee to do business, so unless you want to pay us for the customers we are going to lose, it's not appropriate for you to ask us to stop.' They cited us for going against franchise policy. I was known as a troublemaker.
Q.Why did you decide to keep buying locations?
A. Nothing succeeds like success -- it's intoxicating. And it's still gratifying for me. It's gratifying now to see us go into underserved neighborhoods in and around New York City and see people on the periphery get a job, get skills and grow. We've opened restaurants in low-income neighborhoods like Bedford-Stuyvesant, Jamaica and the South Bronx, and we are usually the only sit-down restaurant in the neighborhood, one of the few places where customers are all treated with respect.
Q.What have you learned about doing business in those neighborhoods?
A. When we open a restaurant and are interviewing, we will have guys show up with their pants hanging below their crotch, their hat on sideways, answering our questions antagonistically. Our recruiters will say to them, 'If you're here for a job, go home and get dressed like you're applying for a job and then come back.' Many will go home, change and come back.
Q.Do you hire differently than other Applebee's?
A. In the New York market it's hard to find people with good attitudes, so we try and hire by personality. We can teach you to cook, to make a drink, to be a server, but we can't teach you how to be nice.
Q.How do you screen for nice people?
A. You see it in a person's demeanor and mannerisms; it's in their smile. Is it sincere? It's the way you shake my hand, look me in the eye, the way you say hello.
Q.You opened your first Applebee's in Staten Island, a location Applebee's insisted did not fit its model. What didn't they like?
A. It was in a mall that had just completed a big addition, and the restaurant was to be at the rear entrance to the mall. Applebee's wanted it to be at the front of the mall, so people would see it as they entered.
Q.Why did you open there anyway?
A. We felt comfortable being in the rear because there was a big parking lot and an entrance to the mall there too. Today both entrances are used equally. I felt and I still feel that we know the New York marketplace better than they know it from Kansas.
Q.What else did you do that went against the model?
A. We built the first multistory store in Times Square, we stay open on Christmas and Thanksgiving and in the last year, we started serving breakfast at six of our 34 restaurants, which no other Applebee's in the world serves. We are the only Applebee's franchisee that takes every kitchen and general manager on a cruise each year. We also give managers who have been in the same job for 18 months a new car. There's a tremendous amount of loyalty that comes with that.
Q.How did you convince corporate Applebee's to let you make these changes?
A. It was the threat we would just do it ourselves. When we opened in Manhattan, there were a lot of things corporate didn't like and we kept ignoring them. Finally I said, ''We're down to the last nail. We can call this Applebee's or we can call this Zane's.'' They resentfully permitted it, and it's now the largest Applebee's in the world. It does $13 million a year. It's difficult for them to tell us what to do when we are showing them the way, if you will.
Q.What would happen if all Applebee's franchisees started going their own way?
A. It would be chaos.
Q.Why didn't you just start your own chain?
A. We did -- Zanaro's Italian. We closed it in 2008, at the start of the recession. We had three of them in Westchester, New York, and for a while they did very well, then we closed them because of the economy and to focus on Applebee's.
Q.What does Applebee's have that Zanaro's didn't?
A. Price point. In the economic environment of the last few years, everyone is looking for price value. There's no discretionary income hanging around anymore.
Q.How have your Applebee's performed compared to other Applebee's?
A. We lead in food and liquor sales and our operating costs are among the lowest of all Applebee's in the nation.
Q.How can operating costs be lower in New York City than in Kansas?
A. Because Applebee's has a co-op where we buy our big foods -- chicken, beef, dry goods -- and the pricing is the same for us as it is for all other Applebee's. We make up for higher wages with increased efficiency, and on the rent side, we make up for that with traffic in our restaurants.
Q.What's your relationship with corporate like today?
A. It's quite good, actually. The last two years in a row we were selected as their franchisee of the year.
Q.Do you think they ever wanted to be rid of you?
A. Yes, but I also think they couldn't figure out who would have handled New York for them. So I'm a necessary evil.

HEADLINE: Tackling Reams of Bank Data Can Take Diligence, and Trust

BYLINE: By JESSE EISINGER. 
Jesse Eisinger is a reporter for ProPublica, an independent, nonprofit newsroom that produces investigative journalism in the public interest. Email: jesse@propublica. org. Twitter: @eisingerj.

 BODY:
Some people stay sharp in their old age by doing crossword puzzles. Some play memory games or Scrabble or cut back on the heavy drinking.
That's minor league stuff. If you really want to give your brain a workout to stave off the ravages of mental decline, I recommend trying to read bank financial statements.
In my last column, I wrote about how many bad residential mortgage loans the big banks had on their balance sheets, using numbers from a site called Bankregdata.com, which does the punishing work of wading through regulatory filings known as call reports and aggregating the data.
Take Wells Fargo. About $41.3 billion, or 19.5 percent, of its $212 billion worth of residential first-mortgage customers were either late in paying or had been classified as ''nonperforming,'' according to the site. 
This was in line with calculations by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which estimates that about a fifth of residential loans on bank balance sheets nationwide are delinquent or in the process of being written off.
Turn to Wells Fargo's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a full picture, according to Wells. It's a happier, alternate universe in which $15.6 billion, or 7 percent of $223 billion, of first-mortgage loans are tagged late or ''nonaccrual,'' a charmingly opaque euphemism for bust.
Two helpful representatives from Wells Fargo gave me a raft of reasons to disregard the call reports and trust the S.E.C. filings. Their main argument is that the federal figure includes a bucket of loans Wells wrote down when it bought Wachovia in 2008.
When Wells Fargo bought Wachovia, it set aside a huge reserve for those loans - mostly pick-a-pay deals, where the borrower could choose to make a minimum payment, with the downside that the rest of the monthly amount owed was tacked onto the outstanding balance. The loans aren't performing well, but they are doing better than Wells expected back then, which makes investors even more confident that the bank will eventually kick some of that reserve back to the bottom line.
In addition, the representative pointed out, the call figure was an analysis that added up different figures from several bank divisions. But Wells has some divisions that don't file call reports yet make a modest number of mortgage loans. (All big banks are holding companies with multiple subsidiaries.)
(Disclosure: the pick-a-pay loans were made by Golden West Financial, which was sold to Wachovia in 2006 by Herb and Marion Sandler, the principal financial backers of ProPublica.)
To be fair, banks do file mountain ranges of disclosure documents. They report to the S.E.C. (which protects investors), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (which insures depositors), the O.C.C. (which regulates banks) and the Federal Reserve (which also regulates banks with slightly different responsibilities).
Day after day, they push out news releases that run dozens of pages. They prepare reams of special presentations for investors, the most recent of which from Wells ran 51 pages, on top of a 41-page news release. The S.E.C. filing from the quarter was 162 pages.
The numbers and presentation differ slightly in all of them and often differ from other banks' presentations, stirring a struggle among outsiders to compare apples and bananas. No professional admits this publicly, but many investors and analysts privately acknowledge that they can't fully track the data gushing each quarter from the nation's banks.
Even if they could somehow reconcile all the numbers, analysts would still be significantly in the dark. In many instances, banks' financial disclosures are drawn from estimates that only management teams are privy to. Even the simplest of concepts - how much capital a bank has - is a number based on countless calculations that, let's face it, are not much better than guesswork.
So it is all the more important that we trust bank management and regulators to make sure the numbers we see truly reflect their financial condition.
Wells is one of the four biggest banks in America. After the financial crisis, it vaulted into this top echelon of gigantic institutions, along with JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup. In this group, Wells has the greatest exposure to residential real estate, more recently infamous as the single-worst asset class in America.
For many reasons, some not particularly rational, Wells seems to be scrutinized less by investors and the media. One is that Warren E. Buffett holds a large stake in the bank, the financial equivalent of a Good Housekeeping seal of approval. It is based in San Francisco, far from the madding crowd of American finance and media.
Wells, for its part, has historically displayed disdain for investors and Wall Street, in some regards an appealing attribute. While some of its competitors have tried to wheedle their way into analysts' hearts, the San Francisco bank refused to engage on even the most basic level. Not until last year did its management deign to take questions on conference calls after earnings reports.
A Wells Fargo representative told me that the bank's disclosure was ''best in class'' and listed the enormous amount that it provides.
The bank still falls short of other big banks in disclosure, according to investors and analysts I've spoken with. It doesn't break out the reserves it has made by asset class, unlike Bank of America, making it particularly difficult to understand how much it is reserving for bad residential real estate loans. It doesn't separate its business lines in the detail that the other banks do.
Then there are its nonperforming loans. For its residential mortgages, it doesn't classify them as nonaccrual until they are 120 days past due, instead of the more typical 90 days. The effect is to make the numbers look better.
The crucial figure, over time, is the loss rate, the bank representative said. And since the Wells portfolio - not counting the bad Wachovia loans - has been performing consistently well for many years now, investors should believe that the bank is doing something right, and better than its competitors with its mortgage portfolio.
Yet housing prices continue to fall, the economy is weaker than expected, and we are flirting with another financial crisis, as Europe gets its revenge on us for having exported our calamity to their continent in 2008. Wells isn't likely to remain immune to that. ''Trust but verify,'' Ronald Reagan used to say of the Soviet Union. Not a bad idea.

HEADLINE: NASA Unveils Giant Rocket That Might Someday Go to Asteroids and Mars

BYLINE: By KENNETH CHANG; Dennis Overbye contributed reporting.

 BODY:
To push farther out into the solar system -- to the moon and beyond, to asteroids, eventually to Mars -- NASA unveiled plans on Wednesday for a behemoth rocket that would serve as the backbone of its human spaceflight program for decades.
The finished rocket would be the most powerful ever to rise from the gravitational bonds of Earth.
''We're investing in technologies to live and work in space, and it sets the stage for visiting asteroids and Mars,'' the NASA administrator, Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., said at a news conference in Washington.
The megarocket, blandly named the Space Launch System, embodies the space agency's enduring desire to aim far and dream big. But it also reflects a shrinking of near-term ambitions as budget cutters seek to rein in federal spending. Just two years ago, NASA had hoped to build an even larger rocket that would take astronauts back to the moon and set up an outpost there. With money more limited, the pace of progress will be much slower than during NASA's Apollo heyday in the 1960s. 
William H. Gerstenmaier, the agency's associate administrator for human exploration, said NASA expected to devote $3 billion a year to the effort, or a total of about $18 billion over the next six years.
That would be enough to finish a rocket capable of lifting 70 metric tons into orbit; the largest unmanned rockets currently available can lift about one-third that much. The first unmanned test flight is scheduled for 2017.
The design would evolve to larger versions that could lift up to 130 metric tons. (The Saturn V rocket that powered the Apollo Moon exploration program could lift 120 metric tons.)
In contrast to the previous program, Constellation, which set a very specific goal -- returning to the moon by 2020 -- NASA has yet to decide destinations or deadlines for what it would do with its new rocket.
''We've talked conceptually about multiple destinations,'' Mr. Gerstenmaier said. ''We talk about an asteroid in 2025. We talk about Mars being the ultimate destination.''
More details would be worked out over the next year. ''We can do pretty exciting missions with the capability that we've got,'' Mr. Gerstenmaier said.
Congressional backers of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration hailed the announcement as resolving a standoff between Congress and the White House over the agency's future. In February 2010, the Obama administration had proposed a radical shift in space exploration, canceling the Constellation program and deferring any decision on a replacement for five years.
But the administration retreated under Congressional pressure, first reviving the crew capsule from the Constellation program and now proposing a heavy-lift rocket that looks like Constellation's slimmer sibling.
''This is a day we've been looking forward to for a long time,'' said Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Texas Republican. ''We wish it had been sooner, of course.''
Last year, Congress passed, and President Obama signed into law, a blueprint for the space agency calling for a rocket like the one announced Wednesday. But NASA missed deadlines for announcing how it would carry out the plan.
In frustration, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, where Senator Hutchison serves as ranking member, even issued a subpoena to NASA demanding information.
The unveiling of the heavy-lift rocket was a victory for Ms. Hutchison and Senator Bill Nelson, the Florida Democrat who is chairman of the commerce committee's science and space subcommittee.
Texas is home to NASA's Mission Control and Florida is where NASA's rockets are launched from. The two senators played key roles in writing the NASA blueprint and outlining many specifics of the rocket they wanted NASA to build, leading critics to sarcastically call it the Senate Launch System.
The announcement took place on Capitol Hill, not NASA headquarters, and at the news conference it was Senator Nelson who spoke first for five minutes, describing the characteristics and capabilities the rocket.
For his part, General Bolden said, ''I'm the administrator and not the expert at NASA'' and deferred technical questions to a subsequent telephone news conference that Mr. Gerstenmaier held.
Critics note that NASA has announced ambitious rocket plans before, only to cancel them as costs escalated and schedules slipped.
''Yes, there will be budget cuts,'' said James Muncy, a space policy consultant. ''Yes, it will be stretched out. Yes, it will have problems. And yes, it will fall apart.''
The Constellation program, unveiled in 2005, spent more than $10 billion and flew one prototype rocket before it was canceled.
John Grunsfeld, the former astronaut who flew on several space shuttle missions to repair the Hubble Space Telescope and is now deputy director of the Space Telescope Science Institute, said: ''The only good thing about the initiative is that NASA is moving on something, and that the jobs are preserved. It also means we'll have this discussion again in two years.''
To speed development and control costs, the design is based on pieces from the just-retired shuttles and the canceled Constellation program. The first stage is an elongated shuttle fuel tank, and it would use the same rocket engines as the shuttles. For the initial test flights, two solid rocket boosters -- stretched versions of what flew on the shuttles -- would provide additional thrust.
NASA also announced plans for a competition to design more powerful boosters, each providing 3.9 million to 5 million pounds of thrust, for the more powerful version of the rocket.
The schedule beyond the first test flight depends on future budgets. The first rocket that is to fly in 2017 will consist of a single stage. Internal NASA documents suggest that if the space agency's budget remains flat, providing about $41 billion from 2012 through 2025, NASA will not be able to do much work on the second stage, needed to increase the lift capability, until after 2017, and the first manned flight would not occur until 2021.
Subsequent flights would occur only once every year or two, and the final version, capable of lifting 130 metric tons, would not be completed for two decades.
With more money, perhaps as much as $62 billion over the next 14 years, the agency estimated that the first manned flight could be moved up by three years and the 130-metric-ton rocket could be available by 2021. It could fly up to two missions a year and still have enough to start developing the necessary pieces for a mission to an asteroid, like a deep-space habitat -- essentially a living room for astronauts during long space trips.
Senator Hutchison said there was now broad support from the administration and both parties in Congress on the space exploration plan.
She said even among the ardent budget cutters in her party, ''they have not cut the core mission of NASA, because they see that as part of the American spirit and most certainly part of the American economy and America's national security where we cannot afford to be in second place.''

HOSTILE TAKEOVER The reinsurer Validus Holdings said on Wednesday that it would seek to replace the board of Transatlantic Holdings.
Transatlantic's shareholders are scheduled to vote next week on a proposed all-stock merger with Allied World Assurance. ''Validus believes the Transatlantic board has repeatedly failed to take the necessary steps to secure greater value for Transatlantic stockholders,'' Edward J. Noonan, above, chief executive of Validus, said in a statement. MICHAEL J. de la MERCED 
BUDGET PUSH Financial regulators clamoring for bigger budgets notched a rare victory on Wednesday, as a Senate subcommittee approved a measure to increase their budgets.
The bill, offered by the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on financial services, would raise spending by about 19 percent at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. BEN PROTESS
BEYOND MADOFF When an audit of a unit of the United States Marshals Service was released on Tuesday, the headlines focused on the auditors' conclusion that the unit's files and office procedures were such a mess that a federal prosecutor balked at letting it handle the sale of two financial assets seized from Bernard L. Madoff, left, the confessed Ponzi schemer.
But a second look at the lengthy report shows that Mr. Madoff was not the only notable defrauder whose assets were badly documented in the unit's records. DIANA B. HENRIQUES
DEADBEAT BANKS While it has been nearly three years since Washington bailed out the banks, the financial industry is still clinging to $19 billion in taxpayer money.
Nearly 500 banks, from beleaguered regional powerhouses to obscure community banks, owe roughly 8 percent of the $245 billion doled out at the peak of the financial crisis, according to Treasury Department data. BEN PROTESS

HEADLINE: It's a Long, Long Road to Election Day: Making the Grade? Perry Says He Didn't

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.

 BODY:
LYNCHBURG, Va. -- As a child, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas was dead set on being a veterinarian. ''That was my heart's content. It's what I always wanted to do,'' he said.
Then came a day of reckoning, during the second semester of his sophomore year at Texas A&M University, when he went to see the dean of the veterinary school. His advice: switch to an easier major.
''He said, 'Son, I'm looking at your transcript,''' Mr. Perry said. '''You want to be an animal science major.'''
Mr. Perry told the anecdote here Wednesday morning to students at Liberty University in a speech that seemed to go to great lengths to explain and rationalize his poor academic performance in college, something that has already been an issue in the race for the G.O.P. presidential nomination. 
Liberty University, established 40 years ago by the late Rev. Jerry Falwell -- the founder of the Moral Majority -- has become a whistle-stop for many aspiring G.O.P. contenders. In his 20-minute address, Mr. Perry almost totally avoided discussing politics and policy, a breather, perhaps, after he was attacked by Republican rivals in a debate Monday on everything from immigration policy to social security.
Instead, the governor delivered a much more personal speech about his Christian faith and his view that ''God uses broken people to reach a broken world.''
But first, he tackled those bad grades. He described how being a member of the Texas A&M Corps of Cadets was like attending a military academy, and how he had to keep his shoes perfectly shined and avoid scratches on his belt buckle, otherwise upperclassmen would tell him to ''drop down and give them 72'' push-ups, a number chosen because Mr. Perry was a member of the class of 1972. ''They made sure we understood at Texas A&M that being a freshman in the Corps of Cadets was not going to be one big fraternity party,'' he said. ''They wore us out so much that not a single member of my freshman class managed to stay awake in class for the first few weeks.'' That, he added to ripples of laughter from the audience, was ''kind of the start of why my grades were what they were.''
At least at the start of college, Mr. Perry did not make any F's, turning in mostly C's along with a smattering of B's and one A as well as one D, which he received for a class in plane trigonometry during the spring semester of 1969, according to a copy of his transcript obtained by The Huffington Post.
The grades did not improve as his college career went on, as Mr. Perry pushed ahead with some of the more difficult science courses including organic chemistry, in which he made a D one semester and an F in another.
His other D's included courses in the principles of economics, Shakespeare, ''Feeds & Feeding,'' veterinary anatomy, and what appears to be a course called ''Meats,'' though the quality of the copy of the transcript makes it hard to tell for certain.
''Four semesters of organic chemistry made a pilot out of me,'' he joked, suggesting his experience in what is traditionally a weeding-out class for doctors and other medical professionals focused his immediate career aspirations toward the military. Mr. Perry was a pilot in the United States Air Force in his 20s. His transcript shows two semesters of organic chemistry and two organic chemistry lab courses.
On the other hand, he also scored B's in introductory literature, government, soil science, algebra, business law, and a course on the marketing of livestock.
It was difficult, he said, ''preparing for that life in the military while trying to keep a focus on a variety of subjects that would prepare me for a life after the military.''
''Quite frankly, I struggled with it. I fully admit that.''
He added that at high school in the town of Paint Creek, Tex., ''I graduated in the top 10 of my graduating class -- of 13.'' The crowd laughed and applauded.
Drawing on his youth in a small farming town, he described Texas A&M, in College Station, Tex., as an experience that ''broadened that perspective for me, as much as an all-male military institution could do in the late 60s and early 70s.''
He said his time in the Air Force also taught him ''about a world incredibly more diverse and complex than Paint Creek or College Station.''
Later, he said, he turned to God at age 27, when he was an Air Force officer, a journey ''that is not the story of someone who turned to God because I wanted to.''
''It was because I had nowhere else to turn,'' Mr. Perry said. ''I was lost spiritually and emotionally, and I didn't know how to fix it.''
After quoting some scripture, the governor shifted briefly to politics, exhorting the Liberty students to ''tell the people in power that you will not have your inheritance spent or your future mortgaged.''
He added: ''Don't leave it to a bunch of Washington politicians to tell you how to live your life.''
Before the speech, Mr. Perry got some support from the chancellor and president of Liberty, Jerry Falwell Jr., who has run the school since the death of his father in 2007.
In comments to reporters, Mr. Falwell emphasized that the university could not endorse a candidate. But he made it clear that he felt an affinity with the Texas governor, while saying that two of Mr. Perry's rivals for the G.O.P. nomination -- Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former Utah governor, and Representative Ron Paul of Texas -- were ''unelectable.''
However, any of the Republican contenders ''would be much better'' than President Obama, he added.
Mr. Falwell also defended Mr. Perry against criticism from rivals during Monday's debate, when the governor admitted he had made a mistake with an executive order requiring sixth-grade girls in Texas to be vaccinated against the human papillomavirus.
''I don't think you'll find a candidate in the world who hasn't made a mistake,'' Mr. Falwell said. Echoing a Bible verse, he suggested that critics ought to remove the speck from their ''own eye before judging someone for the splinter'' in theirs.
In his introduction, Mr. Falwell also called Mr. Perry ''one of the most pro-life governors in American history'' and spoke approvingly of policies he has backed in Texas.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Sees Bellwether in Two Democratic Defeats

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Republican Party on Wednesday seized on the outcome of two special Congressional elections as fresh evidence that voters are souring on President Obama and are prepared to hold Democrats accountable for the rising level of voter dissatisfaction over the direction of the country.
A Republican triumph in a Congressional seat in New York that had been held by Democrats for nearly a century, along with a victory in a Nevada district, set the stage for an uphill battle facing Democrats in their quest to win control of the House. The results, while not necessarily predictive of next year's elections, dealt at least a morale setback to Democrats. 
''This election sends Democrats another warning that Democrats up and down the ballot next year cannot escape accountability for their failed economic policies,'' said Representative Pete Sessions of Texas, the chairman of the National Republican Campaign Committee.
In a closed-door meeting of the House Democratic Caucus on Wednesday, participants said, members of Congress expressed deep concern about their own re-election efforts next year. The defeats also signaled the deepening fissures between Democrats on Capitol Hill and the White House.
The Republican victories, particularly in the Ninth Congressional District of New York where Democrats have a three-to-one edge among registered voters, deepened the sense of agitation of Democrats and highlighted a deficit in enthusiasm among the party's core supporters that contributed to widespread losses in the 2010 elections.
The Democratic defeat in the Nevada district, even in traditionally strong precincts around Reno, offered hope to Republicans that criticism about significantly overhauling Medicare did not appear to resonate deeply with voters.
Republicans invested heavily in television commercials, including ones with the candidate's mother standing at his side to push back against suggestions that the party planned to cut programs like Medicare.
President Obama and his policies were a central point of discussion in both campaigns. The Democratic loss in Nevada held an extra layer of significance because the state is a critical presidential battleground that Mr. Obama won in 2008. His victory was built on a strong showing in Washoe County, which includes Reno, which the Republican candidate carried Tuesday by 10 percentage points.
The White House dismissed suggestions on Wednesday that the president's frail political standing contributed to the Democratic defeats and argued that the results were a warning sign to incumbents of both parties.
''Special elections are often unique, and their outcomes do not tell you very much about future regularly scheduled elections,'' said Jay Carney, the White House press secretary. ''Are Americans in general anxious and not happy with Washington? The answer is yes.''
With the outcomes of the special elections on Tuesday, Republicans now hold 242 seats in the House, compared with 192 for Democrats. There is one vacancy.
Republicans and Democrats often trade victories in special Congressional elections.
In May, Democrats won a heavily Republican district in upstate New York in a campaign that was dominated by a debate over Medicare. Democrats fought against the budget plan passed by Republicans, which called for revamping the Medicare program. The argument did not have the same effect this week.
''Special elections are always difficult -- they are low-turnout, high-intensity races,'' said Representative Steve Israel of New York, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
The special election in New York was called after Representative Anthony D. Weiner, a Democrat, resigned in the wake of a sex scandal. He will be succeeded in Congress by Bob Turner, a Republican, who is a retired television executive.
Mr. Turner will be joined in Washington by Mark Amodei, a Nevada Republican, who won his race in the special election called after an opening was created by a congressman who stepped down to compete for the seat being vacated by the resignation of Senator John Ensign.

HEADLINE: Some Democrats Are Balking at Obama's Jobs Bill

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama anticipated Republican resistance to his jobs program, but he is now meeting increasing pushback from his own party. Many Congressional Democrats, smarting from the fallout over the 2009 stimulus bill, say there is little chance they will be able to support the bill as a single entity, citing an array of elements they cannot abide.
''I think the American people are very skeptical of big pieces of legislation,'' Senator Bob Casey, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, said in an interview Wednesday, joining a growing chorus of Democrats who prefer an a la carte version of the bill despite White House resistance to that approach. ''For that reason alone I think we should break it up.'' 
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, has said he will put the bill on the legislative calendar but has declined to say when. He almost certainly will push the bill -- which Mr. Obama urged Congress to pass ''right now!'' -- until after his chamber's recess at the end of the month; Mr. Reid has set votes on disaster aid, extensions for the Federal Aviation Administration and a short-term spending plan ahead of the jobs bill.
Republicans have focused their attack on the tax increases that would help pay for the spending components of the bill. But Democrats, as is their wont, are divided over their objections, which stem from Mr. Obama's sinking popularity in polls, parochial concerns and the party's chronic inability to unite around a legislative initiative, even in the face of Republican opposition.
Some are unhappy about the specific types of companies, particularly the oil industry, that would lose tax benefits. ''I have said for months that I am not supporting a repeal of tax cuts for the oil industry unless there are other industries that contribute,'' said Senator Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana.
A small but vocal group dislikes the payroll tax cuts for employees and small businesses. ''I have been very unequivocal,'' said Representative Peter A. DeFazio, a Democrat from Oregon. ''No more tax cuts.''
His voice rising to a near shriek, he added: ''We have the economy that tax cuts give us. And it's pretty pathetic, isn't it? The president is in a box.''
There are also Democrats, some of them senators up for election in 2012, who oppose the bill simply for its mental connection to the stimulus bill, which laid at least part of the foundation for the Republican takeover of the House in 2010.
''I have serious questions about the level of spending that President Obama proposed,'' said Senator Joe Manchin III, a Democrat from West Virginia, in a statement issued right after Mr. Obama spoke to a joint session of Congress last week.
While Mr. Reid, who is known for trying to protect Democrats from casting tough votes, may be delaying the bill to insulate his party, the White House has a tacit agreement with Senate Democrats that Mr. Obama be permitted to take his American Jobs Act around the country to try to sell it to voters. The White House is to brief Democratic senators on the granular aspects of the proposal on Thursday.
The White House does enjoy support from many Democrats still. ''I am so happy to hear them talking about the most important thing, which is jobs,'' said Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan.
As he barnstormed again on Wednesday, Mr. Obama told voters in North Carolina, ''If you love me, you've got to help me pass this bill,'' but even some members of Congress from that state may prefer to stay just friends.
Senator Kay Hagan declined on Wednesday to say her support for the bill that Mr. Obama spent the day promoting in her state was indubitable. ''We've got to have legislation that is supported by Democrats and Republicans,'' she said. ''I'm going to have to look at it. ''
Representative Heath Shuler, another North Carolina Democrat, said Congress should tame the deficit before approving new spending for job programs. ''The most important thing is to get our fiscal house in order,'' said Mr. Shuler, a leader of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition. ''Then we can talk about other aspects of job creation.''
Earlier in the week, David Axelrod, the president's top political adviser, said in an interview with ''Good Morning America'' that the White House was ''not in negotiation to break up'' Mr. Obama's bill, and that Congress would not have an option for an ''a la carte menu.''
But it is very likely that the bill will be cherry-picked for items that appeal to large swaths on both sides of the aisle, like the payroll tax cut and a job training program for the unemployed.
Senate Democrats would certainly relish the idea of bringing numerous bills to the floor to fail -- like those that would benefit first responders -- potentially embarrassing the opposing Republicans. However, if Democrats end up dumping some of the more controversial methods of paying for the infrastructure and other big-ticket items in the bill -- and most of them annoy Republicans or Democrats or both -- either the administration or the House and Senate will still be stuck finding another way to pay for them.

HEADLINE: The Biden Assignment

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
The White House wants to make sure voters know that administration officials are doing everything they can to cut waste in these hard economic times. Towards that end, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Wednesday convened the first Cabinet meeting dedicated solely to looking at how to reduce waste at federal agencies. 
Mr. Biden announced a new waste-cutting initiative that he said would save $2 billion, and tasked the assembled Cabinet secretaries to mount reviews focusing on unnecessary and inefficient federal spending in their agencies.
''We can make our government more efficient and responsible to the American people,'' Mr. Biden said in a statement. ''If we're going to spur jobs and economic growth and restore long-term fiscal solvency, we need to make sure hard-earned tax dollars don't go to waste.''

HEADLINE: A Tax Item in the Jobs Bill Raises Some Hackles Among Private Equity Executives

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
8:00 p.m. Updated
Private equity executives and hedge fund managers are apoplectic that President Obama has included a provision in his jobs bill that they are calling punitive and discriminatory.
Buried on Page 139 of the American Jobs Act is a measure that would tax profits on the sale of an investment management partnership - like a private equity, venture capital or hedge fund firm - at ordinary income rates of 35 percent. Proceeds from the sales of these and other United States businesses are now taxed at a 15 percent capital gains rate.
Critics say that if this so-called enterprise value tax proposal becomes law, investment management partnerships would be the only businesses in the United States where proceeds from the sale of the business would be taxed at ordinary income rates. 
''The enterprise value provision that the administration has included as part of an already flawed carried-interest proposal violates basic tax fairness policy and seems to single out the private equity, venture capital and real estate industries in a punitive fashion,'' said Steve Judge, interim chief executive of the Private Equity Growth Capital Council, the industry's trade group.
Until now, much of the conversation surrounding tax increases on Wall Street has focused on ''carried interest'' income, or the cut of profits that fund managers earn as part of their compensation. That income is currently taxed at capital gains rates; the administration's proposal would tax it at higher ordinary income rates.
Though an increase in the carried-interest tax rate would raise a relatively small amount of money - the White House budget office estimates $18 billion - the issue in recent years has become a flash point in the debate over how to pay for programs that will create jobs and stimulate the economy. Private equity and hedge fund firms have exploded over the last decade, and their executives have become among the most powerful and wealthiest players on Wall Street.
But since President Obama announced his jobs plan last week, the industry has not focused its ire on carried interest. Some Wall Street executives even privately concede that there are legitimate arguments for increasing their taxes on carried-interest compensation, especially as the economy continues to struggle.
Instead, they are angry over the enterprise value tax. When the provision first emerged from the House Ways and Means Committee, lobbyists and lawyers representing Wall Street thought it was a drafting error.
It was not. Proponents of the tax said it was necessary to prevent industry players from circumventing new rules on carried interest. In other words, tax policy makers feared that investment management executives would sell their businesses to avoid paying higher tax rates on future carried interest income.
But cashing out has become more common in private equity and hedge fund land. A number of hedge funds have sold themselves to large banks, including Highbridge Capital Management to JPMorgan Chase and Old Lane Partners to Citigroup. The country's most senior buyout executives, including Stephen A. Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group, recently descended on Capitol Hill to protest the tax.
Here is what has them so angry: It is widely understood that when a business is sold, the owners' proceeds are taxed at a capital gains rate. For instance, if two entrepreneurs built a chain of tattoo parlors and then sold that business, their profits would be taxed at the capital gains rate.
But under the White House's proposal, two entrepreneurs who built a private equity or a hedge fund firm and then sold it would pay ordinary income tax rates on the profits from the sale. Some policy makers say they believe the measure could raise billions of dollars in revenue for the government.
''It's like a bill of attainder,'' said one senior buyout executive who requested anonymity because he did not want to alienate the administration. A bill of attainder, which is banned by the Constitution, is a law that has a negative effect on a single person or group.
Last week, a paper written by the Democratic staff of the House Ways and Means Committee suggested increasing only the carried-interest tax rate, but not adopting the enterprise value tax.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: It's a Long, Long Road to Election Day: Assigning a Jobs Bill as Homework

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
RALEIGH -- President Obama turned up the rhetorical heat in his push for his jobs bill on Wednesday, declaring that the country is facing a ''national emergency'' that demands Congressional action on his $447 billion economic package.
Plunging into his third battleground state in five days, Mr. Obama told highly charged students in a packed basketball arena at North Carolina State University that he was sick of the partisanship that has engulfed Washington during the last three years. He accused lawmakers of deliberately dragging their feet on his economic plan, not because they don't think it will help, but because they do not want to give him a political win. 
''Give me a win?'' Mr. Obama said, his voice rising as the crowd started cheering. ''Give me a break. That's exactly why folks are fed up with Washington.''
Even as initial polls suggest that only half of Americans support his jobs proposal, Mr. Obama appears convinced of his ability to sell it to the public, and he urged his audience to sell it in turn to their Congressional representatives.
''For those of you who did skip class today, I've got a homework assignment for you,'' he said, asking that students ''call, e-mail, tweet, fax, Facebook'' their Congressional representatives with the message that ''the time for partisanship is over. The time for action is now.''
Mr. Obama has been raising the energy level every day since announcing his jobs proposal last Thursday, and this event pushed it up another notch, appearing as part campaign rally and -- this is North Carolina, after all -- part basketball game.
The university's marching band showed up in Reynolds Coliseum, accompanied by a squadron of cheerleaders and baton twirlers, to play Wolfpack fight songs for three hours before Mr. Obama arrived, to a capacity crowd of 9,000 people, including students who had camped out to claim tickets. In a surreal battle for musical supremacy, the band then kept interrupting the usual campaign-trail tunes (''I'll Take You There'' by the Staple Singers, ''The Rising'' by Bruce Springsteen and the twangy ''Only in America'' by Brooks & Dunn) with drumming, dance moves and chants of ''Go State!''
Outside the coliseum, a group was handing out the New Testament in the 90-degree heat.
Mr. Obama's political advisers say they believe strongly that he can compete in North Carolina, a conservative state with a changing demographic that the president improbably won in 2008, the first time a Democrat had taken the state since Jimmy Carter, a Southerner, did in 1976. Charlotte will be carrying the hopes of Democratic Party officials next year when it hosts the Democratic National Convention. And the capacity crowd here at North Carolina State certainly seemed pro-Obama.
But North Carolina's big universities are notorious for being more liberal than the rest of the state. Republicans maintain that 2008 was a fluke, and signs point to a tough battle here for Mr. Obama. The state's unemployment rate was 10.1 percent in July, and has been tracking above the national average. Last year, Democrats lost a House seat in the state, and Democrats also lost control of both houses of the state legislature.
Can Mr. Obama win again here? ''No, I don't think so,'' said Greg Palmer, a senior, standing in the crowd at Reynolds awaiting Mr. Obama's speech. Mr. Palmer said Mr. Obama won North Carolina in 2008 mostly on a swelling of the African-American vote, and added that he believed that the president's policies had alienated North Carolinians.
But standing next to Mr. Palmer, Fiona Marsh, a recent transplant from Georgia, begged to differ. ''North Carolina,'' Ms. Marsh said, ''is more enlightened. At least, more enlightened than Georgia.''
Mr. Obama seemed bent Wednesday on repeating his 2008 political feat, playing up to the crowd of screaming students. ''It is good to have all these wolves in my wolfpack!'' he said, igniting a frenzy of wild cheers. The crowd clearly energized Mr. Obama, who was sounding feistier than he has in the past.
There was even a return of the age-old ''I love you Barack'' from the 2008 campaign, as one audience member bellowed out. From the president, he received the standard response: ''I love you back,'' which ignited another rafter-shaking cheer. But then, Mr. Obama added: ''If you love me, you've got to help me pass this bill.''

HEADLINE: Frank Quattrone's Golden Touch

BYLINE: By ROBERT CYRAN and JOHN FOLEY

 BODY:
When Frank Quattrone comes calling, buyers should beware. The latest coup for the former Credit Suisse First Boston ace is persuading Google to bid against itself for Motorola Mobility. Since starting Qatalyst Partners, his boutique investment bank, Mr. Quattrone has extracted a much higher premium for clients than rival tech bankers. Silicon Valley has now been given fair warning.
The $12.5 billion Motorola deal is a big part of Mr. Quattrone's already impressive second act. He spent several years tied up in court, clearing his name of accusations linked to hot initial public offerings during the original dot-com bubble. He successfully fought off all charges by 2006, but by then the sector's landscape had been radically altered since the days of Netscape. 
The technology may have changed but many of the executives and investors had not. Setting up Qatalyst in 2008, mainly to help firms sell themselves to rivals instead of the public, proved canny. Giants like Hewlett-Packard, Oracle and Google increasingly invade one another's turf, and the move to Web-based services has intensified this free-for-all. Mr. Quattrone's job today also remains essentially the same as it was a decade ago: fetch the highest price for technology clients.
He has done exactly that. Since the start of 2010, Qatalyst has advised nearly a dozen publicly listed companies. The typical tech firm sells for 37 percent more than where its shares were trading four weeks before the deal announcement, according to Thomson Reuters data; Mr. Quattrone's clients garnered premiums of about 70 percent.
It's impossible to pin down the reasons for this success. It could be favorable client selection. 3PAR's ability to secure nearly three times its undisturbed price may have had more to do with desperate suitors than the auctioneer's skills. Then again, Mr. Quattrone may be better at marshaling hype and old-fashioned salesmanship. How else to explain the data storage firm Isilon fetching 100 times earnings or Google twice raising its bid for Motorola despite a lack of other bidders?
Either way, it strains belief to suggest Mr. Quattrone is merely on a lucky streak. Sellers may want to make him their first call. Buyers, on the other hand, should heed the approximate Latin: Caveat Qatalyst.
China's Strings
It's no surprise that China's pledges of support for indebted trade partners come with strings. But Premier Wen Jiabao, addressing the World Economic Forum on Wednesday, was unusually blunt about what he expects in return: to be named a market economy. That would cost Europe little, but it doesn't mean it should agree.
Chinese investment must look more appealing as stricken euro zone states like Italy, Greece and Spain face up to the possibility that investors will refuse to finance their deficits. Italy's gouging by bond markets on Tuesday gives a taste. Just a drop of China's $3.2 trillion in foreign exchange reserves could give troubled countries a reprieve.
Market economy status is, on the face of it, an easy thing to give in return. After all, it's just a label. But without it, countries can accuse China of dumping goods, and then use other countries' prices -- say, India's energy prices or Thailand's land costs -- to prove their point. Under World Trade Organization rules, China gets market status anyway in 2016, but as Mr. Wen says, bringing that forward a few years is the kind of thing one might expect ''from one friend to another.''
Perhaps. Except that China isn't a market economy, it's a ''socialist market economy.'' Some important hallmarks aren't there. The exchange rate is guided more by policy than market forces. Capital is allocated by decree rather than just by price. True, China isn't the command economy it was under Chairman Mao. But the suppressed rate on deposits, for example, or the inflated lending rates for small companies show that not everything is pure supply and demand.
So while Europe could give China what it wants -- and it has flexed the ''market'' definition before, for Russia -- it's hardly a commendable course. Far better for Europe's leaders to get their own house in order, including planning for a Greek default and pushing Italy to cut back its debts. That's harder work. But it would also make China's veiled ultimatums moot.

HEADLINE: Furor Over Loans to Failed Solar Firm

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD and CHARLIE SAVAGE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Republican lawmakers, escalating the political furor over the collapse of a solar equipment manufacturer that received a $528 million government loan, released excerpts from Obama administration e-mails on Wednesday suggesting that the White House pressed federal officials to wrap up their review of the loan quickly for political purposes.
In the e-mails, officials at the Office of Management and Budget expressed frustration that they were being put under time pressure to sign off on the loan to the company, Solyndra, two years ago so that Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. could announce its approval at a groundbreaking for a factory. The White House wanted an announcement that would show progress on job creation. 
The disclosure became a focus of a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing on Wednesday about the loan to Solyndra, which has developed into a political headache for the Obama administration. The administration used the company as a prime example of stimulus bill dollars creating ''green jobs.'' But Solyndra recently filed for bankruptcy protection and closed its factory, and its headquarters was raided by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, apparently in connection with the loan.
The bankruptcy filing and the raid ''clearly show that the committee was more than justified in its scrutiny of the deal,'' said the panel's chairman, Representative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan. ''Why did the administration think Solyndra was such a good bet?''
Critics of the loan have focused on whether political considerations played a role in awarding the loan to Solyndra, which the Obama administration denies. But the hearing also cast doubt on the government's competence to assess how sure a bet it is making, regardless of politics.
Officials of the Energy Department's loan office and the White House budget office defended their decisions, which they said were carefully reviewed and not politically inspired. The administration said that the e-mails showed only that the White House wanted to know when a decision would be made for its planning.
''As the e-mails indicate, there was interest in when a decision would be made because of its impact on whether an event involving the vice president could be scheduled for a particular date or not,'' said Eric Schultz, a White House spokesman. ''But the loan guarantee decision was merit-based and made by career staffers at the Department of Energy, and the process for this particular loan guarantee began under President George W. Bush.''
Suspicions that the administration might have pushed the loan for political reasons have centered on the fact that a major investor in the company is a charitable foundation associated with George B. Kaiser, a billionaire from Tulsa, Okla., who raised $50,000 to $100,000 as a ''bundler'' for President Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
Logs show that Mr. Kaiser visited the White House on several occasions during the spring and summer of 2009, while the loan to Solyndra was being considered. Among the officials he met with were the chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, and Pete Rouse and Valerie Jarrett, both senior advisers to Mr. Obama.
''It seems like crony capitalism was trumping the smart decision-making,'' Representative Steve Scalise, Republican of Louisiana, said at the hearing.
Campaign finance records analyzed by OpenSecrets.org show that there were about 235 other bundlers for the Obama campaign in Mr. Kaiser's range, while about 326 bundlers raised significantly larger sums.
Administration officials said the White House meetings were not about Solyndra but rather were related to Mr. Kaiser's charitable interest in policy matters like early childhood education. Mr. Kaiser has declined to comment directly about the meetings. But the George Kaiser Family Foundation has said that ''he did not participate in any discussions with the U.S. government regarding the loan.''
While Mr. Kaiser's connection to the Obama campaign and to Solyndra, based in Fremont, Calif., have helped draw attention to the loan, he was not a major topic of discussion at the hearing on Wednesday. Republicans did, however, press those testifying on whether the Solyndra bankruptcy offered proof that the government should not be lending to companies that have trouble raising money from private investors.
''In this time of record debt, I question whether the government is qualified to act as a venture capitalist, picking winners and losers in speculative ventures and shelling out billions of taxpayer dollars to keep them afloat,'' Mr. Upton said.
Three factors pushed the market price of solar arrays below Solyndra's cost of production, according to experts. The cost of silicon, a key ingredient in competitors' cells but not in Solyndra's, fell sharply. The European economic crisis cut demand for solar cells. And China subsidized a huge increase of solar equipment production, producing a surplus.
While taxpayers could lose the $528 million the company borrowed from the Treasury, Jeffrey D. Zients, deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, said that the system for evaluating such loans was sound. He said it was inevitable that some cutting-edge firms would fail but that over all, the investments would prove worthwhile. He did allow, ''The lesson learned here is that marketplaces can change even more rapidly than one would have anticipated.''
Executives from Solyndra are scheduled to testify before the subcommittee next week.
Meanwhile, the White House provided about 900 pages of e-mails this week to the committee, which had asked for all correspondence between Obama aides and Solyndra executives. Most of the correspondence concerned logistics for a visit by Mr. Obama in the spring of 2010.
However, several e-mails from the company to the White House flagged and sought to discredit a handful of articles that had questioned the company's financial viability as far back as July 2010. A Solyndra official, David Miller, called one such report baseless and noted that Solyndra ''had no intention of going out of business'' and that its goal was to be ''a true success story for this administration to point to.''
Another Solyndra e-mail, from this past May, informed the White House that ''things are going well'' at the company and that it had ''good market momentum, the factory is ramping up and our plan puts at cash positive later this year. Hopefully, we'll have a great story to tell toward the end of the year.''
A White House official, Greg Nelson, replied: ''Fantastic to hear that business is doing well -- keep up the good work! We're cheering for you.''

HEADLINE: After Choosing a Candidate Who Lost, a Democrat Stands in an Unfavorable Light

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN; Thomas Kaplan and Tim Stelloh contributed reporting.

 BODY:
New York Democrats woke up on Wednesday morning to an unwelcome new reality -- the voters of Queens and Brooklyn had elected a Republican to represent the Ninth Congressional District -- and an uncomfortable new question: What went wrong?
There was the unhappiness with President Obama, of course, and the state of the economy. There was the Israel issue, the endorsement by former Mayor Edward I. Koch and the weakness of the Democratic candidate, David I. Weprin. But then, too, there was Representative Joseph Crowley. 
After all, critics said, it was Mr. Crowley, the Queens Democratic Party chairman, who picked Assemblyman Weprin as a Congressional nominee. Mr. Weprin had a locally familiar last name: his father was a well-known Assembly speaker, and his brother is a member of the City Council.
But the candidate himself was neither charismatic nor aggressive, and was chosen in part because of his willingness to represent a district that was viewed as likely to be eliminated during the redistricting process next year. Mr. Weprin, other Democrats said, was chosen in part because he would not then challenge the neighboring incumbents, Representative Gary L. Ackerman and Mr. Crowley himself.
And no one, apparently, wanted to interfere with Mr. Crowley's choice. Not the Brooklyn Democratic leader, Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez, who, though one-third of the Congressional district was in his borough, was preoccupied with assisting a Brooklyn Assembly candidate's campaign. Not the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which had assumed, until the end, when it dumped $600,000 in panicked spending into the race, that the district was safely Democratic.
''This was Joe's call,'' one frustrated high-ranking New York Democrat said, repeating a common mantra. He spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect his standing with Mr. Crowley and the party.
Fair or not, Mr. Weprin's defeat has cast an unfavorable light on Mr. Crowley and his borough party organization, and raised questions as to whether his once-ascendant star in Washington will be diminished, or whether his influence in future local battles will wane.
The loss could also have a profound effect on the other Democrats in the House, who may now have to recommend another district to sacrifice in the redistricting process, in which New York must give up two of its Congressional seats. The Congressional delegation had been planning to recommend that each party give up one of its seats in the state, and the Ninth District no longer counts as a Democratic seat.
''There's no question that the nomination process made Weprin look like a machine-handpicked candidate, and that's always unhelpful,'' said David Wasserman, the House editor of The Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan newsletter. ''The loss does Crowley no favors in the Democratic caucus.''
Then again, Mr. Wasserman and others noted, Mr. Crowley cannot be blamed entirely for Mr. Weprin's loss to Bob Turner, a retired businessman, in the special election to fill the seat formerly held by Anthony D. Weiner. Indeed, one can point instead to the president's sinking approval numbers in the district, widespread grumbling in its heavily Orthodox Jewish community about the Obama administration's Israel policy, low voter turnout and, not least, Mr. Weprin's stumbling performance on the campaign trail.
''I don't think you can heap blame on Crowley or any one person,'' said Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. ''This is a perfect storm -- a collision of a lot of different, very unique circumstances that you probably couldn't replicate again for a special if you tried.''
And as for redistricting, which is the province of the State Legislature, it remains anyone's guess as to what will happen, since Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, has threatened to veto any plan that does not come from an independent commission.
In an interview, Mr. Crowley noted that his picks for other races in Queens -- two Assembly seats -- both prevailed. He also noted that Mr. Weprin carried the Queens portion of the Ninth District by a few percentage points, and lost the seat only because of a two-to-one drubbing in Brooklyn.
''All in all, we had a good night,'' Mr. Crowley said. Then, referring to the Ninth District seat, he added, ''If this were only in Queens, we would have won N.Y. 9 too.''
When it comes to Congressional elections, Mr. Crowley is no stranger to the inside game. After serving in the Assembly for 12 years in the 1980s and '90s, he was elected to Congress in 1998, thanks to a clever political move engineered by his mentor, Thomas J. Manton, his predecessor in the House and as leader of the Queens Democratic organization. Mr. Manton caught the political establishment off-guard that year by announcing his retirement so late that when Mr. Crowley was named to replace him in Congress, he was able to avoid both a special election and any serious competition from Republicans or other Democrats.
Mr. Crowley became the county party leader shortly after Mr. Manton's death in 2006. The holder of that position often has a strong influence on the race for Council speaker, and, to a lesser extent, citywide candidates. As a political moderate, Mr. Crowley has frequently played a key role in important city issues, siding, for example, with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg on congestion pricing.
Mr. Crowley also embodies the familial nature of Queens politics. His cousin, Elizabeth Crowley, is a council member. But his pick of Mr. Weprin raised eyebrows from the start.
''It looks bad, and he'll be blamed for sure, but not to his face,'' Michael Tobman, a Democratic political consultant who was not involved in the race, said of Mr. Crowley. ''And as Queens works, it'll have little impact on his future or on reapportionment.''

HEADLINE: Bleak News on Health Insurance

 BODY:
Nearly one million more Americans went without health insurance in 2010 than in 2009. This distressing news is further evidence of the need for government safety net programs and the national health care reforms that will take effect mostly in 2014. 
The Census Bureau reported this week that the number of uninsured people rose to 49.9 million last year, up from 49 million the previous year. This is particularly troubling during an economic downturn in which more people have been pushed into poverty and median family income has plummeted, leaving the uninsured with even fewer resources to pay for health care.
The percentage of Americans covered by private health insurance continued its decade-long decline, and the percentage covered by employment-based policies, the bedrock of the insurance system for working people, dropped to 55 percent. Job-related coverage has been eroding because employers have shifted costs to workers, making insurance less affordable, and because workers have lost their jobs.
The only consolation was that government insurance programs were able to mitigate some of the damage. The percentage of people covered by these programs increased for the fourth consecutive year. Medicaid and a related children's health insurance program have actually enrolled more children in recent years than were dropped from employer coverage.
The new health care reforms will expand Medicaid coverage for the poor and provide subsidies to help middle-income people buy private health insurance. Such steps will make health care much more affordable to those who lack employer-based coverage.

HEADLINE: Islamists' Growing Sway Raises Questions for Libya

BYLINE: By ROD NORDLAND and DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

 BODY:
CORRECTION APPENDED
TRIPOLI, Libya -- In the emerging post-Qaddafi Libya, the most influential politician may well be Ali Sallabi, who has no formal title but commands broad respect as an Islamic scholar and populist orator who was instrumental in leading the mass uprising.
The most powerful military leader is now Abdel Hakim Belhaj, the former leader of a hard-line group once believed to be aligned with Al Qaeda.
The growing influence of Islamists in Libya raises hard questions about the ultimate character of the government and society that will rise in place of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's autocracy. The United States and Libya's new leaders say the Islamists, a well-organized group in a mostly moderate country, are sending signals that they are dedicated to democratic pluralism. They say there is no reason to doubt the Islamists' sincerity.
But as in Egypt and Tunisia, the latest upheaval of the Arab Spring deposed a dictator who had suppressed hard-core Islamists, and there are some worrisome signs about what kind of government will follow. It is far from clear where Libya will end up on a spectrum of possibilities that range from the Turkish model of democratic pluralism to the muddle of Egypt to, in the worst case, the theocracy of Shiite Iran or Sunni models like the Taliban or even Al Qaeda. 
Islamist militias in Libya receive weapons and financing directly from foreign benefactors like Qatar; a Muslim Brotherhood figure, Abel al-Rajazk Abu Hajar, leads the Tripoli Municipal Governing Council, where Islamists are reportedly in the majority; in eastern Libya, there has been no resolution of the assassination in July of the leader of the rebel military, Gen. Abdul Fattah Younes, suspected by some to be the work of Islamists.
Mr. Belhaj has become so much an insider lately that he is seeking to unseat Mahmoud Jibril, the American-trained economist who is the nominal prime minister of the interim government, after Mr. Jibril obliquely criticized the Islamists.
For an uprising that presented a liberal, Westernized face to the world, the growing sway of Islamists -- activists with fundamentalist Islamic views, who want a society governed by Islamic principles -- is being followed closely by the United States and its NATO allies.
''I think it's something that everybody is watching,'' said Jeffrey D. Feltman, assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, visiting here on Wednesday. ''First of all the Libyan people themselves are talking about this.'' The highest-ranking American official to visit Libya since Colonel Qaddafi's fall, Mr. Feltman was optimistic that Libya would take a moderate path.
''Based on our discussions with Libyans so far,'' he said, ''we aren't concerned that one group is going to be able to dominate the aftermath of what has been a shared struggle by the Libyan people.''
Mr. Sallabi, in an interview, made it clear that he and his followers wanted to build a political party based on Islamic principles that would come to power through democratic elections. But if the party failed to attract widespread support, he said, so be it.
''It is the people's revolution, and all the people are Muslims, Islamists,'' Mr. Sallabi said. Secularists ''are our brothers and they are Libyans.''
''They have the right to offer their proposals and programs,'' he said, ''and if the Libyan people choose them I have no problem. We believe in democracy and the peaceful exchange of power.''
Many Libyans say they are not worried. ''The Islamists are organized so they seem more influential than their real weight,'' said Usama Endar, a management consultant who was among the wealthy Tripolitans who helped finance the revolution. ''They don't have wide support, and when the dust settles, only those with large-scale appeal, without the tunnel vision of the Islamists, will win.''
Yet an anti-Islamist, anti-Sallabi rally in Martyrs' Square on Wednesday drew only a few dozen demonstrators.
Many, like Aref Nayed, coordinator of the Transitional National Council's stabilization team and a prominent religious scholar, say that the revolution had proved that Libyans would not accept anything but a democratic society, and that the Islamists would have to adapt to that.
''There will be attempts by people to take over, but none of them will succeed because the young people will go out on the streets and bring them down,'' Mr. Nayed said.
Some are concerned that the Islamists are already wielding too much power, particularly in relation to their support in Libyan society, where most people, while devout, practice a moderate form of Islam in which individual liberties are respected.
Mr. Sallabi dismissed those fears, saying Islamists would not impose their traditionalist views on others. ''If people choose a woman to lead, as president, we have no problem with that. Women can dress the way they like; they are free.''
Adel al-Hadi al-Mishrogi, a prominent businessman who began raising money for the anti-Qaddafi insurgents early in the revolution, is not convinced by the Islamists' declarations of fealty to democratic principles. He pointed to a well-organized Islamist umbrella group, Etilaf, which he said had pushed aside more secular groupings.
''Most Libyans are not strongly Islamic, but the Islamists are strongly organized, and that's the problem,'' Mr. Mishrogi said. ''Our meetings go on for hours without decisions. Their meetings are disciplined and right to the point. They're not very popular, but they're organized.''
He complains that Etilaf and Mr. Sallabi are the ones who are really running things in Libya now. Others say the picture is much more diverse and chaotic than Mr. Mishrogi suggests, although it is true that Etilaf, with no fixed address and still apparently operating underground, continues to issue decrees of all sorts as if it were some sort of revolutionary guide.
''All offices here must make sure that they are headed by an acceptable person within seven days of this notice,'' read a leaflet pasted to the doors of offices throughout Tripoli Central Hospital, dated Sept. 3 and signed, simply, Etilaf.
''They are behind everything,'' Mr. Mishrogi said.
Youssef M. Sherif, a prominent Libyan writer and intellectual, said: ''Every day the Islamists grow stronger. When there is a parliament, the Islamists will get the majority.''
''Abdel Hakim Belhaj is in effect the governor of Tripoli just because he was elected by an Islamist militia,'' Mr. Sherif said. Echoing debates in Egypt, Mr. Sherif argued for a longer transition to elections than the planned eight months, to give liberals a better chance to organize.
The growing influence of the Islamists is reflected in their increased willingness to play a political role. Until recently the Islamists have kept a low profile, and even many secular Libyan officials have expressed a reluctance to criticize them, saying they should focus instead on the common enemy while Colonel Qaddafi remains on the loose.
That seems to be changing. After the interim government's acting prime minister, Mr. Jibril, appeared recently in Tripoli and indirectly criticized politicking by the Islamists as premature with a war still in progress, Mr. Belhaj and Mr. Sallabi began agitating for his replacement.
''Jibril will be gone soon,'' one aide to Mr. Belhaj said.
And Mr. Sallabi said that Mr. Jibril, along with the American-educated finance and oil minister, Ali Tarhouni, were ushering in a ''new era of tyranny and dictatorship,'' Al Jazeera reported.
During the 42 years of Colonel Qaddafi's rule, underground organizations like Mr. Belhaj's Libyan Islamic Fighting Group and the Muslim Brotherhood were the only opposition. Although outlawed and persecuted, they had a network through mosques that secular opponents of the government could not match.
That has also given them a head start in political organizing now, and they appear to be wasting no time.
''There will be attempts by some parties to take over; it's only natural,'' said one prominent official with the Transitional National Council, who spoke anonymously so as not to alienate Islamists. ''And definitely Etilaf is trying to increase its influence. And we're hearing much more from the Islamists in the media because they are more organized and they are more articulate.''
Mr. Nayed conceded that might be true, but was unconcerned. ''My answer to anyone who complains about that: You must be as articulate as they are and as organized as they are,'' he said. ''And I think we're starting to see that among various youth groups.''
Fathi Ben Issa, a former Etilaf member who became an early representative on the Tripoli council, said he quit his position after learning that the Muslim Brotherhood members who dominate that body wanted to ban theater, cinema and arts like sculpture of the human form. ''They were like the Taliban,'' he said. ''We didn't get rid of Qaddafi to replace him with such people.'' The final straw, he said, came when Etilaf began circulating a proposed fatwa, or decree, to bar women from driving.
Most Libyans are quick to bristle at suggestions that their own Islamists might one day go the way of Iran, where after the fall of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini stomped out a short-lived liberal government by denouncing democracy as un-Islamic.
Mr. Sallabi said he hoped Libyans could find a leader on the model of George Washington, whom he had been reading about lately. ''After his struggle he went back to his farm even though the American people wanted him to be president,'' Mr. Sallabi said. ''He is a great man.''
Referring to Mr. Sallabi, Mr. Ben Issa, who said he has received death threats since breaking with the Islamists, retorted: ''He is just hiding his intentions. He says one thing to the BBC and another to Al Jazeera. If you believe him, then you don't know the Muslim Brothers.''

HEADLINE: Walking Out on China

BYLINE: By LIAO YIWU. 
Liao Yiwu is the author of ''God Is Red'' and ''The Corpse Walker.'' This essay was translated by Wen Huang from the Chinese.

 BODY:
YUNNAN PROVINCE, in southwestern China, has long been the exit point for Chinese who yearn for a new life outside the country. There, one can sneak out of China by land, passing through pristine forests, or one can go by water, floating all the way down the Lancang River until it becomes the Mekong, which meanders into Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.
So each time I set foot there, in a land where red soil gleams in the sun, I turned restless; my imagination ran wild. After all, having been imprisoned for four years after I wrote a poem that condemned the Chinese government's brutal suppression of student protesters in 1989, I had been denied permission to leave China 16 times. 
I felt very tempted. It doesn't matter if you have a passport or visa. All that counts is the amount of cash in your pocket. You toss your cellphone, cut off communications with the outside world and sneak into a village, where you can easily locate a peasant or a smuggler willing to help you. After settling on the right price, you are led out of China on a secret path that lies beyond the knowledge of humans and ghosts.
Until earlier this year, I had resisted the urge to escape. Instead, I chose to stay in China, continuing to document the lives of those occupying the bottom rung of society. Then, democratic protests swept across the Arab world, and posts began appearing on the Internet calling for similar street protests in China. In February and March, there were peaceful gatherings at busy commercial and tourist centers in dozens of cities every Sunday afternoon. The government panicked, staging a concerted show of force nationwide. Soldiers changed into civilian clothes and patrolled the streets with guns, arresting anyone they deemed suspicious.
Meanwhile, any reference to Tunisia's Jasmine Revolution (and even the word jasmine) was censored in text messages and on search engines. The police rounded up human rights lawyers, writers and artists. The democracy activist Liu Xianbin, who had served nine years in prison for helping to form the China Democratic Party, was given a new sentence of 10 years. The artist Ai Weiwei vanished in April and has lived under close government surveillance since his release in mid-June.
An old-fashioned writer, I seldom surf the Web, and the Arab Spring simply passed me by. Staying on the sidelines did not spare me police harassment, though. When public security officers learned that my books would be published in Germany, Taiwan and the United States, they began phoning and visiting me frequently.
In March, my police handlers stationed themselves outside my apartment to monitor my daily activities. ''Publishing in the West is a violation of Chinese law,'' they told me. ''The prison memoir tarnishes the reputation of China's prison system and 'God Is Red' distorts the party's policy on religion and promotes underground churches.'' If I refused to cancel my contract with Western publishers, they said, I'd face legal consequences.
Then an invitation from Salman Rushdie arrived, asking me to attend the PEN World Voices Festival in New York. I immediately contacted the local authorities to apply for permission to leave China, and booked my plane ticket. However, the day before my scheduled departure, a police officer called me to ''have tea,'' informing me that my request had been denied. If I insisted on going to the airport, the officer told me, they would make me disappear, just like Ai Weiwei.
For a writer, especially one who aspires to bear witness to what is happening in China, freedom of speech and publication mean more than life itself. My good friend, the Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo, has paid a hefty price for his writings and political activism. I did not want to follow his path. I had no intention of going back to prison. I was also unwilling to be treated as a ''symbol of freedom'' by people outside the tall prison walls.
Only by escaping this colossal and invisible prison called China could I write and publish freely. I have the responsibility to let the world know about the real China hidden behind the illusion of an economic boom -- a China indifferent to ordinary people's simmering resentment.
I kept my plan to myself. I didn't follow my usual routine of asking my police handlers for permission. Instead, I packed some clothes, my Chinese flute, a Tibetan singing bowl and two of my prized books, ''The Records of the Grand Historian'' and the ''I Ching.'' Then I left home while the police were not watching, and traveled to Yunnan. Even though it was sweltering there, I felt like a rat in winter, lying still to save my energy. I spent most of my time with street people. I knew that if I dug around, I could eventually find an exit.
WITH my passport and valid visas from Germany, the United States and Vietnam, I began to move. I shut off my cellphone after making brief contacts with my friends in the West, who had collaborated on the plan. Several days later, I reached a small border town, where I could see Vietnam across a fast-flowing river. My local helper said I could pay someone to secretly ferry me across, but I declined. I had a valid passport. I chose to leave through the border checkpoint on the bridge.
Before the escape, my helper had put me up at a hotel near the border. Amid intermittent showers, I floated in and out of dreams and awoke nervously to the sound of a knock on the door, only to see a prostitute shivering in the rain and asking for shelter. Although sympathetic, I was in no position to help.
At 10 a.m. on July 2, I walked 100 yards to the border post, fully prepared for the worst, but a miracle occurred. The officer checked my papers, stared at me momentarily and then stamped my passport. Without stopping, I traveled to Hanoi and boarded a flight to Poland and then to Germany. As I walked out of Tegel airport in Berlin on the morning of July 6, my German editor, Peter Sillem, greeted me. ''My God, my God,'' he exclaimed. He was deeply moved and could not believe that I was actually in Germany. Outside the airport, the air was fresh and I felt free.
After I settled in, I called my family and girlfriend, who were questioned by the authorities. News about my escape spread fast. A painter friend told me that he had gone to visit Ai Weiwei, who is still closely watched. When my friend mentioned that I had mysteriously landed in Germany, Old Ai's eyes widened. He howled with disbelief, ''Really? Really? Really?''

HEADLINE: The Bachmann Chronicles

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
Let's talk about Michele Bachmann.
Look, you should thank me for not bringing up Greek debt. Afghan violence. Economic indicators. Show some appreciation.
Bachmann is a challenge for feminist-friendly voters. Was it sexist to talk about her migraine problem? For Newsweek to run the cover that made her look like a well-groomed zombie? Should we have applauded the Iowa Republicans when they put a woman at the top of their presidential preference list, even if the woman in question blamed government spending for the earthquake in Washington?
Wow, it seems like we went through all this with Sarah Palin yesterday. 
Women tend to do well in almost any new enterprise where there's not a lot of stratification and seniority. So it's not surprising the Tea Party has a number of female stars. But isn't it sort of strange that they're all extremely attractive to the point of hot? You'd think there'd be a gray hair or a wattle somewhere.
As we've all learned, Bachmann's strong points are her passion and determination, while her weak ones include a rather free-floating relationship with reality. This week, she scored a Tea Party version of a home run when she laced into Rick Perry for trying to require girls in Texas public schools to be vaccinated against HPV, a sexually transmitted disease that can cause cervical cancer. ''I'm a mom, and I'm a mom of three children,'' she said, neglecting for what may have been the first time in the campaign to mention that she also fostered 23 others.
Let's stop a minute on the mom point. How often should a female candidate with children bring that up? My suggestion would be: frequently enough that we can appreciate a special sympathy for issues like early childhood education. But not so often that you could imagine it being her first comment during negotiations with North Korea over plutonium processing.
Except that Michele Bachmann does not seem to have a special sympathy for early childhood education. So forget it.
About the vaccine. It's been proved to be effective in reducing cervical cancer in sexually active women, and it apparently works best if you begin the shots around age 12. The intense opposition from the social right appears to be based on the idea that once the kids had the shots they'd be more likely to have sex. Or, in the convoluted and creepy words of Rick Santorum: ''Unless Texas has a very progressive way of communicating diseases in their school by way of their curriculum, then there is no government purpose served for having little girls inoculated at the force and compulsion of the government.''
Then, Bachmann tossed in another argument: vaccines are dangerous. ''I had a mother last night come up to me ... she told me her little daughter took that vaccine, that injection and she suffered from mental retardation thereafter,'' Bachmann told one TV interviewer after another.
O.K., hold the phone.
Let's presume that Bachmann is being accurate, and that the woman in question was not someone she heard about from a friend of a friend's cousin in Xenia, Ohio. What would you expect a candidate for president of the United States to do after such an encounter? Take a name? Investigate the case? Would a contender for the White House -- or even the Zoning Board of Appeals -- just blurt out something they heard from a stranger that could discourage parents from accepting vaccinations that could save their children's lives?
The Bachmann campaign did not respond to my questions about who the woman was or what the candidate did to check out the information. So I guess maybe, yeah.
Before we bid adieu to Michele Bachmann, let's look at her other charge against Perry: that the governor tried to start up a vaccination program because he got campaign contributions from the vaccine's maker, Merck.
''If you're saying that I can be bought for five thousand, I'm offended,'' said Perry, in a response that will make a swell campaign ad. (''Vote For The Man Who Can't Be Bought For As Little As $5,000!'')
Although Merck has apparently donated about $30,000. And at the time Perry made the decision, his former chief of staff was working for Merck as a lobbyist.
Rick Perry supports abstinence-only sex education in all Texas public schools. He doesn't think kids should be taught about condoms. How many of you really think he would leap to the cutting-edge front of the war against sexually transmitted disease by inoculating 12-year-old girls simply because, as he put it, ''I am always going to err on the side of life.''
Let me see a show of hands.
Sooner or later, even Michele Bachmann will turn out to be right about something.

HEADLINE: On Way to Congress, Already Talking of Staying

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN and KATE TAYLOR

 BODY:
Bob Turner, who won a special election on Tuesday to succeed Anthony D. Weiner in Congress, emerged onto his porch in Rockaway Point, Queens, at 9:45 on Wednesday morning in a polo shirt and shorts and bare feet, still groggy from his victory party the night before.
''I thought my 15 minutes was over,'' Mr. Turner said as he bent down to pick up his newspaper.
But his moment is only beginning. On Wednesday night, at a gala Republican dinner in Manhattan, he was hailed as a hero by party leaders, who pulled out smartphones and digital cameras to pose with him, and who chanted ''Turner! Turner! Turner!'' as he rose to speak in a high-ceilinged ballroom. And on Thursday morning, he was scheduled to be sworn in at the United States Capitol as a 70-year-old Congressional freshman. 
A retired television executive who helped create ''The Jerry Springer Show,'' Mr. Turner now has only months to prove that he is more than a passing expression of anger by a piqued electorate whose congressman resigned after a scandal involving lewd online behavior. The district he will represent, New York's Ninth, was widely expected to be eliminated next year; Mr. Turner's election is forcing state lawmakers to rethink redistricting plans, and he says that, however they redraw the political map, he plans to fight to remain in Congress.
''People have said the district will disappear,'' he told reporters on Wednesday during a news conference at the Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers in Manhattan. He added, ''I will be ready to take the fight into '12, no matter what the district is called, and I just don't know who the opponent will be.''
On Wednesday morning, Mr. Turner seemed as surprised as anyone that he had woken up as a congressman-elect: asked what he would do first, he paused for a moment. ''Let me think about that a little more,'' he said. ''That question has been asked a number of times, and I want to make sure I keep answering the same thing.'' Then he ducked back into his house.
By evening, Mr. Turner had a ready answer. He called himself ''just a practical businessman outraged enough to step forward,'' pledged to work with Democrats and independents as well as Republicans, and said he would devote himself to finding answers to the questions he heard from his neighbors: ''What are we doing to get the stalled economy going? How are we going to find jobs for people?''
Mr. Turner's decisive victory, in a Brooklyn and Queens district that has three registered Democrats for every Republican, mesmerized the political establishment. There had been only one Republican in the city's Congressional delegation, and to win election Mr. Turner had to persuade many Democrats to vote for him as an expression of their frustration with President Obama.
State Senator Martin J. Golden, a Brooklyn Republican, recalled with some amazement encountering a steady stream of Turner supporters in neighborhoods that have long been Democratic strongholds.
''When people start putting their hand on the Republican lever, it used to shake,'' Mr. Golden said. ''I give Bob Turner a lot of credit.''
Voters in the election cited unhappiness with Mr. Obama over the state of the national economy, as well as over the president's handling of Israel, which is a particularly sensitive issue in parts of the district with high concentrations of Orthodox Jews. But there were other factors, too, including what many analysts concluded was the weakness of the Democratic nominee, Assemblyman David I. Weprin.
But Mr. Turner, of all people, came to Mr. Weprin's defense on Wednesday, twice saying it was unfair to blame the Democratic candidate for his defeat. Mr. Turner called Mr. Weprin ''an able, proven politician,'' but said Mr. Weprin ''read the party script as directed.''
''And he went down to defeat because of it, and they are blaming their messenger,'' Mr. Turner said. ''That's not the case.''
Democrats in Washington and New York insisted that Mr. Turner's victory should not be seen as a bellwether. The White House press secretary, Jay Carney, told reporters that special elections ''are often unique, and their outcomes do not tell you very much about future regularly scheduled elections.''
''If you're asking me, are Americans in general anxious, not happy with Washington, the answer is yes,'' Mr. Carney added. ''And I would say, as we've said, that every elected member of Congress -- elected official, rather, who is up for election in 14 months needs to take that mood very seriously. And the president certainly does.''
The chairman of the state Democratic Party, Jay Jacobs, called Mr. Turner's election ''a disappointment, but not a permanent setback.''
And Representative Charles B. Rangel, a Democrat and the longest-serving member of the New York Congressional delegation, when asked the election's significance, said he did not know the answer, ''but I do know we'll probably never have the chance to have this certain scenario again.''
But Republicans insisted that the election was a portent of greater change to come in the presidential and Congressional elections next year. New York's top elected Republican, Dean G. Skelos, the State Senate majority leader, argued that Mr. Turner's election was ''a clear message that New Yorkers are tired, angry and frustrated by Democrats.''
National Republican leaders, some of whom were in New York for the state party dinner on Wednesday night, were clearly not only elated by, but also still marveling at, their party's victory in a city known for its liberal politics.
''If it's tough winning in that district as a Democrat, the district of the United States of America is going to be pretty tough for Barack Obama,'' said Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman.
And Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi, the keynote speaker at the New York dinner, said, ''We don't know yet whether Bob's victory is a statement or whether it's a watershed.''
But, Mr. Barbour said: ''This was an absolute total repudiation by New York City's voters of the policies of the Obama administration. Period.''
In Mr. Turner's beach neighborhood on Wednesday, his supporters praised him as a ''regular guy,'' a businessman, and not a politician.
''Guy comes out of retirement, he doesn't have to do it, he's just fed up with the whole situation,'' John Morris, 66, said.
About 8:30 in the morning, John Matthis, 70, rode a bike up to the house and stuck a ''Bob Turner for Congress'' sign in the yard. On a piece of brown paper taped onto the sign was written in capital letters: ''We won!''

HEADLINE: Seeing Ripple In Jewish Vote

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Not since Jimmy Carter in 1980 has a Democrat running for president failed to win a lopsided majority of the Jewish vote. This has been true during times of peace or war, and even when there has been deep acrimony between the White House and the Israeli government.
Republicans see a chance to change that in 2012, with President Obama locked in a tense relationship with Israel's leaders and criticized by many American Jews as being too tough on a close and favored ally. Tuesday's Republican upset in New York's Congressional election, they say, is a sign of bad things to come for Mr. Obama.
Sensing trouble, the Obama campaign and Democratic Party leaders have mobilized to solidify the president's standing with Jewish voters. The Democratic National Committee has established a Jewish outreach program. The campaign is singling out Jewish groups, donors and other supporters with calls and e-mails to counter the Republican narrative that Mr. Obama is hostile to Israel. 
Among those efforts is a multi-page set of talking points circulated last Friday with the title, ''President Obama's Stance on Israel: Myths vs. Facts.'' David Axelrod, a close Obama adviser, has sent e-mails to Jewish voters, pointing them to a speech by the Israeli defense minister, Ehud Barak, praising Mr. Obama and saying he had deepened the military cooperation between the United States and Israel.
And the White House is drawing attention to recent expressions of gratitude from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israelis after Mr. Obama intervened last Friday to help prevent violence after a mob attacked the Israeli Embassy in Cairo, threatening the Israeli diplomats inside.
It was a rare thaw in the relationship between the men. At times since the midterm elections, Mr. Netanyahu has appeared to put more energy into cultivating the new Republican majority in the House than into his relations with the president.
''We just have a lot of people lying about the president's record, and we have to push back on it,'' said Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, who is chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. ''The president has a rock-solid record on Israel, and because we're going to convey that in a detailed way, we're going to get an overwhelming majority again.''
She took part in one such ''validation'' exercise recently in Miami when she appeared before reporters with Israel's deputy foreign minister, Danny Ayalon, and stood aside while he lavished praise on Mr. Obama.
Like other Democrats, Ms. Wasserman Schultz played down the broader implications of the upset in New York, arguing that the district's Orthodox and Russian-Jewish population makes it more conservative than other Jewish areas. She pointed to polls showing that a majority of Jews still support Mr. Obama and that their level of approval for his performance largely tracks that of the broader electorate.
Still, American Jews are clearly less enchanted with Mr. Obama than they were in 2008, when nearly 8 out of 10 voted for him (in a Gallup poll last July, the most recent month for which data was available, his approval rating was 60 percent). Jewish lawmakers have been warning the White House that this disaffection could hurt the president in turnout, fund-raising and enthusiasm.
''For a while now, I've been hearing from my constituents a lot of dissatisfaction with the statements on Israel that have been coming from the president and the administration,'' said Representative Eliot L. Engel, Democrat of New York. ''He'll still get a majority of Jewish votes, but I would not be surprised to see that drop 10 to 20 points.''
The nub of the problem, Mr. Engel said, is that Mr. Obama tends to blame Israel and the Palestinians equally for the impasse in the Middle East -- an equivalence many Jewish voters find objectionable. He said this visceral reaction prevented Jews from giving the president credit for the positive aspects of his policy.
Republican groups are determined to make Israel a wedge issue. In recent days, billboards went up around New York City showing Mr. Obama smiling and shaking hands with the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, and declaring that the president is ''Not Pro-Israel.''
''Not a day passes when I don't see a string of e-mails on my BlackBerry from people I don't know or groups I've never heard of, just pounding away that this president is not a friend of Israel, and worse,'' said David Harris, the executive director of the American Jewish Committee, a nonpartisan organization. ''I can't measure the impact of that beating of the drums, but the pace is incessant.''
In New York's Ninth Congressional District, which was put into play after Anthony D. Weiner's texting scandal forced him to resign, the Republican Jewish Coalition sent mailings to voters that put a spotlight on Israel.
One postcard quoted former Mayor Edward I. Koch, who endorsed the Republican candidate, Bob Turner, as saying that if voters in Brooklyn and Queens turned against the Democratic favorite, David I. Weprin, ''it might very well cause President Obama to change his hostile position on the State of Israel and to re-establish the special relationship that presidents before him had supported.''
The Republican Jewish Coalition said it planned to use the same tactics in other districts with substantial numbers of Jewish voters in 2012. ''It's very easy to extrapolate to the 2012 election and say Obama is going to have trouble with Jewish voters in battleground states like Ohio, Florida, and Pennsylvania,'' said Matt Brooks, executive director of the coalition.
Prominent Democratic Jewish politicians disagree. ''It is not a bellwether district,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. ''I don't think there's another district like that in America.''
While Israel emerged as a hot-button issue late in the campaign, a poll by Siena College in early September showed that other issues, like the economy and Social Security and Medicare, were viewed as much more important, even by Jewish voters. With the Republican Party swinging further to the right, analysts said, it will have trouble appealing to more liberal-minded Jewish voters on these issues.
''The notion that this is a single-issue constituency, and that these people don't vote on the economy and jobs and other issues is just misplaced,'' said Jeremy Ben-Ami, executive director of J Street, a liberal group. ''That perception is based on a handful of loud and effective advocates.''
As Steve Rabinowitz, a former Clinton White House official who advises Jewish groups, puts it, ''Jews vote like everybody else -- only more so.''

HEADLINE: In Rebuke to Iran's President, Courts Void Release of Hikers

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK; Alan Cowell contributed reporting from London, and Artin Afkhami from Boston.

 BODY:
CAIRO -- To pave the way for his annual visit to the United Nations, Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, announced with great fanfare this week the imminent release of two American hikers sentenced to eight years for espionage.
Not 24 hours later, Iran's courts issued a stinging public rebuke: they said he did not have the authority to free the prisoners.
The fate of the two American hikers remains uncertain, since the courts said they would review the defendants' application for bail. But the back and forth has delivered a blow to Mr. Ahmadinejad's already diminished standing at home, allowing his adversaries within Iran's system to undercut his credibility as he prepared to mingle with the heads of state and to court international news media at the General Assembly gathering next week.
''The conservatives are trying to establish the fact that Ahmadinejad is not their boss,'' said Vali Nasr, a professor at Tufts University and an expert in Iranian affairs. ''He is a weakened president, and they are perfectly comfortable embarrassing him. It is a signal that it is perfectly O.K. to attack him, and you might get brownie points for doing it.'' 
The very public rebuke by Iran's conservative establishment was the latest reminder of Mr. Ahmadinejad's deep split with the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, once his most ardent ally.
What was intended as a grand humanitarian gesture to win diplomatic capital instead was reminiscent of one of his low points on the world stage: when in 2009 he initially supported a nuclear deal with the United States, France and Russia that would have calmed tensions with the West, only to see the deal rejected by Ayatollah Khamenei and other conservatives at home.
''Ahmadinejad is still trying to carve out a space for himself, but Khamenei does not want this to happen,'' said Rasool Nafisi, an Iran expert based in Virginia.
Handpicked by the supreme leader, Mr. Ahmadinejad has run afoul of his most important patron by challenging the authority of the clergy and trying to recast the presidency into a more powerful post that could operate independently of -- and in some cases in contradiction to -- the supreme leader.
That conflict burst into public view in April in a battle over control of the Intelligence Ministry, a battle the president lost. It re-emerged this week, first when conservatives accused a financier close to Mr. Ahmadinejad along with his right-hand man, Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, of perpetrating a record $2.6 billion bank fraud, the largest in Iran's contemporary history.
Mr. Ahmadinejad had groomed Mr. Mashaei to succeed him as president in 2013, until the internal battle with Ayatollah Khamenei led to the arrests of several of their associates and eliminated talk of such a succession.
On Wednesday, Mr. Ahmadinejad said he had asked the chief of the judiciary, Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani -- the same powerful conservative who squashed the prisoners' release -- for an ''honest'' investigation of the bank fraud.
''Whoever they are -- whether in the government, judiciary or Parliament, or those with sacred attire -- capture them, try them, punish them and expose them to the people,'' Mr. Ahmadinejad urged, referring to the clerical establishment and the branches of government it most influences.
''The cabinet is a red line,'' he added, ''and if they want to touch the cabinet, then defending it is my duty.''
But, in an extraordinary departure, Iranian state television-- also controlled by the conservatives -- did not broadcast the speech. It was shown only on the Web site of the Iranian presidency, though state news agencies covered it.
Mr. Ahmadinejad always represented a very different style and a different constituency from Iran's clerical and commercial elites.
The son of a blacksmith who rose to power through military service, he mingled with clerics made rich by the Iranian revolution whose scholarly pedigrees sometimes go back for generations. He rattled the conservatives around Ayatollah Khamenei with his messianic rhetoric and presumptions of religious authority, redistributive economic policies and an appetite to expand his own power at the expense of the clerics.
Mr. Ahmadinejad, who had been mayor of Tehran, was seen as Ayatollah Khamenei's preferred candidate when he first won election in 2005, defeating the former president, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. In 2009, Ayatollah Khamenei backed Mr. Ahmadinejad when large protests broke out challenging the validity of his re-election. The leader, stepping out from his role as arbiter, instead backed a harsh crackdown against the liberal ''green'' protest movement.
With the reform movement effectively crushed, Mr. Ahmadinejad set about trying to establish his own authority.
But in the Iranian system, the supreme leader has final say over all matters of religion and state, and has control over the most delicate issues, like the nuclear file. Mr. Ahmadinejad's efforts to expand the president's authority hit a wall in April, when he sought to remove the supreme leaders' appointee running the powerful Intelligence Ministry.
The ayatollah blocked Mr. Ahmadinejad's effort, and the president withdrew from public life for about 10 days in a protest that critics likened to a tantrum.
Iran analysts said that Mr. Ahmadinejad might have hoped a high-profile performance in New York would bolster his fortunes back home. But with his stature diminished, it is less likely, they said, that he will be able to make any diplomatic breakthrough while in New York.
He has always relished his turns in the international spotlight, and he has often made expansive humanitarian gestures just before foreign trips to help burnish his image.
Before the United Nations General Assembly meeting in September 2010, Mr. Ahmadinejad oversaw the release of a third American hiker, Sarah E. Shourd, who was arrested with the other two near northern Iraq's border with Iran in July 2009. She was released on $500,000 bail, which many critics said amounted to a ransom.
Her two companions, Shane M. Bauer and Joshua F. Fattal, both 29, were recently sentenced to eight years in prison after being convicted of espionage. All three said they had inadvertently strayed into Iran.
Iran has never presented evidence that any of the three engaged in espionage. They were in the Middle East studying or traveling at the time of their arrest.
On Tuesday, the president personally announced in an interview on NBC's ''Today Show'' that Iran would soon release Mr. Bauer and Mr. Fattal But within a day the Iranian state news media reported that the plum of their release was not Mr. Ahmadinejad's to give away.
''Iran's judiciary has refuted recent media reports on the imminent release of two American nationals that were convicted of committing espionage,'' declared the English-language satellite broadcaster Press TV.
''The two Americans are going to stay in prison for a bit longer,'' a judiciary official said in the report. ''Reports of their imminent release are wrong.''
Before the judiciary interceded, the two prisoners' families issued a statement welcoming their release. ''Shane and Josh's freedom means more to us than anything,'' the families said. ''We hope to say more when they are finally back in our arms.''

HEADLINE: Israel and New York's Ninth District: No political win, or loss, here alters the fact that a peace deal is in Israel's best interest

 BODY:
There has already been a lot of theorizing about why a little-known Republican businessman, Bob Turner, won Tuesday's special Congressional election in a traditionally Democratic New York City district. The grim economy appears to have been a big factor in his victory over Assemblyman David Weprin, and some voters also complained about Mr. Weprin's principled vote in Albany to legalize gay marriage, which was anathema to many ultra-Orthodox Jewish voters.
Some analysts -- and eager Republican critics -- are also claiming it was a repudiation of President Obama's policies toward Israel. On Wednesday, an article on the Web site of the Israeli newspaper Haaretz said that ''in politics it is the perception that counts,'' and that the Democratic loss ''will be portrayed, as the outspoken former Mayor Ed Koch put it, 'as a message to President Obama that he cannot throw Israel under a bus with impunity.' '' 
Mr. Obama has done nothing of the sort; his support for Israel has never wavered. But we fear that Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, will read the election as yet another reason to ignore the president's advice and refuse to make any compromises with the Palestinians, no matter how essential for Israel's own security.
Mr. Koch played a cynical game in urging special-election voters to choose the Republican as a rebuke to Mr. Obama for saying that Israel's pre-1967 borders -- with mutually agreed land swaps -- should be the basis of any peace agreement. That has been the basis of every deal sought by American presidents for more than a decade. Mr. Netanyahu now hints that he, too, accepts it.
Mr. Obama has not handled the Israeli-Palestinian issue adroitly. Palestinians certainly waited too long to begin negotiations, and Arab leaders failed to offer initiatives that might give Israel confidence that a serious deal was possible. But Mr. Netanyahu has been the most intractable, building settlements and blaming his inability to be more forthcoming on his conservative coalition. Egged on by Congressional Republicans, he has sought to embarrass Mr. Obama -- astonishing behavior for so close an ally that does not serve his own country's interest.
Mr. Obama has repeatedly affirmed support for Israel and backed it up with action. He has had far more success than President George W. Bush in rallying tough sanctions on Iran. Security cooperation is strong, including accelerated development and funding for an Israeli missile defense system. The administration pressured Egypt last weekend to protect Israel's diplomats in Cairo, and it negotiated an agreement to ease tensions with Turkey over the Gaza aid flotilla, until Israel pulled out of the deal.
Now, Mr. Obama is risking American ties with a fast-changing Arab world by vowing to veto the Palestinians' statehood bid at the United Nations. The president supports a two-state solution but rightly believes that can be achieved only through negotiations.
His diplomats are working with allies to persuade the Palestinians that a United Nations vote would be costly for them too, once the euphoria fades in the West Bank and it is clear that little has changed. They are hoping to restart negotiations by defining the main elements of an agreement that guarantees Israel's security and provides the Palestinians with a viable state. They should put a map and a timeline on the table and demand that both sides join in.
Mr. Netanyahu should be worried that his country is more isolated now than when he took office. That isolation will deepen so long as negotiations remain stalemated. No vote in New York City makes that any less true -- or any less dangerous for Israel.

HEADLINE: Vows of Support, and Persistent Anxiety: Leaders of Germany and France Reiterate Their Commitment to Greece

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER and NICHOLAS KULISH; Nicholas Kulish reported from Berlin. Additional reporting was contributed by Liz Alderman in Paris, Stephen Castle in Brussels, Androniki Kitsantonis in Athens and Landon Thomas Jr. in London.

 BODY:
PARIS -- The Greek prime minister vowed Wednesday to persevere with austere cuts in the struggling country's budget, while the leaders of France and Germany promised to support Greece's continued membership in the euro zone.
That was the stay-the-course upshot of a conference call Wednesday evening in Europe by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany with the Greek prime minister, George Papandreou.
With no new proposals issued, the conversation seemed mainly intended to send a message that Europe's two richest countries do not intend to let Greece's debt crisis spiral out of control.
The conversation came at the end of a day in which European stock markets took a breather from the recent spate of crisis-induced sell-offs, even shrugging off the credit-rating downgrade of two big French banks. 
Stocks closed higher in the United States, too, as the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, voiced confidence in Europe's ability to ''hold this thing together,'' but indicated it was the Europeans' problem to solve.
Mr. Sarkozy and Mrs. Merkel told Mr. Papandreou that he must meet deficit-cutting promises to the European Union and the International Monetary Fund in return for subsidized loans and a second bailout, according to the French and German governments. Mr. Papandreou, in turn, briefed them about Greek cabinet decisions on further state job cuts and other economic reforms, Greek officials said.
France and Germany also promised full support for Greece and for preserving the euro zone.
The French and Germans are pushing all euro zone states to rapidly ratify an agreement reached on July 21 to expand the bailout program known as the European Financial Stability Facility to 440 billion euros ($601 billion) and give it greater flexibility to protect Greece and other heavily indebted members as they work to stabilize their finances.
A Greek government spokesman, Ilias Mossialos, said that Germany and France had expressed confidence that new austerity measures announced by the Greek government over the weekend -- chiefly a new property tax -- would ensure that Athens meets deficit reduction goals set by foreign creditors, while securing a sixth installment of emergency funds on which its solvency depends.
Before the call, a French government spokeswoman, Valerie Pecresse, emphasized that France was determined ''to do everything in order to save Greece.''
But France and Germany are also determined to save their own banks, which are heavily exposed to Greek debt. And analysts say the banks have not fully written down that exposure to a realistic level, given wide expectations that the Greek debt would need to be restructured yet again, forcing its creditors to absorb further losses.
France suffered a minor blow on Wednesday as two of its biggest banks, Societe Generale and Credit Agricole, were each downgraded a notch by Moody's Investors Service -- a move expected, but not as severe as some had predicted. Moody's kept a third bank, BNP Paribas, under review, but said its profitability and capital base provided an adequate cushion to support its exposure to Greek, Portuguese and Irish debt.
French officials insisted that the banks were strong, and implied that Paris would do whatever was necessary to recapitalize them if necessary to cover any Greek losses.
Mr. Geithner also sought to soothe nerves over a possible Greek default in a CNBC interview Wednesday morning. Mr. Geithner, who plans to attend an informal meeting of European finance ministers on Friday in Poland, said ''there is no chance that the major countries of Europe will let their institutions be at risk in the eyes of the market.''
But he added: ''They recognize that they have been behind the curve. They recognize that it will take more force behind their commitments.''
Mr. Geithner was not specific about what needed to be done, but said the United States was concerned ''because it adds to a lack of confidence.'' But ultimately, he said, ''this is their challenge.''
The slow speed of Europe, where every country must approve any significant move, leads to market frustration and opportunities to profit on panic. The expanded bailout agreed to in principle on July 21 might have made a larger difference had it gone into effect immediately. Even if ratified, though, it was unlikely to be put in place before mid-October.
Greece, in recession after two years of austerity, needs an 8 billion euro ($11 billion) tranche of aid in October to pay government-owed wages and pensions. France and Germany are using that need as leverage to exact more cuts from Athens.
Clemens Fuest, a professor of public finance at Oxford and a member of the German Finance Ministry's independent panel of academic advisers, said Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy were in a far more difficult position than might be acknowledged by critics who push them to take further action.
''If they took bold steps to help the highly indebted countries, those countries would make less of an effort to put their own houses in order,'' Professor Fuest said.
''It's very difficult to come up with a really convincing strategy,'' he said. ''The job they are doing is not as bad as most people think. The policy choices out there are not very nice.''
And Mrs. Merkel, at home, must contend with critics insisting that Germany be even less involved in sorting out the financial messes of Greece and other weak euro zone members. Infighting in the German government grew worse on Wednesday.
A Merkel cabinet member, the transport minister Peter Ramsauer, told the weekly Die Zeit that it would ''not be the end of the world'' if Greece left the euro zone.
A leader of the opposition Green Party, Cem Ozdemir, said that Mrs. Merkel must ''make clear who is governing in Berlin,'' and that if she could not control her government she should call for new elections.
The European Union, meanwhile, is riven by divisions within its own institutions. That includes a rivalry between the European Council of nation states, run by President Herman Van Rompuy, and the European Commission, the permanent bureaucracy, run by President Jose Manuel Barroso.
The lengthy euro crisis has sidelined Mr. Barroso, who created something of a fuss on Wednesday by saying he was close to proposing joint euro bonds -- unified debt instruments that would be backed by all the member states of the euro zone. Market players like the idea, because such bonds would put the full backing of the stronger states behind all the debts of the weaker and more profligate nations.
But Germany, the Netherlands and France oppose the idea of euro bonds unless there is more economic coordination and harmony among member states. Otherwise, they argue, their own creditworthiness would be used to support spendthrift states before they get their finances in order.
Mrs. Merkel's own coalition partner, the Free Democrats, also opposes euro bonds. There is also a serious question whether they would even be constitutional in Germany.
The edgy mood in Europe was not helped by comments from the Polish finance minister, Jacek Rostowski, who told the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, that ''Europe is in danger'' and that ''if the euro zone breaks up, the European Union will not be able to survive'' -- a view expressed by Mr. Van Rompuy many months ago.
Mr. Barroso, whose native country, Portugal, was forced to seek European Union and I.M.F. aid, said that ''this is a fight for the economic and political future of Europe -- this is a fight for European integration itself.''

HEADLINE: Does the New Normal Include Private Unemployment Insurance?

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: IncomeAssure offers private unemployment insurance to supplement state benefits.

 BODY:
With unemployment hovering around 9 percent, many Americans are relying on government unemployment benefits to make ends meet. Now, a new, private option is available that can help replace, at least temporarily, more of the income forfeited when you lose your job.
IncomeAssure is a supplemental unemployment insurance policy that, when combined with public unemployment insurance, can help temporarily replace up to half of your lost wages. Leslie Nylund, chief executive of the Assura Group of NY Ltd., which introduced the offering this summer, says she believes her firm is the only company currently offering such coverage.
The main barrier to such offerings before has been overcoming the problem of adverse selection, an industry term referring to the propensity of people who most need a certain type of insurance to buy a lot of it, concentrating risk and making it difficult to offer coverage profitably.
Ron Lieber wrote about this problem with private unemployment insurance in a 2009 column.
But Ms. Nylund says the Assura Group thinks it has a workable formula, which includes a hefty waiting period (six months) before initial coverage begins, to avoid a rush to buy policies when a big layoff occurs or seems imminent, and a link of the private insurance to public jobless benefits. With high unemployment looking like a long-term feature of the economy, she says, supplemental insurance should be an attractive offering.
Public unemployment insurance, Ms. Nylund says, initially was meant to replace half of one's income, on a weekly or monthly basis. But since most states have imposed dollar caps on benefits they pay out - $400 or so a week is the typical maximum - benefits don't stretch that far for workers earning upwards of about, say, $50,000. So, IncomeAssure aims to sell insurance coverage to make up that difference.
The premiums for the coverage, which are based on the state where you work, your salary, and the industry in which you work, as well as unemployment statistics, range from 0.5 to 2 percent of your wages.
So, for instance, if you earn $100,000 working in manufacturing in Ohio, your premium would be about $130 a month. If you lost your job, you would receive $1,677 per month in state unemployment benefits. Using that as a base, IncomeAssure would pay $2,500 a month, bringing your monthly total to $4,177 a month. That's the monthly equivalent of $50,000 a year - half of your former annual pay.
But it's important to realize that the payments don't continue for a year; rather, they track state unemployment benefits, which typically run for 26 weeks. IncomeAssure payouts are triggered by the initiation of state unemployment benefits, so you must first file and receive approval for your state jobless claim before payments from IncomeAssure begin. There is then a two-week delay before payments begin, and they continue for a maximum of 24 weeks. While the federal government has funded the extension of public unemployment benefits beyond 26 weeks as a result of the sluggish economy, IncomeAssure payments stop after six months.
So, in the above example, you'd be paying about $1,560 a year to receive a maximum payout of just over $15,000.
Ms. Nylund notes that the current unemployment rate also is factored into the premiums, so they would very likely drop as unemployment falls (or, increase as unemployment rises).
The Web site offers a form that can give you a quick estimate, but it has a few glitches to iron out. I typed in a request for a hypothetical poultry industry executive in Georgia (using the "agricultural" classification) earning $80,000 a year, and it told me the estimated payout - $1,903 a month, on top of the state benefit of $1,430 - but not the premium. However, I was able to get that information quickly from "Katie" using the site's online chat function.
Katie told me the premium would be $107.28 per month, or $1,287 for a year, which could be paid monthly or quarterly. But if it were paid in a lump sum, it would be eligible for a discount of almost 9 percent, which would reduce the annual premium by $115.
That doesn't sound too bad, but there are some caveats. First, if you've already lost your job, you're out of luck; you have to be employed to buy the insurance in the first place, and then you have to wait six months to become eligible to collect. (If you buy a policy and are laid off two months later, the company refunds your premiums, Ms. Nylund said.)
The coverage is available for salaries up to $250,000. If you make more than that, you can buy coverage, but only up to that amount.
The policy is renewable every 12 months. The only likely reason the company wouldn't renew, Ms. Nylund said, would be if the worker changed jobs and became employed in a state where the Assura Group isn't authorized to sell insurance. IncomeAssure, which is underwritten by the Great American Insurance Company of Cincinnati, currently is available in 34 states and the District of Columbia, and is pending approval in additional states.
Policy holders can, of course, choose not to renew - if, for example, the premium offered rises and they decide they don't want to pay it, or if they think their employment has become more stable.
But Ms. Nylund is betting that people will hold onto coverage even if economic conditions improve, for peace of mind. The extra payments can help avoid depleting savings and cover monthly expenses, she says, while job seekers regroup and search for a position that's a good fit. "This is something you should buy for a good night's sleep," Ms. Nylund said.
Do you think buying additional unemployment insurance is worth it?

HEADLINE: Where All Work Is Created Equal

BYLINE: TINA ROSENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: In this time of high unemployment, time banks, which let people exchange skills and services, are more valuable than ever.

 BODY:
School went badly last year for Jose, Angel and Estefani. The 8-year-old twins and their 7-year-old sister are recent immigrants to the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan. In part because they didn't speak much English, late in 2010 all three were notified they were in danger of failing.
But their fortunes changed in January. They began going to the Fort Washington Library every Saturday for two hours of one-on-one tutoring from Elayne Castillo-Velez, her sister, Sharon Castillo, and their grandmother, Saturnina Gutierrez. The children had lost confidence and didn't feel that more hours spent with school books would produce anything, said Castillo-Velez. "There were times when all they wanted to do was talk about their week," she said.

"But once we started working one-on-one it triggered something in them," she said. "They were enthusiastic." Castillo-Velez would ask Jose's teacher what he should work on, and the teacher would write back - work on vowel sounds, or subtraction strategies. The children began to take books out of the library every week. Their grades improved. When June came, they all passed, and won certificates for academic improvement and achievement.
The two families met because of a bank - a time bank, where the unit of currency is not a dollar, but an hour. When you join a time bank, you indicate what services you might be able to offer others: financial planning, computer de-bugging, handyman repairs, housecleaning, child care, clothing alterations, cooking, taking someone to a doctor's appointment on the bus, visiting the homebound or English conversation. People teach Mandarin and yoga and sushi-making. Castillo-Velez earns a credit for each hour she spends tutoring Jose. She spends the credits on art classes.
Time banks - more than 300 of them - exist in 23 countries. The largest one in New York City is the Visiting Nurse Service of New York Community Connections TimeBank.
It has more than 2000 members and is most active in three places - Upper Manhattan (Washington Heights and Inwood) Lower Manhattan (Battery Park City, Chinatown and the Lower East Side) and parts of Brooklyn (Sunset Park and Bay Ridge). Members come from all over New York City, but exchanges are easiest when people live in the same neighborhood - like Castillo-Velez and Jose.
There is something old fashioned about a time bank. Home repair, child care, visiting shut-ins and taking someone to the doctor are now often commercial transactions; a time bank is a return to an era where neighbors did these tasks for each other. But a time bank is also something radical. It throws out the logic of the market - in a time bank, all work has equal value. A 90-year-old can contribute on an equal basis with a 30 year old. Accompanying someone to the doctor is as valuable as Web design.
The idea comes from Edgar Cahn, a legendary anti-poverty activist. (Cahn and his late wife, Jean Camper Cahn, established the Antioch School of Law to train advocates for the poor, and were instrumental in founding the federal Legal Services Corporation.) In his book "No More Useless People," Cahn writes that time banks were a response to cuts in social programs during the Reagan years. Cahn wrote: "If we can't have more of that kind of money, why can't we create a new kind of money to put people and problems together?"
Time banks also owe much of their development to Ana Miyares, who in the 1980s gave up a lucrative position in international banking to join the time bank movement in its infancy. She has founded time banks in various countries, and today is the manager of the Visiting Nurse Service's time bank. Miyares sees time banking a little differently than Cahn does. "I would like to see social justice - but in a different way, using social capital, energizing social capital to be responsible citizens," she said.
The value of a time bank during a time of high unemployment is obvious. It is a way for underemployed people to put their skills to work to get things they need. (During the Great Depression, a group of men living in a Hooverville of unlaid sewer pipe in California began a barter exchange that eventually had 100,000 members.) Forty percent of the members of the Visiting Nurse Service's time bank, for example, have an annual income of less than $9,800. Many time banks have a large percentage of members who are older and living on a fixed income. "The difference it makes to have a handyman come out and do a repair for the cost of materials could be the difference between being able to purchase medicine or not," said Barbara Huston, the president and chief executive of Partners in Care, a time bank based near Baltimore. "Getting a ride to the doctor and saving $30 to $50 in transport costs might mean being able to buy all their vegetables."
But a time bank it is more than a barter Craigslist. Mashi Blech, the director of the Visiting Nurse Service time bank, said that only 10 percent of members bother to consistently record the hours they put in. In what industry would 90 percent of wage workers not care about recording their hours?
Castillo-Velez, for one, doesn't always record hers. She knows the Fort Washington Library well, because she used to go there as a child. Her grandmother is an avid reader in Spanish, and Castillo-Velez inherited her love of books. Now a graduate of Stony Brook University, Castillo-Velez tutors Jose because she remembers her own journey. "I know how it is to have to learn another language and have no one really there. I also overcame my shyness - sitting in class without speaking up. I saw myself in them," she said.
Several TimeBank members told me that activities gradually cease being services performed and become instead hours with friends. When Regina Gradess was 56, for example, she met Doris Feldman, who was 80. She began to drive Feldman places in her car. Technically, Gradess was providing companionship to an elderly woman. But that's not what it felt like. "I would take her to the duck pond, or a unique thrift shop, or libraries," she said. "We'd ride the bus to a museum and talk about all the architecture we saw. Every time I was with her we had tons of things to talk about. It was wonderful for me and wonderful for her." They saw each other at least every other week. When Feldman died in July at the age of 84, Gradess said she felt like she had lost her soul mate.
A time bank is a way to make a small town out of a big city - something especially important for retired people, who might go for days without human contact. The Visiting Nurse Service TimeBank has group gatherings - birthday parties, potlucks, trips - in addition to the work exchanges. A survey of members over 60 years old in 2009 found that 90 percent had made new friends, 71 percent saw those friends at least once a week, and 42 percent saw their TimeBank friends a few times a week. By overwhelming margins, the members reported that they felt more a part of a community, and their trust of others had increased - especially of other people who were different from them. The vast majority of pairings in the TimeBank bring together very different people - in ethnicity, income level, or especially, age; in Castillo-Velez's family, her grandmother, mother, aunt, sister, brother, husband and sister-in-law also are active in the TimeBank. Many pairings also cross language barriers. Members speak 29 different languages, and for just under half the members, English is not one of them.
Despite its size - or perhaps because of it - New York City offers people many different groups to join and many different ways to make friends. What makes a time bank different is that the purpose of the connection is ostensibly to give help - something that makes a lot of people more comfortable and confident. "I'm a shy person and I have a problem with receiving," said Gradess. Even if you happen to be the one receiving services in any particular transaction, you know you will be giving help to someone else.
Blech tells a story from an earlier time bank experience about Betty, a member in her 70s who suffered from several serious medical conditions and had been the caregiver for her mother for 15 years. When Betty's mother died, "people were thinking now she'll be less stressed," said Blech. "I was concerned that she'd be depressed - she was losing her role in life."
Blech called one afternoon two weeks after the mother's death and found Betty very depressed. "Later, I found out that she had barely gotten out of bed in two weeks, and that the bottle of antidepressants she was prescribed was still sitting on her table, unopened," she said.
They talked for a while, and then Blech said, "I need you." Betty was a skilled crocheter. "I was going to an international conference and needed a baby gift," Blech said. Would Betty make a baby blanket?
"I don't think I'm up for that," Betty said. Blech asked her to think about it.
Five minutes later Blech's phone rang. "Should it have a hood?" said Betty. "How about a matching crocheted hippo or dog?"
Blech invited her to the next time bank gathering to show off her crocheting. She left with 10 orders.
This is a story many of us can relate to. People like to cook for others, to make things for others, to teach what they know, to use their skills to do a job for someone who needs it. People need to feel valued.
On Wednesday I'll respond to comments and explain one of the mysteries of time banks - why does the Visiting Nurse Service run one? Why do so many hospitals? Being with and giving to others, it turns out, are good for your health.

HEADLINE: Design Unveiled for New Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive

BYLINE: ROBIN POGREBIN


HIGHLIGHT: The University of California Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive presented the schematic design for the transformation of a former printing plant into its new home.

 BODY:
The University of California Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive on Wednesday presented to the public the schematic design for the transformation of a former printing plant into its new home, designed by the New York firm Diller Scofidio + Renfro. 
Located at 2120 Oxford Street in Berkeley's arts district, the $100 million project is due to be completed in late 2015; $65 million has been raised so far. The design combines the existing 1939 concrete Art Deco-style building, unoccupied since 2004, with a new metal-clad, skylighted structure that will include galleries, a 32-seat screening room, a store and a learning center.
"They have managed with great dexterity and ingenuity to accommodate the limitations and opportunities of the site and the constraints of the budget in concert with our programmatic requirements to create a facility that I think will be really a surprising and beautiful and highly functional addition to the Bay Area cultural scene," said the museum's director, Lawrence Rinder, in an interview.
The museum began planning for a new home in 1997, when an engineering survey determined that its current building, on Bancroft Way, does not meet present-day seismic standards and cannot be upgraded to meet those standards without eliminating the open space required for the museum's exhibition program. After abandoning a 2006 design by Toyo Ito & Associates in 2009 due to the recession, the museum searched for a new firm.

HEADLINE: What Next for Greece and for Europe?

BYLINE: PETER BOONE and SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: Unless Greece and its allies acknowledge the breadth and depth of Greece's problems, there is little hope of resolving them, two economists write.

 BODY:
Uncertainty about potential loan losses in Europe continues to roil markets around the world. For many investors, taxpayers and ordinary people there is no clarity on the exact current situation - let alone a consensus on what could happen next.
The news on Wednesday was relatively good, but the situation remains precarious. 
What should any friends of Europe - the United States, the Group of 20, the International Monetary Fund, perhaps even China - strongly suggest the Europeans do?
A good start would involve being honest on four points. There is nothing pleasant about the truth in such crisis situations, but denial is increasingly dangerous to all involved.
Greece is on the front burner. Currently on offer is a debt swap for private-sector lenders that, once it goes through, will effectively guarantee 33 cents for every euro in bonds that they currently hold. That downside protection is attractive to banks - because they will get hard collateral in the restructured deal. (Greece would buy the bonds of safe European countries, like Germany, and hold them where creditors could get at them.)

The first brutal truth is that this is a default by Greece, and all attempts to deny this or use another word just muddy the waters.
Greece can probably afford to service debt restructured to this level - although that will depend also on the final terms of European Union and International Monetary Fund support. But the second truth is that this is a wasted opportunity for Greece, because it does not put Greece's debt problems behind it; most likely, it will be back to ask for further reductions in principal in the future. 
The ice has been broken: the European Union has agreed that a euro-zone member can default. Greece should now go all the way - aiming to end up with new bonds that have grace periods of three years on interest and 10 years on principal. 
The third truth - and the most difficult for many to stomach - is that in the context of any such deeper debt restructuring, the Greeks should cut public-sector wages across the board and bring down other spending to make Greece's budget deficit much smaller immediately. 
Greece and the monetary fund need to assume another recession in 2012 and no growth for five years. They should aim to balance Greece's primary budget on a cash basis in 2012 (since there would be no interest due, this would also mean they need no cash from any kind of lender). In this scenario, the new bonds could be collateralized with state property.
There is nothing particularly fair or just about this set of outcomes. Everyone in Greece is already hurt by the consequences of excessive spending, big deficits and reckless lending (to the government) in the past.
But what are the alternatives? If Greece adopts some version of this deeper debt-restructuring approach, it can stay in the euro zone and find its way back to growth (assuming the world economy does not go down again sharply). Its private sector will eventually rebound.
In contrast, if Greece were to leave the euro zone, its financial system would cease to operate; Greek banks depend to a great extent on support from the European Central Bank (for more background and the available numbers, see our recent Peterson Institute policy brief, "Europe on the Brink"). Do not try to run any modern economy on a purely cash basis; the further fall in gross domestic product would be enormous.
If Greece pays its debts at the currently proposed level (33 cents on the euro), it will struggle to grow. The tax revenue needed to service that debt would burden businesses and households for decades - enterprising and productive people will move their fortunes and their futures elsewhere in the euro area or to the United States.
The fourth and most dangerous truth is that Italy and Germany are not ready for the next stage of the euro crisis.
Any further adverse developments in Greece will precipitate a run on Italy - involving investors selling Italian government debt. The European Central Bank is currently prepared to buy Italian bonds, to keep interest rates below 6 percent.
The Germans are obviously very worried by this approach - hence the resignation last week of Jurgen Stark, the senior German representative in the European Central Bank management. He has been replaced by someone who is likely to take an even tougher line on bond buying.
Aside from the politics, the risk is that the euro loses credibility and falls steeply in value. The European Central Bank thinks it can "sterilize" any bond-buying by selling its own bonds into the market; this would mean no net increase in the supply of money (just fewer Italian bonds and more E.C.B. bonds held by the private sector).
As a technical matter and in the short term, the E.C.B. may be right. But the central bank is taking on a lot of credit risk. If a big country defaults, the bank would need to ask member governments to provide it with more capital, and this is the kind of transparent fiscal hit that politicians hate. 
And if E.C.B. financial support is truly unconditional, this just encourages countries to be less careful about their fiscal deficits. "Fiscal dominance" - meaning a central bank always buys up government bonds to keep interest rates down - is a recipe for big inflation.
Expect a great deal of shouting behind the scenes at the highest level in Frankfurt (where the European Central Bank has its headquarters) and in European capitals. Instability seems unavoidable. Significant inflation may follow, although first we will see serious recessions in the troubled European periphery, a ratcheting up of bond buying and repeated political crises.

HEADLINE: A War Against Food Waste

BYLINE: DYLAN WALSH


HIGHLIGHT: So food manufacturers are groping for strategies that will encourage donations to food banks and composting. (A substantial portion of food is thrown away while still fully edible because of cosmetic blemishes or overstocking.)

 BODY:
A food industry alliance is planning a three-year initiative to reduce the tremendous amount of food that Americans still throw in the garbage even as they grow somewhat more conscientious about recycling paper and yard trimmings.
The effort, announced by the Grocery Manufacturers Association, an alliance of food, beverage and packaging makers, aims both to reduce the amount of food sent to landfills and to increase donations to food banks for the poor. The effort is being carried out and financed in concert with the Food Marketing Institute.
A substantial portion of food is thrown away while still fully edible because of cosmetic blemishes or overstocking. The manufacturers association acknowledges that changing consumer habits will be a challenge. "This is not a problem that will be solved in three years," said Meghan Stasz, a sustainability consultant for the group.
According to the most recent available statistics, more than 30 million tons of food was dumped in landfills in 2009, making food by far the most abundant material there by weight, the federal Environmental Protection Agency says. (That calculation excludes industrial, construction and hazardous waste.) This amounts roughly to 200 pounds a year for every man, woman and child in the United States.

The environmental consequences are considerable. A 2009 article published in the journal PLos calculated that food that ends up getting tossed accounts for almost one-quarter of all freshwater use in the country. Additionally, rotting food in open landfills releases significant quantities of methane, a greenhouse gas with a warming potential that is 20 times greater than that of carbon dioxide.
The lack of progress in redirecting food waste from landfills has persisted as something of an anomaly over the last two decades. While overall recycling rates, including the composting of yard trimmings, has risen by 10 percent since 1990, the amount of food composted or redirected from landfills has decreased. Today, only 2 percent of food waste is composted or otherwise recycled; by contrast, 62 percent of paper is recycled.
The Grocery Manufacturers Association and the Food Marketing Institute convened a leadership committee in June whose co-chairmen hold sustainability positions at General Mills, one of the world's largest food processors, and Publix, the grocery store chain. Also represented on the committee are Feeding America, a nonprofit network of food banks, and Waste Management, a national waste removal company, among others.
The committee will first conduct a comprehensive survey of the sources and causes of food waste, "from food processing facility to fork," as Ms. Stasz put it. Then the initiative will identify public policies that could expand the diversion of food from landfills to food banks. Third, the committee will identify new technologies and industry practices that support the other goals.
One example already proposed is locating food processors, retailers and restaurants in close geographical proximity -- a move that would not only cut transport distances but also make compost services a more viable choice economically.
A 1997 study by the economic research arm of the Department of Agriculture figured that about 10 million people a year could be fed through the recovery of just one-fifth of food waste.
Currently 50 million households suffer from food insecurity, meaning that family members cannot always meet their basic food needs.

HEADLINE: Bike Sharing vs. Sidewalk Sharing

BYLINE: CLYDE HABERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Day: As a plan to increase bicycling progresses, here's a helpful reminder of the second syllable in "sidewalk." Also, what City Room is reading in other papers and blogs.

 BODY:
It is a conceit of New Yorkers that their city is a breeding ground for all manner of new ideas on making life in a big town more bearable. In fact, the opposite is usually true. Just as the United States has a chronic trade deficit when it comes to goods, New York runs a deficit in ideas. Innovations tend to originate elsewhere, whether in education, mass transit, homelessness, health - or bicycles.
 The latest example of our borrowing habit came with word from City Hall on Wednesday that it had chosen a company to introduce a system of bike sharing to New York. Comparable programs have been rolling for years in a bunch of other cities.
 The announcement quickly produced a cascade of reactions to this newspaper's Web site, from people who practically hailed it as the greatest development since Magna Carta to those who all but called it the worst idea since leisure suits.
 Nobody asked me, but I'm taking an agnostic approach for now. In theory, this should be a splendid addition, good for body and soul. But that pesky devil always lurks in the details, does it not? 
 It isn't clear, for instance, how much sidewalk space may be sacrificed to accommodate the 600 rental stations (with 10,000 bikes) that the designated company, Alta Bicycle Share, plans to create in Manhattan south of 79th Street and in parts of Brooklyn.
 Those of us who choose to get around on foot (except for long distances, when mass transit is preferred) are already squeezed pretty hard on sidewalks, where so much space is gobbled up by outdoor restaurants, construction sheds, security bollards, newspaper stands, bus shelters and other forms of street "furniture." Outdoor restaurants are pleasant amenities, and construction sheds and bus shelters are necessities. But they shrink the sidewalk. Anything that furthers the encroachment merits close inspection.
 The city might also insist that Alta require participants in its program to sign a pledge to stay off sidewalks and not ride against traffic. I am not so foolish as to think such a pledge is enforceable. Those strictures are already in place, and are routinely violated.
 But making bike sharers sign a pledge would at least remind them that, you know, pedestrians are people, too.
 No question, motorists are a much bigger threat than cyclists are. For myself, the blood boils when drivers turn into intersections - barrel into them, really - heedless of those on foot, who have the right of way. They are not only a menace. They are also brainless, because once they make the turn, they invariably must stop for a red light at the next corner. The dopes have gained nothing.
 But recognizing that motorists are the greater danger doesn't let cyclists off the hook. All too many of them, imbued with a sense of environmental purity, feel that basics like stopping for lights and steering clear of sidewalks do not apply to them.
 Delivery guys are often a bane, especially in Manhattan, which survives on takeout food. Nearly all of them are hard-laboring immigrants, and deserve to be treated with dignity. But their work ethic does not grant them impunity to zoom against traffic and startle - and sometimes hit - unwary pedestrians. Older people feel especially vulnerable.
Even the city's Transportation Department, in its pro-bike fervor is plainly aware that not all cyclists are saints. That's why a few months ago it began a bike safety advertising campaign, telling them, "Don't be a jerk."
 Not that all pedestrians are a thrill. Some can be pretty brainless themselves, paying traffic no mind as they cross the street with eyes glued to smartphones. (A particularly irritating subgroup of the species includes those who make a full stop at the top of subway steps to check their messages, forcing everyone else to walk around them.)
 In recognition that none of us are perfect, can we at least make a deal as bike sharing comes to New York? We on foot will stay clear of your bicycle lanes. But you on wheels have simply got to keep off our sidewalks.
 The operative part of that last word is "walk."

HEADLINE: Home Prices Are Down, but Rentals Are Rising

BYLINE: MOTOKO RICH


HIGHLIGHT: Rents were essentially flat in 2010, but they have been rising steadily since the end of last year.

 BODY:
The housing market is gasping for air, and home prices are down to 2003 levels, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices.
But that does not mean all housing is cheap. Rents are actually rising, according to the latest inflation data from the Labor Department. Last year, rents were essentially flat, but they have been rising steadily since the end of 2010. In August, rents paid for primary residences were up 0.4 percent compared with July, and 2 percent above a year earlier.
The reason is simply a matter of increasing demand for rental properties. In a better economy, the people who are now renting might be looking to buy a house. Many people do not have the financial capacity to get a mortgage. Interest rates are at historic lows, but lenders are making prospective borrowers go through ever more hoops to qualify for loans. People who are insecure about their jobs do not want to commit to mortgages, and those who are scraping by on unemployment insurance or savings certainly cannot buy a house.
"A lot of people are really changing their attitudes toward housing," said Chris G. Christopher Jr., senior principal economist at IHS Global Insight. "So there is more renting going on." With prices down, he said, housing "doesn't seem like a very good investment."

HEADLINE: City Unemployment Rate Ticks Up to 8.7%

BYLINE: PATRICK MCGEEHAN


HIGHLIGHT: A strike by 8,700 Verizon workers made the August job picture appear worse, the state's Department of Labor reported. Even so, the city's job market remained weak.

 BODY:
The two-week strike by unionized employees of Verizon offset all of the hiring that occurred last month in New York City and pushed the city's unemployment rate up slightly, according to figures released Thursday by the State Department of Labor.
The city's official unemployment rate rose to 8.7 percent in August from 8.6 percent in July, as the total number of jobs declined, the department reported. Even discounting the strike, the city's job market remained weak at the end of the summer as fears of another recession spoiled some employers' appetites for new workers.
Without the strike by 8,7000 Verizon workers, the city's private-sector employment would have fallen by 4,500 jobs, after adjustments for the usual seasonal trends in hiring and firing, said Barbara Byrne Denham, an economist with Eastern Consolidated, a real estate services firm in Manhattan. Countering those losses - in jobs, if not in incomes - was a gain of about 4,900 government jobs in the month, she said.
Ms. Denham performs her own calculations to adjust for seasonal fluctuations because the Labor Department does not make those adjustments for all of the city data.d
The city's highest-paying sectors, Wall Street and other financial services, did not do any significant hiring in August. Indeed, employment in the securities industry is down by more than 1,000 jobs this year, Ms. Denham said. 
Those losses preceded some big layoff announcements from large banks, like Bank of America, which has said it would eliminate 30,000 jobs.
Statewide, the number of jobs fell by about 30,000 in August, with more than half of that total attributable to the Verizon strike, the department reported. The state's unemployment rate held at 8 percent last month, well below the national rate of 9.1 percent for August.
The number of unemployed people in the state increased a bit to 756,400 in August, the department said. That number does include people without jobs who did not actively seek work during the month. Nearly 450,000 people collected unemployment benefits from New York State in August, the department said.

HEADLINE: Executives May Be Too Confident on Cybersecurity, Survey Finds

BYLINE: SOMINI SENGUPTA


HIGHLIGHT: Global executives are confident in their ability to secure their information systems, but few are actually on top of their companies' security issues, a PricewaterhouseCoopers survey found. 

 BODY:
Every week comes a new report warning how vulnerable consumers, companies and government agencies are to hackers bent on breaching computer systems and extracting sensitive data. 
This week came a somewhat unusual report, compiled by the global consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. It surveyed more than 9,000 executives in over 130 countries and found them confident in their ability to secure their information systems and bullish about cybersecurity spending. In the survey, released Thursday, 43 percent of respondents said they had confidence in their security protocols and 50 percent said they expected their companies to spend increasing amounts of money on cybersecurity. 
Digital hubris can be dangerous, though.
PricewaterhouseCoopers parsed the data more closely. They asked the executives about the precautions they were taking. It turned out that only 13 percent of those surveyed had actually done what the consulting firm considered to be adequate -- meaning they had an overall security strategy, they had reviewed the effectiveness of their strategy and they knew precisely the types of breaches that had already hit them over the last 12 months. 
Even as the use of social networks has proliferated, barely one in three respondents said their companies had a policy governing their employees' use of tools like Facebook and LinkedIn. Social media, the report's authors concluded, is a double-edged sword for many companies. 
"It's a great business opportunity," Mark Lobel, a principal at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said by phone. "It's also a terrible avenue for data loss and data leakage." 
Driving the spending on security was the prospect of cyber-espionage, or snooping on sensitive company and government data, everything from blueprints of fighter jets to confidential information about mergers and acquisitions. But only 16 percent of respondents said they were prepared for cyber-espionage.
The worries about security were echoed on Tuesday by Gen. Keith B. Alexander, chief of the United States Cyber Command, who warned of the looming threat of a computer attack. Speaking at a conference, General Alexander said he could not predict whether such an attack would be on government institutions or private firms. "It is a question of time," he said, according to a writeup by the Defense Department. "What we don't know is how far out it is."
He estimated that cyber crimes have cost the global economy a trillion dollars.

HEADLINE: Another View: Why C.E.O.'s Need to Engage Washington

BYLINE: NELS OLSON


HIGHLIGHT: Some leading chief executives explain the benefits of actively reaching out to Capitol Hill and the White House.

 BODY:
American chief executives fall into two camps: those who relish opportunities to engage with Washington and those who engage only when threatened with a subpoena. 
This notion of engagement is even more relevant at a moment when the United States is struggling with high unemployment, slow economic growth and yawning budget deficits. In the coming months, Washington will be making decisions about federal spending and tax policy that will reshape the government's fundamental role in the American economy for years to come. At the same time, both Congress and the Obama administration are under increasing pressure to find ways to create jobs and kick-start growth as the 2012 election approaches.
As a result, chief executives and business leaders from companies of all shapes and sizes will almost certainly find their local representatives and senators eager to hear a private-sector perspective from outside the Beltway. 
Ivan Seidenberg, the former chief executive and chairman of Verizon, fits the archetype of the corporate leader who sees the long-term benefit of having a presence in the capital. As chief executive, he frequently met with regulators, members of Congress, and White House officials (including invitations to speak with the president with other chief executives). President Obama named him to the President's Export Council in July 2010, and he served for three years as chairman of the Business Roundtable, the Washington-based group that advocates pro-business policies. Among the senior executives working for him at Verizon are a former congressman and Verizon executive vice president of public affairs, Thomas Tauke; a former general counsel for the United States trade representative, Peter Davidson, now senior vice president of government relations at Verizon, and until 2008 William B. Barr, a former attorney general of the United States. 
"I've focused on Washington because it's essential to the long-term health of Verizon, but also because I want to help develop solutions to the nation's pressing problems," Mr. Seidenberg said. 
As the White House, policymakers and legislators grapple with issues like deficit reduction, spending cuts and tax changes, engaging Washington is critical for corporate leaders, given the ramifications of regulation, taxation, global trade and more. While this is understood by top executives like Mr. Seidenberg and others, there is a clear need for leaders from outside the Fortune 500 to similarly ratchet up their efforts to have their voice heard and address what Mr. Seidenberg has characterized as "a growing disconnect between Washington and the business community." 
Why Washington Engagement Matters
The federal government and, to a lesser extent, state government are deeply entwined in sectors throughout the American economy. Regulation, in particular, can affect companies significantly and in unexpected ways, given that statutes are regularly being modified in a range of areas, including environmental protection, consumer privacy and workplace conditions. It is far preferable to try to influence the process than be stuck responding to the result. 
"If you're not engaged, you can wake up one morning and find a big problem on your hands," said Jim McNerney chairman, president and chief executive of Boeing, who is acutely aware of the need to develop relationships in Washington, given that the company is consistently the second-largest recipient of United States government contracts after Lockheed Martin.
There is some evidence that companies increasingly recognize the likelihood of public policy affecting their operations, based on the findings of a McKinsey global survey of business executives in February. Among survey respondents from companies in North America, 71 percent said they expect increased involvement from both government and regulators - the highest percentage of any region in the world. Another indicator is that membership in the Business Roundtable, which represents chief executives of leading American companies, has increased to 205 from 143 over the past 12 months. 
How Chief Executives Should Engage
The engagement of chief executives with Washington can take many forms. The traditional steps of making campaign contributions, joining trade associations and hiring government relations staff remain important. But they are no longer sufficient. Mr. McNerney of Boeing recommends that work on public policy issues become one of the experiences expected of executives as they rise through ranks toward the chief executive's office. "It is more important than ever to have experience with Washington built into the background of people who run companies," he said.
Reinforcing the importance of chief executive involvement is the proliferation of advocacy efforts by those who are not chief executives. In 2010, there were nearly 13,000 registered lobbyists in Washington. The large number of lobbyists creates more competition for companies as they seek to deliver their message to policymakers. 
"You can't outsource the Washington knowledge to external lobbyists or your in-house government relations people," says Bill Green, chairman and former chief executive of Accenture. "As a C.E.O., you have to have some level of depth on the issues of the day and the issues that could affect your company in the future. Relying solely on the government relations folks to raise the red flag is not sufficient and does not serve your shareholders well. In today's world, you have to be part of the ongoing dialogue."
But even with their stature and mastery of issues, chief executives must be prepared for challenges and frustrations, said David Cote, chief executive of Honeywell. "There's generally no one person you can talk to who can make the decision." 
"Because Washington has 536 independent subcontractors, you have to do a lot of talking and a lot of participating to get buy in," Mr. Cote said, referring to the president and all members of Congress. "That can be frustrating for us who are used to talking to one person and getting a problem solved. But that's the way it works, and you have to participate."
The Benefits of Engagement
Washington engagement is undeniably a form of risk management -- developing the relationships with officials that can help a chief executive to resolve differences (policy or otherwise) before they strike at the heart of a company's brand or balance sheet.
But engagement should not be viewed entirely as a defense mechanism. Being positioned to shape policies as they develop, and to seize opportunities emanating from policy changes, can also be a catalyst for corporate growth. And a healthy, vibrant relationship between chief executives and Washington, resting on communication and cooperation, will ultimately translate to a stronger, more dynamic economy that can deliver higher levels of job creation and greater prosperity for the American people.

HEADLINE: Will Obama 'QuickPay' Policy Mean Billions to Small Businesses?

BYLINE: ROBB MANDELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: The policy reduces the government's payment time from 30 days after receiving an invoice to 15 days.

 BODY:
On Wednesday, the White House made good on President Obama's pledge, in his jobs speech to Congress last week, to speed up government payments to small-business contractors. The new policy, which has its own product-like branding, QuickPay, reduces the government's payment time from 30 days after receiving an invoice to 15 days. In a statement, Karen Mills, Small Business Administration administrator, lauded the new policy: "QuickPay is a smart and powerful boost that effectively delivers billions more dollars into the hands of small contractors so that they can do what they do best - create jobs."
Really? Billions more dollars? The Agenda thought an elaboration might be in order here, so we called Joe Jordan, the S.B.A.'s associate administrator for government contracting and business development. 
The billions more dollars, he said, represent the interest saved on the cost of financing the goods and services produced for the government. Many businesses - perhaps most - do not finance their production or inventory out of earnings but rather by borrowing against lines of credit or taking out other loans. Even those that do rely on earnings then have an opportunity cost. "By cutting the receivables time in half, you're reducing the negative float - it's the financing cost of the good or service they just sold to the government," Mr. Jordan said.
Small-business contracts officially totaled about $98 billion in 2010, so the financing cost that will be saved by halving payment time is some small percentage of that. "We don't have a hard number, but it's billions," Mr. Jordan said. "But it's single-digit billions." For businesses with large contracts, in the range of $100 million, Mr. Jordan said the reduction in negative float could make a real difference in freeing up money for investments. "There are certain break-even points where the math definitely works on hiring new workers because of the savings." Mr. Jordan, though, could not say immediately how many small businesses receive $100 million contracts.
There are other benefits, too, he added. Faster payment lessens the uncertainty in making those investments and reduces the transaction costs associated with financing production - the time spent tapping credit lines or paying them down.
So there you go.
QuickPay applies only to officially designated small-business contractors, not the behemoth corporations that do much government work. And the policy covers only prime contractors, those companies that deal directly with the government. But many small businesses also serve as subcontractors to other prime contractors, and Mr. Jordan acknowledged that subcontractors often have to wait to be paid for their work. (In fact, according to Washington Monthly, some major corporations have, as a matter of policy, extended payment times to small vendors to 60 or even 120 days.) Mr. Jordan said the administration had taken up the issue, but added in a subsequent e-mail that "expanding this to subcontractors is still an open question."

HEADLINE: Greenhouse Gas Rule Delayed

BYLINE: JOHN M. BRODER


HIGHLIGHT: The E.P.A. attributes the delay to the complexity of drawing up the rule, not to pressure from a White House besieged by congressional opposition.

 BODY:
 To the surprise of almost no one, the Environmental Protection Agency confirmed on Thursday that it would not meet a Sept. 30 deadline for issuing rules governing greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and other major sources. 
The agency had been under court order to present proposed rules for limiting such emissions by the end of the month but has negotiated an extension while it wrestles with the complex technical and economic issues raised by the proposal.
 An E.P.A. official said that a new timetable for issuing the regulations would be forthcoming "soon." He said that the decision to delay the proposed rule was driven by agency considerations and not by political pressure from the White House.
 The idea of strict limits on emissions of carbon dioxide and other climate-altering gases from power plants and refineries terrifies many in the utility, manufacturing and oil and gas industries, who fear it will drive up energy costs and force the retirement of some older but still-profitable facilities.

Republicans in Congress characterize the proposed regulation as a job killer and are trying to throttle it. Business lobbyists have leaned hard on the White House to delay or modify it. The Republican presidential candidates are universally against regulating greenhouse gases, in some cases because they dispute the notion that carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels is a pollutant that is contributing to the warming of the planet.
 The E.P.A. and its supporters argue that the government is compelled to act to limit emissions by the inexorable science of climate change and by the Supreme Court's 2007 ruling that the agency must regulate such emissions if it finds they are a threat to human health and the environment. The E.P.A. issued such a finding in 2009. 
 Senator James Inhofe, the Oklahoma Republican who is the most outspoken climate-change skeptic in Congress, welcomed the delay, calling it one of the E.P.A.'s most economically damaging rules.
 "This announcement, as well as President Obama's recent request that E.P.A. withdraw the ozone standard, makes one thing clear: not only will E.P.A.'s barrage of regulations cost hundreds of thousands of American jobs, they may cost President Obama his own job, and he knows it all too well," Mr. Inhofe said. "That's why he is punting on a number of them until after the 2012 election."

HEADLINE: The Last Crown Vic Rolls (but Not as a New York Cab)

BYLINE: JAMES BARRON


HIGHLIGHT: That familiar staple, in mustard yellow, of the New York taxi fleet, the Crown Victoria, is rolling off the assembly line for the last time.

 BODY:
By midday Thursday, an enduring symbol of the city - the Ford Crown Victoria, a four-door sedan thatt has been a staple of taxi fleets since before Bill Clinton was president - went the way of the 1960 Ford taxi that bounced up Fifth Avenue as "Moon River" started to play in "Breakfast at Tiffany's." 
And the 1959, 1958 and 1957 Plymouth taxis in the final scene.
The last Crown Victoria rolled off the assembly line at 12:30 p.m. 
It will not join the hundreds of Crown Victorias - "Crown Vics," to car buffs - that rumble through the city, their meters adding 40 cents to the fare every 1,056 feet. (Assuming, of course, there are passengers inside and the conditions spelled out in the fine print from the Taxi and Limousine Commission, like going over six miles an hour, have been met.) A Ford spokesman said the last Crown Victoria would be exported, probably to Mexico or Saudi Arabia.
The city prepared for the Crown Victoria's demise with its Taxi of Tomorrow contest and chose a Nissan van as the city's next taxicab. It will have touches the somewhat frumpy Crown Victoria never did, like airplane-style reading lights and a so-called low-annoyance horn system.
It has become the taxi that champion taxi hailers hope will take them where they want to go. It does not require them to step up the way the minivans and sport utility vehicles in the taxi fleet do. It has more leg room than other sedans now on the streets, or so they say. 
The Crown Victoria was a big rear-wheel drive sedan that shared its platform with another almost-bygone staple of city streets, the Lincoln Town Car, a favorite of limousine companies. Crown Victorias were also widely used by police departments across the country.
But by the time Ford announced it was discontinuing the Crown Victoria and the Lincoln Town Car, they had become relics from "a bygone era of Detroit boulevardiers, with their front bench seats, soft suspensions and awkward, space-robbing proportions," Andrew Ganz, senior editor of the Web site leftlanenews.com, wrote last year.
His eulogy for that platform, known as the Panther, noted that it dated to the 1970s. "Once upon a time, the Panther platform underpinned coupes, station wagons and sedans marketed by all three of Ford's divisions," Mr. Ganz wrote. "Remember the Lincoln Continental Town Car Coupe? How about the Mercury Colony Park wagon? One by one, Panthers dropped off the chart."
And then Mercury dropped off the chart. Ford discontinued the brand. The last Mercury Marquis, another Panther-platform relative of the Crown Victoria, came off the production line in January at same plant that will make the last Crown Victoria on Thursday. 
The 44-year-old plant, in Ontario, made Ford Mavericks and Pintos in its early days. It will be the 27th plant Ford has closed since the recession began. 
"Anybody who started working here would be told, 'Hey, kid, don't get used to this, because it's going to close one day,' " Dennis McGee, the president of Local 1520 of the Canadian Auto Workers, told The Toronto Star last week. 
Ford has made Crown Victorias for 19 consecutive years, as long as it made Model T's - an unusually long run, said Bob Casey, an automotive historian who is the curator of transportation at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Mich. (Ford used the name Crown Victoria on a two-door coupe in the mid-1950s, and in 1979 and 1980 and again from 1983 to 1991, it made a sedan called the LTD Crown Victoria.)
"The Crown Victoria is certainly in its construction a very traditional vehicle," said Mr. Casey of the Henry Ford Museum.
"One of the defining characteristics of Crown Victorias was they were all body-on-frames, as opposed to the unibodies they were using on the Taurses and the Five Hundred and the revived Taurus." With unibody construction, he said, "once the cars were completed, you couldn't unbolt the body and take it off, as you could on a Crown Vic."

HEADLINE: Steuben Glass Factory and Store to Close

BYLINE: PATRICK MCGEEHAN


HIGHLIGHT: Heads of state and wedding guests will have to look elsewhere for the perfect gift after the Steuben glass store shuts its doors.

 BODY:
For decades, they have solved the riddle of what to give those who seem to have everything. Pieces of Steuben glass, those quintessential samples of American artisanship, have proved suitable for queens and presidents, brides and retiring executives. 
But in a few months, wedding guests and sheepish husbands will have to find a substitute for gifts from Steuben because the 108-year-old glassmaker is shutting down its factory in Corning, N.Y., and its flagship store on Madison Avenue in Manhattan. The cause of the company's demise was a waning appetite for fancy crystal that was exacerbated by the weak economy, company officials said. 
"We did not see an increase in new consumers or established collectors," Ron Sykes, a spokesman for the Schottenstein Stores Corporation, which bought Steuben from Corning Inc. three years ago said on Thursday. 
 "The difficult economy did not help us in the recovery." 
In Corning, more than 70 people, some of them master glass blowers, will lose their jobs by the end of November, Mr. Sykes said. The staff of the company's large store and showroom in Midtown may stay on longer while the company sells off its inventory of expensive and often quirky products, like an $1,800 widemouthed piggy bank designed by Harry Allen in Manhattan.
"Steuben was one of the last companies that I know of that was doing that sort of high-quality manufacturing here in America," said Mr. Allen, whose industrial-design studio is in the East Village. "The end result is you have very expensive products. Very few people want to pay what you had to pay to have a product made by Steuben in their life."
The store's closing, the precise timing of which Mr. Sykes declined to discuss, will bring an end to Steuben's 77-year presence as a retailer in Manhattan. It was still a division of Corning Glass Works when it opened its first store in the city on Fifth Avenue in 1934. 
For the rest of the 20th century, there was a Steuben shop in one location or another along the most elegant stretch of Fifth Avenue. 
Throughout that period, an engraved fruit bowl or animal figurine handmade by Steuben was considered a can't-miss present, a sentiment burnished by the choices of American presidents from Harry S. Truman to Ronald Reagan.
President Dwight D. Eisenhower was one of Steuben's biggest fans. He gave custom-made glassware as gifts to heads of state and also collected some himself. In 1954, on the first anniversary of Eisenhower's inauguration, members of his cabinet surprised him with a foot-tall pedestaled cup whose engravings depicted his life story. 
When Prince Charles married Lady Diana in 1981, the Reagans gave them an engraved Steuben bowl as a wedding gift. 
In a less official role this summer, two hosts of the "Today" show, Matt Lauer and Al Roker, presented a Steuben crystal cat to Pope Benedict XVI in Rome.
Steuben (pronounced stew-BEN) glass has served as a gift for all purposes for as long as some wealthy New Yorkers can remember.
"Over the years, I have received many, many, many Steuben gifts - bar mitzvahs, weddings, birthdays," said Leonard Stern, chairman of Hartz Mountain Industries, which owns the building at 667 Madison Avenue that is home to the Steuben showroom. "This is one of America's oldest handicrafts consumer goods. It's world famous. It would be like France hearing that Baccarat was closing down." 
But Mr. Stern said he sensed that the company was a victim of a generational shift in tastes.
"The younger generation of consumers is not buying things like this right now," he said. "I have children, and buying expensive crystals is just not part of their lives."
Young adults are more likely to spend their money on electronics, Mr. Stern said, inadvertently tracing the evolution of Corning. For nearly all of Steuben's existence since it was founded in 1903, it was sort of a vanity venture, demonstrating the finer side of the everyday glassware and crockery that Corning sold. 
But Corning gradually reinvented itself as a maker of glass-based products for high-tech applications, like computer monitors and LCD televisions.
Steuben had been a big money-loser for Corning for years before the company sold it to Schottenstein, which operates retail chains, including Value City Furniture and the DWS shoe stores. But that purchase was ill-timed, coming just as the financial crisis sent the economy into a swoon.
"I guess when it had to stand on its own two feet, without the corporate umbrella and the munificence of the owners of Corning, economic realities set in," Mr. Stern said.
But, he added, Steuben's last location in Manhattan will not sit empty long: Michael Kors, the clothing designer, has already agreed to lease the whole space Steuben filled. 
"The price of progress is not always cheap or pleasant," Mr. Stern said.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus a look at what's happening in Washington.

 BODY:
In Today's Times:
Students at North Carolina State University who skipped class Wednesday to see President Obama ended up with a $447 billion homework assignment, a group project at that. Helene Cooper writes that Mr. Obama asked the audience to pressure members of Congress to act on his jobs proposal as the country faces a "national emergency."
Mr. Obama may be having a harder time selling his proposal to Congress than he had originally calculated. Jennifer Steinhauer reports that as early polls show that only half of Americans believe the president's jobs plan will help to ease unemployment, Democrats, for their own reasons, are joining the Republican-led chorus of critics of the president's proposal.
A $528 million loan guarantee the Obama administration provided to the failed solar business Solyndra has drawn the scrutiny of House Republicans, who suggest that the guarantee was rushed for political reasons, an accusation the White House denies, Matt Wald and Charlie Savage report. On a broader level, the reporters write, a hearing Wednesday cast doubt on the government's ability to assess its loan risks.
The Jewish vote that Democrats have won in lopsided proportions since Jimmy Carter's presidency may be up for grabs, Mark Landler writes. He writes that President Obama's policies toward Israel have turned off some Jewish voters and may have helped a Republican win a special election in New York to fill a seat Democrats have held for years in a heavily Jewish Congressional district.
Happening in Washington:
The Hill reports that the special debt committee will meet privately this morning over breakfast.
At 8:30 a.m., the Labor Department releases real earnings and the consumer price index for August, as well as weekly jobless claims. Simultaneously, the Federal Reserve will release industrial production for August.
At 10, the House Financial Services Committee holds a hearing to discuss ways to overhaul the Securities and Exchange Commission.
At 12:30 p.m., the House speaker, John A. Boehner, takes his party's message to the Economics Club in Washington.
At 2:45 p.m., President Obama awards the Medal of Honor to Dakota Meyer, a former active duty Marine Corps corporal for courageous actions while serving in Afghanistan.

HEADLINE: Boehner Argues G.O.P. Case in Jobs Speech

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Speaker John A. Boehner responds in his first major speech since the president unveiled the American Jobs Act last week.

 BODY:
1:07 p.m. | Updated Speaker John A. Boehner on Thursday called President Obama's jobs plan a "poor substitute" for pro-growth policies and accused him of offering "initiatives that seem to have more to do with the next election than the next generation."
In a speech to the Economic Club of Washington, Mr. Boehner promised that House Republicans would consider the president's proposals. But he said that the government had gotten in the way of private business and that Mr. Obama's proposals were "more of the same."
"Job creators in America are essentially on strike," Mr. Boehner said, according to excerpts released by the speaker's office. "The problem is not confusion about the policies. The problem is the policies."
Mr. Boehner's tough rhetoric sets the stage for a contentious legislative battle as Mr. Obama continues to press his case for his jobs plan in the face of Republican resistance and some growing skepticism among Congressional Democrats.
Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, joined that argument in a tough speech on the Senate floor Thursday. 
"The truth is, the president has a problem that no amount of political strategizing can solve: his economic policies simply haven't worked," Mr. McConnell said. "Yet he and his advisers seem to be the only folks in Washington who aren't ready to admit it."
The fight over the jobs plan is likely to be tied closely to the effort by a special Congressional panel to reduce the nation's debt over the long-term. In his speech Thursday, Mr. Boehner reiterated his demand that tax increases be kept off the table during those discussions.
"It's a very simple equation," Mr. Boehner said. "Tax increases destroy jobs. And the joint committee is a jobs committee. Its mission is to reduce the deficit that is threatening job creation in our country."
The comments by Mr. Boehner come as Mr. Obama is preparing to submit his own plan for the deficit reduction committee to Congress next week. In the speech, Mr. Boehner said he had warned the president against the use of what he called "gimmicks" to lower the debt.
"As I told the president's economic team during the debt limit negotiations: we're just not doing that anymore," Mr. Boehner said.
But the speaker hinted in his speech that there may be areas for compromise that could be acceptable to his members.
Mr. Boehner said that the committee's efforts should include proposals to close tax loopholes as part of a broader reform that lowers personal and business tax rates. Some Republicans have balked at Democratic proposals to close tax loopholes, calling them tax increases. But Mr. Boehner said he was open to the idea.
"Yes, tax reform should include closing loopholes," he said. "Not for purposes of bringing more money to the government. But because it's the right thing to do."
Mr. Boehner also criticized a common talking point of some of his Tea Party members -- that cuts in spending designed to take place in later years are not real, meaningful cuts.
Mr. Boehner called that idea a "myth" that needed to be busted for the committee to be free to do its work effectively. That is a signal to his members that they should focus on the committee's long-term goals.
"That myth is built on a healthy skepticism that spending cuts made today are going to be implemented tomorrow.," Mr. Boehner said. "But it is a myth nonetheless, and we need to make sure it doesn't stop us from doing what needs to be done."
In his speech, Mr. Boehner called on members in both parties to end the "name-calling, the yelling and the questioning of others' motives."
But he repeated his belief that the government is overregulating, overtaxing and overspending. He said private businesses that would like to create jobs had been hampered by Mr. Obama's administration.
"They've been antagonized by a government that favors bureaucrats over market-based solutions," he said. "They've been demoralized by a government that causes despair when we need it to provide reassurance and inspire confidence."

HEADLINE: New Hampshire Governor Will Not Seek Re-Election

BYLINE: JESS BIDGOOD


HIGHLIGHT: Gov. John Lynch of New Hampshire, a Democrat, announces that he won't run for re-election, leaving the state with an open 2012 race.

 BODY:
Gov. John Lynch of New Hampshire, a Democrat, announced Thursday that he would not run for re-election, leaving the state with an open 2012 race expected to involve primaries on both sides.
In a brief press conference at a Manchester elementary school, Mr. Lynch said simply that it was time for the state to have new political blood. "To refresh and revive itself, democracy needs new leaders and new ideas," Mr. Lynch said. 
New Hampshire is one of two states with two-year gubernatorial terms, and Mr. Lynch will have been in office for four of them, having won record margins in his 2006 and 2008 re-elections. In 2010, he survived the electoral beating that saw both the state House and Senate fall under Republican control.

Since then, Mr. Lynch has battled with Republicans on several measures, including a Republican override of veto of a bill requiring parental notification for minors seeking abortions. Just Wednesday, the state's House of Representatives overrode Mr. Lynch's veto on a bill expanding the rights of citizens to use deadly force to defend themselves in public.
Several Republicans are considering running for governor next year, including the state health and human services commissioner, John Stephen, who narrowly lost ot Mr. Lynch in the 2010 race; Ovide LaMontagne, who ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate last year and is popular in the state; and Jeb Bradley, the majority leader of the state Senate. 
 "John Lynch's decision to forgo a re-election bid increases the G.O.P.'s chances of picking up the governorship," the Republican Governor's Association said in a statement shortly after Mr. Lynch's announcement.
During his news conference, Mr. Lynch ticked off his priorities for the 16 months left in his term, including lowering the state's high school dropout rate, balancing the state budget and expanding the economy, which already has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation.
"The journey is not over," Mr. Lynch said. "There is still much to do."

HEADLINE: Senators Hold Pep Rally for Deficit Panel

BYLINE: EMMARIE HUETTEMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Though weak on specifics, the group of Democrats and Republicans emphasized their willingness to back the bipartisan committee on deficit reduction.

 BODY:
A bipartisan group of senators gathered on Capitol Hill on Thursday to voice their support for the panel tasked with proposing $1.5 trillion in deficit reductions. Though the senators, who cheekily dubbed themselves the "Group of 36," were weak on specifics, Democrats and Republicans alike emphasized their willingness to back the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction.
"We're with you," said Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota and chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. "Be bold. Be brave. Go big."
And by "big," they meant bigger. Though the 12-member panel is tasked with finding at least $1.5 trillion in deficit reductions over 10 years, economists have said that something closer to $4 trillion in cuts is needed to resolve the nation's troubles, Mr. Conrad said.
The group acknowledged that the deficit-reduction panel faces a significant challenge, made even more daunting by its Nov. 23 deadline, and several senators said the committee would have to rely on previous proposals like those set out by the Simpson-Bowles commission and the "Gang of Six," the self-appointed group of senators who sought a solution on the deficit this spring.
"They don't have time to reinvent the wheel," Mr. Conrad said. "They're going to have to work from what they already have."
The show of bipartisanship was striking after a summer of gridlock that left Congress with its lowest approval ratings ever. Members of both parties made it clear that they hoped to show Americans that they could work together to fix the nation's economic woes.
"It took two parties to get us $14 trillion in debt," Senator Kelly Ayotte, Republican of New Hampshire, said. "It's going to take two parties to get us out of this mess of debt."

HEADLINE: Senate Democrats Want More Details on Obama's Jobs Bill

BYLINE: EMMARIE HUETTEMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The president's jobs package met with hesitant support from Senate Democrats as many said they wanted more specifics.

 BODY:
The White House brought its jobs proposal before Senate Democrats on Thursday, meeting hesitant support as many senators said they backed job creation measures but wanted more specifics about this bill.
"I'm not being critical. I'm just saying it's a huge bill, and I need to know that it's going to help my state," said Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, who said she did not get enough information from the presentation by Gene Sperling, President Obama's chief economic adviser. "If I can feel that it does, I'm all for it. If it doesn't, I don't know."
Senator Chris Coons of Delaware said the White House had made a good case to Democrats. "I'm looking forward to hearing more of the details of exactly what it will do, but broadly speaking, it's a balanced plan that has a real shot at helping restart job growth," he said.
Some expressed their support without apparent reservation. Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, who is the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, said he was persuaded by Mr. Sperling's presentation.
"They've gone out and spoken to people all across America," Mr. Durbin said. "What the president's proposing, this jobs program, is what America wants."
But Mr. Durbin acknowledged it would not be smooth sailing to passage, even when it came to gathering support among Democrats. He said some senators were concerned about how the government would pay for it, particularly if it came to eliminating the oil subsidy.
"We're not going to get 100 percent of our caucus," he said. "But believe me, if it's up to the Democrats to pass the president's plan, it'll pass."
Mr. Obama introduced his jobs proposal with a prime-time address before a joint session of Congress last week. Since then, he has taken his plan on the road to Virginia, Ohio and North Carolina to drum up support, urging Americans to contact their representatives and tell them to pass his bill.

HEADLINE: Pennsylvania Electoral College Plan Could Backfire on G.O.P.

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Republicans in the state are considering a proposal that would award 18 of its 20 electoral votes to the winner of each of its congressional districts, leaving the remaining 2 to the winner of the state at large. 

 BODY:
Republicans in Pennsylvania are considering a proposal that would award 18 of the state's 20 electoral votes to the winner of each of its congressional districts, leaving the remaining 2 to the winner of the state at large.
Had the proposal been in place in 2008, when Pennsylvania had one more electoral vote prior to reapportionment, Barack Obama would have carried only 11 of the state's 21 electoral votes despite winning Pennsylvania by a 10-point margin.
The plan would create the possibility, in fact, that the winner of the popular vote in Pennsylvania could come away with fewer electoral votes from the state. Pennsylvania's congressional districts are heavily gerrymandered and the Democratic vote is concentrated in the dense urban areas of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. Republicans have a 12-7 edge now in the state's congressional delegation, and are in charge of its redistricting process. With Pennsylvania needing to lose one seat because of slow population growth, they will try to consolidate Democratic voters into six districts while reinforcing their own.
A couple of the Republican-held districts might still be in play. The one occupied by Representative Charles Dent, for instance, now designated as Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional District, has been slightly Democratic-leaning in its presidential voting and was carried by Mr. Obama in 2008. But if Mr. Obama were to carry Pennsylvania narrowly, its electoral votes could plausibly split 9-11 or even 8-12 against him.
The Constitution provides broad latitude to states to determine how to allocate their electoral votes. In fact, Democrats have little recourse in Pennsylvania at all: Republicans control both branches of the state legislature as well as the governorship. And Pennsylvania has neither ballot initiatives nor recall elections. Democrats simply have to hope that Republicans will decide that the proposal is not in their overall best interest.
Fortunately for Democrats, the proposal is already drawing objections from some Republicans. And it's easy enough to see why: there are all sorts of downsides to this plan for Pennsylvania Republicans.
Problem #1. The Electoral College split could work against Republicans and cost their candidate the election.
It's easy to draw maps where the Pennsylvania plan could cost Mr. Obama an election he otherwise would have won. One case is if Mr. Obama were to lose Ohio, Florida, Nevada, Indiana and North Carolina from among the states he carried in 2008, holding the rest including Pennsylvania. 
That would result in a 279-259 win for Mr. Obama in the Electoral College under the current rules. But, since he would probably lose between 10 and 12 of Pennsylvania's electoral votes because of the congressional district split, that would put him below the 270 votes required to win the Electoral College.
But one can also come up with plausible maps that would work the other way. Take the map we just drew and make two small alterations: Mr. Obama holds onto Nevada, but loses Pennsylvania. (Seem unlikely? It isn't: Mr. Obama carried Nevada by a wider margin than Pennsylvania in 2008.) 
Under the old rules, this would be enough for the Republican candidate to become the next president, winning the Electoral College 273-265. If Pennsylvania's votes were split, however, Mr. Obama would be very likely to carry at least five of them in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. That would be enough for him to win the Electoral College 270-268.
Over all, somewhat more of these scenarios are likely to work for rather than against Republicans. That's because of the way Pennsylvania's congressional districts are drawn, and because Pennsylvania has historically been slightly Democratic-leaning relative to the rest of the country.
Still, the relative order of states shifts a little bit from election to election, and Pennsylvania is close enough to the razor's edge that it could flip from Democratic-leaning to Republican-leaning. 
As recently as 1996, Pennsylvania was what I call the "tipping-point state." Bill Clinton carried 21 states and the District of Columbia by wider margins than he did Pennsylvania, giving him 256 electoral votes. There were 28 states, meanwhile, totaling 259 electoral votes, that Bob Dole either won outright or lost by a smaller margin than Pennsylvania.
Neither figure is sufficient for a majority of the Electoral College -- so had the 1996 election been closer over all, Pennsylvania would have been the decisive state. Mr. Clinton could have won Pennsylvania but lost the Electoral College under the proposed rules. But the same is true for Mr. Dole.
Problem #2. The plan could undermine the integrity of the Electoral College, which is probably not in Republicans' long-term best interest. 
Two states, Maine and Nebraska, already award some of their electoral votes by congressional district, although their votes had never actually been split before 2008, when Mr. Obama won Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District in Omaha to take 1 of the state's 5 electoral votes. This quirk hasn't led to the collapse of the Republic, or the Electoral College.
But there are some important differences between these states and Pennsylvania. First and most obviously, they are much smaller, having 9 electoral votes between them, versus the 20 that could be affected by Pennsylvania's plan. And Maine and Nebraska are not usually swing states whereas Pennsylvania very much is, so their rules are exceedingly unlikely to change the winner of the election.
Second, the candidate winning the popular vote in Maine and Nebraska is guaranteed to also win a majority of its electors. Nebraska awards 2 electoral votes to the overall winner of the state, as well as 1 in each of its 3 congressional districts. But since it is mathematically impossible to win a state without winning at least one of its congressional districts, the worst that the statewide winner could do is 3 out of 5 votes total. In Maine, meanwhile, the winner of the state is guaranteed 3 of 4 electoral votes. 
As we mentioned, that isn't the case in Pennsylvania. It's quite plausible that a candidate could win the popular vote there but lose most of its electoral votes.
Finally, the Pennsylvania plan is much more explicitly partisan. And because of the geography of the state, it would give redistricting and gerrymandering a much larger role in the outcome of presidential elections. (There isn't much worth gerrymandering in Maine or Nebraska.)
So for all practical purposes, this would represent a paradigm shift in the way that presidential elections are decided. 
There's no reason that Republicans couldn't adopt a similar proposal in Wisconsin or Michigan, where they also have control of the state government. 
There aren't any particularly good places for Democrats to retaliate this year. They control the state governments in places like Arkansas and West Virginia, but they are small states and might not allocate many electoral votes to Democrats no matter how they were split.
But if they swept the statehouse in Texas one year, or in Georgia, or Missouri, what would stop them from adopting the Pennsylvania plan if this were the new normal?
It would be one thing if all states adopted the same method, some of which could have advantages to the current approach, and which are sometimes favored by political scientists and good-government advocates.
But what you'd probably wind up with instead is a patchwork of procedures for awarding electoral votes: some states would retain the current winner-take-all method, but some would use the congressional district split. Some might divide their votes proportionately, or use other hybrid approaches. And the method could change each time that the state government changed hands.
It's perfectly Constitutional, for that matter, for states to award their electoral votes through the state legislature, as many states did in the early years of the Republic, without taking a popular vote at all. If Republicans want to all but guarantee that they win the presidency next year, there is nothing stopping them. They control the state governments in 21 states totaling 242 electoral votes. All they need to do is have their state legislatures pick Republican electors in those states, and then for their candidate to win by popular vote in Alaska, Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi and West Virginia, which would get him to 270 electoral votes.
That, of course, is an extreme and unlikely example. But the Pennsylvania play would undermine the integrity the Electoral College, which is already fairly unpopular. 
Eight states and the District of Columbia, totaling 132 electoral votes, have signed on to a plan called the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, a proposal that would use a workaround to guarantee that the winner of the national popular vote would win the Electoral College once states totaling a majority of 270 electoral votes had committed to the plan. Such efforts would presumably gain steam if the Pennsylvania plan were adopted, as would proposals for changes to the Constitution.
And that's probably not in Republicans' best interest: the Electoral College will generally favor them. 
Take the 50 states and the District and Columbia and divide them into three roughly-equal sized piles:
In the red pile go all of the states that John McCain carried, which currently have a total of 170 electoral votes.
Into the purple pile go states with 182 electoral votes: all states that voted for both parties at least once between 2000 and 2008, plus Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota, where the results are usually close. 
The remaining 186 votes are in Democratic base states and go into the blue pile.
The blue states award a total of 4.1 electoral votes per million voters, based on turnout in 2008. The red states, by contrast, award 4.9 electors per million votes. 
So Republicans get about 20 percent more Electoral College mileage out of their base states than Democrats do, relative to the number of votes cast. This reflects the fact that Republican states tend to have smaller populations, and the Electoral College slightly favors low-population states. (California has 66 times as many people as Wyoming, but awards "only" 18 times as many electoral votes.)
In any particular election, this advantage may flip. Our simulations in 2008 suggested that Barack Obama was more likely to lose the popular vote but win the Electoral College rather than the other way around, a reflection of the fact that his campaign over-performed in swing states because of its superior turnout operations. 
Over the medium-to-long term, though, the Electoral College should increase the number of Republican presidents -- an advantage they would presumably want to keep rather than undermining the system.
Problem #3. The plan could motivate Democrats and lead to higher Democratic turnout both in Pennsylvania and nationally.
I don't entirely buy that President Obama has problems with his base -- his numbers are still pretty decent with most Democratic core voters. But they have eroded some, even among African-Americans. And even if these voters still support Mr. Obama, they may not turn out, or they may turn out but decline to devote their time and money to his campaign.
I can't think of many better ways to motivate these voters than to convince them that Republicans are trying to steal the election, and remind them of what happened in 2000, themes that will become prominent should the Pennsylvania plan come to pass.
Is the possibility of winning 10 or 12 extra electoral votes a good trade if the price, say, is motivating $100 million in additional donations to Mr. Obama and the D.N.C.? Or boosting Democratic turnout by 5 percent?
These effects are tricky to quantify. But considering that the Pennsylvania plan will help Republicans only under a relatively specific set of circumstances -- if the election is close over all, if Pennsylvania is close to the electoral tipping point, and if Mr. Obama rather than their candidate wins the state -- it's hard to know who gets the better of the deal.
Problem #4. The plan would significantly reduce Pennsylvania's influence in the election campaign. 
The first three problems concerned the Republicans' broad self-interest in electing Republicans to the White House both in 2012 and in future years. But Republicans in Pennsylvania also have narrower and more parochial things to worry about. 
If the Republican plan were adopted, its two statewide votes would still be worth going after, as might the electoral votes three or four of its congressional districts. The others would be foregone conclusions, heavily advantaging one or the other party, which would lose them only in the event of a national landslide.
Thus, Pennsylvania would effectively demote itself to something like New Mexico in the electoral pecking order -- a state with five or six swing votes rather than 20. That means fewer favors from Washington, fewer visits from the candidates, less of a windfall for the state's economy, and less face-time for its politicians.
Problem #5. The plan would probably become unpopular in the state over time, potentially costing some Republican office-holders their jobs.
That reduction in influence could also make Pennsylvania voters unhappy. Consider what happened in Colorado in 2004, when there was an initiative on the ballot to allocate the state's electoral votes proportionately. 
Initially, the initiative had plurality support in the polls. Once opponents began to point out that it would vastly reduce Colorado's influence, however -- essentially, only 1 of its 9 electoral votes would be in play -- its support collapsed to the point that it was resoundingly defeated, 66-34, on Election Day.
The Pennsylvania and Colorado cases are not identical: Colorado's plan would have split its votes proportionately according to the popular vote rather than by congressional district. 
The experience suggests, however, that opponents of the bill are likely to have the stronger case in the court of public opinion: the argument that Pennsylvania has been made less influential in determining the next president will tend to carry the day. 
Since there is no ballot initiative to vote on in this case, voters might instead take their frustrations out on Republican politicians throughout the state.
Republicans control 112 of the 203 seats in the Pennsylvania State Assembly, with 102 votes being required to pass the bill. Republicans hold a 30-20 majority in the Pennsylvania State Senate, meanwhile, so would need to hold 26 of their members to pass it there. 
My guess is that they will not be able to keep their coalition together: it's not clear if this plan is in their best interests. There are reasons why states have been loathe to tinker with the Electoral College despite having the latitude to do so.

HEADLINE: Players Show Their Unity At Key Juncture of Talks

BYLINE: By HOWARD BECK

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS -- On an afternoon of showy symbolism and strident commentary, Derek Fisher took the podium, flanked by 33 constituents in matching shirts, and flipped the script on the N.B.A.'s festering labor drama.
Solidarity was the dominant theme on Thursday, whether Fisher was reaffirming the unity of his players association or casting doubt upon the unity of N.B.A. owners amid a critical period in their negotiations.
The players association convened an informational meeting here amid reports that five influential agents were agitating to dissolve the union. Fisher, the union president, and Billy Hunter, its executive director, used the opportunity to rebut those suggestions, by staging a news conference with their players literally behind them. 
Afterward, Fisher suggested that it was the owners who were dogged by internal divisions -- a belief that is fueling the union's hope for a swift resolution to the labor battle.
Negotiators are close to agreement on the financial terms of a new labor deal. They remain bitterly divided over the owners' insistence on a hard salary cap. But with substantial savings now on the table, Fisher said he could not envision all 30 owners sacrificing the season just to win a hard-cap system.
''No, not even close,'' Fisher said.
Union leaders reached that conclusion after a series of productive small-group bargaining sessions that pushed the two sides much closer on how to divide the N.B.A.'s $4 billion in revenue. The players have offered to reduce their share to 53 percent or less, from the current 57 percent, if the N.B.A. will retain the basic soft-cap system.
Any optimism about an agreement along those lines faded Tuesday, when the owners' labor committee rejected that outline during a negotiating session in New York. Still, union officials believe that the framework for a deal is close, and that a majority of owners would take it, despite the objections of some hard-liners.
''In my opinion, there are not as many teams or owners as people would think that are interested in throwing away a season over a hard-cap issue,'' Fisher said.
Fisher said that Commissioner David Stern and the deputy commissioner Adam Silver had intimated as much -- ''that if we can find a way to find some common ground on economics, they don't see throwing away a season over the system.''
Hours later, after a lengthy owners meeting in Dallas, Stern dismissed Fisher's assessment.
''I don't know what the basis of Derek's belief is,'' Stern told reporters, ''but I can tell you, having just come out of the meeting, that the vast majority of owners are indeed in favor of a hard-cap system.''
Stern added, ''Having said that, they authorized the committee to be ready to negotiate on all points, and the committee is.''
Silver seemed to open the door to a compromise position, saying that the key principle for owners was not a hard cap, per se, but rather ''a system where all 30 teams can compete for a championship.''
No bargaining sessions are scheduled, but union and league officials are expected to talk over the next day or so.
About 40 players, most of whom came here to play in an informal league, attended the union meeting at a hotel near the Strip. A handful left early, presumably to attend to other business, but the rest -- all of them wearing gray T-shirts that read ''Stand'' -- joined Fisher and Hunter for the news conference.
Among the hot topics at the meeting was decertification, a legal strategy that some agents believe would boost the players' bargaining leverage by creating chaos and uncertainty for the owners. Union officials view it as a measure of last resort.
''If we go down that path,'' Fisher said, ''it'll truly be because we can't do our jobs as a unit.''
N.F.L. players dissolved their union last spring, but the maneuver ultimately played a negligible role in resolving their labor battle with owners. DeMaurice Smith, the N.F.L. union's executive director, apparently said as much when he addressed the N.B.A. players on Thursday, at Fisher's request.
Smith did not speak to reporters on his way out. According to Hunter, Smith's message on decertification was: ''It's not the silver bullet. That the real key to all of it is solidarity.''
To that point, Fisher and Hunter repeatedly stated that reports of player discontent were overblown. ''I think we've kind of dispelled the notion that the players were not together, and that they were not in support of the union,'' Hunter said.
The N.B.A. did resolve one labor issue on Thursday, approving a new five-year deal with its referees, whose contract expired Sept. 1. It remains an open question whether they will have games to officiate anytime soon.
Without a breakthrough, Stern could postpone training camps and start canceling preseason games by the end of next week. But the true tipping point -- the cancellation of regular-season games -- will not occur for another month.
''As we've indicated to our players, this is still early in the game,'' Hunter said, adding, ''There's still time to get a deal, but the N.B.A. has to be a lot more reasonable than they've been.''

HEADLINE: Skeptics Cast Wary Eyes on Plan to Finance Cal Stadium Upgrade

BYLINE: By RYAN PHILLIPS. 
Airphillips5@gmail.com

 BODY:
Are there buyers for $225,000 college football tickets?
That is the question haunting the University of California, Berkeley, which is engaged in a $321 million upgrade of its football stadium in the midst of the worst budget crisis in its history.
As the Cal Bears get ready to open their home season on Saturday at AT&T Park, their temporary residence, university officials are eyeing the progress of an elaborate financing plan for California Memorial Stadium that relies on selling 50-year rights to 3,000 special seats for $40,000 to $225,000 each.
If the seats get sold, Cal will be able to pay off the stadium renovation and establish an endowment to support all of its athletic programs. But if sales fall short, the university could be on the hook for tens of millions in construction costs even as it wrestles with up to $80 million in budget cuts for the next fiscal year as well as plans for huge tuition increases. 
So far, the results are mixed. After an initial surge in interest, seat sales have slowed over the past year, and Cal is only halfway to its goal. In its latest update, at the end of June, the athletic department reported 49 percent of the 3,000 Endowment Seating Program seats were sold. But the total projected revenue of $113.5 million is just 41 percent of the goal, and only $27.8 million has been collected; buyers can pay up front or over time, but there is no contract, so people can opt out at any time.
The seats that have sold the best are those at the lowest price; there have been few takers at $225,000.
''It's ambitious, and it's optimistic,'' said Roger Noll, a Stanford economist and a leading academic authority on stadium financing. ''And, unfortunately, they're going to have to commit to spending $350 million before they know whether they'll get the revenue.''
The stadium upgrade, and the recently completed $150 million Student Athlete High Performance Center, are the handiwork of Cal's intercollegiate athletics department, which has struggled financially for years. According to a report by the university's academic senate, the department required almost $9 million annually from the general campus fund from 1999 to 2009. The figure for last year was $10.5 million, and Cal has vowed to reduce it to $5 million by 2014.
The stadium financing plan was created in 2008, when the football team was on a roll under Coach Jeff Tedford. The U.C. Regents had ordered the campus either to fix the stadium -- it sits on top of the Hayward fault in a ravine above the Berkeley campus -- or to find a new place for the Bears to play.
Cal contracted with Stadium Capital Financing Group of Chicago, an affiliate of Morgan Stanley, and developed the E.S.P. seat-selling plan The goal was to raise $250 million, with much of the money coming up front. Some of the money would go into an endowment, which would provide lasting support for all Cal athletic programs (budget cuts last year nearly killed off five sports, including the baseball program).
''The fans and donors we're talking about have a bigger picture in mind: to create this endowment,'' said Sandy Barbour, the Cal athletic director.
The seats are a key part of the stadium renovation, which also includes wider concourses and seats, more concessions and restrooms, and improved wheelchair access. The extra-plush E.S.P. seats are outdoors, and there are three levels, each with its own amenities and price tag. (Cal alumni had made it clear in surveys that they did not want to be separated from the rest of the fans in enclosed luxury boxes.) E.S.P. participants also receive parking passes, and access to the stadium and clubs on nongame days.
Ms. Barbour said that E.S.P. had ''altered'' its financial aspirations, but that most sales are likely to come this year and that she still has faith that all the seats will be sold.
''Given the year we went through, in the last 12 to 18 months, frankly I'm very pleased with where we are,'' Ms. Barbour said. ''Is it a little behind what our very ambitious projections were? Yeah, there's no doubt about that.''
A recent analysis by Cal Moore, an emeritus professor of math, projects that E.S.P. will raise more than $300 million by 2052. Supporters also note that E.S.P. is a long-term project, and only one piece of a financial puzzle that includes ticket revenue, naming rights, corporate sponsorships, and tens of millions of dollars in TV revenue from the new Pac-12 media contract.
But skeptics, including vocal members of the Cal faculty, are not convinced.
Brian Barsky, a computer science professor and longtime critic of athletic department spending, calculated in January that 82 percent of E.S.P. participants had opted for the 30-year payment plan, and that most opted for the cheaper seats.
''Although nothing is impossible,'' Mr. Barsky wrote in an op-ed article in the student newspaper, The Daily Californian, the athletic department ''provides no convincing argument that it will succeed in raising so much more money in the near future.''
The low percentage of donors who have paid up front worries Mr. Noll, the Stanford professor.
''That strikes me as a warning sign,'' he said. ''People have bought the right to have tickets for a few years, but they haven't really bought into the endowment part.''
Mr. Noll said he believes the E.S.P. will fall $50 million to $100 million short of plan.
Rich Magid, the chief executive of Stadium Capital, said the bad economy and a bad public relations year for the athletic department made it the ''worst possible time'' to roll out the program. Still, Mr. Magid said, ''we're seeing a level that we're extremely comfortable with, to be in an area of 50 percent this far in advance.''
But another university may serve as a warning of how the program could go wrong. In 2009, the University of Kansas embarked on a similar plan -- selling 3,000 club seats to high-end donors to finance a stadium upgrade. Fans could pay $30,000 to own a seat for five years or $105,000 to own a seat for 30 years, with the goal of raising about $74 million.
But the plan raised roughly $5 million before being scrapped in 2010, according to Jim Marchiony, associate athletic director at Kansas. He blamed bad timing, but he also said fans were not willing to spend that kind of money for football tickets.
''Most of the fans we talked to were really looking for options that were not as ambitious'' as those prices, Mr. Marchiony said.
Mr. Magid said there is a big difference between the Cal and Kansas programs, namely that Kansas gave itself a much shorter time frame to recoup costs. He also suggested that Kansas had not done enough work in surveying its donors
''We spent a year-plus on the Berkeley side really making sure we had proper input and designed it properly,'' Mr. Magid said.
Mr. Barsky is unconvinced.
''Intercollegiate athletics at U.C. Berkeley never comes anywhere close to breaking even each year, with ever-increasing annual spending as it is locked in a financial arms race with competing schools,'' he said. ''On what basis should we assume that this will turn around?''

HEADLINE: Community Is Torn Over Expansion of Oil Refinery

BYLINE: By KARI LYDERSEN. 
klydersen@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
Steve Kozel was 7 in August 1955 when the Standard Oil refinery near his family's Whiting, Ind., home was badly damaged by a huge explosion and fire. His father, who worked at the nearby Sinclair oil refinery, had been planning to buy a house in Whiting. ''My mother said no way,'' Mr. Kozel said, and they moved farther away.
Now BP, the British oil giant, owns the century-old Standard refinery, the largest inland oil refinery in the United States. And Mr. Kozel, who still lives in northwest Indiana and is president of a citizens group called the Calumet Project, still worries that it will harm his health. He and other residents of the area are especially concerned now that the refinery is undergoing a large expansion to process more Canadian tar sands oil by 2013. 
Across the Midwest, refineries like BP are expanding to process the tar sands oil -- heavy, gooey oil mixed with sand in vast deposits that will be shipped via pipeline from Alberta. Tar sands oil is expected to be a staple of this country's energy future.
Opposition from citizen and environmental groups and citations from the federal Environmental Protection Agency mean BP will now most likely have to install cutting-edge pollution-control equipment that BP officials and environmental lawyers say will make the BP facility a model for other refineries.
Environmental groups are pushing BP, and the two are close to agreement on a consent decree designed to limit the effect of the refinery expansion. But even as environmentalists take on the oil giant, they are finding that they must also make their case to local residents, who want jobs more than they worry about new pollution, Mr. Kozel and other local leaders said.
In the face of a slow economy, BP's expansion is creating jobs on the southern rim of Lake Michigan, an area full of heavy industry and home to some of the worst air quality in the United States. The project will create about 5,000 construction positions, the company said, and 80 to 100 permanent jobs.
Chicago politicians and advocates for the Great Lakes raised a huge outcry in 2007 when Indiana officials granted BP a new permit that would allow it to release significantly increased amounts of ammonia and suspended solids, or sludge, into Lake Michigan as part of the expansion. The controversy eventually died down after BP promised not to exceed the limits of its previous permit.
Scott Dean, a BP spokesman, said he was confident that the company would not increase discharges into the lake.
Even so, the water permit that drew the ire of then-Mayor Richard M. Daley and then-Representative Rahm Emanuel remains in place. Environmentalists are calling for a legally binding commitment that BP will not exceed the prior limit.
Concerns about the discharges into the lake are but one issue for environmentalists as the $3.8 billion expansion moves toward completion in two years. Because tar sands are much heavier and contain more sulfur than conventional oil, they must be diluted with a volatile natural gas product to make them sufficiently liquid to be shipped. Once they arrive at Whiting, these toxic compounds need to be removed and disposed of during refining.
Environmental groups appealed the air permit that Indiana granted BP in 2008, saying it omitted expected increases in emissions, particularly from flaring, the burning off of toxic gases that shoots flames into the sky. The E.P.A. agreed and in 2009 ordered the state to redo the permit.
Now Indiana authorities, the E.P.A. and environmental groups are negotiating a consent decree governing BP's air emissions, which include volatile organic compounds, particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, benzene, lead and other pollutants linked to higher rates of cancer, respiratory disease or other ailments.
In its permit application, BP said the expansion would actually reduce its total air emissions, since the company was installing modern technology across the refinery and shutting down some old equipment.
In the challenge filed with the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, environmental and citizens groups essentially accused BP of making calculations designed to misrepresent the effect of the refinery expansion. The environmental groups argued that BP's calculations did not include increased flaring or new procedures needed to process tar sands oil, while at the same time the company took credit for reduced emissions from equipment that had been shut down years ago.
While the details of the consent decree are confidential until negotiations are completed, probably by the end of the year, Mr. Dean said BP had committed to limit flaring and to make other changes in its original plans. The company will also install innovative pollution-control devices that have not been used by refineries before.
Environmental group leaders not directly involved in the negotiations said the consent decree would most likely mean greater protections than would otherwise have happened. Still, some worry about the health impact on local residents.
The Calumet Project and the Global Community Monitor, an advocacy group based in California, filed their own appeal of the state air permit, asserting that it violates federal ''environmental justice'' protections because neighbors of the refinery are predominantly low-income and include a high percentage of minorities.
Denny Larson, the Global Community Monitor executive director, said the group was in discussions with the BP plant manager, trying to persuade the company to place air monitors around the refinery perimeter that will transmit air-quality information to the Internet in real time and alert residents of any problems.
''If you're having frequent toxic releases and you don't even have a program to monitor what's crossing the fence line into your community, that's certainly an environmental justice issue,'' Mr. Larson said.
The company's critics also point to risks in transporting more tar sands in and out of the area. A January report by the Pipeline Safety Trust, a federally financed nonprofit watchdog group set up after a fatal 1999 pipeline explosion in Bellingham, Wash., and environmental groups said pipelines carrying tar sands were more likely to spill than those carrying conventional oil, based on an analysis of spills from 2002 to 2010.
The report's authors noted that tar sands were grittier and more corrosive than conventional oil and must be piped at higher temperatures and higher pressure.
More than 1,000 people were arrested in Washington in the past three weeks protesting a proposed pipeline called the Keystone XL from Alberta to the Gulf Coast. They fear that spills of tar sands might contaminate the enormous Ogallala Aquifer, which extends from South Dakota to West Texas.
This article was made possible by a grant from the Dennis A. Hunt Fund for Health Journalism, and was produced as part of the California Endowment Health Journalism Fellowships, a program of the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism at the University of Southern California.

HEADLINE: In Kansas City, An Arts Center Makes a Debut

BYLINE: By A. G. SULZBERGER

 BODY:
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- As arts organizations from one coast to the other wrestle with cuts in grants and declines in ticket sales, an ambitious new performing arts center in the middle of the country is defying the trend.
The Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts, a $326 million concrete-and-glass clamshell overlooking downtown, will open Friday. It was designed by the prominent architect Moshe Safdie and paid for with private donations. 
The building, people here say, reflects the willingness of Kansas City residents to open their wallets if it means raising the national profile of the city's arts scene.
The opening, which will include a performance by Placido Domingo, has captured attention elsewhere, too, given these lean times. Michael M. Kaiser, president of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, said the Kansas City structure, with an 1,800-seat theater for the ballet and opera companies and a 1,600-seat concert hall for the symphony, reflected an investment unseen of late in far larger cities.
''At a time when the arts are really challenged to find private funding, and when certainly governments are cutting back funding, to have a city that to most of the rest of the country isn't known as the arts capital of America put such much emphasis on funding the arts is really unusual,'' said Mr. Kaiser, who once led the ballet company here.
The project was seeded more than a decade ago with more than $100 million from the Kauffman family, one of a handful of wealthy local families who continue to exert considerable sway in the affairs of the city.
Though the donations slowed during the recession -- 24 of 25 gifts of more than $1 million came before the downturn -- community members would occasionally call to reiterate their support. ''They would say, 'I want to give but I have to wait and see,' '' said Jane Chu, president of the center.
At one point, project leaders considered abandoning plans for two stages in favor of a single, multipurpose theater more common to a city this size, but decided that would compromise too much.
Instead the slowdown left its mark on the building's final touches -- modest ones that allowed it to come in on budget. ''We really cut back on frivolous spending and streamlined it immensely,'' said Julia I. Kauffman, who has led the project since the death of her mother, who first proposed the building.
Though the center was conceived in something of a boom period for such facilities, only a few such centers have opened in recent years.
''During the recession we saw a slowdown in capital campaigns,'' said Randy I. Cohen, vice president of research and policy for Americans for the Arts, a national group. ''Either they've taken longer, or they've been put on hold.''
Putting up the building during hard times without public help -- though the city paid for the $47 million parking lot on the grounds -- is a point of pride in a city that celebrates its routine standing near the top of lists of most philanthropic cities.
The building has also renewed hopes for a downtown that remains sleepy despite extensive redevelopment, including a new arena.
''This has been a very supportive arts community for a long time,'' said Jeffrey J. Bentley, executive director of the ballet company, which just relocated into a $32 million building near the center. ''But this is a coming-of-age moment for Kansas City.''
One worry for any new cultural facility now: Will the seats be filled for ballet, opera and symphony performances, or will there be an economic tug toward more lucrative shows? Center leaders say the early results seem promising. The pricey opening gala, with tickets starting at $500, is sold out. Already, they say, season subscriptions have increased substantially.

HEADLINE: Inflation Slowed in August, Reflecting a Weak Economy

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
The rate of inflation in the United States slowed slightly in August, when a rise in food prices was tempered by easing prices for gasoline and automobiles, according to government statistics released Thursday.
The Labor Department said the Consumer Price Index rose 0.4 percent last month, a slight deceleration compared with the 0.5 percent rise in July. The index, although it reflects just one month of data, is a closely watched indicator that guides analysts in assessing the economy. Other reports released Thursday showed weakness in the jobs market and an uncertain outlook for manufacturing.
''The story is very much the same: that economic growth is slow,'' said Kurt J. Rankin, economist for PNC Bank, about the day's data. 
The inflation figures for August reflected the volatility in prices for items such as food and energy. Prices for gasoline moderated, with a 1.9 percent rise in August after a 4.7 percent jump in July. Food prices rose 0.5 percent compared with 0.4 percent in July.
When those components were stripped from the index, the core C.P.I. showed that prices rose in August at the same rate as in July, 0.2 percent. That was in line with analysts' forecasts in a survey compiled by Bloomberg News.
On a year-over-year basis, the core C.P.I. was up 2 percent in August compared with 1.8 percent in July.
Paul Ballew, a former Federal Reserve economist and now chief economist at Nationwide, said that the August C.P.I. number was consistent with expectations set earlier by such things as automobile prices, which were basically flat in August.
''Those pockets of weakness were in areas already expected and known,'' he said.
Of more importance to investors were events in the European debt crisis and speculation as to what Federal Reserve policy makers would say after a meeting next week, Mr. Ballew said. Although the chairman of the Fed, Ben S. Bernanke, has given no sign that there would be fresh stimulus measures, market watchers were weighing the possibility of any measures that would promote the economic recovery in the United States.
With the year-over-year core C.P.I. at 2 percent, it was bumping up against the top limit of the Fed's unofficial target rate. But the Fed also relies on another closely watched measure of inflation, the price index for personal consumption expenditures, which was up 1.6 percent in the 12 months that ended in July, the latest government data shows.
''It definitely gives him room under the ceiling, if they want to ease policy,'' said Kevin Logan, senior economist at HSBC. One such move would be for the Fed to shift bonds in its portfolio to bring down longer-term interest rates. But the central bank cannot raise rates, Mr. Rankin of PNC Bank said, because it would slow economic activity.
In addition, the latest figures show that inflation is set to outpace wage growth, which would be a ''significant blow'' to potential economic growth because 70 percent of the economy is based on consumer spending, Mr. Rankin said.
''Even those with jobs are not able to put that money back into the economy in a way that would create jobs,'' he said. ''Now we are getting to the point with this inflation number, even those with jobs are less capable of driving economic activity.''
Steve Blitz, the senior economist for ITG Investment Research, also said that the latest data did not add any impetus to notions that the Fed would respond with policy action at its meeting on Sept. 20-21.
''I think because of the headline number and all of the conservative politics behind it, this certainly does not give Bernanke any cover towards doing anything big,'' Mr. Blitz said. ''The only thing that is going to give him the cover is what is going on in Europe.''
Mr. Blitz said the C.P.I. data reflected more of a shift in prices rather than inflation, because there was no accompanying rise in wages, and some elements of the data suggest the possibility of future economic activity in specific sectors as capital is directed more efficiently.
For example, rents are a factor pushing the index higher, Mr. Blitz said, but that could be positive for the economy if it continues because it can spur construction in multifamily homes and rental housing.
In addition, a weaker dollar is also pushing up the C.P.I., which means imported goods are more expensive. Domestic producers might see an opening to compete with imported products.
''Here what you have is an interesting mix of price signals that could very well help growth going forward,'' Mr. Blitz said.
A weekly report from the Labor Department showed that for the second consecutive week, initial claims for jobless benefits rose, increasing by 11,000 in the week ended Sept. 10 to 428,000. That was up from the previous week's 417,000, which was revised up from 414,000.
Economists generally take any level over 400,000 as a continued sign of weakness in the labor market.
In addition, the Federal Reserve reported that industrial production increased 0.2 percent in August after having advanced 0.9 percent in July.
Total industrial production for August was 3.4 percent above its level of a year ago, the Fed said.

HEADLINE: A Two-Step Plan That Strengthens Your Nest Egg

BYLINE: By JOHN F. WASIK. 
John F. Wasik offers some tips and guidance for maximizing your returns and strengthening your safety net.

 BODY:
BY now, you may have accepted, with grim reluctance, that you must delay taking your retirement benefits.
But even if you're looking at diminished balances from persistent market volatility, the news isn't all that dour. Planning a two-step retirement will actually bolster your total retirement income.
The best part of such a plan is that the longer you wait to collect Social Security, the higher the lifetime benefit. Once you retire, your monthly benefit will normally increase with annual inflation adjustments (except for in 2009 and 2010). 
The earliest you can collect Social Security is age 62, and the highest-possible benefit comes at age 70. The Social Security Administration provides an incentive to wait, reducing the retirement benefit by as much as 30 percent at 62 (compared with ''normal'' retirement age) and incrementally increasing it the longer you wait.
Since the government will pay you a ''delayed retirement credit'' in the form of a higher monthly payment for each year you defer collecting benefits, you'll need to use its calculator to plot the best strategy. The step-up in annual payments depends on when you were born, starting at 3 percent (for people born from 1917 to 1924) and increasing to 8 percent (for those born in 1943 and later).
When you take Social Security, of course, depends upon your health, additional savings and debt situation.
''You have to look at your health and financial resources first,'' said Gary Gilgen, a certified financial planner with Rehmann Financial in Troy, Mich. ''If your health is poor, it makes sense to draw out Social Security at younger ages. Managing debt is another concern.''
What if you can afford to wait to collect Social Security? The second leg of the strategy is to fill the income gap until your government benefits begin. You can start withdrawing money from other savings, and you could also generate immediate cash by buying an fixed annuity from an insurance company that guarantees monthly payments.
Most defined-benefit retirement plans, if you're lucky enough to have one, include a feature that will pay out a fixed annuity benefit. If you have a defined-contribution plan like a 401(k), you'll have to take a lump sum from your plan and buy the annuity on your own.
In a study looking at household total net wealth from $349,000 to $1.5 million, the Government Accountability Office found that ''delaying Social Security payments and buying an annuity'' maximizes retirement income for nearly every income group. The one situation in which it did not was when one spouse was in poor health, in which case taking early Social Security benefits was recommended.
''Some people may be inclined to want more guaranteed income,'' said Christine Fahlund, a financial planner with T. Rowe Price, the mutual fund company. ''There isn't one best answer because people may have different goals.''
In one retirement model she prepared, Ms. Fahlund showed that if a couple with $100,000 in combined preretirement income and $500,000 in investable assets each took Social Security at 67 and combined annuity income for the first five years with savings withdrawals, it would wind up with $1.76 million in lifetime income -- if both partners lived to be 95. About 80 percent of this income would be guaranteed.
Which asset you draw down first -- savings, Social Security or annuities -- affects your total income over time. You also have to consider risk and return. Ms. Fahlund's assumptions are based on guaranteed, five-year fixed-rate annuities, which are paying in the low single digits these days, and a balanced mutual fund (55 percent in stocks, 45 percent in bonds) averaging 7 percent in annual growth.
When you buy an annuity, make sure that the issuer is a top-rated insurer. Ratings are provided by companies like A.M. Best and Weiss. The higher the letter grade, the better the financial health of the company.
And keep in mind that annuities have no federal guarantees; they are generally covered by weaker state guarantee funds.
You can take on more risk with a variable annuity indexed to the stock market, but the return is not guaranteed, and income won't be either, unless you pay for a costly rider that will lock in a certain withdrawal benefit. And Congress is continuing to discuss reductions of Social Security benefits and raising the retirement age to receive benefits, so keep an eye on that as well.
To make this strategy work, you'll have to customize it. What if you want more guaranteed income at a younger age? What if you're single? What if you or your spouse's health suddenly declines? And factor in the tax considerations, because nearly all retirement withdrawals and annuity income are subject to federal and state income taxes.
At the least, you'll need to be flexible. If you don't want to do it yourself, get help from an adviser -- one who does not receive a commission on products clients buy. Consider working with a certified, fee-only financial planner to devise the optimal plan.
The stock markets are volatile. Interest rates are extremely low. The economic outlook in the United States and abroad is uncertain. And proposals are circulating in Washington to make changes to Social Security and to Medicare. It is a stressful time to contemplate retirement and what income (and expenses) await.

HEADLINE: Long-Term Stock Plans Help to Avoid Impulsive Moves

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
JUST as you caught your breath after the stock market mayhem of 2008 and 2009, it has become increasingly clear that this ride isn't over just yet.
This is particularly worrisome for people who are nearing retirement, as well as those who have already left the work world, many of whom are probably spending a fair bit of time wondering if the world markets have suddenly become a riskier place.
When you need to begin withdrawing savings, the stock market valleys can appear deeper and more turbulent than the ones you experienced earlier in your career because there is often little time to recoup your losses.
''What changes, and very radically, is risk perception,'' said Dave Yeske, a financial planner in San Francisco. ''The scariness of short-term volatility disproportionately blinds us to the long-term scariness of inflation,'' he added, saying that the recent inflation rate of 3.6 percent would erode your purchasing power by half in 20 years. 
The latest bout of volatility is no exception. The summer was punctuated by rounds of dysfunctional politicking and then, on Aug. 5, the unprecedented downgrade of the United States credit rating. Concerns about a double-dip recession continue to linger, while the debt crisis in Europe is another wild card.
Not surprisingly, the markets reacted. Look at a stock chart during the week after the downgrade: the zigs and zags form a distinct W, which took shape when the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index plummeted nearly 7 percent, and then, in the days following, rose about 4.7 percent, gave up 4.4 percent, then rose 4.6 percent once again.
Further market gyrations are inevitable. So to protect your portfolio from yet another risk -- your emotional impulses-- during these unsettling times, you might consider reassessing whether your money is invested in a way that you can truly handle for the long haul. Start by trying to answer these questions:
HOW MUCH RISK CAN I TOLERATE? Though the most recent downturns are painful, they have served a purpose. ''It did provide a nice stress test for investors,'' said Fran Kinniry, a principal at Vanguard's Investment Strategy Group.
How did you do? Were you able to ride out the crash in 2008 and 2009 (or perhaps even the debt ceiling debate) without touching your investments -- or did you fold and go to cash? If it's the latter, then you were invested too aggressively, experts said.
''If they were at 60 percent in stocks and 40 percent in bonds going into the bear market, and sold during the downturn, then that is above their tolerance for risk and they shouldn't go back to the level,'' said Rick Ferri, author of ''All About Asset Allocation'' and founder of the money management firm Portfolio Solutions. ''Perhaps 50-50 or 40-60 is more appropriate, that is if they need to take that much risk based on their situation.''
At financial planning firms across the country, advisers have been re-evaluating their clients' stomach for volatility. ''We moved a lot of our retirees that exhibited lower risk tolerance during the last crash to lower equity exposures once the recovery was well under way,'' said Rick Kahler, a financial planner in Rapid City, S.D. ''In the last year, many wanted to return to their previous portfolio that had the higher equity exposure, and we discouraged them.''
That sort of flip-flopping can be attributed to a behavioral phenomenon known as recency bias -- the tendency of investors to weigh recent events more heavily than those in the past.
Though advisers say that many of the risk tolerance questionnaires available on the Web are an overly simplistic gauge, many of them use FinaMetrica, a 25-question tool that combines psychology and statistics and generates an investor risk profile illustrating where they stand relative to others. While it is geared for advisers (and costs $45 for consumers), it could prove to be an educational exercise, or serve as a conversation starter for couples with different outlooks.
HOW MUCH STOCK DO I NEED? The amount of stock funds you can tolerate may not necessarily match what's recommended to reach your retirement goals. (But you generally want to take as little risk as you need to reach those goals.) The optimal allocations will vary depending on your specific circumstances and how much money you need to withdraw for annual expenses not covered by Social Security, pensions and other income sources. Because retirement does not come with a do-over option, it often pays to visit a certified financial planner, particularly one that charges an hourly rate or a flat fee, to help you sort this out.
Still, even among investment professionals, the recommended allocations tend to differ. Consider the varying allocations of target-date funds -- whose investment mix becomes more conservative as you age -- for people who recently retired or are nearing retirement.
Schwab's Target 2010 fund, for example, holds slightly more than 38 percent in domestic and foreign stocks, while Vanguard's 2010 target-date fund is nearly 46 percent in stocks. Fidelity's Freedom 2010 has 47 percent, and T. Rowe Price's Retirement 2010 fund has 53 percent. Meanwhile, a Vanguard fund for people who have already retired or are over the age of 69 has a stock allocation of 30 percent.
Mr. Ferri, the author and money manager, suggests some investment mixes in his book that could serve as a starting point. For example, a person who is about three to five years from retirement and has a moderate tolerance for risk may consider a diversified portfolio evenly split between stocks and bonds, he said, while a conservative investor may keep only 30 percent of the portfolio in stocks.
Once retired, moderate investors may dial down their stock allocation to 40 percent, Mr. Ferri said, while more aggressive investors may still decide to keep 60 percent in stocks. ''These examples probably cover 80 percent of retirees,'' he said. ''There are some people who can and should be more aggressive, and those that should be more conservative. It all depends how much they have saved and whether that's enough, or if they have much more than enough and are really investing for someone else.''
HOW MUCH SHOULD I HAVE IN CASH? People nearing or in retirement might consider setting aside anywhere from one to five years of their expenses in a safe and cashlike account, experts said. This may help you rest easier since you know that your immediate needs will be met.
Alan Moore, a financial planner at Kahler Financial Group in Rapid City, S.D., said some investors did not like seeing a sizable chunk of money sitting on the sidelines, but he called it market insurance. ''We set up direct deposits into their checking account for their monthly expenses,'' he said, ''and each year we replenish the cash reserve.'' If the market is on the decline, and a retiree isn't comfortable selling, they wait.
AM I KEEPING MY RISK LEVEL IN CHECK? Over time, market swings will inevitably throw your portfolio out of balance, so you need to establish a strategy to periodically recalibrate your investment back to your targets. For most investors, it usually makes sense to rebalance either annually or semiannually, when a particular investment category -- say, large-cap stocks or bonds -- deviates about five percentage points from your target, according to a study by Vanguard based on historical market returns.
It's a counterintuitive strategy: you are generally selling your winning investments and buying the laggards. The study, however, found that investors who rebalanced after big market drops had typically been rewarded over the long term. Increasing your stock allocation (especially when stocks are cheap) can position you for an eventual rebound, which can help returns over time. But at its core, rebalancing is not about maximizing your returns.
''Rebalancing is about maintaining risk tolerance and objectives of the portfolio,'' Mr. Kinniry said. ''What we do know is that over long holding periods, the portfolios that are allowed to drift have slightly higher returns, as expected, as the average equity position is larger. But it has significantly more risk.''
AM I FOCUSING ON THE BIG PICTURE? This is admittedly hard to do during periods of uncertainty. But consider the recent performance of a diversified portfolio. Since the market peaked in October 2007, a portfolio split evenly between stocks and bonds had a cumulative return of 5.9 percent through Sept. 6, while a portfolio with 30 percent stocks and 70 percent bonds had a cumulative return of 15.8 percent. An all-stock portfolio, meanwhile, lost 18.9 percent over the same period, according to calculations by Vanguard.
Rewind 30 years, and the same evenly split portfolio returned an annualized 10.3 percent from July 31, 1981, through the same date this year, while the 30 percent stock portfolio earned 9.9 percent, and the 100 percent stock portfolio yielded 10.9 percent annualized.
WHAT'S MY CONTINGENCY PLAN? If your retirement date happens to coincide with a significant market downturn, it can do long-term damage to your plan because the money you withdraw will not be invested for a potential recovery. ''A person considering retirement should determine how much of a contraction he or she could withstand and still be able to meet their retirement spending goals,'' said Troy Sapp, a financial planner at Commencement Financial Planning in Tacoma, Wash.
For Chris Gruber, a 63-year-old research psychologist in Long Beach, Calif., and his wife, Diane, a retired surgeon, the market swings have underscored their need to remain flexible. The couple finished paying off their son's college bills and her medical debt a little more than a decade ago.
They saved aggressively in the years that followed, and they both planned to work part-time for a year or so after they gave up their full-time positions. But when his wife's retirement date rolled around two and a half years ago, he said her employer eliminated many part-time slots -- just as the market crashed.
''My wife and I say we chose the worst time in 75 years to retire,'' he said.
Fortunately, his part-time prospects were much better, and he discovered that he enjoyed working part time, especially because he was able to give up many administrative duties. But in light of the market swings, he said they've already done some belt-tightening.
His wife's pension and their Social Security will cover about 60 percent of their annual expenses once they're fully retired, with the remainder coming from their savings, which is largely invested in stock funds. ''On any given day, I can tell you how much I have over my nut to spend,'' said Mr. Gruber, who has created a spreadsheet tracking how close their funds match their spending goals. Right now, they're about 30 percent below their targets, which is well below his comfort zone.
''I manage my risk by readjusting what I can do for the rest of my life,'' he said. The couple's goal was to keep their four-bedroom ranch for 10 years, but now they may stay only five, which will allow them to spend more time in Colorado, where they have an apartment near their son's family. ''We are willing to downsize as it becomes necessary.''

HEADLINE: Focus Is on G.M. as Contract Talks Resume

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC; Nick Bunkley contributed reporting.

 BODY:
DETROIT -- The United Automobile Workers union turned its full attention to General Motors on Thursday to reach a new national labor agreement after postponing talks at Chrysler.
Negotiators for the U.A.W. and G.M., the nation's biggest automaker, reconvened for meetings after failing to reach a deal before their contract expired late Wednesday. 
The union has agreed to a day-by-day extension at G.M. to complete the outstanding issues separating the two sides, including job commitments in plants, signing bonuses for workers and a pay increase for entry-level employees. Talks will resume 9 a.m. on Friday.
The union's president, Bob King, has been conducting parallel talks with G.M. and Chrysler, the two Detroit automakers that were bailed out by the Obama administration in 2009.
But Chrysler abruptly asked for a weeklong contract extension on Wednesday night after Mr. King did not attend a scheduled session with Chrysler's chief executive, Sergio Marchionne.
Instead, Mr. King seeks to set a pattern on wages and bonuses at G.M., and then try to match it at Chrysler and Ford Motor.
''It looks like the pattern, at least initially, is going to be set at G.M. rather than Chrysler,'' said Arthur R. Schwartz, president of the consulting firm Labor and Economic Associates in Ann Arbor, Mich.
The union cannot strike either G.M. or Chrysler as a condition of their federal aid packages. That is not the case with Ford, which turned itself around without government assistance.
It is not unusual for the union to grant a contract extension if it is close to a deal with one automaker. G.M. has been determined to be the first company to settle and establish a cost structure that will help its comeback.
Mr. King, however, may find the going rougher at Chrysler, which is owned by the Italian carmaker Fiat and has yet to turn as profitable as G.M. or Ford. Mr. Marchionne was clearly peeved with Mr. King for not honoring an agreement to negotiate face to face on the last day before the current four-year deal expired.
The Chrysler chief executive sent a scathing letter by fax to Mr. King, noting that he had flown in from Europe to finish the negotiations. ''You, unfortunately, could not be here, I am told, due to competing engagements,'' Mr. Marchionne wrote. Mr. King received the fax in the middle of his discussions with G.M.
Mr. Marchionne then said he would be unavailable to meet with Mr. King again until next week. Mr. Marchionne also, for the first time, brought up the possibility of the contract being arbitrated if an agreement could not be reached.
''If that happens, nobody knows what we're getting into,'' Mr. Schwartz said.

HEADLINE: City Hands Off Part of Teacher Evaluation Effort to the State

BYLINE: By SHARON OTTERMAN

 BODY:
New York City education officials announced Thursday that they would end their effort to rank teachers based on their students' standardized test scores, adding a surprise twist to one of the most contentious issues facing the city's teaching force.
For the past three years, the city has produced annual performance rankings of fourth- through eighth-grade teachers, in an attempt to measure a teacher's contribution to student achievement. Joel I. Klein, the former schools chancellor, championed the rankings, and the city has been supporting their release to the public against a teachers' union lawsuit for the past year. 
Under a new state law on teacher evaluation, however, New York State will produce similar effectiveness scores, comparing teachers across the state beginning this summer. Shael Polakow-Suransky, the city's chief academic officer, said the new law made the city's rankings, known as Teacher Data Reports, no longer necessary.
''Already, we're working with the state to ensure their reports will be fair to teachers, and take account of factors like poverty and race,'' Mr. Polakow-Suransky said. ''This is just one of multiple measures we will use to evaluate teachers, and there's no need to duplicate the state's efforts.''
The city and union have been battling over the use of the Teacher Data Reports. When they were begun as a pilot program, city officials pledged to the union that they would not be used in high-stakes decisions, like termination, and that they would fight their release to the public. In their lawsuit, union officials say that dozens of reports are inaccurate, attributing the wrong students to teachers, and that they rest on invalid assumptions about how well a teacher should perform.
Though the state's ratings may ultimately produce similar results, Michael Mulgrew, the president of the United Federation of Teachers, hailed the city's decision to pass the baton.
''I think it's a very constructive and solid decision by the chancellor,'' Mr. Mulgrew said. ''It's not reliable. The state has already gone through its contract process and did not choose the city's system, for obvious reasons. So why would we duplicate at this point in time when money is such a huge issue?''
The city's rankings, using a methodology called value-added modeling, have been produced by a center affiliated with the University of Wisconsin. Not producing them this year will save the city about $200,000, city officials said. Doug N. Harris, an economist affiliated with the center, said he thought the decision to end the contract ''was more broadly a political issue than about whose model is better.''
''My sense is the city is trying to make amends a bit with the union,'' he said. ''New York City is saying we will let the state take the heat.''
American Institutes for Research, based in Washington, has been awarded the $2.7 million, three-year state contract for the state rankings. Instead of comparing teachers only within the city, the new model will compare teachers with similar students, in terms of their academic level and some demographic factors, across the state, and count for up to 25 percent of the annual evaluation for 33,000 fourth- through eighth-grade teachers.
But individual districts must agree with union chapters before the rankings can be used, and the state teachers' union has sued over the weight New York plans to give test scores. In addition, in the first year the new contractor will use a less-precise model that looks at fewer demographic factors. The new value-added system is scheduled to begin in 2013.
''That sort of model will give you a description of how students in a teacher's class perform,'' said Jon Cohen, the institute's chief statistician and executive vice president, of the model set for 2012. ''It's a stretch from there to attributing that growth to the teacher.''
Sean Corcoran, an economics professor at New York University, has been critical of the city's rankings, but was surprised to hear the city had ended them.
''It's one of the most developed systems in the country,'' he said, ''and for all its faults, it's better than most of what's out there.''

HEADLINE: Abalone And a Rite Fall Victim To Red Tide

BYLINE: By JOHN UPTON. 
jupton@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Since he was a child, Matt Mattison has taken part in an enduring summer ritual of the spectacular and rugged Sonoma Coast: donning fins and a mask, and diving to the ocean floor in search of abalone. 
But on Aug. 21, as he was hiking up a hill to his car after taking a couple of the prized shellfish from the waters near Fort Ross, Mr. Mattison, a 34-year-old Monte Rio resident, turned and saw ''a bloody, muddy kind of an oil slick coming down the coast.''
What he witnessed was the arrival of an exceptionally virulent red tide, which since then has devastated the shellfish population along the Sonoma and Mendocino coasts and ruined the end of the summer beach season.
On Thursday, the California Department of Fish and Game closed the abalone fishing season in Sonoma County, more than 10 weeks ahead of schedule. State biologists say 30 percent or more of the abalone were killed at Fort Ross, with dead abalone dotting beaches from Bodega Bay to Anchor Bay. Seasons remain open in other counties.
Dead shellfish and other small sea animals still covered beaches in the area this week, attracting flies and seagulls with their stench.
A red tide is a mass of plankton, which feed on nutrients that rise from the ocean depths as well as on fertilizer, sewage and other man-made foods. The plankton can kill slow-moving wildlife with poison or by sucking oxygen out of the water.
''Red tides happen every year, but having a large, significant die-off due to one is very rare,'' said Ian Taniguchi, a Department of Fish & Game biologist. ''Along the Sonoma County coastline, we've never seen it.''
Scientists are not sure what caused the unusually toxic red tide, but it is a major blow to an already troubled abalone fishery and the summer traditions that go along with it.
Abalone are slow-growing shellfish and can be caught legally only by free-diving; no scuba gear is allowed. State regulations allow people to take a maximum of 24 a year, and each abalone must be at least seven inches long. Thousands of divers in Sonoma and Mendocino Counties capture nearly all of the abalone caught legally in the state. No commercial fishing is allowed in the region.
Abalone fishing is not for the feint of heart: two people died this year in abalone-diving accidents along the Sonoma County coast. But it is a cherished rite of summer here, with many abalone aficionados camping at beachside state parks and grilling their catch after a strenuous day of diving. The chewy shellfish can also be fried, minced and used for sushi.
It is unclear whether the fishery will reopen next summer, but Sonoma County residents and businesses desperately hope it will recover.
''It's a tradition,'' said Efren Carrillo, a county supervisor. ''Tourism is something that helps keep our economy afloat.''
For Mr. Mattison, who made his first dive with his father when he was 5, it is hard to contemplate the possible absence of an abalone season.
''It's a way of life on the north coast,'' he said.

HEADLINE: China Consolidates Grip on Rare Earths

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Stephanie Clifford contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- In the name of fighting pollution, China has sent the price of compact fluorescent light bulbs soaring in the United States.
By closing or nationalizing dozens of the producers of rare earth metals -- which are used in energy-efficient bulbs and many other green-energy products -- China is temporarily shutting down most of the industry and crimping the global supply of the vital resources.
China produces nearly 95 percent of the world's rare earth materials, and it is taking the steps to improve pollution controls in a notoriously toxic mining and processing industry. But the moves also have potential international trade implications and have started yet another round of price increases for rare earths, which are vital for green-energy products including giant wind turbines, hybrid gasoline-electric cars and compact fluorescent bulbs.
General Electric, facing complaints in the United States about rising prices for its compact fluorescent bulbs, recently noted in a statement that if the rate of inflation over the last 12 months on the rare earth element europium oxide had been applied to a $2 cup of coffee, that coffee would now cost $24.55. 
A pack of three 11-watt G.E. compact fluorescent bulbs -- each the lighting equivalent of a 40-watt incandescent bulb -- was priced on Thursday at $15.88 on Wal-Mart's Web site for pickup in a Nashville, Ark., store. The average price for fluorescent bulbs has risen 37 percent this year, according to the National Electrical Manufacturers Association.
Wal-Mart, which has made a big push for compact fluorescent bulbs, acknowledged that it needed to raise prices on some brands lately. ''Obviously we don't want to pass along price increases to our customers, but occasionally market conditions require it,'' Tara Raddohl, a spokeswoman, said. The Chinese actions on rare earths were a prime topic of conversation at a conference here on Thursday that was organized by Metal-Pages, an industry data firm based in London.
Soaring prices are rippling through a long list of industries.
''The high cost of rare earths is having a significant chilling effect on wind turbine and electric motor production in spite of offsetting government subsidies for green tech products,'' said one of the conference attendees, Michael N. Silver, chairman and chief executive of American Elements, a chemical company based in Los Angeles. It supplies rare earths and other high-tech materials to businesses.
But with light bulbs, especially, the timing of the latest price increases is politically awkward for the lighting industry and for environmentalists who backed a shift to energy-efficient lighting.
In January, legislation that President George W. Bush signed into law in 2007 will begin phasing out traditional incandescent bulbs in favor of spiral compact fluorescent bulbs and other technologies. The European Union has also mandated a switch from incandescent bulbs to energy-efficient lighting.
Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota is running for the Republican presidential nomination on a platform that includes strong opposition to the new lighting rules in the United States and has been a leader of efforts by House Republicans to repeal it.
China says it has largely shut down its rare earth industry for three months to address pollution problems. By invoking environmental concerns, China could potentially try to circumvent international trade rules that are supposed to prohibit export restrictions of vital materials.
In July, the European Union said in a statement on rare earth policy that the organization supported efforts to protect the environment, but that discrimination against foreign buyers of rare earths was not allowed under World Trade Organization rules.
China has been imposing tariffs and quotas on its rare earth exports for several years, curtailing global supplies and forcing prices to rise eightfold to fortyfold during that period for the various 17 rare earth elements.
Even before this latest move by China, the United States and the European Union were preparing to file a case at the W.T.O. this winter that would challenge Chinese export taxes and export quotas on rare earths.
Chinese officials here at the conference said the government was worried about polluted water, polluted air and radioactive residues from the rare earth industry, particularly among many small and private companies, some of which operate without the proper licenses. While rare earths themselves are not radioactive, they are always found in ore containing radioactive thorium and require careful handling and processing to avoid contaminating the environment.
Most of the country's rare earth factories have been closed since early August, including those under government control, to allow for installation of pollution control equipment that must be in place by Oct. 1, executives and regulators said.
The government is determined to clean up the industry, said Xu Xu, chairman of the China Chamber of Commerce of Metals, Minerals and Chemicals Importers and Exporters, a government-controlled group that oversees the rare earth industry. ''The entrepreneurs don't care about environmental problems, don't care about labor problems and don't care about their social responsibility,'' he said. ''And now we have to educate them.''
Beijing authorities are creating a single government-controlled monopoly, Bao Gang Rare Earth, to mine and process ore in northern China, the region that accounts for two-thirds of China's output. The government is ordering 31 mostly private rare earth processing companies to close this year in that region and is forcing four other companies into mergers with Bao Gang, said Li Zhong, the vice general manager of Bao Gang Rare Earth.
The government also plans to consolidate 80 percent of the production from southern China, which produces the rest of China's rare earths, into three companies within the next year or two, Mr. Li said. All three of these companies are former ministries of the Chinese government that were spun out as corporations, and the central government still owns most of the shares.
The taxes and quotas China had in place to restrict rare earth exports caused many companies to move their factories to China from the United States and Europe so that they could secure a reliable and inexpensive source of raw materials.
China promised when it joined the W.T.O. in 2001 that it would not restrict exports except for a handful of obscure materials. Rare earths were not among the exceptions.
But even if the W.T.O. orders China to dismantle its export tariffs and quotas, the industry consolidation now under way could enable China to retain tight control over exports and continue to put pressure on foreign companies to relocate to China.
The four state-owned companies might limit sales to foreign buyers, a tactic that would be hard to address through the W.T.O., Western trade officials said.
Hedge funds and other speculators have been buying and hoarding rare earths this year, with prices rising particularly quickly through early August, and dipping since then as some have sold their inventories to take profits, said Constantine Karayannopoulos, the chief executive of Neo Material Technologies, a Canadian company that is one of the largest processors in China of raw rare earths.
''The real hot money got into the industry building neodymium and europium inventories in Shanghai warehouses,'' he said.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about the effect of China's control over rare earth metals on energy-efficient products like light bulbs misstated the price of 11-watt G.E. compact fluorescent bulbs listed on Wal-Mart's Web site. The price of $15.88 is for a three-pack, not a single bulb.

HEADLINE: The Risks of Investing Like the Big Pension Funds

BYLINE: By FRAN HAWTHORNE

 BODY:
OVER the last several years, the managers of many big, traditional pension plans have become increasingly cautious. Instead of viewing high returns as their top priority, these managers have focused on avoiding risk. Some have shifted assets from stocks to bonds, while others have changed the way they analyze their investments or hired special risk officers. An old investment strategy called liability-driven investing has been revived, in which pension plans buy a series of bonds with maturity dates timed to match the years when cohorts of employees are expected to retire.
A 401(k) investor might well look at such developments at places like the Boeing Company and the California Public Employees' Retirement System and say: ''These are trained professionals with business degrees and years of experience. They must know what they're doing. Shouldn't I do the same?''
The comparison is not that simple, however. Certainly, 401(k)s and traditional defined-benefit plans have much in common because both are long-range investments. Yet the two pools of money are significantly different in size, in the diversity of recipients, in payment schedules and in legal requirements. To make matters even more confusing, experts disagree about whether individuals should be more aggressive than big plans, or less. 
''What people can take from defined-benefit plans is how important it is to have a good understanding of your financial risks,'' said Michael Archer, a senior consultant at the benefits consulting firm Towers Watson, which is based in New York and advises large plans.
The caution among pension managers began about five years ago, and some of the driving forces clearly do not apply to individuals. These include a new accounting rule that requires pension liabilities to be listed on the corporate balance sheet and a new federal pension law that gives companies only seven years, rather than the previous 30, to make sure their plans are fully funded. Those institutional changes discourage pension managers from choosing risky investments, because any losses will be more obvious to stockholders and will have to be replaced more quickly.
However, other cautionary pressures -- severe market swings, recession, more complex investment choices and increased longevity -- might seem familiar to anyone with a 401(k).
To a novice 401(k) investor, the most obvious solution might be to switch money out of volatile stocks and into more stable bonds, and in fact, many traditional plans are doing just that.
But unlike a 401(k) investor, a giant fund like the California Public Employees' Retirement System, known as Calpers, cannot easily move its $237.5 billion around without causing financial tidal waves. Instead, the fund last December adopted what it called a ''risk-focused asset allocation strategy.'' The staff now looks at the investments in terms of how they perform in different market conditions.
In another example, officials from a dozen large plans, including Boeing, meet regularly to demand more data on risk from their outside managers.
''The desire is to have a system that tells them where they are exposed across the market,'' said Karyn Williams, a managing director specializing in risk management at the Los Angeles consulting firm Wilshire Associates.
Pensions are a delicate topic, as companies increasingly shift new employees to 401(k)s. In addition, ''It's not a fun thing to talk about, when the funded status is low and equity values are low,'' said the Vanguard Group's chief actuary, R. Evan Inglis.
In the broadest sense, defined-benefit and 401(k) retirement portfolios are similar because they must try to anticipate developments decades in advance and then find investments that match those projections.
Still, size matters, and there are strong arguments against copying the big plans too closely.
Because their losses are spread around a wider base, defined-benefit plans enjoy more flexibility, which allows them to take more investment risk. ''An individual in a 401(k) has a set time frame,'' said Alison Borland, the retirement manager for Aon Hewitt's outsourcing arm. The individual must make sure there is enough money to stretch from Year 1 of retirement all the way through the actuarially expected lifespan. A pension plan, by contrast, can juggle the estimates for thousands of different retirement schedules. ''You can be pretty sure the entire population is not going to live to 90,'' Ms. Borland said.
''Individual investing tends to be more complex,'' said Stephen M. Horan, head of private wealth management for the CFA Institute, a trade group for financial advisers. ''I need to think about that individual's past profile, estate planning, life situation and any family dynamics that might have wealth implications.'' Again, a defined-benefit manager can disregard the personal details and ''aggregate the employees altogether,'' Mr. Horan said.
Another important distinction is that 401(k) holders must worry about inflation eating away at their savings. Traditional pension plans can ignore the topic, because most do not offer cost-of-living adjustments.
All those differences might seem to imply that 401(k) holders should be even more cautious than the newly cautious defined-benefit plans. They cannot afford losses jeopardizing their ability to retire on their hoped-for date.
But experts also cite some intriguing reasons why 401(k)s could actually be a bit more daring than their larger cousins.
For one thing, a 401(k) holder can delay retirement if the portfolio gets depleted. The pension manager cannot change the decisions of the work force. ''An individual is aiming for a target, but it's not so precisely nailed down,'' said Stephen P. Utkus, director of Vanguard's Center for Retirement Research.
The new pension funding law also constrains traditional plans, because they have only seven years to get their assets and liabilities back in balance after a market crash. Individuals face no such limits. ''If I'm an individual, 30 years old, I've got a lot more than seven years,'' Mr. Archer of Towers Watson said. In theory, that 30-year-old has until age 65 to make up the losses. ''Even if I'm 60 years old,'' Mr. Archer continued, ''I still have more than seven years, because I'm not planning to use up all my money the day I retire.'' He said ''this gives you as an individual an ability to take on more risk.''
True, defined-benefit managers have access to professional advice and complex investment choices that allow them to hedge against risk. But simplified versions of those investment options are becoming increasingly available to the retail and 401(k) markets. Michael Kresh, president of M. D. Kresh Financial Services in Islandia, N.Y., advocates using Treasury inflation-protected securities, international bonds and mutual funds that specialize in commodities, even if it must be done outside the 401(k), via an individual retirement account.
Whether 401(k) investors decide to be more cautious, less so or stay the course depends on their attitudes toward risk. And that is something that has always been true, regardless of what the big players are doing.

HEADLINE: In Boeing Case, House Passes Bill Restricting Labor Board

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The House voted on Thursday to approve a Republican-backed bill that would prohibit the National Labor Relations Board from trying to block Boeing from operating a new $750 million aircraft assembly line in South Carolina. The largely party-line vote was 238 to 186.
Republicans denounced the labor board's case against Boeing, asserting that the board was overreaching its authority and should not be dictating where companies can locate their operations. But many Democrats and union leaders condemned the legislation, arguing that it undercut an independent federal agency and favored Boeing, a potent lobbying force and prominent political donor. 
Under the bill, an unusual effort to curb a federal agency's actions in a pending case, the labor board would be barred from seeking to have an employer shut, transfer or relocate employment or operations ''under any circumstances.''
The bill, called the ''Protecting Jobs from Government Interference Act,'' is expected to face a battle in the Democratic-controlled Senate. In the House vote, the partisan divide was clear: only eight Democrats voted for the bill and only seven Republicans voted against.
Republicans have repeatedly criticized the board's acting general counsel for filing a complaint against Boeing last April, accusing the company of building an assembly plant in North Charleston, S.C., as a form of retaliation against unionized employees in Washington State who have engaged in five strikes since 1977, including a 58-day-walkout in 2008.
The National Labor Relations Act prohibits companies from taking any actions, whether firing employees or relocating a factory, against workers for exercising federally protected rights that include forming a union or going on strike.
Republicans asserted that the N.L.R.B.'s move was causing some foreign companies to think twice about opening operations in the United States, while Democrats said the bill would speed the exodus of American jobs overseas.
Representative John Kline, a Minnesota Republican who is chairman of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, said: ''This legislation represents an important step in the fight to get our jobs back on track. It tells job creators they don't have to worry about an activist N.L.R.B. telling them where they can locate their business.''
But Representative Rush Holt, a New Jersey Democrat, said the bill ''would be devastating to workers across this country.''
''It makes it easier to shift jobs overseas,'' he said. ''It eliminates the only remedy to force companies to bring back work from overseas. This outsourcers Bill of Rights is not only bad for the interests of workers, it's bad for the economy at large.''
The Boeing case is pending before an administrative law judge, who is to decide whether to order Boeing to move the South Carolina production plant, which assembles 787 Dreamliners, to Washington State. The House bill has a retroactivity clause that would bar the labor board from seeking such an order.
Republicans argue that the bill would still let the labor board pursue many other remedies, among them back pay, although the opening of the assembly line in South Carolina has not caused any layoffs of Boeing workers in Washington State. But officials with the machinists' union say 1,800 may soon be laid off after the new plant gets up to speed.
The labor board's acting general counsel, Lafe Solomon, said on Wednesday that his decision to file a complaint against Boeing ''was based on a careful investigation and a review of the facts under longstanding federal labor law.''
''The decision had absolutely nothing to do with political considerations, and there were no consultations with the White House,'' he said. ''Regrettably, some have chosen to insert politics into what should be a straightforward legal procedure. These continuing political attacks are baseless and unprecedented.'' The general counsel is independent from the full labor board and prosecutes cases asserting unfair labor practices.
To prove that Boeing's move was retaliatory, Mr. Solomon pointed to statements by top Boeing officials saying their unhappiness over past strikes motivated them to build the South Carolina plant. But Boeing officials say South Carolina's low production costs were the reason behind the move.
Jay Timmons, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, applauded the House vote. ''The N.L.R.B.'s actions are having a chilling impact on job creation and causing a great deal of uncertainty for manufacturers throughout the country,'' he said. ''Today's vote is just one step in the process of reining in this rogue agency.''
More than 250 professors signed a letter criticizing the legislation as ''unprecedented interference with a pending legal proceeding for the benefit of a particular employer.'' They said the legislation would severely diminish the board's power to move against employers that illegally retaliate against unionization efforts or protests over working conditions by moving their operations elsewhere. They note that the bill would bar the labor board from bringing actions like the one against a California jewelry manufacturer that announced it was shutting its California operation and moving it to Mexico after its 118 workers voted to unionize. After a federal judge ruled that the company's move was an illegal, retaliatory action, the jewelry company agreed not to move the plant.

HEADLINE: Even a Things-to-Do List Seems to Be Multitasking

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
The curse of Carrie Bradshaw infects ''I Don't Know How She Does It'' with a severe case of what might be called post-Carrie Parkeritis. Parkeritis, if you haven't heard, is the term given to a new ailment named after Sarah Jessica Parker, in which a star finds herself condemned to eke out the last drops of freshness from the role (in this case in ''Sex and the City'') that made her world famous eons ago. In its chemical structure it closely resembles the Roberts Syndrome (as in Julia), first identified in ''Pretty Woman'' and last seen in ''Larry Crowne.''
''I Don't Know How She Does It'' is adapted from Allison Pearson's 2002 novel about a woman who ''has it all'' (to use that awful 1980s cliche), meaning success in business and a happy family. It's a matter of juggling, Ms. Parker's character, Kate Reddy, confides. The secret is not how you catch but how you throw. 
Kate is a hotshot manager for a Boston investment company (in the novel the setting is London), whose long-suffering husband, Richard (Greg Kinnear), a struggling, often unemployed architect, becomes a de facto househusband left to bring up their two young children as Kate's star ascends. Kate boasts that there is still heat between them, but in the minutes between his taking a shower in preparation for a marital tryst and plunking down next to her in bed, she falls fast asleep; so much for heat.
Although the movie is chock-full of smart one-liners, and Ms. Parker's maniacally giddy Kate wages a full-scale charm offensive, the movie inadvertently makes Kate's supposedly golden life look like a living hell. During much of the movie she behaves like a rat in a maze, hyperstimulated by constantly buzzing cellphones as she dashes back and forth between Boston and New York to pitch a deal having something to do with retirement funds. As we all know, going to an airport nowadays is about as much fun as a trip to the hospital.
The jittery momentum of the movie, directed by Douglas McGrath (''Emma,''''Infamous''), mirrors Kate's frazzled state all too well. In one of its more clever touches, the film visualizes Kate's endless things-to-do list that gives her insomnia as an animated scrawl.
Ms. Parker is a reasonably adept physical comedian, and a scene in which Kate, having just learned that her children have lice, frantically scratches her head during a high-powered meeting gives the movie a momentary blip of levity. But more often than not, Ms. Parker's straining to be funny comes across as desperation to please.
With two exceptions, the supporting roles are underwritten and the performances anemic. Mr. Kinnear's Richard is a near-cipher who reacts to Kate's hysteria with mild exasperation, only raising his voice once (and not very loud). Pierce Brosnan, suave as ever but grayer, plays Jack Abelhammer, the company's head honcho in New York with whom Kate teams to pitch the deal. A calm, enlightened, impossibly courtly, unattached widower who tolerates Kate's every quirk and begins to fall in love with her, he is the polar opposite of a driven financial kingpin like Richard Fuld, the final former chief executive of Lehman Brothers. The screenplay by Aline Brosh McKenna (''The Devil Wears Prada,''''27 Dresses'') makes a whole to-do about the signals conveyed by Jack's signing his e-mails to Kate ''xo.''
The movie is unkind to Kate's perceived rivals, both male and female. The head of her Boston office, Clark Cooper (Kelsey Grammer), is a supercilious iceberg; her colleague Chris Bunce (Seth Meyers), a treacherous, grinning back stabber. But neither has enough screen time to register as more than a half-finished sketch. The film is nastier to two Boston matrons, nicknamed ''the Momsters,'' one of whom blithely dispenses anti-Kate barbs while working on an elliptical trainer.
Kate's best friend, Allison (Christina Hendricks), who speaks directly to the camera, has more substance, although her remarks about the different perceptions of similar male and female behavior in the workplace are about as fresh as ''Have a nice day'' and ''Where's the beef?''
The movie's one unalloyed delight is Olivia Munn's portrayal of Kate's poker-faced assistant, Momo, a spiritual first cousin of Anna Kendrick's Natalie Keener in ''Up in the Air,'' but icier and more robotic. Beneath Momo's composure lurks a terror that leaks out when she learns she is pregnant.
Carrie Bradshaw flirted her way into mass consciousness in the late '90s, when Ms. Parker was in her early 30s, and well before Sept. 11, two wars and a major recession dampened American exuberance. If Kate's hyperkinetic cheer and shrill self-absorption are Carrie trademarks, 13 years after ''Sex and the City'' first appeared on television, their appeal has all but evaporated. ''I Don't Know How She Does It'' seems stuck in the past. Except for one acid remark about bankers, the screenplay seems to imagine that the boom years are still upon us.
More than once, a character exclaims, ''Let's make some money!'' But there's no indication that all the wealth pouring down is producing any joy or pleasure, beyond the grim satisfaction of beating the competition and getting the deal done.
''I Don't Know How She Does It'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has mild sexual situations.
I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE DOES IT
Opens on Friday nationwide.

HEADLINE: Living at the Intersection of Public Need and Housing Pride

BYLINE: By SCOTT JAMES.

 BODY:
Valencia Gardens, located in San Francisco's Mission neighborhood, is considered by many to be the Eden of public housing.
The original five-acre complex, a dangerous, drug-infested, crime-ridden scourge, was demolished in 2005. After an investment of $74 million in public and private money, the current 260-unit development opened in 2006 with a clean slate and strict new rules that have made it a safe home for a melting pot of 750 tenants.
Now, some believe, that hard-earned security could be lost. 
The city has approved plans to turn a neighboring vacant brick building at 1731 15th Street, at the corner of Albion, into group housing where 51 or more newly released felons could possibly live.
''We have fought tooth and nail to have what we have today,'' said D. J. Brown, president of the Valencia Gardens Residents Council. ''And to have something across the street that could set us back is totally unacceptable.''
Valencia Garden residents and some of their neighbors will go to the city's Board of Appeals on Sept. 21 to try to stop the project.
But the situation raises issues that go beyond this Mission block -- issues involving communities across California and what to do with thousands of convicted criminals who will soon become the responsibility of local governments, rather than the state prison system.
Under the Criminal Justice Realignment, beginning Oct. 1, counties will send fewer convicted criminals to state prisons. In San Francisco, this means about 700 felons will be added incrementally to the city's criminal justice system over the next year. While many would be incarcerated in the county's jails (capable of holding nearly 800 more inmates than its current prisoner population of 1,490), others would be placed in programs intended to move them back into society.
The shift should reduce chronic overcrowding in the state's prisons, as per a court order, and save the state about $1.4 billion. It also burdens counties with more of the expense as state reimbursement is expected to pay for only half of the additional local costs.
Regardless of the economic impact, some experts believe that the increased use of community-based programs is a plus for rehabilitation, being more effective than what the state has provided in the past.
''It's a golden opportunity to help these individuals change their lives,'' said Wendy Still, the chief of the Adult Probation Office of the City and County of San Francisco, who oversees the post-release supervision of offenders. ''It could break the intergenerational cycle of incarceration.''
The building at 1731 15th Street could house felons in these transitional programs. It was bought for $2 million last year by Barak Jolish, a local developer, and his family, who own several buildings in the neighborhood.
Before acquiring the property, which had sat vacant for years, Mr. Jolish received written approval from the Planning Department that the building could be used for group housing, with convicted criminals specifically mentioned.
''We didn't think it would be a big deal,'' Mr. Jolish said, adding that the building could be used for other types of group housing, although he declined to commit to excluding felons.
The area is zoned for group housing as a ''right,'' said Corey Teague, a city planner familiar with the project. City ordinances do not really distinguish between housing for convicted criminals and other residents, like Buddhist monks, who lived in the building in 1974, Mr. Teague said.
The rules also do not require developers to notify neighbors that felons might be moving in next door -- remarkable in a city where it is otherwise a common practice to send letters to anyone living within 300 feet of benign construction projects.
Kathleen Johnstone, a mother of twins and resident of Albion Street for 11 years, said neighbors learned of the plan only a few weeks ago ''by accident'' and felt betrayed by the city. In response, Ms. Johnstone organized Albion Neighbors to oppose the project. She said her queries to the district's city supervisor, Jane Kim, had gone unanswered.
''We're a fragile neighborhood,'' Ms. Johnstone said. She remembered when Valencia Gardens was a blight that adversely affected several adjacent blocks, and feared that placing dozens of felons -- many of them convicted of drug offenses -- so close to the revitalized complex could reverse its turnaround.
Mr. Brown agreed, and said it was already a constant battle to keep the drug gangs that once ruled the area from reclaiming their turf.
''We didn't just change the skyline,'' Mr. Brown said. ''We transformed a neighborhood.''

HEADLINE: The Company You Keep

BYLINE: By ANN CARRNS

 BODY:
ONE of the biggest challenges of relocating after retirement is making new acquaintances.
''I couldn't imagine going to a location where I didn't know anyone,'' said Karen McGuire, 61, who along with her husband, Brian Hughes, just bought a house to which they plan eventually to retire, a stone's throw from longtime friends on Cape Cod.
While some people want to move closer to friends after retirement, others try to coordinate a plan ahead of time to move together to a new location -- a different home in the same town, another town in the same area, a new community thousands of miles away.
''What's happening now is people are realizing they don't have to start all over again; they can take their friends with them,'' said Marc Freedman, founder of Civic Ventures, a nonprofit organization that seeks to expand opportunities for older Americans, and the author of several books about the changing nature of retirement. ''There is more of a sense of people being more active in the housing decision process.'' 
Many people approaching retirement age are thinking not just about where they want to live after they leave their longtime careers and what sort of home they want, but also about what sort of activities they will do -- and whom they want nearby. ''There are so many options open to the boomer generation, compared with our parents,'' said Dorian Mintzer, a retirement coach with many clients from that generation.
These additional choices come, in part, because the housing industry has recognized the opportunity in the large number of boomers who will be retiring, creating ''so many different options,'' said Nancy Thompson, a spokeswoman for the AARP. While a majority of retirees don't relocate, she said, more are likely to in coming years, simply because there are more boomers.
Dr. Mintzer noted, in particular, the emergence of the co-housing movement and the development of ''village'' networks that allow people to share services as they age. Some people plan to develop these projects themselves; others settle into existing developments and try to recruit friends and neighbors to join them.
''We're close to old friends, and we've met new ones,'' said Betteann Dowd, 68, who with her husband, Tom, has led friends and acquaintances to Bonita Springs, Fla., from Troy, N.Y.
While research shows that moving can be a positive step for retirees, many are anxious about relocating because they are afraid they won't be financially able to go back home if things don't go as planned. The state of the economy and the uncertain real estate market heighten those fears.
''The big thing about moving is the uncertainty,'' said Don Bradley, a sociologist at East Carolina University who has studied retirement and migration. ''So moving where you already know somebody makes it less costly in psychic terms.''
Ms. McGuire and Mr. Hughes, who live outside Boston, aren't ready to retire, but they're planning for it. They had often joked about buying a small hotel on Cape Cod with friends and renovating it so they all could retire together, she said. In recent years, the couple has seen some friends retire and move away -- often to be closer to adult children and grandchildren -- and wondered if they would have any social life left after they stopped working full time.
They mulled moving to a warmer climate but felt they would miss Boston's cultural attractions, she said, and, most significantly, the thought of having to establish an entire new network of friends seemed ''kind of sad,'' she said. (And their grown son lives near Boston.)
In May, while visiting Cape Cod for the 25th wedding anniversary of their friends, Bob Colford and Lynne Conroy, they saw a small cottage for sale just three-tenths of a mile from their friends' home in Hyannis Port. Mr. Hughes has known Mr. Colford since they were second-graders in New Jersey. Ms. McGuire and Ms. Conroy have become good friends, too; the couples traditionally gather to exchange gifts each year on Dec. 23 and have often vacationed together, sometimes with dogs in tow.
So on Aug. 19, they closed on the cottage, an 800-square-foot, two-bedroom property where Ms. McGuire is already spending long weekends. Last year, she left her career as a human resources executive at Citizens Bank and now works part time as a project manager for a nonprofit, matching people 55 and older with volunteer jobs. Mr. Hughes, 62, a software engineer, said he planned to work several more years before retiring and expected he would have a second career, too -- perhaps teaching Pilates.
The couple plans eventually to sell their home in Belmont, a Boston suburb, and use part of the proceeds to renovate the Cape house. ''One thing that attracted us is that the Cape is beautiful,'' said Mr. Hughes, ''but there's also medical facilities available as we get older.''
Ms. McGuire and Ms. Conroy are already looking forward to gardening and kayaking together. ''It's like moving next to family,'' said Ms. Conroy, who is 61 and a retired public school teacher. (Mr. Colford, a television engineer, is 62 and isn't planning on retiring any time soon, she said.)
''The issue of how to maintain a social network in retirement is huge,'' said Catherine Frank, director of the North Carolina Center for Creative Retirement. And many couples, baby boomers in particular, are trying to design a life in retirement that will have meaning and purpose, said Dr. Mintzer, who wrote ''The Couples Retirement Puzzle'' with Roberta K. Taylor.
That outlook was the driving force behind Pat Darlington's push to create Oakcreek, a co-housing community for people 50 and older that is soon to break ground in Stillwater, Okla., one of several co-housing developments around the country focused on older people. Such developments are becoming more popular, said Charles Durrett, author of ''The Senior Co-Housing Handbook,'' because ''what people really want is to be around others they care about and who care about them.''
Ms. Darlington, 60, returned to school to become a licensed therapist after her husband died in a car accident in 1994. A year in New Hampshire as an intern, and dealing long-distance with her aging father, who was in Florida, convinced her that she did not want to grow old in a place where she lacked close ties.
''I really didn't want to leave Stillwater,'' she said. ''It's difficult to recreate yourself someplace else.''
A few years ago she attended a seminar about co-housing -- communities designed to make it easy for residents to socialize and share services and meals if they choose to -- and quickly decided she wanted to create such a place for herself and others in Stillwater. The first friend she asked to participate declined, but a mutual acquaintance jumped in and helped Ms. Darlington with recruiting. They formed a company to develop the project in 2009 and now, with 11 of 24 households committed, expect to break ground this fall.
Oakcreek has an existing home that will be used as a central common house, with new, smaller houses clustered around it. The common house can be retrofitted to include a caretaker's apartment, in the event residents need help with grocery shopping or other daily activities as they age. Developing from the ground up was time-consuming, she said, but it means the community will be as the residents themselves want it. ''If we bought into something,'' she said, ''it would be someone else telling us what old people like.''
Some communities of friends in retirement evolve over time, rather than being planned. Dr. Bradley, of East Carolina University, said these sorts of relocations fit the classic ''chain'' migration model, in which an initial pioneer brings others from the original community and others follow as the connection builds.
The Dowds bought a home in the Worthington Country Club property in Bonita Springs after visiting it at the suggestion of a friend's mother and have lived there full time for seven years. Mr. Dowd, 70, who retired from a small printing business he established in Troy, has spent much of his time since then persuading other ''Trojans'' -- many of them golfing buddies from the Troy Country Club -- to buy homes in Worthington. At least 14 other families have followed, including his former business partner, a doctor, and a former colleague of Mrs. Dowd, a retired operating room nurse.
''We do hang together with the Troy folks, but it's not like we're a clique or anything like that,'' Mr. Dowd said. ''You can't expect to just interact with the people you came down with.''
Linda Garner, 61, and her husband, Kent, 66, of Fairport, N.Y., near Rochester, weren't thinking of living in Florida when they visited their friends, Karen and Bob Miller, at their home in Fort Myers several years ago. But after visiting the Millers, friends from their church who had bought in a development called Pelican Preserve, they decided to buy -- in fact, when their flight home was canceled because of bad weather in New York and they had to stay three extra days, they viewed some properties and bought one.
Now, the Garners are splitting their time between Fairport and Fort Myers, but are building a larger home in Pelican Preserve and expect eventually to move there full time.
The Garners, in turn, urged another Fairport couple, Ralph and Patty Cox, to check out Fort Myers. Mr. Cox, 63, retired as a corporate lawyer three years ago; his wife, 61, is a retired nurse. Two years ago, they rented a place near the Garners for a month in the winter and were hooked. The mortgage on their Fairport home had been paid off by the time they retired, and they didn't want to take on any new debt. But after the real estate market crash, they were able to buy a home for cash, in a short sale.
''Linda Garner took us under her wing and introduced us to everybody,'' Mrs. Cox said. ''It just feels like home.''

HEADLINE: Hedge Fund Chief Takes Major Role in Philanthropy

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- Until last year, Tom Steyer was just another billionaire hedge fund manager intent on keeping a low profile.
''I haven't done that much so there hasn't been that much to talk about,'' Mr. Steyer, 54, said in an interview recently in the offices of his firm, Farallon Capital Management.
What a difference a year makes. First, Mr. Steyer and his wife, Kat Taylor, found themselves on center stage in the nonprofit world when they signed onto the Giving Pledge, the public commitment by the wealthy to give away at least half of their fortunes.
Then Mr. Steyer joined a former secretary of state, George P. Shultz, in a crusade against a ballot measure aimed at halting the imposition of California's stringent clean energy standards. 
Now he is working with his brother Jim, 55, to build the Center for the Next Generation, a nonprofit organization that aims to be a loud voice in major public policy debates.
''Politics push elected officials to consider the short term in their decision making,'' Tom Steyer said. ''We think someone needs to be talking about what we as a society want for the future and the investments we need to make to get there.''
The organization intends to tackle children's issues and the environment, developing analyses and research, and campaigns across all media platforms to highlight the findings. ''We've spent hundreds of billions of dollars on war over the last 10 years at the same time we've been spending less and less on kids,'' Jim Steyer said. ''That's fiscally insane and morally bankrupt, but no one is talking about it.''
More and more of the nation's big philanthropists are devoting their money to influencing public policy, like Charles and David H. Koch, the billionaires behind the Tea Party movement, or Peter B. Lewis and Herb and Marion Sandler, who seeded the liberal Center for American Progress.
Such efforts make many uncomfortable, but the Steyer brothers (Tom is a Democrat, Jim is an independent) say the new center will be ''fiercely'' nonpartisan and work only to get the public to think and talk more about major issues in California and the country at large.
''I believe there is a huge void in American society because no one likes to speak out,'' Tom Steyer said. ''One of the reasons I admire Warren Buffett so much is that he has the courage of his convictions and steps up and takes part in the public debate.''
He pointed to the Kaiser Family Foundation's prominent role in the health care debate as a model for the Center for the Next Generation. ''We will take the issues of this lost generation head on,'' said Matt James, the former Kaiser executive who is the center's chief. ''This will be an aggressive campaign and one that we plan to run for many years, as that is what it will take to begin to turn the tide.''
Tom Steyer and Ms. Taylor have pledged $15 million over five years to seed the center's operations, but it must also raise money on its own. The Ford Foundation already has contributed $500,000, and, given the brothers' network of connections, fund-raising is the least of the organization's worries. ''I call myself a member of the Jim Steyer repertory company,'' his friend Geoffrey Cowan of the University of Southern California joked.
Just 13 months apart in age, the Steyer brothers' early life comes right out of ''The Catcher in the Rye,'' minus its protagonist's angst. They shared a bedroom in an apartment on New York's Upper East Side, attending the Buckley School, then Phillips Exeter Academy and Yale -- where their father, Roy, had attended law school in a class with Potter Stewart, Cyrus R. Vance Sr. and Gerald R. Ford -- and Stanford.
After business school at Stanford, where he met Ms. Taylor, Tom Steyer worked at Goldman Sachs, where his boss on the firm's vaunted risk arbitrage desk was Robert E. Rubin, who later was Treasury secretary. ''One thing I remember about that time is his resume,'' Mr. Rubin said. ''He had graduated summa cum laude from Yale and was captain of the Eli soccer team, and that combination struck me as pretty unusual.''
Jim Steyer bucked the family tradition and went to Stanford as an undergraduate and as a law student. Desiring more knowledge about public interest law, he persuaded the law school dean to give him credit for starting a nonprofit group, the East Palo Alto Community Law Project.
''Jim is the one of us most like our mother,'' Tom Steyer said. Their mother, Marnie Steyer, taught for years in public schools in Harlem and the South Bronx. She ''was fiery and emotional and intuitive,'' Tom Steyer said. ''She cared deeply about things, and Jim does, too.''
In 1988, Jim Steyer started another nonprofit organization, Children Now. A year later, the organization hit the front pages with a ''report card'' on California's children that showed only half were immunized and one-fifth lacked health insurance. He founded a company that produced children's television shows and wrote a book, ''The Other Parent: The Inside Story of the Media's Effect on Our Children.''
That led to the establishment of Common Sense Media, a nonprofit group that helps children and their parents navigate media and technology. The group, with more than 600,000 members and programs in some 20,000 schools, was instrumental in the passage of the California law, recently struck down by the Supreme Court, restricting sales of violent video games.
''Jim is not content to be a maintenance man,'' said Gary Knell, chief executive of Sesame Workshop, producer of ''Sesame Street.'' ''He's always looking for another mountain to hike up; that's what this new venture with his brother is.''
The fight for children's rights seems to have little to do with the environment, but the Steyers say the welfare of both is critical to the country's future. ''Developing advanced energy is critical to our economy, and so is a skilled work force, and both require substantial investments,'' Tom Steyer said.
The letter he and his wife wrote for the Giving Pledge explained that they had more money than they could spend in their lifetimes and ''don't require more material possessions.''
''They live in a very modest house, he drives an old car, he doesn't own a corporate jet -- and then there are those bad ties,'' Mr. Rubin said, referring to Mr. Steyer's habit of wearing cheap, loud plaid or striped ties.
The Steyer-Taylor philanthropy is perhaps best explained by One PacificCoast Bank, which works in low-income neighborhoods that are underserved by mainstream banks. They have invested roughly $50 million in the bank and donated their shares to its foundation.
The TomKat Ranch in Pescadero, Calif., near where Ms. Taylor grew up, is a similar venture -- though she and her husband disagree over whether it will ever be self-sustaining like the bank. ''I lie awake at night worrying about that,'' he joked.
The ranch recently began selling beef (under the brand name Leftcoast Grassfed) from the cattle that graze behind solar-powered fences on native grasses on a schedule designed to protect the soil. ''The first day of sales, they sold out in a few hours, and Kat was so excited,'' Jim Steyer said. ''Tom's take was that she must have mispriced it.''
Tom Steyer and Ms. Taylor have practiced more traditional philanthropy as well, including a $40 million gift to Stanford to underwrite a new institute to tackle energy issues and a $25 million gift to Yale for a similar project.
He said more of their money may go to efforts like fighting Proposition 23, a ballot initiative that would have rolled back state-mandated cuts in greenhouse gases. The initiative was financed by two Texas refiners -- and a petrochemical company owned by the Koch brothers.
Mr. Steyer gave $5 million to the successful effort to defeat it.
The approach he took in that battle offers a hint about how the Center for the Next Generation will operate. Rather than engaging in a bitter debate about environmental benefits of California's emissions requirements, that effort repeatedly emphasized the jobs the standards were creating, the investments they were attracting and their health benefits.
''I've kind of had it with the politics of screaming and yelling and going crazy,'' Mr. Steyer said. ''I won't live by those rules.''

HEADLINE: Fine-Tune a 401(k) or I.R.A., and Cut Costs

BYLINE: By JOHN F. WASIK. 
John F. Wasik offers some tips and guidance for maximizing your returns and strengthening your safety net.

 BODY:
YOU have to dig deep into your retirement accounts to find out how to optimize their performance and bolster your nest egg.
It's almost like a prairie plant. The most important working parts lie well below the surface, yet are worth examining because they are fundamental to long-term growth.
You've probably heard the mantras for prudent retirement management: diversify and reduce risk across stocks, bonds and alternatives; keep costs low by investing in passive index funds; and ensure that your allocation matches your age and risk tolerance. 
Beyond these fundamentals, you should add a high degree of fine-tuning. You will need to involve your employer if you have a 401(k)-type plan. People with Individual Retirement Accounts can do it mostly on their own.
The first leg of an overhaul should be to examine your account for often-hidden internal expenses. There may be layers of middleman fees that you can eliminate simply by changing vendors. Generally, plans sold by insurance agents (particularly with onerous ''wrap'' fees) and by stockbrokers tend to be the most expensive. Avoid funds sold with a commission, which will eat into your returns.
It may take some dedicated sleuthing to find some of the most pernicious expenses within a retirement plan. One key to telling if a plan may be loaded with middleman costs is to ask the 401(k) plan administrator if revenue-sharing fees are being paid. If they are, they will ultimately be deducted from your assets and pare your savings, although you may not see the fees on your statement.
''It's rare that a plan doesn't pay revenue-sharing,'' said Dan Solin, of Index Fund Advisors in Bonita Springs, Fla., the author of ''The Smartest Portfolio You'll Ever Own'' (Penguin, 2011). How do you rid a plan of revenue-sharing fees? Mr. Solin says to hire someone to act as a full fiduciary for the plan's design, management and administration. Only full fiduciaries will accept a binding legal responsibility to create plans -- and pare costs to a bare minimum -- that work in your best interests, he said. Both the Labor Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are working on fiduciary rules for plan managers and brokers; their final wording and coverage is still uncertain.
If you dig into plan documents, you may encounter some confusing definitions of fiduciary duty. They are not all the same. Precise definitions are important.
''On the fiduciary issue, my advice is to avoid 3(21) Erisa fiduciaries and to insist your fiduciary be a 3(38) Erisa fiduciary,'' said Mr. Solin, who is a lawyer, referring to a law called the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. ''You can't be a fiduciary and accept revenue-sharing.''
Speaking of reducing middleman fees, here's another way to overhaul your plan, although a less-than-perfect method. By adding exchange-traded funds to your retirement account, you can almost always lower costs and obtain more diversification. Exchange-traded funds are pools of assets like mutual funds that are openly traded on stock exchanges.
Most of these funds are based on indexes that own broad swaths of markets, so you need only a few funds like the iShares Lehman Aggregate Bond Fund (AGG), the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index (VTI) and the Vanguard Total World Stock Index (VT). These three funds give you sweeping exposure to most of the bond and stock markets in the United States, as well as to foreign stocks.
If you don't want to create an exchange-traded fund retirement plan on your own, consider a platform that sets up portfolios for you. Services like Invest n Retire, which doesn't pay revenue-sharing fees, will set up model portfolios. Folio Investing is worth considering if you want to set up a portfolio yourself.
If you are more self-directed, you can buy exchange-traded funds commission-free for your retirement plans through discount brokers like TD Ameritrade. Fidelity Investments, the Vanguard Group and Charles Schwab also sell certain exchange-traded funds with no commission charged.
For getting the best risk-adjusted allocation, it may make sense to find a registered investment adviser or fee-only certified financial planner to help you create the right portfolio.
''You need to look at this holistically,'' said Jerome Golden, president of Golden Retirement in New York. ''Spendable retirement income is the ultimate goal.''
The main theme in any retirement plan overhaul is to diversify as much as possible in passive funds and switch out of actively managed funds, because fewer than 5 percent of them even equal their benchmark in any given decade.
Other than reducing internal expenses, a general policy of contributing as much as you can -- and keeping money in the plan until age 59 1/2 -- can pad your retirement income.
The Internal Revenue Service has strict rules for loan withdrawals. Generally, you have to pay them back within five years or face penalties. Exceptions are available for expenses like medical situations or college payments, but in the end the I.R.S. will demand its due. And if you change employers, you have to pay back the loan in full -- or face taxes and penalties.
The stock markets are volatile. Interest rates are extremely low. The economic outlook in the United States and abroad is uncertain. And proposals are circulating in Washington to make changes to Social Security and to Medicare. It is a stressful time to contemplate retirement and what income (and expenses) await.

HEADLINE: Markets Cheer Central Banks' Effort to Stabilize Europe

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
A joint effort by five major central banks to support Europe's financial system set off a rally in stocks Thursday. Gold plunged and Treasury yields rose as traders sold the safest investments. Markets in Europe soared.
The European Central Bank, the United States Federal Reserve and three other central banks said Thursday they would provide European banks with unlimited dollar loans. The aim is to fend off worries that the banks could be weakened by their holdings of government bonds from Greece and other struggling European countries.
''It's a pretty powerful action,'' said Brian Gendreau, senior investment strategist at the Cetera Financial Group. ''And it's another piece of news that leads you to think the crisis in Europe could be on the road to resolution.'' 
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 186.45 points, or 1.7 percent, to close at 11,433.18.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 20.43 points, or 1.7 percent, to 1,209.11. The index has jumped 4.8 percent this week but is still 10 points short of where it started the month.
Gold plunged $45, or 2.5 percent, to settle at $1,778 an ounce. Treasury prices fell, pushing their yields up. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 26/32, to 100 12/32, and the yield rose to 2.08 percent from 1.99 percent late Wednesday.
The Nasdaq rose 34.52 points, 1.34 percent, to 2,607.07. The index has jumped 5.6 percent so far this week and is up 1.1 percent in September. The Dow is down 1.6 percent this month, the S.& P. 0.8 percent.
Daniel Alpert, managing partner at Westwood Capital in New York, said the stock market had been overreacting to Europe's debt crisis, swinging in response to each new development.
''Every time there's news out of Europe that's not bad, the market reacts positively, and that's occurring on almost a nightly basis,'' he said. ''You'd think the U.S. economy might be part of what the market trades on, but the fact of the matter is, today and recently, it's all been about Europe.''
Bank stocks led the market higher. The Goldman Sachs Group rose 3 percent to $107.97. Bank of America rose 4 percent to $7.33. Morgan Stanley jumped 7 percent to $16.59 after reporting that its chairman, John J. Mack, would step down at the end of the year.
The stock market's gains were tempered by a mixed batch of economic reports. First-time claims for unemployment benefits rose by 11,000 last week, to 428,000. The New York and Philadelphia branches of the Federal Reserve also reported weak manufacturing in their regions.
On the positive side, factory output rose 0.5 percent in August, after increasing 0.6 percent in July. Autos and related products increased 2.6 percent, evidence that supply chain disruptions stemming from the Japan earthquake continued to ease.
Among stocks making big moves, HCA Holdings, a hospital chain, rose 12 percent to $20.84 after it said it would buy back more than $1 billion of its stock from Bank of America.
Research in Motion fell sharply in after-hours trading after falling less than 1 percent and closing at $29.54 in regular trading. The maker of BlackBerry mobile devices reported earnings and sales that came in far below Wall Street's estimates.
The Swiss bank UBS fell 10 percent to $11.41 on news that a trader could cost the bank as much as $2.2 billion. The bank warned that it could post a loss for the quarter as a result of the unauthorized trade.
Netflix fell almost 19 percent to $169.25, the biggest drop among stocks in the S.& P. 500 index, after the company said it expected fewer people to subscribe to its DVD-by-mail service as well as its streaming movie service.

HEADLINE: Uncertainty on Wall Street, Big Deals on Madison Avenue

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
THREE years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers produced worldwide financial disruption, advertising agencies continue to face significant challenges. But Madison Avenue is, by and large, in better shape than many of the industries for which it creates ads.
To be sure, numerous agencies have succumbed to business woes. But no holding company that owns agencies has gone bankrupt. No agency with offices around the world has been forced to close, nor has any big agency in a large market like New York. And agencies are still making deals, actively pursuing mergers and acquisitions.
This summer, for instance, holding companies like Havas, the Publicis Groupe and WPP have announced deals for agencies like Big Fuel, DPZ, Host and Lunchbox. 
And on Thursday, Publicis said that it would buy Schwartz Communications, a public relations agency with offices in Boston, London, San Francisco and Stockholm. It was the sixth acquisition of a public relations agency by Publicis in 18 months, according to The Holmes Report, a trade publication.
Another example of the trend will come on Friday, when MDC Partners, which owns agencies like Crispin Porter & Bogusky and Kirshenbaum Bond Senecal & Partners, is to announce the acquisition of majority stakes in two specialty agencies.
One agency, Concentric Pharma Advertising, creates campaigns for pharmaceutical marketers like Bayer, Novartis, Pfizer and Roche. Concentric has 75 employees who work at a headquarters in New York and an office in London.
The other agency, Laird & Partners, is based in New York and also has about 75 employees. It specializes in ads for beauty, fashion and luxury-goods marketers like DKNY, Gap, Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein.
MDC is estimated to be paying $20 million for the majority ownership stakes in both agencies, with additional considerations based on future performance.
The acquisitions are the second and third this year for MDC, which is based in Toronto and owns all or part of about 50 agencies. The previous deal in 2011 involved a New York agency named Anomaly. MDC made 13 acquisitions last year and two in 2009.
''When others are fearful, we are ambitious, and when others are ambitious, we are fearful,'' said Miles S. Nadal, chairman and chief executive at MDC. ''We see this time of uncertainty as a great opportunity.''
Although ''the European debt crisis is a big issue because it's affecting the confidence of C.E.O.'s everywhere,'' Mr. Nadal acknowledged, ''business for us has been terrific,'' with a 24 percent increase in the first half in organic growth -- revenue minus acquisitions and currency exchange -- compared with the same period last year.
''We do not see any change in our clients' patterns of behavior'' in recent weeks, Mr. Nadal said. ''The spending continues.''
That has encouraged him to pursue a ''much more aggressive'' acquisition strategy, he added, zeroing in on agencies in the fast-growing realms of digital marketing, social media and analytics; agencies in Asia, Europe and Latin America; and specialty agencies like Concentric and Laird.
Concentric was appealing, Mr. Nadal said, because health care ''is obviously a critical area'' in marketing. And Laird was appealing, he added, because ''fashion, like music, is at the epicenter of pop culture.''
MDC and Concentric came to know each other in the last 18 months after Concentric began working on assignments with MDC agencies like Allison & Partners, Attention Partners and Kirshenbaum Bond Senecal.
''It solidified our belief that MDC was the right partner for us to help accelerate our growth and the growth of our clients' brands,'' said Ken Begasse Jr., who is co-chief executive at Concentric with Michael Sanzen.
''We're already talking about establishing a satellite office on the West Coast,'' he added.
Concentric, which was opened in 2003, had previously entertained offers, Mr. Begasse said, but he and Mr. Sanzen believed MDC's ''entrepreneurial bent'' best matched theirs.
An agency ''we were in talks with earlier ended up acquiring a different agency,'' he added, which ''was renamed two times and now no longer exists.'' Trey Laird, chief executive and chief creative officer at Laird, which was opened in 2002, said that he, too, had ''talked to lots of the different players'' in Madison Avenue deal-making circles.
He found MDC attractive, he added, because ''I never got the sense there was a corporate way of doing things that was enforced on you.''
Mr. Laird was introduced to Mr. Nadal through a mutual friend, Hamilton South, who sold a majority stake in his fashion-focused public relations agency, the HL Group, to MDC in 2007.
''It was nice to know someone who'd been through this whom I trusted,'' Mr. Laird said.
Being part of MDC could help ''take what we do to the next level,'' he added, listing goals like expanding the digital division, adding offices overseas and ''taking our expertise in fashion, luxury, beauty -- high-image-driven brands -- and applying it to other categories.''
Mr. Laird, like Mr. Nadal, said he had seen no signs of ''dramatic shifts'' in advertisers' spending plans in response to the recent turmoil in American and European financial markets, which he described this way: ''It's up. It's down. It's recovered. It's not.''
''Certainly, everyone is watching everything closely,'' Mr. Laird said, but clients know that ''going dark'' -- that is, to stop running ads -- ''is not going to do any good when it's so competitive.''
''You have to get in the ring, and you have to duke it out,'' he added.

HEADLINE: Teaching as a Second, or Even Third, Career

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

 BODY:
AT 65, Walt Patteson has two careers behind him and is relishing his third as a high school chemistry teacher. He is one of the retirement-age Americans who are finding new uses for their skills by deciding to teach.
As the baby boomers reach retirement age, some of those anticipating a new career are enrolling at community colleges and in state-approved or private programs to convert their professional expertise to the classroom. Even the recent public criticism of teachers and cuts in school budgets have not deterred retirees from getting teaching credentials -- and finding paying jobs, especially in math, science and special education.
Many come to teaching later in life because they want a challenge. Some want to do good or keep active. Others need an income or a supplement to retirement savings. And some, like Mr. Patteson, need a nudge to explore teaching.
''My wife told me she wasn't going to keep working while I went out every day to play golf,'' Mr. Patteson said. After 10 years in the Navy, where he was a pilot, he returned home to help run his family's farm in Tracy, Calif. But two decades later, in 1999, when the farm was sold, he was only 53 and he wanted to do something community minded. 
Mr. Patteson, who had been a local school board member, heard about an opening at the nearby West High School to teach science, and decided to build on his science and math background to become a teacher. Taking part in one of California's 70 alternative teaching preparation programs, he passed an exam to measure his chemistry knowledge, then took classes and taught. He earned the state's credential to teach chemistry in 2004.
Like California, where alternative teaching programs are grouped under the California Teacher Corps, all 50 states allow aspiring teachers to bypass the traditional education degree and take a shorter route to the classroom -- using the knowledge acquired from college and careers.
Although there is no official tracking of educators older than 50, the nonprofit National Center for Education Information's ''Profile of Teachers in the U.S. 2011'' found that 54,000 of new teacher hires, or about one-third, in the 2007-8 school year were ''delayed entrants,'' people with college degrees who did not enter teaching right after college.
While the battered economy has meant fewer teacher retirements than expected, many school districts still have openings in math, science, special education and English as a second language. By the end of the decade, 440,000 new elementary and secondary teachers will be needed as the total number of teachers reaches slightly more than four million, as projected by the National Center for Education Statistics, part of the Education Department.
Many openings will be in math and science. According to a 2007 study, public schools will need more than 280,000 new math and science teachers by 2015, especially those in low-income school districts. The report was issued by the Business-Higher Education Forum, a national group of senior business and higher education executives.
Among the Web sites available to guide older career changers is Teach.gov, started by the Education Department last year. The teacher recruitment site lists each state's alternative certification programs and facts about financial aid, school districts and licensing and certification.
Teach.gov also tracks elementary and secondary teaching openings -- 663 nationwide were listed early this month, most in early childhood and special education. It also lists the top three states now hiring: Massachusetts, South Carolina and Illinois.
''There is an incredible opportunity here for those who are pursuing encore careers,'' said Brad Jupp, senior program aide to the education secretary, Arne Duncan, who helped start the site.
Some people pursuing second or third careers are earning teaching credentials at community colleges. Civic Ventures, a San Francisco research organization for baby boomers, and the MetLife Foundation recently gave 25 community colleges around the country a one-time $25,000 grant to encourage people 50 and older to switch to teaching.
Harold Washington College, in midtown Chicago, used its grant to advertise in the Chicago Symphony playbill and the Lyric Opera guide. It wanted to attract people over 50 who had master's degrees to enter its program to learn about becoming adjunct college instructors.
''We hire 250 instructors a year, and science and math skills are at a premium,'' said John Hader, associate dean at the college. ''We chose 55 applicants who qualified in these areas and taught them how to manage a classroom, assess student learning levels, use educational technology and encourage active learning.''
Some companies help pay for second-career teachers. Barry Ostrer, who spent 32 years with I.B.M. in White Plains, took advantage of its Transition to Teaching program, which gives as much as $15,000 to employees of at least 10 years who want a career in education.
Mr. Ostrer began his second career this month teaching math to fifth graders at a private school in Englewood, N.J. He earned a bachelor's degree in math at Tufts and reignited his interest in the subject while tutoring the children of friends.
Over six years, taking one or two courses at a time, he earned a master's degree in teaching from Manhattanville College in Purchase in 2010.
''This is a way for me to help students overcome math anxiety,'' said Mr. Ostrer, 54, who worked at I.B.M. in programming and sales and as a liaison with industry analysts. ''I'm way too young to do nothing.''
Teaching offers other rewards, Mr. Patteson found. His students and colleagues provided support when his wife became ill, and died in 2008, he said. As long as he can do the work, he is not considering retiring from his third career. ''It's a little like having 150 grandchildren,'' he said. ''They'll talk to you about things they'd never bring up with their parents. You can discipline, scold, cajole and motivate them in ways that they would rebel against if someone else tried it.''
Web sites that help with the decision to teach:
Teach.gov, an Education Department site that lists, by state, alternative certification programs; information on financial aid, school districts, and licensing and certification as well as state-specific teacher openings.
TheApple.monster.com is a guide to alternative programs to speed certification for people who have college degrees but lack teaching experience, and to find teacher shortage areas.
AllEducationSchools.com has information on teaching subjects like science, and links to learn about how to be certified.
Teachers-Teachers.com lists jobs for teachers, administrators and others.
Encore.org, the Civic Ventures site, provides information about second, and third, careers, including links to learning and work opportunities and ways to connect with people and groups involved in encore careers.
Cateachercorps.org, the California Teacher Corps site, helps connect to the 70 alternative preparation programs.
Alt-teachercert.org, the National Association for Alternative Certification site, provides information about nontraditional educator preparation.
Abcte.org, the American Board for Certification of Teacher Excellence site, has information on finding, preparing and certifying teachers.
Ncei.com, the National Center for Education Information site, provides a profile of American teachers and links to information about teacher preparation, certification and licensing.

HEADLINE: In Honduras, Land Struggles Highlight Post-Coup Polarization

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN

 BODY:
TOCOA, Honduras -- The settlement on the giant Maranones plantation looks like a refugee camp, where children play between rows of huts and chickens peck at garbage heaps. But the farmworkers living here plan to stay, laying claim to land owned by one of the country's richest men.
At the gate, a handful of men sit guard with shotguns and machetes under a red flag painted with defiant words: ''Justice, Liberty, Land.''
''If they give land to the people, the problem can be resolved,'' said Marcos Tulio Paredes, one of the community's leaders. 
In the past few weeks, a long-running battle over land in Bajo Aguan, this fertile valley near Honduras's northern coast, has flared. At least 15 people have been killed in recent weeks alone, including two of the workers' leaders, and the people here are on edge, fearful that the unrest could spread.
The conflict in Bajo Aguan is the most volatile example of the social divide that burst into view in this tiny impoverished country two years ago, when the country's power brokers orchestrated a military coup to expel the president at the time.
A veneer of normality has returned. A new president was elected on schedule, and the ousted former president finally returned from exile in May. But the political polarization that the coup revealed and the violence it stoked -- including the murders of journalists and government opponents -- have persisted, and no place more so than in Bajo Aguan.
''The opportunity was lost to introduce some very significant reforms that were sorely needed in Honduras,'' said Kevin Casas-Zamora, an expert on Central America at the Brookings Institution in Washington. ''Honduras is a country with obscene social imbalances, and very little is being done to address that.''
In Bajo Aguan, where oil palm tree plantations occupy most of the farmland, President Porfirio Lobo has alternated between sending troops and brokering agreements between farmworker groups and the businessmen who own vast sections of the valley. But events rapidly slip beyond the government's control.
''This is a country where there are no institutions,'' said Elvin Hernandez, a researcher at the Jesuit-supported Reflection, Research and Communication Team in the city of El Progreso. ''It is the law of the strongest and Aguan is the place where you see that most clearly.''
The government appeared to move forward on negotiating a solution last week, when Congress approved a mechanism to guarantee bank loans that would allow the farmworkers to buy land. An estimated 4,000 families will be eligible for 15-year loans to buy more than 11,000 acres.
But the 1,400 families camped on the Maranones plantation since last year have been frozen out of the latest pact. Without a title, they fear they could be evicted at any time.
''It is better to die here,'' said one leader, who asked that her name not be used because she had received threats. ''We don't have anywhere else to go. We can't give up on the struggle. Where would that leave the deaths of our comrades? In vain?''
The presence of hundreds of troops sent here after the latest round of violence could also set off more conflict. ''It's a very critical situation,'' said Sandra Ponce, the Honduran attorney general for human rights. ''What is latent elsewhere has already developed in Bajo Aguan.''
The conflict here goes back to the early 1990s, when wealthy landowners bought up plantations from farmer cooperatives. Farmworker groups argue that these purchases were illegal because members of the cooperatives were tricked by their leaders or signed deals they did not understand.
The largest single landowner in the region is Corporation Dinant, owned by Miguel Facusse, the octogenarian patriarch of one of the handful of families controlling much of Honduras's economy. The company owns about one-fifth of all the agricultural land in Bajo Aguan, more than 22,000 acres of well-groomed plantations that supply oil for export and for its snack foods, margarine and cooking oil business. It acquired that land legally, said Roger Pineda, the company's treasurer.
''The country needs agrarian reform,'' Mr. Pineda said. ''Too many people don't have land. But not on the lands that are already under production. It can't be, 'I like your car, and then I take it.' ''
Just days before he was ousted in June 2009, former President Manuel Zelaya intervened in the disputes, signing an agreement to start talks on redistributing land. In December that year, farmworkers staged coordinated land invasions to put pressure on Mr. Lobo.
The occupations cost Dinant $20 million in lost revenue last year, Mr. Pineda said. In addition, pressure by rights groups this year prompted a German investment bank to withdraw a loan, he said.
The choreography of evictions in Bajo Aguan unfolds violently but fails to sap the workers' resolve.
In June, 300 families who had been living for 11 years on a farm of orange groves outside the hamlet of Rigores were expelled by soldiers and police officers who gave them two hours to gather their possessions. Then the men torched and bulldozed their houses, their two churches and their school. Three days later, the farmworkers came back to the farm and began to rebuild.
Against the backdrop of negotiations, murders have continued. More than 40 people, most of them workers, have been killed in the region since the beginning of last year, said Ms. Ponce, the government's human rights prosecutor. ''Not a single investigation has been concluded,'' she said. When impunity is the rule, she added, ''it does not contribute to discouraging the violence.''
The workers have accused the landowners' security guards of carrying out the killings. Mr. Pineda denied that, except in the case of five workers killed by Dinant guards during a land invasion last year.
Adding to the combustible mix is the rise of drug trafficking in the region, which has become an important transshipment point, like much of Central America. Drug traffickers may be encouraging some groups to take over land that could be used for landing strips, Ms. Ponce said.
The latest violence flared up last month when four Dinant security guards, a company employee and a teenager were found dead after an unknown group invaded the Paso de Aguan plantation. Five more people were killed the next day.
In late August, two farmworker leaders, both of them involved in negotiations with the government, were also killed. One of them, Secundino Ruiz Vallecillo, was shot by a motorcyclist as he was driving home after making a withdrawal from the bank. Eliseo Pavon, his close friend and the group's treasurer, was slightly wounded in the attack.
Mr. Pavon waved off the government's theory that the motive was robbery and accused the landowners of ordering his friend's slaying.
''They think that with this they can weaken the group, stop the fight,'' he said. ''But it won't happen.''

HEADLINE: Berkeley Museum Unveils New Design

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
The University of California, Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive on Wednesday presented the schematic design for the transformation of a former printing plant into its new home, designed by the New York firm Diller Scofidio + Renfro. 
Located at 2120 Oxford Street in Berkeley's arts district, the $100 million project is scheduled to be completed in late 2015; $65 million has been raised so far. The design combines the existing 1939 concrete Art Deco-style building, unoccupied since 2004, with a new metal-clad, skylighted structure that will include galleries, a 32-seat screening room, a store and a learning center.
''They have managed with great dexterity and ingenuity to accommodate the limitations and opportunities of the site and the constraints of the budget in concert with our programmatic requirements to create a facility that I think will be really a surprising and beautiful and highly functional addition to the Bay Area cultural scene,'' the museum's director, Lawrence Rinder, said in an interview.
The museum began planning for a new home in 1997, when an engineering survey determined that its current building on Bancroft Way did not meet present-day seismic standards and could not be upgraded to meet those standards without eliminating the open space required for the museum's exhibition program. After abandoning a 2006 design by Toyo Ito & Associates in 2009 because of the recession, the museum searched for a new firm.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: House Republicans Push Stopgap Spending Bill

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In last year's campaigns, Republicans ripped into Democrats for failing to perform one of Congress's most basic duties: providing money in a timely way for the operations of government.
But Republicans acknowledged Thursday that they would miss the deadline they had promised to meet. They began to rush a stopgap spending bill through the House because, they said, Congress could not finish work on any of the 12 regular appropriations bills before the new fiscal year starts in two weeks, on Oct. 1.
The stopgap measure maintains spending for the first 49 days of the fiscal year, through Nov. 18, with a 1.5 percent across-the-board cut from current levels, averting at least for now the threat of a government shutdown. Congressional leaders hope the additional time allows them to finish many of the overdue spending measures. 
In addition, the stopgap bill includes $3.65 billion in assistance for people affected by Hurricane Irene, wildfires, floods, tornadoes and other natural disasters. Of this amount, $1 billion would be offset by cutting a loan guarantee program for production of more fuel-efficient cars. Republicans' insistence on the offset infuriated Democrats, who said no such offset had been required for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
By a vote of 62 to 37, the Senate on Thursday approved a $7 billion disaster relief measure after rejecting Republican efforts to offset the costs. How differences with the House will be resolved is unclear.
Representative Harold Rogers, Republican of Kentucky and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said he would have preferred to complete all the bills before Sept. 30. ''Unfortunately,'' he said, ''the Senate is slightly behind schedule.''
Republicans offered several reasons for missing the deadline. They spent the first few months of the year cleaning up after Democrats who had failed to pass any spending bills for 2011. They spent much of July wrangling with President Obama over an increase in the federal debt limit. When the House took up spending bills for 2012, Republicans allowed wide-open debate and hundreds of amendments, including many offered by Republicans who wanted deeper cuts or more restrictions on use of the money by Mr. Obama.
In the past, lawmakers sought seats on the Appropriations Committees so they could secure more money for programs and projects they liked. But the dynamic is entirely different this year, as pet projects have been drastically curtailed and the committees must cut spending for many programs because of constraints imposed by the new debt limit law.
The chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Daniel K. Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii, said that even military spending had come under the knife ''in this austere fiscal climate.''
Senator John McCain of Arizona, the senior Republican on the Armed Services Committee, said, ''Real defense cuts are coming.'' And they ''will require a change in culture at the Defense Department,'' which in the past ''has just reached for more money as the solution to most problems,'' Mr. McCain said.
The House has passed 6 of the 12 regular spending bills for 2012, and a seventh, providing money for the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department, was on the floor for four days with no final resolution. The House Appropriations Committee has approved three other bills that have not gone to the House floor. The committee has not even released the text of the most contentious bill, which provides money for the Labor Department and the Department of Health and Human Services.
The Senate has passed just one 2012 spending bill, which would provide $144 billion for military construction projects and veterans' programs. The House has passed a similar bill, but has not responded to the Senate's request to hash out a compromise in a conference committee.
On Thursday, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved four 2012 bills, including one that would freeze spending for the normal activities of the Defense Department at $513 billion, which is $26 billion less than Mr. Obama requested and $17 billion less than the House approved in July. The bill would cut $695 million from the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the Pentagon's largest weapons program.
In addition, the bill would provide $117.6 billion, as requested by Mr. Obama, for ''overseas contingency operations'' related mainly to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
Republicans see the spending bills as a way to clip the wings of federal regulators.
In January, Mr. Obama signed a food safety law that provides broad new authority to the Food and Drug Administration. But one of the 2012 spending bills passed by the House would cut the agency's budget.
Mr. Obama proposed an increase of more than 50 percent for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission so it could step up regulation of the financial industry and begin policing the over-the-counter derivatives market under the Dodd-Frank Act. The House-passed bill would cut the agency's current budget by 15 percent, to $172 million.
Representative Marcy Kaptur, Democrat of Ohio, said the bill ''takes cops off the beat at the commission, which provides a critical bulwark against the type of speculation and fraud that led our country into the worst recession since the Depression.''
But Representative Jack Kingston, Republican of Georgia and chief author of the bill, said that Democrats ''love more regulations,'' and that the Dodd-Frank law was ''an overreach, more government telling people how to conduct their business.''
Representative James P. Moran, Democrat of Virginia, said the House version of the E.P.A. spending bill carried ''a wish list for special interests -- oil companies, cattle grazers, industrial agribusiness, miners and those who wish to pollute our air and water.''
Mr. Rogers said that in its zeal for regulation, the agency had lost touch with ''economic reality.''
The House bill would also prevent the National Park Service from carrying out boat inspections on waterways in the Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve in Alaska.
''The Park Service in Alaska has become, very frankly, like an occupying army of a free territory,'' said Representative Don Young, Republican of Alaska, and he pointed to a case in which he said federal agents had manhandled a 70-year-old on a Yukon River cruise.

HEADLINE: New Book Tells of Discord In Obama Economic Team

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A new book claims that President Obama's response to the economic crisis was hampered by a White House economic staff plagued by internal rivalries, a domineering chief adviser and a Treasury secretary who dragged his feet on enforcing decisions with which he disagreed.
The book, by Ron Suskind, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, quotes White House documents that say Mr. Obama's decisions were routinely ''re-litigated'' by the chairman of the National Economic Council, Lawrence H. Summers. Some decisions, including one to overhaul the debt-ridden Citibank, were carried out sluggishly or not at all by a resistant Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, according to the book. 
Mr. Suskind quotes from two memos for the president in which Pete Rouse, a senior White House aide, wrote, ''There is deep dissatisfaction within the economic team with what is perceived as Larry's imperious and heavy-handed direction of the economic policy process.''
A copy of the book, ''Confidence Men: Wall Street, Washington, and the Education of a President,'' published by HarperCollins, was obtained by The New York Times before it officially goes on sale on Tuesday. The White House declined to comment on Mr. Suskind's account, which he said was based on interviews with more than 200 people, including the president.
The book offers a portrait of a White House operating under intense pressure as it dealt with a cascade of crises, from insolvent banks to collapsing carmakers. And it details the rivalries among figures around the president, including Mr. Summers; Mr. Geithner; the former chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel; and the budget director, Peter R. Orszag.
In this rough-and-tumble environment, the book reports, female staff members often felt bruised. At a dinner with Mr. Obama in November 2009, several top female aides -- including Anita Dunn, who was the communications director, and Christina Romer, the chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers -- told the president about being talked over in meetings by male colleagues or cut out altogether.
Ms. Romer, the book says, once passed a note to Mr. Summers threatening to walk out of a dinner with Mr. Obama and outside economists after the president polled his guests for their recommendations but failed to recognize her.
''It was lighthearted. It was not me threatening to walk,'' Ms. Romer said in an interview from Berkeley, Calif., where she is a professor at the University of California. ''My God, who would walk out on the president?''
Mr. Summers, who has returned to a teaching position at Harvard, did not comment.
In the book, Mr. Geithner denies that he obstructed any presidential directive. A senior Treasury official said a government restructuring of Citibank would have occurred only if the Treasury had been left with a significant ownership stake in the bank after it emerged from a financial stress test.
The book claims that Mr. Obama pushed out two of his closest aides, Robert Gibbs, the press secretary, and David Axelrod, his senior adviser, earlier than planned in a housecleaning after the midterm elections.
Mr. Axelrod said he had long planned to leave the administration after two years. ''I had an ironclad agreement with my wife that I would do two years, and everyone knew it,'' he said. Mr. Gibbs said he had contacted Robert Barnett, a Washington lawyer who helps public officials land private-sector jobs, in October to begin planning his future since he intended to leave the White House early in 2011.

HEADLINE: Boehner, in Washington Speech, Reaffirms No-Tax-Increase Position

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR and EMMARIE HUETTEMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Speaker John A. Boehner on Thursday rejected tax increases as part of a sweeping effort to reduce the nation's debt, delivering his prescription for a Congressional deficit-cutting committee ahead of a competing presentation by President Obama early next week.
Mr. Boehner urged the new bipartisan committee to focus on cuts in federal spending and entitlement programs as a way of slowing the growth of government. He said tax increases should be ''off the table'' as the committee works toward a late-November deadline. 
''It's a very simple equation,'' Mr. Boehner said in a speech to the Economic Club of Washington. ''Tax increases destroy jobs. And the joint committee is a jobs committee. Its mission is to reduce the deficit that is threatening job creation in our country.''
The committee -- a group of six Democrats and six Republican from both chambers -- met privately Thursday morning. ''We like to eat breakfast without having cameras in our face,'' Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas and co-chairman of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, told reporters in explaining the decision to take the committee's deliberations behind closed doors.
Earlier in the day, a bipartisan collection of senators informally calling themselves the ''group of 36,'' urged the panel to seek $4 trillion in deficit reductions, far more than the $1.5 trillion called for in their mandate.
''We're with you,'' said Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota and chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. ''Be bold. Be brave. Go big.''
In his speech, Mr. Boehner warned against the use of what he called ''gimmicks'' to lower the debt. But he hinted that there might be areas for compromise that could be acceptable to his members.
Building on a proposal he tried to negotiate this year with Mr. Obama, Mr. Boehner said that the committee's efforts should include proposals to close tax loopholes as part of a broader overhaul that lowers personal and business tax rates. Some Republicans have balked at Democratic proposals to close tax loopholes, calling them tax increases. But Mr. Boehner said he was open to the idea.
''Yes, tax reform should include closing loopholes,'' he said. ''Not for purposes of bringing more money to the government. But because it's the right thing to do.''
Mr. Boehner also criticized a common talking point of some of his Tea Party members -- that cuts in spending designed to take place in later years are not real, meaningful cuts. He called that idea a myth that needed to be put to rest for the committee to be free to do its work effectively.
''That myth is built on a healthy skepticism that spending cuts made today are going to be implemented tomorrow,'' Mr. Boehner said. ''But it is a myth nonetheless, and we need to make sure it doesn't stop us from doing what needs to be done.''
In his speech, Mr. Boehner called on members in both parties to end the ''name-calling, the yelling and the questioning of others' motives.'' But he also offered a tough appraisal as the president continues to press his case for his jobs plan.
Mr. Boehner called it a ''poor substitute'' for pro-growth policies and accused him of offering ''initiatives that seem to have more to do with the next election than the next generation.''
The White House press secretary, Jay Carney, issued a statement Thursday night saying: ''Any plan to grow the economy and create jobs should be measured by whether it puts money in the pockets of middle-class families, puts teachers, police officers, firefighters and construction workers back to work, and invests in our small businesses so they can grow and hire. The president's plan meets that test.''
The speaker promised that House Republicans would consider the president's proposals. But he said that the government had gotten in the way of private business and that Mr. Obama's proposals were ''more of the same.''
''Job creators in America are essentially on strike,'' Mr. Boehner said. ''The problem is not confusion about the policies. The problem is the policies.''
With even some Democrats expressing reservations about the Obama jobs proposal, senior officials from the administration met with Democratic senators on Capitol Hill on Thursday to make the White House case for it. Not all were convinced.
Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, who said after the meeting that she did not get enough information from Gene Sperling, Mr. Obama's chief economic adviser, added: ''I'm not being critical. I'm just saying it's a huge bill, and I need to know that it's going to help my state. If I can feel that it does, I'm all for it. If it doesn't, I don't know.''

HEADLINE: Idling Glass Blowers, and Ending an Era

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
For decades, they have solved the riddle of what to give those who seem to have everything. Pieces of Steuben glass, those quintessential samples of American artisanship, have proved suitable for queens and presidents, brides and retiring executives.
But in a few months, wedding guests and sheepish husbands will have to find a substitute for gifts from Steuben because the 108-year-old glassmaker is shutting down its factory in Corning, N.Y., and its flagship store on Madison Avenue in Manhattan. The cause of the company's demise was a waning appetite for fancy crystal that was exacerbated by the weak economy, company officials said.
''We did not see an increase in new consumers or established collectors,'' Ron Sykes, a spokesman for the Schottenstein Stores Corporation, which bought Steuben from Corning Inc. three years ago said Thursday. ''The difficult economy did not help us in the recovery.'' 
In Corning, more than 70 people, some of them master glass blowers, will lose their jobs by the end of November, Mr. Sykes said. The staff of the company's large store and showroom in Midtown may stay on longer as the company sells off its inventory of expensive and often quirky products, like an $1,800 wide-mouthed piggy bank designed by Harry Allen in Manhattan.
''Steuben was one of the last companies that I know of that was doing that sort of high-quality manufacturing here in America,'' said Mr. Allen, whose industrial-design studio is in the East Village. ''The end result is you have very expensive products. Very few people want to pay what you had to pay to have a product made by Steuben in their life.''
The store's closing, the precise timing of which Mr. Sykes declined to discuss, will bring an end to Steuben's 77-year presence as a retailer in Manhattan. It was still a division of Corning Glass Works when it opened its first store in the city on Fifth Avenue in 1934. For the rest of the 20th century, there was a Steuben shop in one location or another along the most elegant stretch of Fifth Avenue.
Throughout that period, an engraved fruit bowl or animal figurine handmade by Steuben was considered a can't-miss present, a sentiment burnished by the choices of American presidents from Harry S. Truman to Ronald Reagan.
President Dwight D. Eisenhower was one of Steuben's biggest fans. He gave custom-made glassware as gifts to heads of state and also collected some himself. In 1954, on the first anniversary of Eisenhower's inauguration, members of his cabinet surprised him with a foot-tall pedestaled cup whose engravings depicted his life story.
When Prince Charles married Lady Diana in 1981, the Reagans gave them an engraved Steuben bowl as a wedding gift. In a less official role this summer, two hosts of the ''Today'' show, Matt Lauer and Al Roker, presented a Steuben crystal cat to Pope Benedict XVI in Rome.
Steuben (pronounced stew-BEN) glass has served as a gift for all purposes for as long as some wealthy New Yorkers can remember.
''Over the years, I have received many, many, many Steuben gifts -- bar mitzvahs, weddings, birthdays,'' said Leonard Stern, chairman of Hartz Mountain Industries, which owns the building at 667 Madison Avenue that is home to the Steuben showroom. ''This is one of America's oldest handicrafts consumer goods. It's world famous. It would be like France hearing that Baccarat was closing down.''
But Mr. Stern said he sensed that the company was a victim of a generational shift in tastes.
''The younger generation of consumers is not buying things like this right now,'' he said. ''I have children, and buying expensive crystals is just not part of their lives.''
Young adults are more likely to spend their money on electronics, Mr. Stern said, inadvertently tracing the evolution of Corning. For nearly all of Steuben's existence since it was founded in 1903, it was sort of a vanity venture, demonstrating the finer side of the everyday glassware and crockery that Corning sold. But Corning gradually reinvented itself as a maker of glass-based products for high-tech applications, like computer monitors and LCD televisions.
Steuben had been a big money-loser for Corning for years before the company sold it to Schottenstein, which operates retail chains, including Value City Furniture and the DWS shoe stores. But that purchase was ill-timed, coming just as the financial crisis sent the economy into a swoon.
''I guess when it had to stand on its own two feet, without the corporate umbrella and the munificence of the owners of Corning, economic realities set in,'' Mr. Stern said.
But, he added, Steuben's last location in Manhattan will not sit empty long: Michael Kors, the clothing designer, has already agreed to lease the whole space Steuben filled.
''The price of progress is not always cheap or pleasant,'' Mr. Stern said.

HEADLINE: Boehner's Jobs Speech

 BODY:
The following is a prepared text of Representative John A. Boehner's speech about jobs to the Economic Club of Washington on Thursday, as provided by the House Speaker's office:
MR. BOEHNER: President Rubenstein, members of the board, honored guests -- thank you for the opportunity to be here with you today to talk about jobs and the state of our nation's economy.
We all know the economy is stalled, and it's been stalled. And it's not because the American people have lost their way. It's because their government has let them down.
Last week the president put forth a new set of proposals. The House will consider them, as the American people expect. Some of the president's proposals offer opportunities for common ground. 
But let's be honest with ourselves. The president's proposals are a poor substitute for the pro-growth policies that are needed to remove barriers to job creation in America...the policies that are needed to put America back to work.
If we want job growth, we need to recognize who really creates jobs in America. It's the private-sector.
This building is named in memory of President Ronald Reagan, who recognized that private sector job creators are the heart of our economy. They always have been.
That was the America I was raised in. My father and grandfather were small businessmen. They ran a tavern in Cincinnati that my grandpa started in the 1930s. I worked in that tavern growing up.
I ran a small business myself. I know what it takes to meet a payroll, hire workers, and create jobs in the private sector.
There's a fundamental misunderstanding of the economy that leads to a lot of bad decisions in Washington, D.C.
The reality is that employers will hire if they have the right incentives, but the incentives have to outweigh the costs. Businesses are not going to hire someone for a $4000 tax credit if government mandates impose long-term costs on them that significantly exceed the temporary credit. In recent years, such mandates have been overwhelming.
Private-sector job creators of all sizes have been pummeled by decisions made in Washington.
They've been slammed by uncertainty from the constant threat of new taxes, out-of-control spending, and unnecessary regulation from a government that is always micromanaging, meddling, and manipulating.
They've been hurt by a government that offers short-term gimmicks rather than fundamental reforms that will encourage long-term economic growth.
They've been hampered by a government that offers confusion to entrepreneurs and job creators when there needs to be clarity.
They've been undercut by a government that favors crony capitalism and businesses deemed 'too big to fail,' over the small banks and small businesses that make our economy go.
They've been antagonized by a government that favors bureaucrats over market-based solutions.
They've been demoralized by a government that causes despair when we need it to provide reassurance and inspire confidence.
My worry is that even after all of this, much of the talk in Washington right now is basically about more of the same. More initiatives that seem to have more to do with the next election than the next generation. . .initiatives that seem to be more about micromanaging economic decisions than liberating them.
I think the American people are worried about this too.
I can tell you the American people -- private-sector job creators in particular --- are rattled by what they've seen out of this town over the last few years.
My worry is that for American job creators, all the uncertainty is turning to fear that this toxic environment for job creation is a permanent state.
Job creators in America are essentially on strike.
The problem is not confusion about the policies. . .the problem is the policies.
The anger many Americans have been feeling in recent years is beginning to turn into fear. . .fear of our future.
That bothers me, and it should bother all of us.
America is a land of opportunity. Always has been.
Our economy has always been built on opportunity. . .on entrepreneurs, innovators and risk-takers willing to take a chance -- because they're confident if they work hard, they can succeed.
Over the past few years, government has made people less confident -- not more confident -- that they can succeed.
More and more Americans are realizing this, and they're speaking out about it.
I've spent the past 4-5 weeks traveling through my district and across this country, listening to the people outside of Washington who are the key to making our economy work.
My message to Washington today on their behalf: this isn't that hard. We need to liberate our economy from the shackles of Washington. Let our economy grow!
We need to trust in the good judgment of the American people.
The instinct in government, always, is to get bigger, more intrusive, more meddlesome. And that instinct is directly at odds with the things that make the American economy move.
Job creation in America is facing what I would call a triple threat from government. The first aspect of this threat is excessive regulation.
During the Joint Session of Congress last week, I hosted about a dozen job creators from the private sector in as my guests in the House gallery -- all of them with a common story: they're trying to help create more American jobs, but the government is getting in their way.
We all know some regulations are needed. We have a responsibility under the Constitution to regulate interstate commerce.
There are reasonable regulations that protect our children and help keep our environment clean.
And then there are excessive regulations that unnecessarily increase costs for consumers and small businesses.
Those excessive regulations are making it harder for our economy to create jobs.
Over the last couple of months we've seen two vivid illustrations.
Last month federal agents raided the Gibson Guitar factories in Tennessee.
Gibson is a well-respected American company that employs thousands of people. The company's costs as a result of the raid? An estimated $2-3 million. Why? Because Gibson bought wood overseas to make guitars in America. Seriously.
The other example is in South Carolina, where the Boeing company recently completed a plant that will create thousands of new full-time jobs for American workers -- only to be sued by a federal agency that wants to shut it down.
Let make sure I have this straight: under current rules, American companies are free to create jobs in China, but they aren't free to create them in South Carolina?
At this moment, the Executive Branch has 219 new rules in the works that will cost our economy at least $100 million.
That means under the current Washington agenda, our economy is poised to take a hit from the government of at least $100 million -- 219 times.
I think it's reasonable to ask: is it wise to be doing all of this right now?
The current regulatory burden coming out of Washington far exceeds the federal government's constitutional mandate. And it's hurting job creation in our country at a time when we can't afford it.
Government's threat to job creation has two other components.
One is the current tax code, which is discourages investment and rewards special interests.
It strikes me as odd that at a time when it's clear that the tax code needs to be fundamentally reformed, the first instinct out of Washington is to come up with a host of new tax credits that make the tax code more complex.
The final aspect of the threat is the spending binge in Washington. It has created a massive debt crisis that poses a direct threat to our country's ability to create jobs and prosper.
There are some people in this town who still deny this. . .who still deny that the debt is a threat to jobs.
But if you talk to anybody outside of Washington who has to meet a payroll, they'll tell you that out-of-control spending in Washington is one of the things that concerns them the most about our future.
In New York City back in May, I warned that if we don't take action soon, the markets will do it for us.
Last month, the markets took action, in the form of a downgrade and the possibility of future downgrades that caused the markets to tumble.
It's going to keep happening, until we act.
The responsibility for fixing this toxic environment for job creation is a bipartisan one.
The situation was created by Washington's inability to let our economy work.
It was created by government intrusion and micromanagement.
We have a responsibility to work together in the coming months to remove these barriers and liberate our economy.
This is what the American people are demanding of us.
Everything we do in the weeks and months to come needs to start with asking: are we addressing these problems? Or are we making them worse?
The Budget Control Act of 2011, signed into law last month, establishes a Joint Select Committee of Congress for the purpose of identifying $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction.
Many have expressed doubts about the Joint Committee's chances of success.
The skepticism is understandable. A Joint Select Committee is, after all, no substitute for a president who continues to control most of the arms of government.
But I think the Joint Select Committee has a huge opportunity.
It has a chance to lay the foundation for economic growth, by dealing with some of the obstacles that are standing in the way.
The Joint Committee's mission is deficit reduction, and that has everything to do with jobs.
As the co-chairman of the Joint Committee, Jeb Hensarling, said last week at the Committee's first meeting:
'Our debt threatens our jobs. . .Speak to any Fortune 500 CEO or small business person. It is clear that our debt hangs like the Sword of Damocles over their hiring decisions. . .It should be obvious that deficit reduction and a path to fiscal sustainability are themselves a jobs program.'
The Joint Select Committee can tackle tax reform, and it should.
It's probably not realistic to think the Joint Committee could rewrite the tax code by November 23. But it can certainly lay the groundwork by then for tax reform in the future that will enhance the environment for economic growth.
The Committee can develop principles for broad-based tax reform that will lower rates for individuals and corporations while closing deductions, credits, and special carveouts in our tax code. And I hope it will.
Yes, tax reform should include closing loopholes. Not for purposes of bringing more money to the government. But because it's the right thing to do.
And if we're going to tackle tax reform, we should do it all.
Making short-term fixes in exchange for long-term flawed policy is not tax reform.
Tax reform should deal with the whole tax code, both the personal side and the corporate side, and it should result in a code that is simpler and fairer to everyone.
Tax increases, however, are not a viable option for the Joint Committee.
It's a very simple equation. Tax increases destroy jobs. And the Joint Committee is a jobs committee. Its mission is to reduce the deficit that is threatening job creation in our country.
We should not make its task harder by asking it to do things that will make the environment for job creation in America even worse.
I hope the president will meet this standard when he puts forth his recommendations for the Joint Committee next week.
When it comes to producing savings to reach its $1.5 trillion deficit reduction target, the Joint Select Committee has only one option: spending cuts and entitlement reform.
The Joint Committee can achieve real deficit reduction by reforming entitlements and taking real action to preserve and strengthen Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.
There is a myth that spending reforms aren't 'real' unless they happen this year.
That myth is built on a healthy skepticism that spending cuts made today are going to be implemented tomorrow.
But it is a myth nonetheless, and we need to make sure it doesn't stop us from doing what needs to be done.
Most of the entitlement reforms in the House GOP budget are phased in over time. And that's the way the Joint Committee should do them as well.
Modest changes in spending programs today can have large effects tomorrow.
Gimmicks, however, are unacceptable. As I told the president's economic team during the debt limit negotiations: we're just not doing that anymore.
Deficit reduction shouldn't just be about quantity; it should be about quality.
A billion dollars in imaginary savings from war spending that was never going to happen is not the same as a billion dollars in savings that strengthens our entitlement programs.
There are plenty of skeptics about the Joint Select Committee's ability to accomplish its mission, and that's to be expected.
There are always skeptics.
There were skeptics last spring when I said in New York that we should have spending cuts larger than any debt limit hike we gave the president.
But it happened.
And this can happen, too.
The Joint Committee can succeed, and it must succeed. And with success, it can help to lay the foundation for economic growth and job creation in America.
If the Joint Committee does its work correctly addressing the structural problems in our entitlement programs that have put us in danger of more job-destroying downgrades, and setting the stage for fundamental tax reform that will help to support private investment it will have begun to remove some of the biggest barriers to job creation that exist in our country today.
As the Joint Committee does its work, there is a lot of other work in Washington that also needs to be done.
As I mentioned earlier, there are 219 major regulatory actions in the works by the federal bureaucracy right now. We know seven of them will each have an economic impact of $1 billion or more.
The biggest is an EPA rule that could have an impact of as much as $90 billion.
The president acted wisely by halting the implementation of this rule. I would urge the White House to build on it by disclosing to the American people the cost estimates for the remaining 212 'economically significant' rules it has planned.
I would also urge the president to call a Cabinet meeting, and tell every member of his Cabinet: 'Until further notice, I don't want anything that gets in the way of private-sector job creation. And I want you to report back to me in a month with how you've done.'
The members of the president's Cabinet are not doing their jobs if they aren't constantly focused on removing impediments to job growth.
If they're not focused on that, they should be fired.
In the House, Majority Leader Cantor has put together a fall legislative schedule that reflects the concerns we've heard from job creators across America about unnecessary federal regulations that are hampering job growth.
Earlier I mentioned the situation in South Carolina with Boeing.
Today the House is working on a measure that will prevent the federal government from meddling in that situation, and similar ones.
The Senate needs to follow the House in passing this bill, and we need to send it to the president's desk.
The NRLB bill is one of a whole series of measures we're working on this fall to reduce the burden of excessive regulation on job creators.
We'll pass the REINS Act, which would require congressional review for any new regulation that has a major impact on the economy. House committees have identified dozens of job-crushing regulations that are keeping our economy from producing jobs.
We'll repeal the '3 percent withholding rule,' which serves as an effective tax increase on those who do business with the government.
We'll stop excessive federal regulations that inhibit jobs in areas as varied as cement and farm dust.
We'll work on other reforms such as removing barriers to increased domestic energy production and removing barriers to trade, many of which are in the House GOP jobs agenda at Jobs.GOP.gov.
The United States Senate needs to act, too. The Senate cannot continue to sit idle on jobs and the budget.
The House has passed an array of bills already this year to remove barriers to job creation, and those bills are piling up in the Senate.
The Senate hasn't produced a budget, either. It must.
There are a few other things I want to mention that we can do in the weeks and months ahead to free our economy and bolster confidence among our job creators.
One is very simple. Both parties can boost confidence and reassure job creators by being clear: there will be no shutdown of the federal government, and we aren't willing to default on our debt. The United States will meet its obligations to its citizens and to its creditors.
In Congress, I've been clear about these goals since the day I was elected Speaker. And we've been true to our word.
Another thing we can do is in the area of transportation and infrastructure.
I'm not opposed to responsible spending to repair and improve infrastructure. But if we want to do it in a way that truly supports long-term economic growth and job creation, let's link the next highway bill to an expansion of American-made energy production.
Removing some of the unnecessary government barriers that prevent our country from utilizing its vast energy resources could create millions of new jobs.
There's a natural link between the two: as we develop new sources of American energy, we're going to need modern infrastructure to bring that energy to the market.
We can also boost confidence and reassure job creators by sending a balanced budget amendment to the states.
One of the most important things we did in the Budget Control Act last month -- in addition to requiring a vote in both houses of Congress this fall on a balanced budget amendment -- was establish caps on future spending.
These caps are designed to hold back the growth of government while our economy expands and creates jobs.
To ensure those spending caps are set in stone, we should ratify a balanced budget amendment.
If the president truly wants to make a difference and change the dynamic in Washington, he should announce his support for a balanced budget amendment and call on the Congress to send one to the states without delay.
And lastly, if we want to create a better environment for job creation, politicians of all stripes can leave the 'my way or the highway' philosophy behind.
The all-or-nothing approach is not a workable mindset if we're serious about getting our economy on its feet again.
Our economy is facing a broad-based, systemic crisis.
As such, it will require everyone coming to the table with their best ideas first and leaving politics at the door, with the courage to listen to each other's critiques and questions.
It means ending the name-calling, the yelling, and the questioning of others' motives.
Leadership is about ending that nonsense, buckling down, and getting to work.
Thomas Edison once said that 'opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.'
We have an opportunity in front of us. The trick is to recognize it, and believe in it, and act on it.
We know the challenges we face as a nation, and we have a chance to confront them.
If we put election-year politics aside this year and focus on our work, we'll leave our country in a better place.
Getting it done will require a serious effort by both parties.
There are some in both parties who would rather do nothing.
They'd prefer to sit this one out, waiting to be dealt a better hand down the road, after the next election.
That's not what I was elected to do.
This is the hand we've been dealt.
Instead of ducking from the challenge, we should rise to the occasion, and liberate our economy from the shackles government has placed on it.
I'm ready. And for the sake of our country, and our economy I hope all of us are ready.
Thank you for listening. I look forward to your questions.''

HEADLINE: Glib Announcements on Job Creation Can't Hide a Grim Reality

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN. 
jwarren@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
If Mayor Rahm Emanuel can generate jobs as well as he creates solicitous publicity, work-hungry citizens will be hitchhiking to Chicago from San Diego. If only it were that easy.
The Missile announced a plan Tuesday to help small businesses via a Goldman Sachs partnership with City Colleges of Chicago. The formal announcement asserted that City Colleges ''delivers exceptional learning opportunities and educational services for diverse student populations.''
Inspecting the resulting uncritical news media coverage was easy. The ever-disciplined Missile's office that evening accidentally sent out to the news media its comprehensive compilation of daily Missile-related coverage meant for internal consumption. 
No outlet apparently regurgitated the mayor's cheery characterization of City Colleges, which has a 7 percent graduation rate. But the articles and news reports about both that announcement and other Missile-related matters were quite benign, with nobody apparently wondering how the same Goldman gambit has actually fared in other cities.
The news media, increasingly shorthanded thanks to downsizing, can often serve as a mere bulletin board. That's true even at times with an on-message mayor who leaves little to chance and spontaneity.
For example, he is using a prodigious Rolodex in cajoling businesses to add jobs here, scoring apparent successes with JPMorgan Chase, GE Capital and others. As he heralds them, he knows the news media may well forget to fact-check the ultimate results and fail to report on the unceasing trickle, trickle, trickle of jobs being lost.
Since Mr. Emanuel arrived at City Hall, Crain's Chicago Business has reported on planned layoffs at a diverse array of Chicago companies: Harpo Studios (250 people), Emmis Radio (78), Ryerson, Inc. (67), the Sun-Times (456), Schofield Media Group (107), Swissport Cargo Services (146) and Morse Calipers Services (161), among others.
It's part of an awful recession and persisting joblessness whose roots are more intricate than some politicians and businessmen suggest.
For example, there is the notion of a skills mismatch in a high-tech world in which many jobs go unfilled because employers can't find the right person. Also, there's the assertion that reluctance to sell one's home amid declining prices accentuates unemployment by making a move less likely.
Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago pointed me to a wealth of recent studies that raise serious doubts about both conclusions.
It's not that those elements don't surface; it's just that they are not significant driving factors. But since my head was aching after reading the often-academic studies, it was a relief to track down Matthew W. Stagner, a jobs expert at the University of Chicago, who assessed the ''skills mismatch'' thesis more directly.
''People like to believe they have a lever on which to pull to make substantial change,'' Mr. Stagner said. ''The skills-mismatch argument is good politics and plays into a fundamental belief that if people just learn more, and train people for the right job, we'll be fine.
''But it's just one of many possible levers.''
A few hours after the Goldman Sachs announcement, I viewed the small-business and jobs issues firsthand as I drove around Mr. Emanuel's and my North Side ward with Ameya Pawar, the energetic new alderman.
Empty storefronts, vacant lots and unused or underutilized warehouses and factories are everywhere, some a disarmingly short hop from million-dollar homes. I wasn't ignorant but was still taken aback upon this closer inspection.
''A lot of employers are just nervous about making investments,'' Mr. Pawar said.
He was surprised by my mention of experts' qualms on the skills-mismatch issue. But he conceded that many factors, some interconnected, are at play in the ward, some recession-specific, others not. Some are macro, others micro.
They include low consumer demand, employers learning to survive with fewer employees, frustrations with government bureaucracy, doubts about local schools, cravings for tax breaks, the city's budget mess and foreign competition, among others.
We drove along dour Lawrence Avenue, past an unemployment office, a public aid office, desolate storefronts and empty sidewalks. They are why Mr. Pawar is pushing a big plan to use $19 million in tax increment financing to overhaul the avenue and has ''Grow 47,'' a smart-looking overall strategy for the ward.
But he's dealing with a conundrum. If employers don't hire, people don't make decent wages to buy anything -- among other matters.
And as Mr. Pawar put it, ''We're shrinking as a city.''
If only Goldman Sachs had the answer.

HEADLINE: Americans And Cubans Still Mired In Distrust

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

 BODY:
MEXICO CITY -- Bill Richardson had chits to offer Cuban officials in Havana this week if they released Alan Gross, the American contractor serving a 15-year sentence for distributing satellite telephone equipment.
Mr. Richardson, who has negotiated prisoner releases from Cuba to North Korea, had State Department approval to present at least two things, said four people with knowledge of the negotiations. One was a process for removing Cuba from the list of states sponsoring terrorism. The Obama administration was also willing to waive probation for one of the ''Cuban Five,'' as a group of Cuban agents accused of espionage in the United States are known on the island, so he could go home after he leaves prison next month.
But it was not enough. Mr. Richardson was not even allowed to see Mr. Gross, and when he left Havana on Wednesday, he was angry and disappointed, concluding that elements of the Cuban government ''do not seem to really want warmer relations.''
That brand of bitterness is once again the modus operandi for United States-Cuba relations. American officials and experts say that Mr. Richardson's failed trip was just the latest in a series of misunderstandings, missteps and perceived slights showing that both countries, after a moment of warmth, have slipped back into a 50-year-old pattern of cold distrust. 
''Neither side has shown the slightest interest in learning from experience and have demonstrated repeatedly the tragic way in which both sides are condemned to repeat their mistakes,'' said Robert A. Pastor, a professor at American University who advises former President Jimmy Carter on Latin America. ''It's not just the Obama people. It's the new people under Raul Castro.''
This is not what either side expected. President Obama campaigned for greater engagement with Cuba, boldly telling a Miami audience in May 2008 that he would be open to meeting with Mr. Castro and forging warmer relations. Four months after he took office, he headed in that direction, abandoning longstanding restrictions on the ability of Cuban-Americans to visit the island and send money to relatives.
The Cuban government responded quickly. Meetings with American officials became more common during the first year of the Obama administration, including a gathering in Havana with the highest-ranking State Department official to visit Cuba since 2002. Cuba also eliminated a 10 percent tax on remittances that had galled Cuban-Americans sending money to their families.
But the Gross affair cast doubt into the relationship. A contractor for a company financed by the United States Agency for International Development, Mr. Gross was arrested in December 2009. Cuba charged him with crimes against the state for delivering banned equipment as part of a semicovert program aimed at weakening the Cuban government.
The arrest sent a chill through the diplomatic corps of both countries. The Cuban government has complained for years about ''democracy programs'' it says subvert its authority and sovereignty. Still, American officials said they did not expect a protracted affair. Indeed, relations were still good enough a month later to lay the groundwork for what some officials now see as a lost opportunity -- a jointly run medical clinic in Haiti.
The idea emerged soon after the earthquake that flattened Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, in January 2010. Cuba quickly approved an American request to fly victims to Florida through Cuban airspace, and the country's doctors won accolades from American officials.
That led to the idea for a more formal relationship and a new hospital for rural Haiti -- in an area later ravaged by cholera. It was to be built and supplied with American aid, but staffed with Cuban doctors. According to current and former American officials, discussions moved smoothly over several months and were nearly complete when old sensitivities emerged.
''First the Cubans said, 'We want to do this but you have to stop your efforts to recruit our medical brigades,' '' said one American official who was not authorized to speak publicly. The Cubans were angered by a little-known program, started by President George W. Bush and continued by Mr. Obama, that assists Cuban doctors looking to defect, said several American officials.
Then, after the Obama administration signaled that it would not eliminate the program, Cuban officials were further incensed by an event at which they believed their country's doctors were not given proper credit for their work in Haiti. Finally, just days before the agreement was to be signed, the Cuban government demanded that a second clinic be built in Port-au-Prince, at a cost of several million dollars. That killed the deal.
And from there, the relationship has continued to wither.
American officials say the Cubans missed an opportunity this year, when the White House and Senator John Kerry pushed to cut money for the democracy programs. If Cuba had released Mr. Gross then, officials said, the programs would have become less about weakening Cuba's government and more about building civil society. Instead, Congress kept them largely intact.
For some time now, American officials said, Cuba has seemed uninterested in letting Mr. Gross go. The island of 11 million people is in the midst of its largest economic overhaul since the end of the Soviet Union -- with a major drive toward private enterprise -- and many Cuba experts believe that the country's officials are engaged in an ideological war over how far and fast to go. Relations with the United States appear to have become secondary to domestic concerns, some argue. Or, they say, hard-liners seem to be winning the argument on foreign relations.
So while Mr. Richardson traveled with encouragement from the State Department, on what was officially labeled a private trip, several government officials said they were not surprised that his effort failed.
Mr. Richardson said that he had been invited, and that he had expected at least a meeting with Mr. Gross. Josefina Vidal Ferreiro, the Cuban Foreign Ministry's head of North American affairs, said Mr. Richardson had gone to Cuba ''on his own initiative.'' She did not discuss the broader strain in relations. But signaling that removal from the terrorism list and a minor change in the sentence of an accused Cuban spy was not sufficient, she said the release of Mr. Gross ''was never on the table.''
And it may not be anytime soon.
One thing that might move Cuba, said an official who has negotiated the issue, is if the European Union changes its common policy limiting relations with Cuba because of human rights concerns. But he and other American officials said that until Cuba released Mr. Gross, Cuba would continue to be isolated. For now, his release -- along with many issues involving Cuba -- appears to be caught in an echo chamber of grievance shaped by decades of failed attempts at warmer United States-Cuba relations.

PERSON: Malcolm Wallop 

HEADLINE: Malcolm Wallop, 78, Senator From Wyoming

BYLINE: By MARGALIT FOX

 BODY:
Malcolm Wallop, a three-term Republican senator from Wyoming who was a leading conservative light in Washington, pressing for a strong national defense, tax reform, states' rights and other elements of the political sea change swept in by the Reagan administration, died on Wednesday at his home near Big Horn, Wyo. He was 78.
A spokeswoman for the Kane Funeral Home in Sheridan, Wyo., said he died after a long illness. 
Mr. Wallop, who served in the Senate from 1977 to 1995, had an improbable pedigree for a representative of the expansive American West. A wealthy, Ivy League-educated rancher, he was descended from a family that combined (in a single progenitor) titled English aristocracy and American frontiersmanship.
In the 1980s he was the senior member of a conservative Wyoming triumvirate that included Dick Cheney, then a congressman, and Alan K. Simpson, then the junior senator, whose collective clout belied the state's small population.
''Although his detractors have steadily grown in number, even Democrats grudgingly admitted to liking his candor and his willingness to be stupendously politically incorrect,'' The Economist wrote of Mr. Wallop in 1994, after he announced he would not seek a fourth term.
After leaving office, Mr. Wallop remained visible on the right as a commentator on television news programs. In the mid-1990s he founded the Frontiers of Freedom Institute, a nonprofit organization dedicated to fostering conservative public policy. At his death he was its chairman.
As a senator he was an outspoken proponent of cutting taxes, limiting federal control over the workings of states and the lives of individuals and containing communism. He opposed Social Security, many environmental regulations and arms control treaties, which, he argued, compromised the ability of the United States to defend itself.
As a member of the Senate Finance Committee, Mr. Wallop, with Senator David L. Boren, Democrat of Oklahoma, sponsored legislation that would reduce estate and gift taxes. Their proposals became components of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, signed into law by President Ronald Reagan that August.
Mr. Wallop was also a leading and early supporter of what became the Strategic Defense Initiative. Initiated by Mr. Reagan in 1983, the program was intended to develop a space-based antiballistic missile system, though it was later abandoned.
Malcolm Wallop was born in New York City on Feb. 27, 1933. His father, Oliver Malcolm Wallop, was descended from an aristocratic English family; his mother, the former Jean Moore, the daughter of an East Coast society family, died when Malcolm was 10.
Malcolm's paternal grandfather, Oliver Henry Wallop, was in all likelihood the only person to have served in both the House of Lords and the Wyoming House of Representatives. He became a prosperous cattle rancher, a naturalized citizen and a state legislator after coming to the United States in the late 19th century.
Then in 1925, when his older brother John died without an heir, Oliver Henry Wallop became the eighth Earl of Portsmouth. Resuming his original citizenship, he returned to England, where he sat in the House of Lords. He remained a British subject until his death in 1943.
Malcolm Wallop earned a bachelor's degree from Yale in 1954 and served in the Army from 1955 to '57. After a career as a cattle rancher and small businessman, he was elected to Wyoming's House of Representatives in 1969 and served until 1972. He was in the State Senate from 1973 to 1976.
In 1974, he ran for the governorship of Wyoming on an environmental platform. Defeated in the Republican primary, Mr. Wallop endeavored ''to move closer to the severe conservatism of most Wyoming Republicans,'' as The New York Times wrote.
In 1976, Mr. Wallop defeated the Democratic incumbent, Gale W. McGee, for the United States Senate, winning 55 percent of the vote. He became one of the rare nonlawyers to serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee; his other committee assignments included the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the Select Committee on Intelligence. From 1981 to 1983 Mr. Wallop was the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Ethics.
Mr. Wallop's first three marriages ended in divorce. Survivors include his fourth wife, Isabel; two sisters, Carolyn and Lady Jean Porchester; four children from his first marriage; and grandchildren. Information on other survivors was not available.
He was the author of a book, ''The Arms Control Delusion'' (1987), written with Angelo Codevilla.
Mr. Wallop's penchant for outspokenness extended far beyond the legislative floor. In a 1976 campaign commercial, he took on a proposed federal regulation, unpopular in Wyoming, that would have required employers to provide on-site lavatories for farmworkers.
Mr. Wallop's advertisement depicted a cowboy riding the range with an outhouse strapped awkwardly to his saddle.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 24, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An obituary on Sept. 16 about Malcolm Wallop, a three-term senator from Wyoming and a descendant of the English aristocracy, described incorrectly the circumstances under which Senator Wallop's paternal grandfather, Oliver Henry Wallop, became the eighth earl of Portsmouth. It occurred when his older brother John died without an heir, not when the last of his siblings died without children. The obituary also misstated the title held by his sister, Jean, who survives him. She is Jean Countess of Carnavon, not Lady Jean Porchester.

HEADLINE: The Moral Values of America's Youth

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''If It Feels Right...'' (column, Sept. 13):
David Brooks cites a Notre Dame study of 230 young Americans to indict an entire generation's moral sensibility, warning that our ''erosion of shared moral frameworks'' gives rise to ''moral individualism.'' 
I think the researchers got it wrong. It's not that we don't have a shared vocabulary to address moral issues -- we just don't have theirs.
My generation is the most open-minded in history. Nearly half of us are nonwhite or multiracial; most of us support interracial dating; and the majority of us, including conservatives, accept gays and lesbians.
We don't frame our moral commitments in the black-and-white language of previous generations, because we've inherited the damage that comes from absolutes, whether partisan politics or fundamentalisms.
We'd rather channel our diverse moral stirrings into meaningful action. In fact, a group of us lead a multifaith initiative for justice anchored in exactly what Mr. Brooks says we lack: moral vision. It's time for a closer look.
VALARIE KAUR New Haven, Sept. 13, 2011
The writer is the director of Groundswell, a social action initiative of Auburn Seminary.
To the Editor:
The lack of moral values in the young that David Brooks cites is nothing more than the natural progression of the cult of individualism that our nation has embraced for several centuries. One can't revere individualism in one arena, say, economic activity, without its bleeding into others.
Mr. Brooks need not look any further than the rapacious and selfish behavior of many generations of adults to explain the trends he identifies in the young. His column is just another example of the golden age myth.
JEFF GOLL Durham, N.C., Sept. 13, 2011
To the Editor:
Regarding David Brooks's disconsolate survey chronicling the failures of young people's moral reasoning, I would challenge him to list examples of sterling moral behavior modeled for the young (and I will settle for simple truth-telling, not moral heroism) in either house of Congress, the presidency or the financial and banking sectors of the United States.
When those with the highest social status routinely lie, cheat, exploit their office for personal gain, profit from outrageous conflicts of interest, when they are rewarded for their turpitude with wealth and acclaim, repeating the conservative party line about moral laxity and self-indulgence is disingenuous.
In fact, I think he is correct about a moral decline, but he is targeting the wrong people.

HEADLINE: Where Banks Proliferate, So Do Rules

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix

 BODY:
The more banks a country has, the less political power they have.
At least that is the way it seems to be shaking out as countries develop new rules on bank capital.
In countries where the financial sector is not an overwhelming presence in the economy, banks seem to be faring better in their lobbying efforts to keep rules relatively gentle.
But the toughest rules in Europe seem to be coming in Britain and Switzerland, the two countries with the largest financial sectors -- relative to the size of their economies -- left in the world.
That attitude is in sharp contrast to the one that seems to prevail in much of continental Europe. There, regulators seem to be trying to water down at least some of the Basel III standards adopted around the world; France in particular seems to have encouraged its banks to minimize write-offs on Greek debt. Many European banks missed a chance to recapitalize before the sovereign debt mess made that impossible, at least for now. They are hoping to muddle through. 
In the United States, which has the largest financial sector but also a huge economy, the picture is not as clear. But it appears regulators are well on the way to much stricter capital rules for all banks, and even harsher rules for the biggest banks.
If that is the way it ends up, it will be a complete reversal of the picture before the financial disaster of 2008.
Then Britain boasted of its ''light touch'' regulation, an attitude that was said to contrast with the enforcement approach prevalent in the United States. The American financial sector was mounting a big deregulation campaign, saying American institutions were at an international disadvantage that was hurting the United States by moving financial activity to other countries.
Then came the Lehman Brothers collapse.
Countries felt forced to bail out their banks. It was a manageable burden for the United States, but it was a closer call for Britain. The real casualties were Ireland and Iceland, which had seemed to prosper because of rapidly growing financial industries. Basically, the banks bankrupted the countries.
In Britain this week, a commission appointed to set new banking rules issued its final report, which was endorsed by the government and seems likely to go into effect. The new rules seek to ''ring fence'' really important banking activities to protect them from losses elsewhere in the enterprise, and they set capital standards that seem to be higher than those mandated in the new Basel III rules. In some ways, the reasons the banks needed help in 2008 are less important than the reasons the failures threatened to be so devastating. Those particular mistakes will not be made again anytime soon, and probably not at all. We won't see Triple-A mortgage-backed securities where no one took the trouble to review the mortgages before the paper was sold.
But one of these days many banks will make some big mistake, and they are likely to do it in a group. That was true of the loans to Latin American countries that precipitated the crisis of 20 years ago, and it was true of foolish real estate lending decades before that.
It would be nice if regulators could prevent those huge errors without also preventing banks from taking reasonable risks. But that will not be easy, and we should not have a financial system dependent on regulator wisdom.
The British commission, led by Sir John Vickers, an Oxford economist, instead calls for a system that will not be a public disaster if the banks do blow it again. That is one of the crucial points to be considered in reviewing regulatory approaches.
The commission does a good job of laying out what failed. First, the banks had too little equity capital in relation to the risks they were running. All those equity percentages that banks brag about are ratios of capital to ''risk-weighted assets,'' not overall assets. That makes sense in principle, but assets deemed to be low risk -- like AAA mortgage securities -- turned out to be high risk.
As the Vickers commission put it, ''the supposed 'risk weights' turned out to be unreliable measures of risk: they were going down when risk was in fact going up.''
Banks also had borrowed money. If an industrial company goes broke, the lenders suffer, and that presumably leads them to be careful in making loans. But that did not happen to bank bond holders. In the words of the Vickers commission, ''banks' debt proved poor at absorbing losses. Debt holders might have borne substantial losses in insolvency, but fears of the wider consequences of insolvency -- not only interruptions to ordinary banking services, but also contagion to other banks and disruption of financial markets more generally -- forced governments to make taxpayers bear the contingent liabilities of bank failures.''
In the future, ways must be found to make those lenders take losses, without at the same time causing lenders to be unwilling to lend money to banks. That is not going to be easy -- as Europe has learned from its effort to force private lenders to bear part of the cost of rescuing Greece -- but it is critical.
To force bondholders to feel the pain requires a credible willingness to allow an institution to fail. The United States is trying to come up with ''living wills'' to allow big banks to fail without threatening the system. It would be wonderful if that worked, but in the meantime the answer seems to be to force the important players -- called SIFIs in the jargon, for systemically important financial institutions, to hold more capital. That has some big banks furious.
They are also angry at little details in the Basel rules, like how to treat financial instruments more popular in one country than another. Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, created a stir by telling The Financial Times that some Basel provisions were ''blatantly anti-American.'' He also allowed that some rules were anti-European, but that got less attention.
In an interview, Mr. Dimon also voiced concern that some regulations were encouraging what amounted to ''new shadow banks'' that would compete with banks without facing either comparable rules or capital requirements. He cited mortgage real estate investment trusts, which lend money to real estate developers, as an example.
As a group, the big global banks are trying to reduce regulation, warning that they need looser rules to resume lending. ''The balance of risks has clearly shifted,'' said Charles Dallara, managing director of the Institute of International Finance, a trade group. He wants more leverage, not less, and says the Group of 20 nations should step in to cut through regulations in the name of economic growth.
The Vickers commission report has a response to that argument: ''Reduced bank leverage is not detrimental to economic growth in the medium term. The inflation of leverage in the past decade led to recession, not growth. Earlier decades saw growth without high leverage.''
In the end, the answer may simply be that some financial activities should be conducted by companies that do not have the advantage of deposit insurance and implied government backing -- and whose failure would not leave taxpayers holding the bag. The Volcker rule in the United States -- barring so-called proprietary trading -- is one such effort, although defining just what is not allowed is far from easy. The Vickers proposal to ring-fence banks is another. The parent company could still be in more risky businesses, but with a separate board and separate capital the bank would be protected if the holding company got into trouble through other activities.
It will be interesting to see how the ''level playing field'' arguments play out, with bankers in every country worried that other bankers are being treated more leniently and thus may be at a competitive advantage. There will be threats that financial activities -- and jobs -- will move to other countries.
Such arguments used to work very well. But now regulators in the countries most at risk -- the ones with the largest financial sectors -- have good reason to stick to their guns. If they forget, a tour of Iceland and Ireland might help them to remember.

HEADLINE: The Planning Fallacy

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
When the Nobel Prize-winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman was a young man, he led a committee to write a new part of the curriculum for Israeli high schools. The committee worked for a year, and Kahneman asked his colleagues how long they thought the rest of the project would take. Their estimates were around two years.
Kahneman then asked the most experienced among them how long such work took other curriculum committees. The gentleman pointed out that roughly 40 percent of the committees never finished their work at all. 
But what about those that did finish? The gentleman reported that he had never seen a committee finish in less than seven years and never in more than 10.
This was bad news. They might fail to finish a task that they thought would be done in three years. At best, the project might consume eight or nine years. Yet this information didn't affect those on the team at all. They carried on, assuming that though others might fail or dally, surely they wouldn't.
As it turned out, their project took eight years to finish. By the time it was done, the Ministry of Education had lost interest, and the curriculum was never used.
In his forthcoming book, ''Thinking, Fast and Slow'' (I'll write more about it in a couple of weeks), Kahneman calls this the planning fallacy. Most people overrate their own abilities and exaggerate their capacity to shape the future. That's fine. Optimistic people rise in this world. The problem comes when these optimists don't look at themselves objectively from the outside.
The planning fallacy is failing to think realistically about where you fit in the distribution of people like you. As Kahneman puts it, ''People who have information about an individual case rarely feel the need to know the statistics of the class to which the case belongs.''
Over the past three years, the United States has been committing the planning fallacy on stilts. The world economy has been slammed by a financial crisis. Countries that are afflicted with these crises typically experience several years of high unemployment. They go deep into debt to end the stagnation, but the turnaround takes a while.
This historical pattern has been universally acknowledged and universally ignored. Instead, leaders in both parties have clung to the analogy that the economy is like a sick patient who can be healed by the right treatment.
The Democrats, besotted by the myth that the New Deal ended the Great Depression, have consistently overestimated their ability to turn the economy around. They regard the Greek crackup as a freakish, unlucky break, even though this sort of thing is a typical feature of a financial crisis.
Republicans, who should know better, also have an inflated sense of the power of government. In the presidential debates, Rick Perry, Mitt Romney and Jon Huntsman argue about which one oversaw the most job creation during his term as governor, as if governors have an immediate and definable impact on employers' hiring decisions.
The reality, of course, is that the economy is not a patient. It is a zillion, zillion interactions. Government is not a doctor. Most of the time, it is a clashing collective enterprise that is occasionally able to produce marginal change, for good and for ill.
Democrats should be learning about the limits of social policy. As in the war on poverty, as in the effort to transform American schools, as in the effort to create prosperity in the developing world, it is really hard to turn around complex systems.
Republicans should be reflecting on the fact that if a Republican president were in office right now, and even if he or she did sensible things, the economy would still be in the dumps. It would be Republicans losing ''safe'' Congressional seats in special elections.
The key to wisdom in these circumstances is to make the distinction between discrete good and systemic good. When you are in the grip of a big, complex mess, you have the power to do discrete good but probably not systemic good.
When you are the president in a financial crisis, you have the power to pave roads and hire teachers. That will reduce the suffering of real people who would otherwise be jobless. You have the power to streamline regulations and reduce tax burdens. That will induce a bit more hiring and activity. These are real contributions.
But you don't have the power to transform the whole situation. Your discrete goods might contribute to an overall turnaround, but that turnaround will be beyond your comprehension and control.
Over the past decades, Americans have developed an absurd view of the power of government. Many voters seem to think that government has the power to protect them from the consequences of their sins. Then they get angry and cynical when it turns out that it can't.

HEADLINE: 5 Central Banks Move to Supply Cash to Europe

BYLINE: By JACK EWING and STEPHEN CASTLE; David Leonhardt contributed reporting.

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- Worried that Europe's debt impasse posed a growing threat to the global financial system, the world's major central banks moved Thursday to assure that European banks would not run short of cash as troubled nations like Greece and Italy sought to stabilize their economies.
The central banks, in a coordinated action intended to restore market confidence, agreed to pump United States dollars into the European banking system in the first such show of force in more than a year. Some banks have found it hard to borrow dollars as American lenders grew nervous about their financial condition. 
Thursday's action, coming almost exactly three years after the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers, lifted global stock markets, sharply increasing the value of shares in banks heavily exposed to debt from Greece and the other struggling members of the euro zone. The euro, which had been falling in recent days, rebounded.
The central bank action came as European finance ministers and other policy makers were gathering in Wroclaw, Poland, for meetings on Friday and Saturday. The United States Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, who was scheduled to attend, was expected to urge European officials to act more aggressively to contain the sovereign debt crisis, which has already begun to undercut growth in Europe.
While the move will relieve some pressure on troubled banks, it does not address the underlying problems that made it difficult for the banks to borrow dollars on their own.
The central banks seemed determined to demonstrate that they would not hesitate to deploy their combined weight to keep the crisis from leading to a collapse of the euro zone.
''They are getting together and acting together,'' Christine Lagarde, the president of the International Monetary Fund, said in Washington on Thursday. ''To me, that is the most important message.''
But Ms. Lagarde also warned that policy makers had not done enough and suggested more action was needed. ''We have entered into a dangerous phase of the crisis,'' she said. There is still a path to recovery, she said, but it is ''a narrow one.''
Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, called the move ''a clear illustration of our very close cooperation at the global level.'' Noting that the collapse of Lehman three years ago could have provoked a depression, Mr. Trichet said, ''We still have a long way to go to move beyond this crisis.''
The European Central Bank said it would allow banks to borrow dollars for up to three months, instead of just for one week as before, giving them breathing room for the rest of the year. The E.C.B. said it was acting in cooperation with the Federal Reserve of the United States, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank.
In recent days some European banks have faced difficulties in borrowing dollars, whether from other banks or from money market funds in the United States. There was fear that if they could not borrow dollars, they would be forced to cut off loans to American companies or sell dollar-denominated assets, perhaps forcing prices down in already unsteady markets.
The move was possible under deals between the central banks that were already in existence, and the Fed saw no need to make an announcement on Thursday.
While there now is more certainty that banks will have access to funds, deeper issues remain unresolved, including whether they have enough capital to withstand a possible default by Greece on its government debt.
An official forecast warned Thursday that growth in Europe would come ''to a virtual standstill'' toward the end of the year. It predicted, though, that Europe would just barely avoid a double-dip recession.
The euro system, established in 1999, created a common currency for 11 countries, a number that has grown to more than 20. But it did not unify national finances. Over time, inflation and a failure to reform labor markets left most countries in the group uncompetitive with Germany but unable to regain competitiveness through devaluation.
That is a problem that some say Europe has yet to deal with.
''The lesson of 2008 and earlier crises is that the later you act, the more you have to do, and the more painful it becomes,'' said Robert Zoellick, the president of the World Bank, in a speech Wednesday. ''It is not responsible for the euro zone to pledge fealty to a monetary union without facing up to either a fiscal union that would make monetary union workable or accepting the consequences for uncompetitive, debt-burdened members.''
Analysts said they expected Mr. Geithner to press European ministers in Wroclaw to increase the resources available to their bailout fund for the euro zone countries. But even the expansion of the fund to 440 billion euros ($611 billion), agreed to in July, has yet to be ratified. There is some worry that countries guaranteeing the bailout fund might themselves face doubts about their own credit.
''Part of the problem for policy makers is that they are still waiting for last big initiative to get off the ground,'' said Peter Westaway, chief European economist in London for Nomura. ''We're all kind of on hold until then.''
Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said Thursday during a visit to the Frankfurt Motor Show that her nation has ''a duty and responsibility to make its contribution to securing the euro's future.'' But she added, stabilizing the euro area ''won't happen overnight or with any one-time thunderbolt.''
United States money market funds and other institutions have cut European banks' access to about $700 million in short-term loans over the last year, according to research by JPMorgan Chase and CreditSights.
European banks have only rarely used an existing one-week dollar credit line offered by the E.C.B. On Thursday, two banks borrowed $575 million from the facility. The E.C.B. does not disclose the identity of the borrowers. The two banks were the first to tap the dollar credit line since August.
By making dollars available for a longer three-month period, the central banks are providing reassurance that ailing banks will not be dependent on the more fragile one-week funding. The E.C.B. will offer the dollars in three operations, starting on Oct. 14 and again in November and December. The other central banks will follow similar schedules. The Fed will not offer loans directly, but will provide dollars to the E.C.B. by way of a swap agreement. The borrowing banks must supply collateral in the form of bonds or other securities.

HEADLINE: Free To Die

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Back in 1980, just as America was making its political turn to the right, Milton Friedman lent his voice to the change with the famous TV series ''Free to Choose.'' In episode after episode, the genial economist identified laissez-faire economics with personal choice and empowerment, an upbeat vision that would be echoed and amplified by Ronald Reagan.
But that was then. Today, ''free to choose'' has become ''free to die.'' 
I'm referring, as you might guess, to what happened during Monday's G.O.P. presidential debate. CNN's Wolf Blitzer asked Representative Ron Paul what we should do if a 30-year-old man who chose not to purchase health insurance suddenly found himself in need of six months of intensive care. Mr. Paul replied, ''That's what freedom is all about -- taking your own risks.'' Mr. Blitzer pressed him again, asking whether ''society should just let him die.''
And the crowd erupted with cheers and shouts of ''Yeah!''
The incident highlighted something that I don't think most political commentators have fully absorbed: at this point, American politics is fundamentally about different moral visions.
Now, there are two things you should know about the Blitzer-Paul exchange. The first is that after the crowd weighed in, Mr. Paul basically tried to evade the question, asserting that warm-hearted doctors and charitable individuals would always make sure that people received the care they needed -- or at least they would if they hadn't been corrupted by the welfare state. Sorry, but that's a fantasy. People who can't afford essential medical care often fail to get it, and always have -- and sometimes they die as a result.
The second is that very few of those who die from lack of medical care look like Mr. Blitzer's hypothetical individual who could and should have bought insurance. In reality, most uninsured Americans either have low incomes and cannot afford insurance, or are rejected by insurers because they have chronic conditions.
So would people on the right be willing to let those who are uninsured through no fault of their own die from lack of care? The answer, based on recent history, is a resounding ''Yeah!''
Think, in particular, of the children.
The day after the debate, the Census Bureau released its latest estimates on income, poverty and health insurance. The overall picture was terrible: the weak economy continues to wreak havoc on American lives. One relatively bright spot, however, was health care for children: the percentage of children without health coverage was lower in 2010 than before the recession, largely thanks to the 2009 expansion of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, or S-chip.
And the reason S-chip was expanded in 2009 but not earlier was, of course, that former President George W. Bush blocked earlier attempts to cover more children -- to the cheers of many on the right. Did I mention that one in six children in Texas lacks health insurance, the second-highest rate in the nation?
So the freedom to die extends, in practice, to children and the unlucky as well as the improvident. And the right's embrace of that notion signals an important shift in the nature of American politics.
In the past, conservatives accepted the need for a government-provided safety net on humanitarian grounds. Don't take it from me, take it from Friedrich Hayek, the conservative intellectual hero, who specifically declared in ''The Road to Serfdom'' his support for ''a comprehensive system of social insurance'' to protect citizens against ''the common hazards of life,'' and singled out health in particular.
Given the agreed-upon desirability of protecting citizens against the worst, the question then became one of costs and benefits -- and health care was one of those areas where even conservatives used to be willing to accept government intervention in the name of compassion, given the clear evidence that covering the uninsured would not, in fact, cost very much money. As many observers have pointed out, the Obama health care plan was largely based on past Republican plans, and is virtually identical to Mitt Romney's health reform in Massachusetts.
Now, however, compassion is out of fashion -- indeed, lack of compassion has become a matter of principle, at least among the G.O.P.'s base.
And what this means is that modern conservatism is actually a deeply radical movement, one that is hostile to the kind of society we've had for the past three generations -- that is, a society that, acting through the government, tries to mitigate some of the ''common hazards of life'' through such programs as Social Security, unemployment insurance, Medicare and Medicaid.
Are voters ready to embrace such a radical rejection of the kind of America we've all grown up in? I guess we'll find out next year.

HEADLINE: Bipartisanship of the Wrong Kind: It's not just Republicans who are opposing President Obama's jobs program

 BODY:
As soon as he proposed to pay for his $447 billion jobs plan with tax increases, President Obama knew he was going to do battle with Republicans. But he is also being challenged by Democrats because they cannot face another big pre-election fight or are thinking more about campaign contributors than the country's best interests. 
It is time for Mr. Obama to think about what Lyndon Johnson would do. Mr. Johnson did not flinch from confronting his caucus when he needed to, and neither should Mr. Obama.
The president has started appealing for public support for his jobs plan, and denouncing Republicans who are opposing it. John Boehner, the House speaker, gave a speech on Thursday in which he promised to consider the plan, and then all but rejected it by saying that regulation, taxes and federal spending caused the lack of jobs. In other words, government should do less, not more. He also said the deficit should be cut only by reducing spending, without any tax increases.
Republican opposition is bad enough, but The Times's Jennifer Steinhauer reported that many Congressional Democrats are hanging back, saying they could support one or another of the components of the jobs plan, but not the whole package. Senator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana wants to protect the oil companies to which she is beholden from losing outdated and overly generous tax breaks. Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, seemed to be preparing to bury the jobs program in Senate rigmarole. Senator Bob Casey and others threatened to slice and dice the program to death.
For Mr. Obama to win public support for this effort, Americans need to see him attack the Republicans' opposition and to forcefully get his party in line.
Some Democrats oppose the jobs bill for its apparent connection to the stimulus law from 2009, which Republicans lambasted on their way to victories in the midterm elections in 2010. The problem with the stimulus bill is not that it did not work. The problem is that neither the administration nor Congressional Democrats ever persuasively used the evidence of its positive effect on jobs, as documented by the Congressional Budget Office and in private economic analyses.
The last thing Democrats should do now is repeat that mistake, cowing in the face of Republican tirades against government help. Economists have estimated that Mr. Obama's plan, if fully adopted, could create 1.3 million to 1.9 million jobs next year. Despite poll after poll showing that Americans support tax increases on the wealthy, Democrats have failed to act. In 2010, with majorities in both houses of Congress, they did not even vote on letting President Bush's high-end tax cuts expire.
The Republicans will not support the jobs bill, if only because Mr. Obama wants it. Americans need Democrats to step up now, and for Mr. Obama to lead them.

HEADLINE: Stand or Fall Together: To save the euro, Europe's leaders need to put up more cash and let go of old ideas

 BODY:
European leaders have at last begun edging, haltingly and reluctantly, toward the only realistic solution to the continent's debt and banking crises: refinancing unpayable government debts and reinforcing weakened banks. If their monetary and political union is to survive, all members must start acting more like a union and less like a collection of jealous sovereign states. 
Unless they quickly convince stock and bond markets that they are truly ready to stand together, Europe risks a spiral of disasters, including a Greek default and the failure of one or more major debt-weakened banks. If things get bad enough, the euro zone could fracture, and that could lead to the fracturing of the entire European Union.
The United States would not escape. A collapse in Europe would sap confidence in global markets and shrink demand for American exports when Washington is struggling to avoid a double-dip recession.
President Obama and his aides must keep their public comments upbeat to avoid further spooking the markets. But we hope that Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner -- who is now on his second trip to Europe in just over a week -- is being blunt in closed-door sessions that there is no more time to waste.
What is most urgently needed is a demonstration that Europe will lend as much as necessary to debtor countries and weakened banks that find themselves shut out of private credit markets. That was supposed to be the job of a new, strengthened bailout fund, but all 17 euro zone countries must still give formal approval. For now, the lending must continue to come from the European Central Bank.
German politicians, who are happy to pocket the many benefits that Germany draws from an economically united Europe, are objecting to the rising costs. With Greece sinking, panic spreading and banks -- including German banks -- buffeted by losses from past careless lending, it is a little late for that. If Chancellor Angela Merkel means what she says about standing by the euro, she must face down these critics.
Europe also needs to rethink its demands for punitive austerity as the price for bailout loans. Athens needs to pare down its bureaucracy, improve tax collection and liberalize its labor markets. But Greece will never be able to work off its debt if its economy keeps shrinking.
What would help a lot more right now is for Germany, Europe's economic powerhouse, to temporarily cut taxes. That would increase domestic demand and imports, including from Greece and other indebted countries that need to find new markets. But fearing the ghosts of long-ago inflation more than the spread of present-day depression, Germany is resisting.
A lasting solution will also require restructuring unpayable debts by writing down principal, lowering interest rates and extending maturities. Common European bonds, taking advantage of the lower interest rates available to Europe as a whole, should be part of the process.
That is more European unity than the rich northern European countries want. The truth is that nothing less will get Europe out of this mess.

HIGHLIGHT: The latest news from India's press.

 BODY:
Government oil companies raised the price of petrol by 3.14 Indian rupees per liter yesterday in a move that is expected to stoke inflation and upset household budgetsThis is the third substantial increase since January. Oil companies argue that a fall in the rupee against the American dollar increased their cost of crude, forcing them to raise the price. There's more bad news for households. A group of ministers is likely to consider limiting the supply of subsidized liquefied petroleum gas cylinders today in an effort to cut the government's overwhelming fuel subsidy bill.

Less than 24 hours after the arrest of two high school students, police nabbed two more students in connection with the bombing of the Delhi High Court last week, which killed 14 people and injured dozens more. Apart from these four young men, police are questioning a cybercafe owner and his manager in relation to the e-mail sent to the media soon after the blast.
A Delhi court granted bailuntil Monday to Amar Singh, a member of the Rajya Sabha, the Upper House of Parliament, on account of his poor health. Mr. Singh is accused of offering cash to other lawmakers in 2008 to win a crucial confidence vote in Parliament that could have toppled the wobbly coalition government.
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton designated the Indian Mujahideen or IM a foreign terrorist organization and said it has significant links with Pakistan-based militant groups like the Lashkar-e-Taiba. "These designations highlight the threat posed by IM not only to Western interests, but to India, a close U.S. partner. The Indian populace has borne the brunt of IM's wanton violence and today's actions illustrate our solidarity with the Indian Government," said Daniel Benjamin, the U.S. Department of State's coordinator for counter-terrorism.
Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah confirmed that he and his wife Payal Nath separated after 17 years of marriage, but said he was dismayed about the speculation of it in the Indian media, which usually keeps the private lives of public figures out of the headlines.
Rocked by industrial strife, India's biggest car maker may see rivals gain as buyers look for alternatives. Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. halted operations for the week, putting the company at risk of being unable to take advantage of the forthcoming festive season, which traditionally sees a bump up in consumer spending.
The immediate beneficiary? Perhaps Honda Siel Cars India Ltd, Mint says, which has seen demand for its premium hatchback Jazz soar.

HEADLINE: The Grammar of Anarchy

BYLINE: ANANYA VAJPEYI


HIGHLIGHT: What would Bhimrao Ambedkar, one of modern India's founding fathers, have thought of the Hazare movement?

 BODY:
As Western democracies contemplate the ravages of debt and recession, in India the global economic crisis has manifested itself this summer as a burning debate about corruption. Led by a 74-year old farmer from Maharashtra, Baburao "Anna" Hazare, the popular outcry against this scourge of the Indian polity has consumed the months of summer and monsoon from April to September. While the Indian media have read Anna's appearance in public life as a historic moment, in fact it is an old tension within India's founding principles that has once again come to the fore.
That tension - between morally-based mass protest and reasoned deliberative democracy - can be traced back to two of India's founding fathers, Mohandas K. Gandhi and Bhimrao Ambedkar. Mr. Gandhi played the largest part in the anti-colonial movement during the first half of the 20th century, using innovative tactics of non-violent resistance, non-cooperation and civil disobedience, including the fast. Anna Hazare's much publicized hunger-strike against corruption was inevitably labeled "Gandhian" by his handlers and commentators alike.
Working in tandem but often in conflict with Mr. Gandhi during the nationalist period was Mr. Ambedkar, the leader of the Untouchables - now called Dalits - who supervised the drafting of the Indian Constitution. Mr. Gandhi's moral politics made sense against an authoritarian colonial regime, and ultimately helped discredit and dismantle the British Raj. 
Now that India has had more than six decades of independent self-rule, electoral democracy, a parliamentary system, and, underlying the structure of its nation-state, a strong and stable constitution, what exactly is the role of a mass movement? Does India need a new Mahatma?
Educated around the time of World War I at Columbia University, a student of John Dewey and Edwin Seligman, Mr. Ambedkar was the first Dalit to get a graduate degree overseas, even as India labored under British rule and America struggled with Jim Crow laws. He had to fight many different kinds of discrimination and inequality, both domestic and foreign, to rise to his place as India's pre-eminent juridical mind in the 20th century.
The lessons Mr. Ambedkar learned in Dewey's classroom between 1913 and 1916 went a long way toward giving India a constitution grounded in the twin principles of equality and equity. The Constitution launched the new Indian state on the basis of equal citizenship, universal adult franchise and affirmative action - revolutionary concepts in a society long structured by the hierarchies and injustices of the caste system, patriarchy, monarchy and religious conservatism (to say nothing of the preceding 200 years of colonialism and imperialism under the British).
What would Mr. Ambedkar have made of the movement that gathered around Anna this summer? Mr. Gandhi invented fasting as a "weapon of the weak," and used it very effectively to exercise moral pressure on his opponents on a number of occasions, many of them seen as landmark moments in the history of Indian nationalism.
It is sometimes forgotten that the Gandhian fast could just as well be turnedon the Mahatma's friends, followers and colleagues in the Congress Party, especially when he saw no other way to de-escalate violent hatred between religious communities and to douse inflamed nationalistic passions that resulted in India's bloody partition.
Mr. Ambedkar, who also had a fundamentally moral point to make in his political career - that being untouchable was unconscionable in independent India, and that caste prejudice had to go - did not, however, support Mr. Gandhi's method of non-violent resistance or "Satyagraha," of which the hunger strike was one manifestation.
For Mr. Gandhi, the fast would discipline the body and purify the mind, providing a vital dose of moral courage to the protester who otherwise eschewed violent means. For Mr. Ambedkar, some combination of righteous refusal, enlightened self-interest, reasoned negotiation and compensatory justice was the correct path to liberty and social equality.
Mr. Ambedkar and Mr. Gandhi disagreed and clashed throughout the two decades leading up to India's independence in August 1947. Mr. Gandhi did not live to see the promulgation of the Constitution in January 1950: he was assassinated in January 1948.
On November 25, 1949, in a celebrated closing speech to the Constituent Assembly, Mr. Ambedkar declared:
"If we wish to maintain democracy not merely in form, but also in fact, what must we do? The first thing, in my judgment we must do, is to hold fast to constitutional methods of achieving our social and economic objectives. It means we must abandon the bloody methods of revolution ... abandon the method of civil disobedience, non-cooperation and Satyagraha. When there was no way left for constitutional methods for achieving economic and social objectives, there was a great deal of justification for unconstitutional methods. But where constitutional methods are open, there can be no justification for these unconstitutional methods. These methods are nothing but the grammar of anarchy and the sooner they are abandoned, the better for us."
It seems unlikely that Mr. Ambedkar would have approved of the way in which the Anna movement sought to force the Lokpal (Ombudsman) Bill through Parliament, arm-twisting the government with Mr. Hazare's hyper-televised fast, and insisting that if you are not with us, you are against us. There is no doubt that corruption undermines Indian democracy to an extent that has become intolerable to ordinary people; that institutional reform is urgently needed and probity must be restored to public office, whether in the bureaucracy or in politics.
But the canker of corruption in Indian political life does not mean that the basically reasonable and resilient framework provided by the Constitution has ceased to exist or to make itself fully available to every citizen. Faced with a monumentally corrupt - and yet popularly elected - government, Indians are conflicted about whether to turn to the bulwark of their founding document constructed with so much effort by Mr. Ambedkar, or follow the new figure of Anna who reminds them in flashes of their greatest leader ever, Mahatma Gandhi.

Ananya Vajpeyi's book, is forthcoming from Harvard University Press. She is working on an intellectual biography of Bhimrao Ambedkar.

HEADLINE: Let's Talk About Death

BYLINE: PETER CATAPANO


HIGHLIGHT: After the Republican debate, a lot of time was spent discussing who it was O.K. to kill, or just let die.

 BODY:
As medical science has proven, death is hard to avoid. But it was especially hard this week.
And not just awful, actual death, of which there was plenty - droves of Somalia's famine-ravaged refugees or Kenya's desperate gasoline scavengers dying in a storm of flame - but also theoretical death, possible death, death to come. Death as a policy point. Death as a matter of discussion or partisan debate, or punishment for transgressions as morally clear as murder or as murky as not having health insurance.

Put simply, a lot of time was spent this week discussing whom it was and was not O.K. to kill - or perhaps just let die. To start, there was the high level debate within the Obama administration on just what sort of Islamic militant they would be allowed to kill in Yemen and Somalia (terror plotters, sure, but are foot soldiers O.K.?). Matters closer to home included a torrent of petitions against the planned execution of an inmate in Georgia, Troy Davis; his case has become a celebrity cause, with advocates like Desmond Tutu, Pope Benedict, Jade Jagger and the Indigo Girls (you got that right) among the petitioners. In Texas, the execution of Duane Buck, a man convicted of double-murder, was halted today, after Buck had already eaten his last meal, because of questions of racial bias in his sentencing. 
And notably, those who saw last week's "Texas death penalty cheer" - in which Rick Perry's role in Texas's execution rate was roundly applauded, twice, by an audience at a Republican debate - and judged it an aberration were proven wrong on Monday when something strangely similar happened at the CNN-Tea Party Express Republican debate (full transcript here).
In a column that generated much discussion, The Washington Post's Eugene Robinson described the scene: 
The lowest point of the evening - and perhaps of the political season - came when moderator Wolf Blitzer asked Ron Paul a hypothetical question about a young man who elects not to purchase health insurance. The man has a medical crisis, goes into a coma and needs expensive care. "Who pays?" Blitzer asked.
"That's what freedom is all about, taking your own risks," Paul answered. "This whole idea that you have to prepare and take care of everybody. . . ."
Blitzer interrupted: "But Congressman, are you saying that society should just let him die?"
There were enthusiastic shouts of "Yeah!" from the crowd.
"You'd think one of the other candidates might jump in with a word about Christian kindness," Robinson wrote. "Not a peep."
To be fair, The Washington Post's Erik Wemple rightly points out, the response was more a like a few jeers, nothing compared to the full-throated chorus at the first debate. Still, Perry himself confessed to being "taken back" by it. 
That almost made him seem, well, sensitive. 
Which raises the question, when you kind of shock a guy who doesn't flinch at executions, what exactly is going on in the bleachers? 
In his column, Robinson asked, "Where are the compassionate conservatives?" (As though we were lousy with them only weeks ago.) "According to the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus told the Pharisees that God commands us to 'love thy neighbor as thyself.' There is no asterisk making this obligation null and void if circumstances require its fulfillment via government."
To which Doug Mataconis at Outside the Beltway responded: "Of course, there is no addition to Christ's statement along the lines of 'therefore, thy must support massive government spending programs,' either."
Clever retort, that. But Mataconis actually puts time and thought into a more thorough rebuttal to Robinson's position.
Perhaps there are situations where only government action can address a situation. In this country, we've more or less got a social compact that accepts the existence of a basic safety net for the indigent that enjoys wide popular support. However, Robinson wants to go further than that, his basic argument that the only charity that matters is government "charity" and that opposing government action to "help" the poor is equivalent to hoping that they die. This is, with all due respect to Robinson, an utterly ridiculous example of the kind of close-minded thinking one sees far too often from political pundits. Agreeing that the poor should be helped is where the compassion comes in. Disagreeing about how that should be done does not make one uncompassionate,...
At Cafe Hayek - that's after Friedrich, not Salma - Robinson received a suitably skeptical response from Don Boudreaux, who asks a good question::
I don't get it. Why is Robinson's call to force Smith to care for Jones an exhibition of compassion, while Paul's endorsement of arrangements under which Smith voluntarily cares for Jones a display of heartless indifference to the plight of others?
Reasonable people can disagree over whether or not voluntary charity would be sufficient. It's a mistake, however, to classify coerced "giving" as "compassion," and downright bizarre to accuse those of us who would rely more upon genuine compassion - evidenced by people giving from the goodness of their hearts rather than from a desire to avoid imprisonment - as endorsing a society without compassion.
Is it true, as our colleague Paul Krugman wrote, that "compassion is out of fashion," that "lack of compassion has become a matter of principle, at least among the G.O.P.'s base."
Andrew Sullivan delves into the issue, but can't quite shake his distaste for the behavior of the audience:
Of course, even if such libertarian purity does make sense, that cannot excuse the emotional response to the issue in the crowd last night. Maybe a tragedy like the death of a feckless twentysomething is inevitable if we are to restrain health care costs. But it is still a tragedy. It is not something a decent person cheers. Similarly the execution of hundreds, while perhaps defensible politically and even morally (although I differ), is nonetheless a brutal, awful business. You don't delight in it. And the same is true of torture. Even if you want to defend its use in limited circumstances, it remains an absolute evil, no humane person would want to do it, and no civilized person would brag of it or dismiss any moral issue with it at all.
At Outside the Beltway, Steven L. Taylor concurs, adding a little disdain for Paul's response, which, while not as unforgiving as the peanut gallery's, was hardly a model of compassion:
[L]ike Sullivan, I find the lack of introspection on these issues as displayed by some to be disturbing. This was my reaction to Rick Perry's all too calm response to the death penalty question from last week's debate and I feel the same way about Pauls' response to Blitzer's question about the uninsured. Purity about justice and liberty (respectively) make for great slogans and debates over drinks, but reality is a tad bit more messy than that. And while what one can extrapolate from audience outbursts is limited, the cheers from the debate crowd in both instances are likewise disquieting.
Joe Conason at RealClear Politics pointed out that the nation's health care situation is a threat to a population much more real than Blitzer's hypothetical man:
Lack of insurance - and the lack of adequate insurance - present a daily concern for increasing numbers of Americans. According to the Census Bureau, the exact number has reached 49.9 million, the highest number since the advent of Medicare and Medicaid and the highest percentage of uninsured Americans since the recession of 1976.
The consequences are tragic and - although financially costly to American society compared with other advanced countries - go far beyond mere money. Being uninsured means foregoing necessary care, especially preventive care, which annually causes the premature deaths of at least 50,000 people.
The Republicans up on that debate stage and the tea party claque don't think this is their problem. They don't care. They must be the only Christians in the world who would cheer wildly at the idea of someone dying from lack of health insurance.
"Our politics is getting weird," writes Chris Ladd on Frum Forum. 
While there have always been some odd characters attracted to power, it seems we're dealing with a whole new category of crazy, something we've never encountered at the highest levels of our politics before.
This year we had a GOP figure candidate rise to the top of some polls by claiming that Obama was born in Kenya. He was replaced briefly by someone who has accused the President of trying to set up mandatory, Communist-style re-education camps for youth. She's been replaced by a guy who calls Social Security a giant fraud.
Something has changed. Facts are elitist. Credibility is evolving into a liability and crazy has become a tactic. Where is this coming from?
Ladd goes on to attribute it to, well, the Internet, the proliferation of shiny devices and our new ability to build technological fortresses of self-reinforcing information. 
Maybe he's right. Or maybe it was just something he picked up on the Web.

HEADLINE: Q-and-A: The Quest of the Earth Scientist

BYLINE: FELICITY BARRINGER


HIGHLIGHT: Ralph J. Cicerone, president of the National Academy of Sciences, is eager to see big questions answered on humans' impact on climate change, forests and glaciers.

 BODY:
Q.
You're back here to celebrate the Department of Earth System Science's 20th anniversary; what has the department accomplished over those two decades?
A.
Both on the side of research as well as classroom instruction, I think they are doing very well. The quality of graduates who are coming here, the places they are turning down in order to come to Irvine, reflects on that. The studies that have been done, citation analyses -- the Irvine group has emerged as one of the leaders, year in and year out.
There is a particular lens that people are looking at here -- that is, human activity. To what extent can the changes being observed on earth be attributed to human activity or not? The idea is to look for changes, to detect changes, to find out how fast they are happening, understand the mechanism -- which of course means whether it's human-caused or natural, in order to be able to predict future changes on human time scales. Every generation we're adding one or two billion people.
Q.
Has the standing of science in general -- but particularly earth sciences -- in American society changed in the last five years or so? If so, why?
A.
I think earth sciences' standing has gone up. Even though we're seeing these manifestations of people denying the role of experts, whether in finance, economics or manufacturing policy or science - and other people who are denying the role of authority, that is, that nothing should be centralized, that every individual decision is as valuable as the other guy's -- despite all that, scientists still enjoy a very high reputation when public opinion polls are taken.
I'm actually pretty optimistic that people are actually realizing that science is self-correcting. When scientists make mistakes, if it's an important issue, believe me, they get caught quickly, whether the mistake was inadvertent or not. I think the whole idea of science being a valuable tool because it's self-correcting, I think it's been catching on, even in the last few years.
Q.
When you hear a presidential candidate like Governor Perry of Texassay that a substantial number of climate scientists are skewing their results to conform to the views of funding sources, what do you want to say to him?
A.
Well, I don't know of any scientist who's skewing results to get more funding. It just doesn't work, because the enterprise is self-correcting. Also, the way science works is not so different from business and other human enterprises -- it's competitive. A scientist doesn't get rich or famous by showing that everything that everyone else has done is correct.
I've watched Nobel Prize winners get interviewed. I remember one in particular who said: Believe me, this discovery did not make me popular among my colleagues. It showed either that, No. 1, they were wrong in what they were doing, or No. 2, they'd missed something pretty important. So this idea that scientists are skewing their results to obtain funding - I don't think it is going on. If it is, it has certainly escaped my attention. And it's not logical.
Q.
Is there any perceptible difference in the number of scientists getting in or out of the business because of the welter of bad feeling, including attacks on individual climate scientists, that has surrounded things like the stolen University of East Anglia e-mails
A.
I do know of individuals who have received threats or been through such unpleasant times that they have questioned whether they want to continue. But it's not happening on a large scale. Scientists answer to themselves pretty much. They are pretty independent cusses. They really are. I don't think scientists are necessarily looking for popularity in the first place. So I don't think it bothers them too much.
But a lot of them, for example, in climate, though, have been pretty taken aback by the ferocity of what goes on on the Web. People are saying things electronically which they would never say face to face and making allegations and accusations which probably don't hold water. The ferocity and maliciousness of the attacks is shocking people, but I don't think it's affecting scientists in what they do or frightening them out of the field.
Q.
In the February 2010 issue of Science, you had aletter that said, among other things, "It is essential that the scientific community work urgently to make standards for analyzing, reporting, providing access to, and stewardship of research data operational, while also establishing when requests for data amount to harassment or are otherwise unreasonable." In terms of self-policing, what changes has the science establishment in this country been able to make, and what changes are still needed?
A.
Well, at an official level, coincidentally, in early 2009 President Obama asked his science adviser to come forward with specific policies and practices. I think they were looking at two things: to clean up processes but also to protect government scientists from political and other kinds of pressure. After a long period of gestation, some places released internal policies and practices. And some of them do have to do with data stewardship, data access.
What I had in mind at the time was aimed at those fields of science that are so closely connected to societal and economic interests that we know there is enormous public interest -- whether it's due to commercial pressures and patents or proprietary information or environmental matters - that might affect us all through regulatory things. And then some awful cases in climate science where some of the worst disputes, including the East Anglia e-mail exchanges, arose over disputes of wanting to look at raw data. It seemed to me that we needed some data standards.
And I found out that there were a number of fields that had set up data standards inside their own fields. Most of them have been grass-roots, bottom-up, saying this is what we legitimately need to make data available to everybody to advance the science. And also to make the science even more rigorous. And also so that people who want the data don't have to go to the investigators and say, "Give me everything you've ever done." So they've set up repositories, some of them under N.I.H. sponsorship, some of them under NASA sponsorship. The National Science Foundation has now moved in this direction. They're requiring every new grantee to submit a plan on how they will make data available and how they will steward data.
I thought it was going to be easier than it's turning out to be. I thought the editors of scientific journals could exert great influence here. And they're saying, "Boy, it's going to be hard." We're trying to create a strategy now where individual scientists who are doing this kind of thing and can claim that they are benefiting from it - and there are quite a few of these people - will set themselves up as examples for others to follow.
Q.
What science should be done now that is not being done? What question would you most like to see answered?
A.
I would like to know how stable some of the productive aspects of our environment are. How stable, let's say, ocean fisheries are, and the whole food chain in the oceans. How stable are tropical forests? When you chew up big parts of them, do the remaining pieces of them still operate in the same way with respect to biodiversity, with respect to causing rainfall and modulating climate? So, large kinds of system questions.
I'd like to focus on the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica. There's been enormous progress in the last few years in understanding the rate at which things are happening and where the icebergs are falling off and so forth. But we can do a better job by far on the mechanics to be able to predict a little bit of the future, how fast this is going to happen in the future.
And it's not rocket science -- but very, very difficult measurements to make under these weird-shaped ice formations that lean out over the oceans, where you can't get boats in, it's hard to get submarines in, you can't do it by satellite. So blocking-and-tackling type science. Measuring heat flows that are coming in under these glacial formations and slowly eating away the shelves that then hold back the whole mass from falling into the ocean. So that would be a focused area of the ice shapes, topologies and heat balances so that we could predict their future destiny.
Another one that's starting to bug a lot of people: Just how sensitive are the major agricultural crops to temperatures and water availabilities under future stress conditions? There's some evidence that the optimum temperature for agricultural crops - once you go past it and get too hot, they may be more sensitive than we thought up till now. It's kind of an urgent subject.
Generally I think there's a lot of science around sustainability that scientists haven't done enough with. You don't want to be accused of being a Chicken Little, but from the other point of view, these systems haven't been characterized. How do they respond when you hit them with a hammer? What is the time spectrum of responses? How stable are they? So that whole set of questions really intrigues me.

HEADLINE: Legal Assistance in Civil Cases Under Growing Threat

BYLINE: JOHN ELIGON


HIGHLIGHT: As the Congress considers how much to cut back its support, the chief judge of New York keeps up a push to have the state help the poor in legal actions like foreclosures, evictions or disputes over benefits.

 BODY:
Both houses of Congress have indicated that they plan to cut back federal financing for the Legal Services Corporation, the nation's largest provider of money to assist people who cannot afford lawyers in civil cases, according to an article in The National Law Journal.
The Senate Appropriations Committee's vote this week to reduce financial support for the corporation by 2 percent comes as Jonathan Lippman, the chief judge of the New York, prepares for another round of hearings to promote the need to increase civil legal services.
Judge Lippman held hearings throughout the state last year and has four more planned this year, the first of which is scheduled for Tuesday in White Plains.
Steven Banks, the chief attorney for the city's Legal Aid Society, said the Congress's intended cuts to the Legal Services Corporation sent the wrong message.
"This is exactly the wrong moment to be decreasing legal assistance, which is crucial to helping children and adults living in poverty obtain the basic necessities of life," said Mr. Banks, whose organization actually does not receive any funds from the federal corporation. Legal Aid opted out several years ago because a condition of accepting the funds would have meant that they would not have been able to represent immigrants facing deportation, Mr. Banks said.
During the economic downturn of the past few years, Mr. Banks said, Legal Aid has seen an increase in requests for legal assistance in areas like obtaining food stamps and unemployment benefits, fighting foreclosure and eviction, and getting orders of protection. Because of a lack of finances, Legal Aid must turn away eight out of every nine people seeking assistance in a civil matter, Mr. Banks said.
"In every category of legal problem on the civil side we're continuing to see dramatic increases," Mr. Banks said. "One of the hardest things that our front-line staff has to do is turn away families and individuals whose evictions we know we could stop, whose foreclosures we know we could stop, who we know we could help get food stamps or unemployment benefits or access to health care, but we can't because of lack of resources."
The Legal Services Corporation currently receives $404 million in federal funding and the Senate's proposal would reduce that by $8 million, according to The National Law Journal. But this cut was far less than the 26 percent reduction proposed by the House, the journal reported.
The fickleness of financing for organizations like the Legal Services Corporation was one of the main reasons Judge Lippman said he was moved to urge the State Legislature to act.
"That's our point, that the Legal Services Corporation and all these other various means, this hodgepodge, patchwork quilt doesn't do it,'' he said. "We have to have a permanent, reliable funding stream for civil legal services. That has to come from the public fisc."
During last year's hearings, Judge Lippman said, he discovered that for every dollar spent on civil legal services, $5 are returned to the state. This is because competent representation in civil cases helps keep people off costly government-financed social programs, and lawyers can also help bring money into the state by identifying federal entitlement programs that their clients are eligible for, he said.
The judge also noted that banks do not want to see people go into foreclosure, landlords do not want to have to evict people and hospitals do not want to have to deny services because it takes away from money they could be earning.
"Their bottom lines, their own well being," Judge Lippman said, "is served by making sure people get civil legal services."

HEADLINE: Ameriprise Speaks With a New Voice

BYLINE: STUART ELLIOTT


HIGHLIGHT: Ameriprise Financial is introducing a new campaign on Friday that features the actor Tommy Lee Jones.

 BODY:
With Labor Day in the rearview mirror, Madison Avenue is fully engaged in bringing out new advertising campaigns for scores of marketers. The idea is to connect with consumers during the important fall and Christmas shopping seasons.
Among the blue-chip, big-spending brands that discussed new campaigns this week are Audi, DHL, GE Capital, Lowe's and United Parcel Service. Joining the crowd is Ameriprise Financial, which is introducing on Friday a campaign that features the actor Tommy Lee Jones.
The campaign for Ameriprise, a financial planning company, is being handled by two agencies owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies. R/GA is the creative agency and Initiative is the media agency.

R/GA is known as an interactive agency, so its role as the creative agency of record speaks volumes about the growing role that digital media are playing in ad campaigns.
Indeed, commercials from the campaign are getting a sneak peek on YouTube and the Ameriprise fan page on Facebook before they make an official debut on Sunday during the Fox coverage of the Emmy Awards.
Two commercials can be watched on youtube.com here and here.
The initial commercials feature Mr. Jones outdoors, leaning on a fence, and speaking to the camera in his characteristic plain-talk tones.
"In America, we believe in a future that is better than today," Mr. Jones says in one spot, then describes how Ameriprise has worked hard for its customers since 1894, "never taking a bailout."
In the other spot, Mr. Jones recounts a bit of the history of Ameriprise and how it reflects how "Americans are always willing to work hard for a better future." In that commercial, he also makes the no-bailout point.
"Consumers may not realize that Ameriprise has been helping people feel confident about their financial futures for more than 115 years," said Kim Sharan, chief marketing officer and president for financial planning and wealth strategies at Ameriprise in Minneapolis.
(One reason may be that Ameriprise has been operating under that name only since 2005, when it was spun off from American Express.)
It is also important, Ms. Sharan said, that people know "the financial institutions they're working with are strong, stable and trustworthy."
"We have an opportunity to demonstrate that Ameriprise is all of these," she added, "and to build confidence in our brand, by telling our story - who we are, what we believe in and what we've done over the years."
As for hiring Mr. Jones as a celebrity endorser, Ms. Sharan said, "We felt our story could be best delivered through one, consistent voice."
"We specifically looked for a well-known personality who shares our optimism and authenticity, and who embodies the American spirit," she added. "We believe that person is Tommy Lee Jones."
The commercials are directed by the documentary filmmaker Errol Morris.
"From a creative perspective," said George Tannenbaum, executive creative director at R/GA in New York, the combination of Mr. Jones and Mr. Morris "evokes an overwhelming sense of confidence and candor from a company that is dedicated to helping Americans through these challenging economic conditions."

HEADLINE: Podcast: The European Crisis, the Guggenheim Family and Online Privacy

BYLINE: JEFF SOMMER


HIGHLIGHT: A look at the latest Weekend Business podcast, and a listen.

 BODY:
The European financial crisis has already roiled markets around the world, but it's likely that worse is yet to come.
That's the view of Gretchen Morgenson, who analyzes the effects of the European crisis on the United States financial system and economy in the new Weekend Business podcast, and in her column in Sunday Business. 
While central banks and political leaders are trying to ameliorate the crisis, a default by Greece is quite probable, she says, and that is likely to be felt in the United States in two main ways. Credit default swaps insuring against a default will entangle some as-yet-unknown American counterparties, she says, and the shock could lead to another full-blown credit crisis, which would harm the markets and the economy. 
The fundamental mechanism underlying world markets is the focus of Robert Frank's new book, "The Darwin Economy," an adaptation of which appears in Sunday Business. In a podcast conversation, he argues that Charles Darwin, the naturalist, was a greater economist than Adam Smith. Darwin's theory of evolution explains why markets sometimes produce socially unacceptable results - and the reason, Professor Frank says, is intrinsic to competition. Unlike Smith's "invisible hand" theory, Darwin's theory says that group and individual interests sometimes conflict, in which case, individual interests win. Government sometimes needs to step in to correct matters, he says.
In another conversation, Graham Bowley tells David Gillen about the history of the Guggenheim family and of individuals who are accused of trying to swindle investors based on the false claim that they, too, are members of that illustrious clan. The saga of the Guggenheims and would-be Guggenheims is the subject of Mr. Bowley's article on the cover of Sunday Business. 
And, finally, Natasha Singer discusses online ID systems that, she says, may threaten individual privacy. She elaborates on this theme in the Slipstream column in Sunday Business. 
You can find specific segments of the podcast at these junctures: Gretchen Morgenson (34:29); news summary (27:03); Graham Bowley (24:38); Natasha Singer (17:32); Robert Frank (10:11); and the week ahead (2:06). 
As articles discussed in the podcast are published during the weekend, links will be added to this post.

HEADLINE: Approval of Congress Matches Record Low

BYLINE: ALLISON KOPICKI


HIGHLIGHT: Just 12 percent of Americans approve of the way Congress is handling its job, matching its all-time low, recorded in October 2008 at the height of the economic crisis, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.

 BODY:
Congress faces historically low approval ratings as it wades into the debate over the $447 billion jobs package proposed by President Obama, with just 12 percent of Americans now approving of the way Congress is handling its job, matching its all-time low, recorded in October 2008 at the height of the economic crisis, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.
Voters are slightly more disapproving of the Republicans in Congress than they are of the Democrats, with just 19 percent approving of Republicans, compared with 28 percent that approve of Democrats.
Republican voters are more dissatisfied with their party's representatives than are Democrats. Half of Republican voters say they disapprove of Republicans in Congress, while 43 percent of Democratic voters say they disapprove of Democrats in Congress. Independents are slightly less approving of Congressional Republicans than Congressional Democrats.
Only 6 percent of registered voters say that most members of Congress have earned re-election, while 84 percent say it's time to give someone new a chance, a historic low for the New York Times/CBS poll. Dissatisfaction with Congress runs deep across both parties, with more than 8 in 10 of both Republicans and Democrats saying it's time to elect new representatives.
In follow-up interviews, partisanship and bickering were given as major reasons for respondents' disapproval of Congress. 
Nancy Lewis, a retiree living in San Clemente, Calif., said she had seen a slow degradation of the political system from when she grew up during the era of Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon. "While there were vigorous debates and some filibusters, generally, 40-some years ago there was more cooperation," she said. "Congress used to be able to compromise and come together to make decisions after a period of discussion."
A Democrat who grew up in conservative Orange County, in a family where politics were discussed often, Ms. Lewis says she and her friends lament what is happening to Congress. "Now I think that many Congress members are in it for the individual glory, they're in it for themselves, and not for the citizens of the United States," she said.
When pollsters asked about voters' own representatives in Congress, they expressed generally more positive or supportive views. But public opinion has changed, with many now saying it's time for someone else to have a chance. Just 33 percent of voters say their own representative in Congress deserves to be re-elected, and 57 percent say it's time to elect someone else - another record level of dissatisfaction.
Democratic and independent voters are slightly more frustrated with their own representatives, with about 6 in 10 of each saying it's time for a new person. This isn't entirely surprising, with Republicans currently in control of the House. But nearly half of Republican voters also say their representative does not deserve re-election.
"They all seem great when they go out on the campaign trail - and then when they get in, they turn into a regular politician.They all tell us what we want to hear," said Steve DeMayo, a maintenance technician in Raymore, Mo. A Republican, Mr. DeMayo is disappointed with politicians' disconnect from their constituents, and wants a candidate who has successfully run a business or had other real world experience. "They get persuaded by the almighty dollar and don't listen to the American people about health care, or abortion, or gun control or immigration laws," Mr. DeMayo said.
Kathryn Westrich, an independent from Yorktown, Va., said she was tired of the partisan bickering in Congress. "They refuse to get along and compromise and get anything done. I think the partisan fighting has been going on a long time, but it's worse now," said Ms. Westrich, 57, who was a mail carrier for her local county, but has been unemployed for four years.
"I'd like to see a candidate who doesn't necessarily follow the party line, but who works for the good of the state that he or she works for," Ms. Westrich said. "And who won't waste taxpayer money on things we can do without - they need to prioritize better, like we do in our own homes."
The current dissatisfaction with Congress may or may not point to another "change" election in 2012. The 2006, 2008 and 2010 elections were all considered at the time to be referendums on voters' disapproval with things in Washington. But for some, like Ms. Lewis, another election may not change anything in the nation's capital.
"Politics was part of my life, and now it's just extremely disappointing," she said. "Genuinely concerned citizens who go to the voting booth don't have any choices. They have to decide between the lesser of two evils, and that's a pathetic place to be."
The latest New York Times/CBS News poll, the full results of which will be available at 6:30 p.m. ET on NYTimes.com, is based on nationwide telephone interviews conducted Sept. 10-15 with 1,452 adults of whom 1,356 are registered to vote. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points for both groups.

HEADLINE: Obama Presses Iceland Over Fin Whale Hunt

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama intensifies pressure on Iceland over its harvest of endangered fin whales.

 BODY:
On Thursday, President Obama ordered government agencies to ramp up pressure on Iceland to end its slaughter of endangered fin whales, the second largest whale species. But the order stopped short of ordering trade sanctions. He issued a Message to Congress with the details, including this passage:
Of particular concern to the United States, Iceland harvested 125 endangered fin whales in 2009 and 148 in 2010, a significant increase from the total of 7 fin whales it commercially harvested between 1987 and 2007.
This is what that harvest looks like (video from Greenpeace):
There are thought to be around 30,000 of these giants, the second largest whale species, in the North Atlantic. 
I was lucky enough to see a few in 2004, while writing about humanity's evolving relationship with whales from the vantage point of Tadoussac, Quebec. -- a spot where whales centuries ago were slaughtered on the beach but where crowds now gather on the rocks to watch spouting blue, sperm, minke and other whale species feeding. Here's one photo from that visit: 
The president's order noted that the collapse of the market for whale meat in Japan following the March tsunami had prompted Iceland's sole whaling company to suspend fin hunts so far this year, but said the country's policies clearly pointed to an eventual resumption in the activities.
Obama's bottom line was clear:
Iceland's actions threaten the conservation status of an endangered species and undermine multilateral efforts to ensure greater worldwide protection for whales.
The Natural Resources Defense Council criticized the decision to stop short of imposing targeted economic sanctions. Leslie Kaufman has more on the Green blog.
Personally, I think the president's move was an appropriate ramping up of pressure, given that the species -- while listed as endangered -- is relatively abundant. He's ordered relevant agencies to file reports with the White House immediately if Iceland resumes the hunt and to review the situation in six months one way or the other.
That's when more serious steps could be merited.

HEADLINE: George Shultz on Politics and Budgets

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: George Shultz, the economist who served in several cabinet posts for Republican presidents, looks at the current budget process in Washington and shudders. But he sounds like he is impressed by one candidate for the Republican presidential nomination. 

 BODY:
I called George Shultz, the former more-or-less everything, this week to see what he thought of the government now. I discovered that he is rankled by the budget process but impressed by at least one candidate for the Republican presidential nomination.
And I found that a long perspective can serve as a reminder that life is not made up of one disaster after another. 
"It's an interesting thing to look back and see how much turmoil we have in the last 100 years, and how it also has been a period of great progress," he said, mentioning the reduction in poverty and increase in life expectancy around the world. "In many respects, the U.S. had a big hand in creating a global commons that everyone benefited from, including us."
On Monday, he will receive the Economics Club of New York Award for Leadership Excellence, and he told me he had no desire to scoop his speech, which will discuss the world as he sees it now. 
But he did say the current budget process "is undoubtedly a catastrophe. We are living in continuing resolutions. They don't have any thought in them. They just continue things."
He spoke wistfully of the days when the presidents and congresses of different parties were able to reach agreement on budgets. "From what I read," he said of the current poisoned atmosphere in Washington, "it is not recognizable."
Mr. Shultz was a young White House economist in the Eisenhower administration. He served as secretary of labor, as budget director and as Treasury secretary in the Nixon administration, and as an economic adviser and as secretary of state under Ronald Reagan. 
"And," he told me, "I did things for Kennedy and Johnson."
When he was not working for the government, he taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Chicago and Stanford, and was president of Bechtel, a large construction company.
I pointed out that doing things for presidents from the other party was now considered a political liability in some circles, noting the criticism of Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former Utah governor, for serving as ambassador to China under President Obama. Mr. Huntsman's campaign for the Republican presidential nomination has yet to catch fire. 
"Why," asked Mr. Shultz, "don't we elect somebody who is patriotic, competent, sensible, has experience in government and has shown that he can manage well?" 
He said Mr. Huntsman had greatly impressed people in Singapore, where he was George H.W. Bush's ambassador before he was elected governor, adding that impressing Singaporeans was not easy.
Mr. Shultz said he was not ready to endorse anybody, but he passed up the chance to volunteer nice things about any of the other candidates.
Of Mr. Huntsman, he said, "He looks a lot better to me than he does in the polls."

HEADLINE: Obama Warns Iceland on Whaling Activity

BYLINE: LESLIE KAUFMAN


HIGHLIGHT: While the sanctions proposed might seem mild to some, for environmentalists it was akin to throwing down the gauntlet, diplomatically speaking.

 BODY:
In a move hailed by conservation activists, President Barack Obama initiated potential diplomatic sanctions against Iceland this week for its commercial whaling activity. The sanctions include six measures ranging from possibly limiting cabinet-level visits to Iceland to limiting cooperation with Iceland in the Arctic region.
While such sanctions might seem mild to some, for environmentalists it was akin to throwing down the gauntlet, diplomatically speaking. "This is a real shot across the bow," said Patrick Ramage, global whale program director with the International Fund for Animal Welfare
The disagreement has its roots in a decision by Iceland to resume commercial whale hunting in 2006. In subsequent years the annual number of endangered fin whales killed by Icelandic fleets for whale-meat exports to Japan has risen from 7 to 148.

In a letter sent to Congress on Wednesday night, the president said that such activities "diminish the effectiveness of the International Whaling Commission conservation program" and could result in sanctions.
The basis for such sanctions was first certified by Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke in July as part of the legal process. He suggested six possible actions that the United States might take to increase pressure on Iceland. The White House had the option to choose none or some of the sanctions; it chose all six.
Mr. Ramage said the decision was being taken seriously in Iceland, where officials are worrying out loud that their whaling activities, which largely benefit one company, are hurting relations with the United States.

HEADLINE: James Carville's Flawed Advice for Obama

BYLINE: MATT BAI


HIGHLIGHT: The veteran political strategist is urging the president to "fire a lot of people." But there's a problem with his argument.

 BODY:
He has probably been quoted more than any pundit on the planet since 1992 (which, by the way, was the last time he actually won an American campaign), but when James Carville opens his mouth, Democrats still tend to listen. And so it got a lot of people talking this week when Mr. Carville, in an open letter for President Obama on CNN's Web site, urged the struggling president to follow the example of some of his predecessors and just fire a bunch of people.
"For God's sake, why are we still looking at the same political and economic advisers that got us into this mess?" Mr. Carville asked. "It's not working. Furthermore, it's not going to work with the same team, the same strategy and the same excuses."
The remarks resonated in part because some Democrats on Capitol Hill and even at the White House appear now to be circling ominously around Bill Daley, Mr. Obama's chief of staff. When Politico asked Mr. Carville if he was talking specifically about Mr. Daley, Mr. Carville replied: "I recuse myself. Bill's an old friend." (Useful tip for Mr. Carville's old friends: if you're ever facing jail time and are in need of an enthusiastic character witness, Mr. Carville might not be the first call you want to make.)
Historians and management consultants can debate the merits of firing senior aides generally. As Mr. Carville noted, it seemed to work for Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton at precarious moments in their campaigns and presidencies. It worked less well for Jimmy Carter, who demanded the resignation of his entire cabinet just days after his so-called malaise speech, perhaps in the hope that he could make everyone forget it.
The problem with Mr. Carville's prescription in this particular case, however, especially as it pertains to Mr. Daley, is that it would directly undermine the foundation of the case that Mr. Obama and his Democratic allies have been trying so hard to make.
The point that Mr. Obama has been driving home for at least the past year, when he started talking about how America's car had been driven into a ditch and all of that, is that he didn't create the mess we're in and therefore shouldn't be held entirely - or even largely - accountable for it. Mr. Obama's first chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, once colorfully explained to me that Mr. Obama and his aides in 2009 had inherited a kind of sandwich that involves an expletive and that, trust me, you do not want to eat. 
What Mr. Obama and other Democrats have argued, over and over, is that we didn't get into our economic morass in one year or two, and we can't expect him or anyone else to get us out of it any faster. Constancy in the face of crisis, they say, is the only sensible course.
But now here comes Mr. Daley, an outsider to the Obama world who became chief of staff nine months ago. He inherited a dispirited White House, a highly partisan and divided Congress and an economy that was about to sink back into turpitude. He has failed, to this point, to score some huge legislative deal or to mollify the president's critics on either the left or the right.
So what should Mr. Obama do with Mr. Daley? Send him packing! Do the Donald Trump on the guy! Where's the accountability?
You see the flaw in the reasoning here?
If administrations are to be judged solely on results, rather than in the context of the times, then Mr. Obama can't possibly make a compelling argument for his own re-election - not when unemployment refuses to fall below 9 percent. But if he intends to argue that the data points of his presidency are simply beyond anyone's control for the moment, and that good policy takes some time to work, then he can't very well go around firing senior aides who have failed, in a matter of months, to stop the slide.
Or, rather, he can, but it would contradict his own appeal to the voters for their continued faith. He would be judging his top aides by exactly the criteria that he is asking the public to set aside.
The White House is either largely responsible for this prolonged economic misery and the ongoing dysfunction in Washington, or it isn't. If it isn't, then there's not much reason to bring the hammer down on those who run the place. If it is, then someone will indeed be held accountable.
But as Mr. Carville knows better than anyone, having won a referendum against George H.W. Bush 19 years ago, that someone can only be the president himself.

HEADLINE: Perry Sharpens His Attacks on Romney

BYLINE: RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.


HIGHLIGHT: In Iowa, Perry plays to conservative farmers with a more pointed version of his stump speech.

 BODY:
NEWTON, Iowa -- On the campaign trial in Iowa, Texas Gov. Rick Perry isn't answering questions -- or even taking questions -- on any of the key issues his Republican rivals attacked him on during last Monday's debate. Instead, he's sharpening his attacks on Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor.
In two Iowa appearances so far this week, Governor Perry has given a pretty routine stump speech of the sort that made him one of the most successful retail campaigners in Texas history. He has played to the conservative farmers and others who came out to hear him by emphasizing his small-town farming background and trying to build the perception that he deserves credit -- as opposed to an oil-heavy economy that would have been strong no matter who was in office -- for job creation in his state. 
But coming off the broadsides he took during the televised debate Monday night in Tampa, he's been going on more of an attack against Mr. Romney, even suggesting it is hard to tell him that much apart from President Obama.
"I think it's very important that we put someone as our nominee that does not blur the lines between President Obama and the Republican Party," he said during a fundraiser in Jefferson on Thursday night.
He also cited Mr. Romney's comments pointing out that Texas's employment has been favorably buttressed by, among other things, the nature of its energy-heavy economy. "Folks back in Texas are a little offended by that," Mr. Perry said, without identifying which folks were upset.
During the debate in Tampa, Mr. Perry had said he didn't believe Mr. Romney's health care plan was right for Massachusetts, but he said he agreed with their right to decide that for themselves. 
But speaking to local Republicans on Friday morning in Newton, a half-hour east of Des Moines, he was sharper: "It doesn't make any difference whether it is passed in Massachusetts or passed in Washington D.C. -- it is bad medicine and it needs to be stopped." He also cited a conservative free-market study in claiming that Mr. Romney's plan has not been good for the Massachusetts economy.
Many Republicans here endorse Governor Perry's attacks on "Obamacare," but it remains to be seen how well, in the end, he can tie that to Mr. Romney.
It is also too soon to know how Mr. Perry will fare in Iowa once he does begin taking questions here about his position on issues including immigration, Social Security, and ethanol subsidies -- issues that many Iowa Republicans, despite their fondness for Mr. Perry's charisma, background and values, have substantial reservations about.

HEADLINE: Perry and Romney Change Tone, and Targets

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney and Rick Perry are beginning to employ more personal attacks that question each other's motivations, character and -- in at least one case -- upbringing.

 BODY:
Now, it's getting personal.
Mitt Romney and Rick Perry are dropping all pretenses and are beginning to employ more personal attacks that question each other's motivations, character and -- in at least one case -- upbringing.
Mr. Perry, the governor of Texas, on Thursday found a new and biting way to respond to Mr. Romney's accusation that the Lonestar State had been dealt four aces when it came to the economy.
"I wasn't born with four aces in my hand," Mr. Perry now says on the trail -- a barely veiled reference to Mr. Romney's multimillion-dollar fortune and patrician upbringing as the son of a governor.
The line recalls what one of Mr. Perry's predecessors, Ann Richards, once said in mocking the upbringing of George H.W. Bush during the 1988 Democratic convention.
"Poor George," Ms. Richards said to thunderous applause. "He can't help it. He was born with a silver foot in his mouth."
Mr. Romney has not gone after Mr. Perry's background -- yet. But he has certainly questioned the Texas governor's willingness take more credit than he deserves for the good things that have happened in Texas. 
"Governor Perry doesn't believe that he created those things," Mr. Romney said in the recent debate in California. "If he tried to say that, well, it would be like Al Gore saying he invented the Internet."
The pair are certainly not the first -- just the most recent -- presidential rivals to get testy with each other. Senator John McCain and Mr. Romney got so nasty during the Florida primary in 2008 that Mr. Romney accused Mr. McCain of being "dishonest" and said "he should apologize."
Mr. Romney never got the apology, but after losing the Florida primary to Mr. McCain, he dropped out of the race and endorsed his rival.
But the venom is appearing a bit sooner than it did in some other races. During their clash in 2008, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama treated each other with kid gloves for months, each wary of taking the first shot.
That did end, eventually, of course. In one debate, after a moderator suggested that voters "seem to like Barack Obama more," Mr. Obama offered what he may have intended as praise for his rival, butit sounded more like a pointed dig.
"You're likable enough, Hillary," he said, "no doubt about it."

HEADLINE: House Republicans Outline Common Ground on Jobs

BYLINE: JENNIFER STEINHAUER


HIGHLIGHT: House Republican leaders rejected key elements of President Obama's jobs plan, but noted some components they would support.

 BODY:
House Republican leaders Friday rejected key elements of President Obama's jobs plan, but told their rank-and-file members they would support other components, from the well-publicized -- like a extension of the current payroll tax holiday -- to the more obscure, such as continuing depreciation write-offs for businesses.
In a letter to their members, Speaker John A. Boehner and Representative Eric Cantor, the majority leader, said, "We believe there are areas of common agreement, and areas worthy of further conversation where agreement , assuming there are good faith discussions, may be possible." 
The memo follows:
MEMORANDUM
TO: House Republicans
FR: Speaker Boehner, Leader Cantor, Whip McCarthy, and Chairman Hensarling
DT: September 16, 2011
RE: The President's Jobs Proposal
In August, we released our fall legislative agenda focused on implementing two key aspects of our jobs agenda, the GOP Plan for America's Job Creators: regulatory and tax relief for America's small businesses, entrepreneurs and employers. This week, we completed action on the first of those items: blocking the federal government's National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) from unilaterally telling businesses in what states they can and cannot open up for business. Also, this week the President sent Congress his proposed jobs bill. Having had a few days to review his proposal, we wanted to take this opportunity and provide you with some initial reaction.
Last week, prior to his address to a Joint Session of Congress, we wrote to President Obama to discuss potential ways forward on job creation. In addition to highlighting the numerous pro-growth jobs bills passed by the House and awaiting action by the Democrat-controlled Senate, we told the President: "While it is important that we continue to debate and discuss our different approaches to job creation, it is also critical that our differences not preclude us from taking action in areas where there is common agreement." We stressed that "[w]e shouldn't approach this as an all or nothing situation."
We were hopeful that the President was interested in finding common ground as well. However, the White House and the President's campaign demanded that the bill pass in its entirety. David Axelrod, the President's top campaign advisor, told ABC's 'Good Morning America' that "We are not in negotiation to break up the package. And it's not an a la carte menu." Meanwhile, the White House Communications Director, Dan Pfeiffer, said, "The president said it 16 times, I'll say it a 17th time today. He wants them to pass the American Jobs Act. That's the piece of legislation he's sending up."
For the sake of 14 million Americans who are currently unemployed and the more than 4 million who have been unemployed for more than a year, we are pleased that the White House has begun to back away from that extreme. It is far more important that the focus be on delivering results for the American people rather than on the upcoming campaign. As the President himself said, "The next election is 14 months away. And the people who sent us here -- the people who hired us to work for them -- they don't have the luxury of waiting 14 months."
We believe there are areas of common agreement, and areas worthy of further conversation where agreement -- assuming there are good faith discussions -- may be possible.
Areas of potential common agreement and areas worthy of further discussion include:
 Extension of 100 Percent Bonus Depreciation: The President has proposed extending through 2012 the ability of businesses to expense 100% of the cost of certain property they place in service. Bonus depreciation, which has historically been a bipartisan proposal, makes it easier for businesses to invest now in new machinery and equipment.
 Addressing the Pending Application of Withholding on Government Contractors: Under current law as of January 1, 2013, businesses that provide goods or services to federal, state, or local governments will have 3% of their payments for such goods or services withheld. The President has proposed delaying this requirement until December 31, 2013. In the House Republican Fall Jobs Agenda, we proposed repealing this onerous withholding requirement.
 Small Business Capital Formation: The White House fact sheet accompanying the President's speech includes a proposal to "reduce the regulatory burdens on small business capital formation in ways that are consistent with investor protection, including expanding 'crowdfunding' opportunities and increasing mini-offerings." While the legislative proposal transmitted by the President failed to include any language to advance these goals, the House Financial Services Committee is in the process of considering legislation that (1) increases the threshold at which small companies are subject to full SEC regulation (the current threshold is nearly twenty years old); (2) increase the number of shareholders a company can have before triggering SEC registration; (3) remove the SEC restrictions on "crowdfunding" so businesses can use marketing, such as social networks, to raise capital from a large pool of small investors who may or may not be SEC accredited; and (4) remove SEC restrictions so businesses can use marketing to seek unlimited amounts of capital from SEC accredited investors. 
 Incentives for Hiring Veterans: Current law includes employer tax credits for hiring disabled veterans (up to $4,800) and unemployed veterans (up to $2,400). These tax credits will expire at the end of 2011. The President has proposed expanding these credits. The House Veterans' Affairs Committee is considering a more comprehensive effort to assist returning heroes, examining the range of challenges they face entering the workforce, including the need for education and training assistance and to address other barriers to employment. We believe there is an opportunity to make meaningful and significant progress in this area.
 Unemployment Insurance System Reforms: The President has proposed a number of reforms to the Unemployment Insurance (UI) system, including "bridge to work" programs that allow the unemployed to pursue work-based training and enhanced reemployment assistance programs to target those most likely to be unemployed for an extended period of time. House Republicans recommended some of these very ideas to the President at the end of 2009. While the President links these reforms to a blanket extension of extended (up to 99 weeks) UI benefits and new federal spending, there is no reason we cannot move forward on these areas of agreement.
 Free Trade Agreements: The President stated in his speech that, "Now it's time to clear the way for a series of trade agreements that would make it easier for American companies to sell their products in Panama and Colombia and South Korea " He also characterized this as a step that, "will require congressional action." We agree. We will take action. But first, we need the President to take action and send us the agreements for our approval. We have repeatedly called on the President to unlock these agreements and clear the way for the creation of hundreds of thousands of new American jobs, while ensuring that we do not lose any more ground in our global competitiveness. In fact, last week we passed a bipartisan measure to extend the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). We hope this action, and pending action in the Senate, will allow us to move forward on all three agreements. 
 Infrastructure Funding: The President has proposed $50 billion in "immediate" surface transportation funding and the creation of a new $10 billion national infrastructure bank. While spending to repair and improve infrastructure can play an important part in both short- and long-term economic growth, adding more money to the same broken system is more likely to produce waste and inefficiency than meaningful results. There are more than 100 federal surface transportation programs, many of which are duplicative or do not serve a federal purpose. Before spending new money, for example, we could act to end the mandatory set aside that diverts 10% of current surface transportation funds from roads and bridges to transportation museums and other "enhancements." And the money we do spend ought to get to the job site faster. For example, of the highway funds provided over two and half years ago under the President's stimulus bill, over 18% is still unexpended. In part, this is because of an overly complicated and bureaucratic approval process that everyone agrees ought to be fixed. Rather than adding more money to a broken system, Congress and the President should spend the next few months working out a multi-year transportation authorization bill that fixes these problems.
 Payroll Tax Relief: The President has proposed an extension and a significant expansion of the current payroll tax holiday. The President would more than double the amount of the holiday (up from $110 billion this year to $240 billion in 2012, including an expansion of this proposal to some of the employers' share of these taxes), and would sunset the entire payroll tax holiday effective January 1, 2013. So while employees would see an additional temporary benefit from this proposal in 2012 (the President would modestly expand the current payroll holiday), they would experience a larger effective tax increase 12 months later when the payroll tax reverted back to its full level. There may be significant unforeseen downsides to large temporary tax cuts immediately followed by large tax increases. Compounding this negative effect is the scheduled increase in all individual tax rates, capital gain and dividend rates, and the elimination/reduction of various individual credits and deductions. In short, we are creating significant new uncertainty in an already uncertain economy. Moreover, the proposal increases general fund transfers to Social Security, something that needs to be carefully considered given the long-term challenges facing that program and the implications of those challenges for taxpayers. Finally, the President proposes to pay for this one-year expanded tax holiday by permanently limiting the ability of those earning more than $200,000 a year to take full advantage of their itemized deductions, including their charitable deductions. With over 40% of charitable deductions being claimed by those impacted by this proposed policy, the practical effect is a tax on and a reduction in charitable giving. This will negatively impact thousands of churches and non-profits. House Republicans are supportive of tax relief for working families and small businesses, but the temporary relief proposed by the President must not cause unforeseen harm to the economy 15 months from now and it shouldn't be offset with permanent tax increases; and it shouldn't come at the expense of the nation's charities. That said, a commitment to honest and fruitful discussions between the White House and Congressional Leaders could lead to potential bipartisan agreement on a plan that avoids these downsides and provides tax relief for the middle class that encourages short- and long-term economic growth and job creation.
There are also some aspects of the President's proposal where it will be harder to find common ground. In addition to his proposed tax increases, we do not agree with the policies proposed by the President that are a repeat or continuation of spending from his 2009 stimulus bill. For example, the President has proposed:
 Payments to State and Local Governments: The 2009 stimulus bill included $53.6 billion in state stabilization funds under the guise of preventing the layoff of teachers, law enforcement officers, and other municipal employees. This band-aid approach masked over the true fiscal problems facing states and local governments. Some jurisdictions used the funds to provide one-time raises; others retained employees for a short-period of time, only to lay them off later. The President is proposing more of the same with an additional $30 billion in spending.
 Federal School Construction: School construction has historically been a state and local function. In his 2009 stimulus proposal, President Obama proposed approximately $20 billion for school construction, but the Democrat-controlled Senate rejected the proposed funding.
 Neighborhood Stabilization Grants: The President has proposed a $15 billion initiative to rehabilitate and refurbish homes. This proposal is strikingly similar to the Neighborhood Stabilization Program which has already received $7 billion in funding. There have been allegations of misuse of funds and little evidence that the program delivered the promised results. Five Democrats actually joined with House Republicans in voting to terminate the program earlier this year.
 Tax Increases: As the President himself has said, " you don't raise taxes in a recession." With respect to the tax increases the President has proposed to pay for this package, many in his party seem to agree. 
Consider these quotes from just one news story this week:
"Terrible," Sen. Jim Webb (D-Va.) told POLITICO when asked about the president's ideas for how to pay for the $450 billion price tag. "We shouldn't increase taxes on ordinary income. There are other ways to get there."
"That offset is not going to fly, and he should know that," said Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu from the energy-producing Louisiana, referring to Obama's elimination of oil and gas subsidies. "Maybe it's just for his election, which I hope isn't the case."
"If we're going to change something, we got to be sure that we do it in the total [tax reform] package, that they know what the rules of the road are," said Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.).
Democratic Sen. Mark Begich, from the oil-rich state of Alaska, said it was "frustrating" to see the president single out the oil industry after calling on the congressional [Joint Select Committee] in last week's address to Congress to find savings. "When you start singling out certain industries, there's an unfairness to it," he said in an interview. "On the pay-fors, I have a problem."
 Tax Deductions and Exclusions: The President's largest proposed tax increase is, as he describes it, on "the wealthiest Americans." Perhaps it would more aptly be described as a tax increase on charitable contributions, mortgage interest deductions, and municipal bonds for states, etc. The President proposes to limit the value of certain deductions and exclusions for those with income above $200,000 ($250,000 for a couple). All but three Senators opposed an even more limited version this proposal when it was voted on in 2009, hardly the type of bipartisan agreement the President has claimed is his goal. It is understandable why this proposal is so vehemently rejected by the American people. Consider the impact of this proposal just on charities: more than 40% of all tax deductible charitable contributions are made by families impacted by this tax increase. Raising taxes on charitable contributions will mean smaller contributions and fewer resources for churches, food banks, universities, and other non-profits. During a week when it was http://news.yahoo.com/census-us-poverty-rate-swells-nearly-1-6-142639972.html>reported that an astounding one in six Americans are living in poverty , why would anyone want to essentially penalize soup kitchens, hospitals, and churches that provide essential services to those hurting the most? Finally, this tax increase is the linchpin of a nearly half-trillion dollar permanent tax increase to offset another round of temporary stimulus spending and other tax changes. We actually changed the Rules of the House this year to prevent the use of tax increases to pay for more spending, a standard this proposal would violate. 
Making Progress

We don't question the President's sincerity when he says he has crafted the right prescription for economic recovery. We believe good people can have honest disagreements without having their morals or commitment to country being called into question. To be clear, we don't agree with portions of President Obama's proposal, and Republicans have a different vision for the steps that need to be taken to help our economy get back to creating jobs. We are, however, committed to passing legislation to implement the policies in the areas where agreement can be found to support job creation and long-term economic growth. Over the past several days, many of you have approached us with ideas for legislation that meets these goals. We will be working with you and our committees in the coming days and weeks to schedule as many of these items as possible for consideration. It is our hope that Majority Leader Reid, the Democratic Majority in the Senate and President Obama will realize that while an all or nothing approach might make sense to some political advisors and communicators, it comes at the expense of making progress for millions of unemployed Americans -- and that is a tradeoff none of us should make.

HEADLINE: The Role of Prices in Health Care Spending

BYLINE: UWE E. REINHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: Americans pay more for doctors and other health-care services that people in other countries, and whether that is value-for-cost is another matter, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Uwe E. Reinhardt is an economics professor at Princeton. He has some financial interests in the health care field. 
The term "health care" evokes different images in people's minds. To patients who find a miraculous cure, health care may be almost sacred. For physicians, nurses and other health care professionals it is a compassionate human activity. To hard-nosed economists, health care represents just another exchange of favors embedded in a wider market economy that consists of exchanging favors.
The chart below illustrates this exchange. Some members of society surrender real resources - their time, amplified by their skill or the health care products they produce - to the process of patient care, which is meant to improve the patients' quality of life. In return, society issues these providers of real health care resources generalized claims (money) on all the things included in gross domestic product. 
Thus, the health care sector of any country always has the dual goals of enhancing the quality of life of patients as well as enhancing the quality of life of the providers of health care, and, charity care aside, patients are at once objects of compassion and biological structures yielding cash.

We express the generalized claims given to the providers of real health care resources either in dollar terms per-capita or as a percentage of G.D.P. The chart below illustrates the fraction of G.D.P. ceded to the providers of health care in a number of different countries over the last three decades. 
Although not all countries can be featured in such a chart, the fact is that no other country cedes quite the slice of its G.D.P. to the providers of health care as does the United States. Current projections are that health care will claim every fifth dollar (19.8 percent to be precise) of G.D.P. in the United States by 2020.
It follows from the first chart that the claim on G.D.P. that a nation cedes to its providers of real health care resources does not tell us what real resources patients receive in return, let alone what value these resources have to patients (see, for example, this report). 
That is because the size of the claim on G.D.P. depends not only on the quantity of real resources surrendered to the process of health care, but also the price paid the providers per unit of real resource. In theory, it would be quite possible that in two otherwise identical countries exactly the same real resources are surrendered to health care and yet the slice of G.D.P. ceded to the providers of these resources in return could differ.
In this regard, by Miriam Laugesen and Sherry Glied, published last week in the health-policy journal Health Affairs warrants careful review. The authors assert:
Higher health care prices in the United States are a crucial reason that the nation's health spending is so much higher than that of other countries. Our study compared physicians' fees paid by public and private payers for primary care office visits and hip replacements in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. We also compared physicians' incomes net of practice expenses, differences in financing the cost of medical education and the relative contribution of payments per physician and of physician supply in the countries' national spending on physician services. 
Public and private payers paid somewhat higher fees to United States primary care physicians for office visits (27 percent more for public, 70 percent more for private) and much higher fees to orthopedic physicians for hip replacements (70 percent more for public, 120 percent more for private) than public and private payers paid these physicians' counterparts in other countries. U.S. primary care and orthopedic physicians also earned higher incomes ($186,582 and $442,450, respectively) than their foreign counterparts. We conclude that the higher fees, rather than factors such as higher practice costs, volume of services or tuition expenses, were the main drivers of higher U.S. spending, particularly in orthopedics.
Other studies point in the same direction. An early one, "U.S. Health Care Costs: The Untold Story," by the health economist Mark Pauly, was also published in Health Affairs. Professor Pauly showed that a good many nations in Europe actually transferred more real human health-care resources to patients than did Americans - suggesting that the real-resource cost of European health care is higher than it is in the United States (or was, at the time of the study). But these other nations paid physicians and other health personnel less than do Americans.
Higher physician income, of course, cannot explain all or most of the total higher health spending in the United States, as payments for "physician- and clinical services" constitute only about 20 percent to total current health spending ($538 billion out of a total of $2.7 trillion in 2011) and close to half of those payments tend to go for practice expenses, including support staff, malpractice insurance and claims processing. 
But prices of other, non-physician health-care services and products in the United States also seem to be higher than elsewhere, as is suggested by the annual surveys of health care prices conducted by the International Federation of Health Plans in their comparative price reports. 
None of these cross-national studies are perfect, but together they do suggest that Americans pay more for individual health care services - not only physician services - than do residents of other countries, and that this must contribute to the higher level of health spending in the United States.
What one should make of this finding is another matter. Professor Laugesen and Ms. Glied refrain from going down that route. They merely present the facts as they see them. 
Critics of this study will properly point out the enormous methodological hurdles one faces in making cross-national comparisons of this sort. But it is not a compelling argument to suggest that because a study of this sort cannot be done perfectly it should be ignored. My response to the critics: Try to do better!

HEADLINE: China Trade Numbers Bear Watching, Up or Down

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
With its imports rising faster than exports, China's overall trade surplus is down sharply from where it was before the credit crisis of 2008 and 2009 caused world trade levels to fall drastically. But its surpluses with the United States and some major European countries have risen to record levels. 
The countries that have benefited the most are the suppliers of major capital goods, particularly Germany, which have sold China rising amounts of machinery that can be used to produce manufactured goods, and the sellers of natural resources.
In addition, some Asian countries have prospered both as suppliers to China and as countries whose own, cheaper exports have replaced some more expensive Chinese products in other markets.
The accompanying charts show the changes in bilateral trade balances between China and 12 countries since 2007, the last full year before the United States and then most of the rest of the world went into recession. The charts are based on Chinese trade figures, including August statistics released this week.
Over the 12 months through August, China ran up a trade surplus in goods of almost $170 billion, about $10 billion less than in the previous 12 months and little more than half the record surplus, of $315 billion, reached during the 12 months through March 2009. Then, it was exporting $1.30 of goods for every dollar's worth it imported. Now, the figure is down to $1.10.
Chinese trade figures provide some insights into the problems now being felt in the euro zone. Germany turned a $3.3 billion deficit in China trade in 2007 into a $12.7 billion surplus in the most recent 12 months, largely through the sales of capital equipment that helped China produce more products.
Some of those products replaced those that had been exported by countries like Italy. Over all, China's trade surplus with members of the European Union other than Germany rose by $31 billion during the period, a little more than the $29 billion rise in China's surplus with the United States.
For a time in 2009, China's trade surplus with both the United States and Europe appeared to be declining. That now appears to have been a result of the plunge in world trade, which slowed both exports and imports. Once Western economies began to recover, even slowly, the appetite for Chinese imports increased.
Largely because of its appetite for natural resources, China imported $75 billion in products from Australia during the most recent 12 months, nearly three times the 2007 figure. But its sales to Australia did not even double, and a small Australian bilateral trade surplus of less than $8 billion in 2007 soared to more than $43 billion.
Among smaller countries, one of the sharpest turnarounds in Chinese trade came in Ireland. In 2007, China exported $4.4 billion in goods to Ireland, and bought just $1.9 billion in products. But after the collapse of its economy, Ireland bought just $2 billion in goods over the most recent 12 months for which data is available, while selling $3.5 billion in products to China.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Chinese Trade Deficit Declines, but Not With the U.S.: China's overall trade surplus in goods was almost $170 billion in the most recent 12 months, about $92 billion smaller than its surplus in 2007, before the global recession hurt many of its customers. The deterioration in China's trade has principally come against countries that export either raw materials or production machinery to China. Some other countries, including the United States and much of Europe, have seen their bilateral trade balances deteriorate. The charts show the change in trade balances since 2007. A rising line indicates China's trade surplus has grown, or its deficit has been reduced. A declining line indicates that China's trade has been weakening. Also shown is the actual trade balance for both 2007 and the 12 months through August. (Source: China Customs, via Haver Analytics)

HEADLINE: Decoding the Wide Variations in House Appraisals

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
I RECENTLY decided to refinance a condominium my wife and I owned in Florida and quickly got caught up in the frustrating and often baffling world of real estate appraisals.
The appraisal for the condo initially came in at exactly the dollar amount we needed to refinance it without putting up any more money -- something I found fishy but did not question since it worked to our advantage.
But a week later, the appraisal management company that had sent out the appraiser reviewed his valuation and revised it downward, determining that instead of 20 percent equity in the condo, we had only 10 percent.
That's when I called up the loan officer at the bank and basically asked the question homeowners everywhere are asking: How are you determining the value of my home? After all, both numbers seemed to me to be rather arbitrary. 
I eventually prevailed and got the refinancing.
But around that time, I got the renewal letter for the homeowner's insurance on our house in Connecticut and was shocked to see that it was being insured for a value 14 percent higher than we paid in 2008. I know homeowner's insurance is meant to cover the cost of replacing the house, but the price we paid for our home in 2008 was not just for the house but included the yard, the street where we live, the property taxes, the schools and other intangibles. And the price I could get for the house now is less than I paid back then. So why the high appraisal?
The question isn't a new one. After all, appraisals seemed to be just as subjective when the market was moving up. Why is the process so opaque? I set out to try to figure that out. Here are a few things I've found that can improve the outcome, though I can't promise that you'll be entirely satisfied.
SELLING AND BUYING One component of selling a home has always been gauging the emotion of a prospective buyer. But several brokers told me that buyers and sellers who need financing for a home should be concentrating instead on the temperament of the bank lending the money.
''Over the past two years, houses are not worth what the owners want or what the buyers will pay for them,'' said Peggy Bates, a broker with William Pitt Sotheby's International Realty in Stamford, Conn. ''A house is worth what the appraiser says it is.''
She says she makes prospective clients have their house appraised before she will list it. If they insist on determining their own value, she said, she makes them sign an agreement to drop the price in four weeks if the house does not sell.
Her tough-love approach may be hard for some to swallow but it just reflects banks' caution in making new mortgages with so many bad ones on their books.
But don't assume that the appraiser will return with a value for your house that you agree with. First, banks are increasingly bringing in appraisers from other towns, if not other states. While this is done to comply with provisions in the Dodd-Frank act aimed at establishing objectivity and preventing agents and mortgage brokers from influencing the outcome, it often produces results that fail to fully account for the central tenet of real estate: location.
Joseph C. Magdziarz, president of the Appraisal Institute and an appraiser outside of Chicago, defended his industry's work but said many appraisers were now pressed to write their reports more quickly and for less money. In cities like Chicago, he said, local knowledge is crucial because prices can vary from block to block and also floor to floor in high-rises.
Even if the appraiser is local, Mr. Magdziarz advises people to review a copy of the report. ''The appraiser who did my house talked about my fireplace, but I don't have one and he got the size of the living area all wrong,'' Mr. Magdziarz said.
REFINANCING The lure of incredibly low mortgage rates has piqued interest in refinancing existing mortgages. After all, going from a rate of 6.5 percent to 4.5 percent means significantly lower payments each month.
But lending requirements are strict even for people with an existing mortgage who have no problem making their current payments.
Frederick Peters, president of Warburg Realty Partnership, spends his days dealing with appraisal problems on sales in New York City. But he said he was baffled when he tried to refinance his weekend home in Litchfield County, Conn.
The first appraisal in February was what he called an ''absurdly low number even knowing the impact of the past few years,'' so he asked the bank to send out another appraiser. That came in only slightly higher and left him unable to refinance.
So he waited until this summer, when the flowers were blooming, and he and his wife walked the appraiser around the property. And that one? ''It came in 50 percent higher than the previous ones,'' he said.
Stan Humphries, chief economist at Zillow, the Web site known for its real estate estimates, said people should not be shocked by wide ranges. The company's ''zestimates,'' which are reached through a proprietary algorithm, currently have a range of accuracy of plus or minus 8.5 percent when compared with actual sale prices.
Mr. Humphries said he experienced this firsthand when he refinanced his home in Seattle last year. The Zillow value was $530,000, which a broker said he could get if he waited up to six months. If he wanted to sell it immediately, she told him to price it at $500,000. The appraisals for the refinancing were $570,000 and $581,000.
''It was interesting to see it arrayed against my own home,'' he said. ''It made sense to me. Appraisals generally come in a little bit higher than zestimates because an appraiser is trying to think of longer-term value.''
Such a wide range also shows just how important it is to educate appraisers when they come to your home. Owners, the experts said, should provide comparable listings, walk appraisers through the house, and point out improvements and unique features.
INSURING The appraisal for insurance purposes is perhaps the most enigmatic. While a mortgage for buying a home or refinancing is based on some combination of market pricing and a lender's stomach for risk, the insurance appraisal is based on the cost of rebuilding the home from scratch.
In some cases, this number is pure fiction. Mr. Peters's house was built in 1796, so how do you value materials you can no longer buy? Add to this that the insurance appraisal is likely to be higher than a home's market value.
''There's a lot of confusion about this issue,'' said Stephen R. Bitterman, vice president in the private client group at Chartis, an insurance firm. ''We are appraising the house for rebuilding cost. Our promise is we're going to put you back exactly the way you are.''
But what irked me with our house was that the initial coverage was for the exact amount we paid for it, and it has only gone up. Yet none of the insurers I spoke with would explain how that worked. When asked to address the discrepancy between rising insurance prices and falling home values, they attributed it to increasing costs for raw materials.
In our case, the insurance company actually raised the replacement cost of our home even more after the appraisal. To add insult to injury, the appraiser noted in his report the market value of our house: 31 percent less than the replacement cost.

HEADLINE: Superefficient Home With Big Ambitions, Built by Students on a Hoboken Lot

BYLINE: By JOANNA M. FOSTER

 BODY:
HOBOKEN, N.J. -- On summer evenings, the running path along the riverfront here is clogged with businessmen on smartphones tripping over dog leashes and joggers weaving through a stream of strollers. It had gotten even more congested recently as curious pedestrians congregated around a fenced-off parking lot on Sinatra Drive to guess the purpose of the structure being built inside.
''People have asked us if we're building a waterfront bar,'' said a worker, Steve Scribner. ''As if Hoboken needs any more. Someone else thought it was a houseboat, or some kind of giant Porta-Potty.'' 
But even taking into account Hoboken's love affair with happy hour, there was an urgency to the building process that seemed incongruous. Someone was always there hammering or sawing -- and many of the workers seemed a little young for cocktails.
The compact, shoe-box-shaped mystery building is named Empowerhouse, and it is a superefficient, solar-powered house that will compete in the Solar Decathlon, an event sponsored by the Energy Department that will open on Friday on the National Mall in Washington. It was designed and built by architecture and engineering students from Parsons The New School for Design, the Stevens Institute of Technology and the Milano School of International Affairs, Management and Urban Policy.
Yet the group aimed to create a structure that would endure in a meaningful way after the competition results are in. Unlike the 19 other entries, Empowerhouse is destined to become a real home for a low-income family in the Deanwood neighborhood of Northeast Washington that will also serve as a model of sustainable housing for Habitat for Humanity.
This year, for the first time, houses in the competition are being graded on cost-effectiveness, as well as energy efficiency and attractiveness. The last winning house was a $2 million entry from Germany with an exterior completely covered in solar panels.
''They racked up extra points because they were producing power above and beyond what the house needed,'' said Joshua Laryea, student project engineer from Stevens. ''But who can afford a house like that and maintain all those solar panels? It wasn't a place designed for living in.''
Joel Towers, the executive dean at Parsons, said: ''We probably won't be the shiniest box on the Mall, but a lot of the technology that's needed for tomorrow's housing is already available. The question we're trying to answer is more social than technological -- how do we actually bring these green solutions into neighborhoods?''
Empowerhouse tackles cost-effectiveness through ''passive house'' design principles, an international standard to minimize energy demand that is just beginning to gain traction in the United States. Passive houses are well insulated and nearly airtight, with 12-inch walls and triple-glazed windows, and they require up to 90 percent less energy for heating and cooling than an ordinary house. (They consume 40 percent less than a typical high-efficiency home.)
Such low energy consumption enabled Empowerhouse to have one of the smallest solar panel arrays in the competition, which helps keep construction and maintenance costs down.
For Habitat for Humanity of Washington, the Empowerhouse project is just the beginning of a new wave of sustainable housing. Once the house is moved to Deanwood, Habitat will work with the students and other volunteers to transform the 1,000-square-foot house -- estimated to cost about $250,000 -- into a two-family duplex of 2,700 square feet with an eventual estimated cost of $530,000. Two more three-unit passive town houses are in the design phase, and construction is scheduled to start in the Ivy City neighborhood of Northeast Washington in the spring.
Kent Adcock, president of the Washington affiliate of Habitat for Humanity, said that in the future, all construction originating from his group would be based on the passive house model -- quite an achievement for a team of students, most of whom had never picked up a power tool before this summer's construction project.
''We're designers -- most of us hadn't really handled much more than an X-Acto knife before this summer,'' said Jason Hudspeth, a student project architect and a graduate of Parsons. ''X-Acto knives aren't very handy when you're trying to put up drywall or pour cement.''
While constructing a passive house costs about 10 to 12 percent more than Habitat's current models, this upfront cost is more than offset by the near elimination of utility bills. For a comparably sized home in the Deanwood neighborhood, utility bills are about $2,300 annually, and with energy prices predicted to continue rising, over the course of a Habitat home's average 25-year mortgage, a homeowner could save anywhere from $61,000 to $132,000.
''These savings could be the difference in that family advancing their education, or paying for child care, or even in investing for retirement,'' Mr. Adcock said.
In June, his group is planning to host a conference for Habitat for Humanity affiliates from across the country to share what they have learned about passive house design and construction. Empowerhouse will serve as a model for an easily replicated, affordable, energy-efficient home for urban communities.
A more immediate concern was carefully taking apart what they had spent all summer putting together so that it could be moved to the National Mall for judging. The move took place last week.
''It took us so many tries to get everything right,'' said Mr. Scribner, a recent architecture graduate from Parsons. ''It's kind of nerve-racking to have to take it all apart. It's going to be one heck of a 3-D puzzle to put back together.''

HEADLINE: Alabama County's Debt Deal Averts Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
The governing board of Alabama's most populous county voted Friday to accept an agreement on how to restructure more than $3 billion of debt, avoiding what could have been the biggest municipal bankruptcy filing in American history.
The terms of the agreement call for Jefferson County, which includes the city of Birmingham, to shed about $1 billion of the debt, the majority of which is held by JPMorgan Chase. The agreement also offers the county several tools to lower the interest rate on roughly $2 billion of new, 40-year debt that will be issued to replace the current warrants.
''It's been an agonizing process; it's been going on for three and a half years,'' said one Jefferson County commissioner, Joe Knight, explaining why he voted for the agreement. ''Today we're going to take a step. It's time for a resolution of this lingering debacle.'' 
Even with the Jefferson County Commission's 4-to-1 vote in favor of the agreement, a number of significant steps must still be taken by the state Legislature and other parties before the restructuring can close by the deadline of June 30, 2012. The county's other creditors -- including Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon, Regions Bank, Assured Guaranty and Financial Guaranty Insurance -- have agreed to use the new agreement as a framework for completing a definitive settlement with the county.
Jefferson County's outsize debt grew out of a flawed attempt to refinance bonds that it sold in the 1990s to raise money for court-ordered improvements to its sewer system. The refinancing was supposed to save money, but it set off a wave of influence-peddling and other illegal activity that led officials to sign up for complex derivatives contracts fraught with hidden risks. The contracts broke down when the markets froze in 2008, leaving the county with more debt than it could pay. Several officials have since been convicted on corruption charges.
The county defaulted on the debt in 2008 and has since been in acrimonious and mostly unproductive talks with creditors about what to do next. The creditors have called on the county to raise sewer rates, but many residents have said they should not have to pay more because contracts were signed amid so much lawbreaking.
The new agreement calls for yearly rate increases, but smaller ones than creditors proposed in the past. It also calls for outside consultants to vet the sewer system's expenditures and costs, for a low-income assistance fund to be created at creditor expense, and for the county to catch up on its audited financial statements, which have been late ever since 2008.
Mr. Knight and others on the five-member commission said they decided to approve the deal because it would involve the state's help for the first time. Gov. Robert Bentley is to call a special session of the state Legislature this fall, where lawmakers will be asked to work on several forms of assistance.
First, the legislators are to create an independent public corporation to take the troubled sewer system off Jefferson County's hands. Because Jefferson County is now in default on the existing sewer debt, it cannot issue new debt, which is an essential part of the planned restructuring. The new corporation would be able to issue the debt separately from the county, with a clean balance sheet.
The legislators will also be asked to draft a ''moral obligation covenant'' for the corporation, meaning state money could be appropriated, upon approval, if the corporation fell behind on its debt payments. Although this covenant would not be as secure as a state guarantee, it would add a layer of credibility to help reduce the new corporation's borrowing costs.
In addition, state lawmakers are expected to look for ways to help Jefferson County close a $40 million budget gap that became apparent over the summer.
Until this year, state officials refused to help the county straighten out its finances, saying it had made its own problems and should solve them on its own. That led to a hardening of public opinion in the county, with more and more people calling for the commission to declare bankruptcy.
County Commissioner Sandra Little Brown said that since the state had finally offered some help, ''it would really be a slap in the face to the governor and the Legislature'' to turn it down. She pointed out that the framework agreement still gives the county a chance to file for Chapter 9 bankruptcy court protection if the state's efforts prove fruitless.
The one commissioner to vote against the agreement, George F. Bowman, said he did so mainly because it included rate increases.
In the meeting on Friday, he read part of a letter the commissioners had received from a county resident who urged them ''not to accept the extraordinarily damaging terms,'' particularly annual rate increases that could go on for as long as 40 years.

HEADLINE: Advice on Debt? Europe Suggests U.S. Can Keep It

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE and LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
WROCLAW, Poland -- The United States has long been considered a financial adviser to the rest of the world. But these days, American officials come carrying baggage.
Financial officials from the United States, once called ''the committee to save the world'' after the Asian crisis in the 1990s, now find themselves uttering apologies for the harm caused to the world by the 2008 financial crisis and coating their advice to European nations with the knowing nod of the battle-hardened.
The change in tone was on display here on Friday when Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner made an unusual appearance at a meeting of euro zone finance ministries. Mr. Geithner had been invited to offer some advice on fixing Europe's sovereign debt and banking problems.
European leaders, who have been slow to react to the root causes of the problem, emerged from the meeting dismissive of Mr. Geithner's ideas and, in some cases, even of the idea that the United States was in a position to give out such pointers. 
''I found it peculiar that, even though the Americans have significantly worse fundamental data than the euro zone, that they tell us what we should do,'' Maria Fekter, the finance minister of Austria, said after the meeting Friday morning. ''I had expected that, when he tells us how he sees the world, that he would listen to what we have to say.''
Such criticism was echoed by other attendees of the meeting, including the finance minister of Belgium, Didier Reynders, who said Mr. Geithner should listen rather than talk. Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the finance minister group, said European officials did not care to have detailed discussions about expanding their bailout fund ''with a nonmember of the euro area.''
American officials are aware that they need to tread carefully when advising others, especially now, and they have avoided offering specific plans or proposals.
Instead, they point to recent programs in the United States simply as case studies. On Friday, Mr. Geithner, among other recommendations, encouraged the European leaders to add more firepower to their bailout funds, and described how the United States used leverage in 2008 to help bolster the markets.
The Treasury department said in a statement Friday that ''Secretary Geithner encouraged his European counterparts to act decisively and to speak with one voice.'' And a Treasury official said the department did not feel Mr. Geithner was rebuffed, because he did not have a specific agenda.
In the past, countries with financial problems have not always received the United States' advice with open arms, at least until they needed financial support. Europe, analysts say, may never need outside support if its political leaders can find a way to use the wealth of nations like Germany to shore up more debt-troubled countries like Italy.
Still, it is hard to argue that the United States is not in a far weaker place to be doling out advice than it was in past crises, especially after the gridlock in August over raising the debt limit.
''We're in a very different world environment right now,'' said Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group, a political consulting firm. ''The United States has diminished credibility -- it can't simply tell Europe what to do. And it lacks the political will or means to throw a lot of cash at European troubles, even though they could become American problems very quickly.''
It was unusual for Mr. Geithner to attend an internal meeting of the 17 financial ministers from European Union countries that use the euro. The meeting was held on the first of two days of talks in Poland, and so far European finance ministers are no closer to overcoming the hurdles holding up the plan they developed for Greece back in July.
Mr. Geithner did not offer up a fully developed plan or urge one particular action. According to an American official who was not authorized to comment publicly, the Treasury secretary urged Europe to send a strong message to the market by putting up a large enough sum of money to support its debt-ridden nations and banks. He suggested that could be done through the use of borrowed money, as the United States did in some programs in 2008. One program, known as TALF, was meant to revive lending in the consumer and small-business markets.
''If you show the market that you have what it takes to stand behind your banks and stand behind your sovereigns, it will cost less in the end,'' said Lael Brainard, under secretary for international affairs at the Treasury.
Some Europeans have expressed ideas similar to Mr. Geithner's for a broader rescue plan. Still, the United States faces a different sort of audience when giving ideas to Europe than it does when facing officials in developing economies.
''In the 1990s, there were lots of countries that would say, that's working in the United States, how can we copy that?'' said Gary Gensler, who worked at the Treasury in the 1990s and now leads the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. ''We're still very much the leader in financial regulations and in the financial markets, but the 2008 crisis showed we failed. Our financial regulatory system failed and Wall Street failed.''
Some policy makers say the United States might even be wise to turn to China as a partner in persuasion.
''Maybe this should be a joint effort,'' said Sheila C. Bair, a senior advisor at the Pew Charitable Trusts, who was the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation until this summer.
She said it would be helpful for China and the United States to give European leaders the same message. But, she said, referring to the United States' financial crisis in 2008, ''we certainly don't have clean hands in all this.''
Countries with financial problems do not want outside advice until they need outside money, said Jeffrey Shafer, who was the under secretary for international issues at the Treasury in the 1990s. ''There are different stages in this process, and Europe right now is kind of in a halfway house,'' he said. ''The reality is that you get more influence when you are providing support.''
It would be difficult for the Obama administration to persuade Congress to give loans to Europe, analysts say, but there are other options. The Federal Reserve can open its discount window to European banks or, as it has already done, it can use foreign exchange lines. The Treasury could also lend out money from a facility that helps with exchange-rate problems. Or the United States could promote additional aid from the International Monetary Fund.
Even if the United States offered more aid, it is unclear if Europe would want it. Edwin M. Truman, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute who has worked with Mr. Geithner, said the United States had questions to answer, too. ''It's not just a question of being the scolding school teacher,'' he said. ''Geithner will also have to give a convincing story that we're dealing with our problems.''

HEADLINE: Hints of Progress in Europe Cap a Week of Gains

BYLINE: By REUTERS; Christine Hauser contributed reporting from New York. Jack Ewing contributed from Frankfurt.

 BODY:
Stocks rose for a fifth consecutive day on Friday and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index scored its best week since early July on signs that euro zone leaders were acting together to limit any damage from the sovereign debt crisis. 
The leaders took steps this week to show they were tackling the debt crisis, which has plagued markets for weeks, including coordinated central bank moves to give European banks greater access to financing in dollars.
Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, urged European Union finance ministers to leverage their bailout fund to better tackle the debt crisis and to start speaking with one voice, but there was no agreement on what steps to take.
Still, the encouraging headlines out of Europe helped the S.& P. 500 post a 5.4 percent gain for the week, its best since early July, and the five-day string of gains was the broad index's strongest since the end of June.
The Nasdaq composite index registered its best weekly percentage advance since July 2009, reflecting strength in technology shares on Friday. The S.& P. tech index rose 1 percent, while the S.& P. consumer discretionary index also gained 1 percent.
''The market seems to be a little bit more reassured that support will not allow for a major disruption in Europe,'' said Natalie Trunow, chief investment officer of equities at Calvert Investment Management in Bethesda, Md.
The Dow Jones industrial average finished up 75.91 points, or 0.66 percent, at 11,509.09. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 6.90 points, or 0.57 percent, at 1,216.01. The Nasdaq composite index was up 15.24 points, or 0.58 percent, at 2,622.31.
The Nasdaq gained 6.3 percent for the week while the Dow rose 4.7 percent.
Still, major obstacles must be overcome in solving the euro zone's debt crisis.
Less than 75 percent of private sector creditors have signaled they will take part in a plan to buy back Greek debt, far less than the 90 percent target set by Greece. The shortfall could jeopardize the planned second bailout package for Athens.
Greece's international lenders said on Friday they would delay a crucial visit to the country next week, and European finance ministers demanded that Athens fulfill its pledges to win further aid.
Among United States stocks, General Electric gained 1.6 percent to $16.33 after forming two new joint ventures in Russia that it said could generate $10 billion to $15 billion in new revenue over the next few years. One of the worst hit stocks, the BlackBerry maker Research in Motion, slid 19 percent to $23.93 a day after it reported a steep drop in quarterly profit and offered little hope of a quick turnaround.
United States economic data showed that consumer sentiment inched up in early September, but that Americans were gloomy about the future with their expectations for the economy falling to the lowest level since 1980.
Interest rates were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 8/32, to 100 20/32, and the yield fell to 2.06 percent from 2.08 percent late Thursday.

HEADLINE: Once a Redoubt Against China, Taiwan's Outpost Evolves

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG and XIYUN YANG

 BODY:
KINMEN, Taiwan -- Burrowing just a few feet beneath the surface of this island in the Taiwan Strait turns up remnants of what was once the most militarized zone on earth.
Concrete tunnels that once served as air-raid shelters run beneath villages like a network of capillaries. The threat from Mao and the People's Republic of China began in 1949, when Communist soldiers trying to invade Taiwan made an ill-fated beach landing on this island, a few miles off the southeast coast of the mainland. Five years later, Chinese forces shelled the island for months, prompting the United States to contemplate using nuclear weapons against China. But even that attack did not prepare the island's residents and Taiwanese soldiers for the artillery barrage that came in 1958: a half-million shells over 44 days that killed hundreds. The Communists then switched strategies: for the next two decades, the shells they lobbed every other day were loaded with propaganda leaflets.
Thus has this windswept island occupied a unique position in the precarious relationship between China and Taiwan, which has de facto independence but is considered a rebel province by the Communists. 
Since 2008, as relations between Taiwan and China have warmed, Kinmen, once called Quemoy in the West, has stood as a test case for how some Taiwanese are calibrating their growing dependence on economic ties with China. The people of Kinmen consider themselves culturally closer to the nearby mainland province of Fujian than to Taiwan, and are debating how much to welcome mainlanders' money and influence. Among the issues at play are whether to build a bridge to the Fujianese city of Xiamen; open a casino for mainland tourists; and adjust portrayals of anti-Communist military battles at tourist sites in language more palatable to the visitors. In July, mainland tourists, once restricted to coming only on tour groups, began arriving independently by ferry from Xiamen.
But to some, there remains a line that should not be crossed.
''Kinmen and Taiwan will grow closer to China to make money off of it, but they will never reunite with China,'' said Chen Yi-liang, who was stationed here in the army for two decades and now lives near the coast.
In that sense, Kinmen is a mirror of the hopes and anxieties across much of Asia during China's resurgence.
The island has a population of 100,000. It has farmland and deserted stretches of beach and even a smattering of European-style villas. Those were built by residents of Kinmen who worked or lived in parts of Southeast Asia starting in the Qing dynasty and were struck by the colonial architecture. (Emigrants from Guangdong Province, in southern China, also built the same kinds of villas in their hometowns.)
Kinmen was a naval garrison during the Qing, but under the Kuomintang, who fled to Taiwan after losing a civil war to the Communists, it became a fortress. When Mr. Chen arrived a few decades ago, there were about 80,000 soldiers on the island, a fifth less than at the height of tensions in the 1950s. Tsai Cheng-wang, a professor at National Quemoy University, estimates that 10 million Taiwanese have participated in military service on Kinmen.
''It is a bitter experience for all Taiwanese men, but it's something we will always remember,'' he said. ''I don't think these memories are going anywhere anytime soon.''
Famously, Justin Yifu Lin, the chief economist of the World Bank, defected at age 26 to the mainland from his military post here supposedly by swimming to Xiamen. There is still an outstanding warrant for his arrest in Taiwan.
The number of soldiers on Kinmen has dropped to just several thousand. They wander the island in their green uniforms, sometimes brushing shoulders with mainland tourists at the sites that commemorate Kuomintang stands against the Communists. Some of the civil defense tunnels have been renovated for tourism. On the northwest coast, there is a preserved concrete gun emplacement outside a military museum, which praises the Kuomintang victory in the 1949 Battle of Guningtou. A centerpiece is the jeep in which Chiang Kai-shek supposedly rode when he reviewed troops after the expulsion of the Communist invaders.
Mainlanders are officially barred from the military memorials, but many sneak glimpses. A debate started up among museum administrators a few years ago over whether to change some of the wording on the displays to make them less insulting to mainlanders, even though the mainlanders want to see the original Taiwanese version. Eventually, signs that labeled the Communist army as ''gongfei,'' or Communist bandits, were altered to refer instead to the People's Liberation Army.
''On Kinmen, for 50 years in their self-presentation and propaganda, they've been a bulwark against P.R.C. expansionism, and now they have to find a way to welcome it and leverage it and generate benefits from it,'' said Michael Szonyi, a professor of Chinese history at Harvard who wrote about Kinmen in ''Cold War Island.'' ''The people on Kinmen have to very quickly adjust to the conversion of their former enemy into their economic lifeline.''
The island's residents have always tried to exploit their unique position, he said. At times, they have emphasized the sacrifices they made during wartime in order to get more compensation from the Taiwanese government. At others, they have played down the history of conflict with China in order to highlight their position as a laboratory for closer relations.
Local politicians strongly supported a proposal by some officials in Taipei to build a bridge between Xiamen and Kinmen. But a study started in 2008 by the government of President Ma Ying-jeou, the Kuomintang member who supports reconciliation with China, determined that it would be too costly. A smaller bridge was ordered built between Kinmen and the nearby island of Little Kinmen. Taiwanese military leaders had also opposed the longer bridge, saying it would leave Kinmen vulnerable to a ground invasion from the mainland. All this disappointed many in Kinmen.
Feelings here have been more mixed about a proposal to build casinos to draw the kinds of revenues that mainland tourism brings to the gambling haven of Macao, given the social ills that might spring up. In Macao, for instance, prostitution is rampant. (Brothels would not be a new phenomenon on this island, though -- they were commonplace here when the Kuomintang military presence was at its peak.)
In 2000, Taiwanese officials approved a policy of establishing the ''little three links'' to Fujian Province from Kinmen and the island of Matsu. The links amounted to a limited opening up of trade, transportation and postal services. Tours from the mainland first arrived by ferry here in 2001, and for years Kinmen was the only taste of Taiwan available to many Chinese. When direct commercial flights between major Chinese and Taiwanese cities began in 2008, mainlander visits to Kinmen dropped. One tour guide, Wu Meiying, 37, said only about a third of the tourists now are from China; the rest are mostly Taiwanese.
Wu Tseng-dong has profited handsomely from tourism by operating stores that sell knives and cleavers made from old artillery shells (each yields about 60 blades). He said Kinmen can only thrive if relations with the mainland continue to warm. ''All right, all right, we fought, we bombed each other to hell, we made knives,'' he said. ''Let's get over it.''
And yet, memories of conflict here remain deeply etched. Yang Xihui, 58, who works as a janitor at a building with a tourist entrance into the defense tunnels, can recall the air-raid siren's going off on Aug. 23, 1958. She said she sprinted with her family to the underground shelter. They lived there for more than 40 days, emerging only during occasional breaks in the shelling to collect sweet potatoes or roots and to empty chamber pots.
''I was too young to be afraid then,'' she said. ''I thought it was a game.''

HEADLINE: Drop of Opera in a Downpour of Pop

BYLINE: By ANTHONY TOMMASINI

 BODY:
Ordinarily it is difficult for officials to estimate the crowd size for a concert in Central Park. But every attendee at Thursday night's free performance there by the superstar crossover tenor Andrea Bocelli had to have a ticket, obtained in advance. And 60,000 were given out.
The chilly, rainy weather, which during the first half of the program turned the Great Lawn into a sea of umbrellas, may have kept the crowd a little smaller than 60,000. But the tight security measures, with pat-downs and bag searches for everyone entering, meant that anyone trying to crash the show would have gotten no closer than the park's cordoned-off pathways. 
The concert, in every way a pop-culture extravaganza, lasted nearly three hours. The audience gave the beloved Mr. Bocelli ovation after ovation as he sang favorite arias (''La donna e mobile''), Italian popular songs (''Volare'') and standards in English (''More,'' a Frank Sinatra hit). Among the surprise guests who dropped by to sing with Mr. Bocelli were Celine Dion (''The Prayer,'' the sappy sacred pop song they have recorded) and, no less, the great Tony Bennett (for a duo version of ''New York, New York'').
Oh, and Mr. Bocelli was backed by the New York Philharmonic, conducted by its music director, Alan Gilbert. Perhaps I should have mentioned this first thing, but the orchestra's participation was not a major part of the billing. The tickets (which were encased in plastic with a ribbon and had to be worn around your neck) had the name of the event, ''Andrea Bocelli: Live in Central Park,'' a photo of the star, logos for the sponsor, but no indication that Mr. Gilbert and the Philharmonic were to perform.
The Philharmonic's involvement in this concert brought the orchestra some poor publicity when the news came in June. A consequence of taking part, along with deciding to present a free performance of Mahler's ''Resurrection'' Symphony at Avery Fisher Hall for the anniversary of Sept. 11, was that the Philharmonic had to cancel its annual free summer concerts in New York City parks. Zarin Mehta, the orchestra's president and chief executive, said that presenting the remembrance program for Sept. 11, which took place last Saturday, was a top priority, and that collaborating with Mr. Bocelli made ''good economic sense'' for the Philharmonic.
After this news broke, I wrote a critical column, saying that with orchestras everywhere buckling under challenges from the poor economy, it was the worst time for the Philharmonic to abandon its popular parks concerts. When Mr. Gilbert conducted his first Central Park concert with the Philharmonic on a balmy summer night in 2008, he and the orchestra drew an elated crowd estimated at 63,000. After the column appeared in June, Mr. Gilbert wrote an e-mail letter to The New York Times, disassociating himself from the decision to cancel the free parks concerts and promising to bring them back in 2012.
Mr. Gilbert and the Philharmonic musicians did what was expected of them on Thursday and performed well in music of different styles, from a vigorous account of the overture to Verdi's ''Forza del Destino'' to a breezy, swinging accompaniment for ''New York, New York.'' But inevitably the orchestra, especially Mr. Gilbert, came across as artistically diminished. At the Philharmonic's own parks concerts, Mr. Gilbert is great at speaking to audiences and introducing music and soloists. But on this night he was mum.
It must have been strange for him, after accompanying Mr. Bocelli in ''O Sole Mio,'' to segue without any explanation into the next segment of the program. The audience was shown a montage of stills and posters from Fellini films, while Mr. Gilbert conducted music from the score to ''Amarcord.'' This turned out to be an elaborate prelude to Mr. Bocelli's performance of Ennio Morricone's theme song from the movie ''Once Upon a Time in the West.''
Mr. Bocelli's fans seemed thrilled, rain or no rain. There remains a considerable divide between the passions of the audience he has reached (his recordings have sold more than 65 million, according to his Web site) and the assessment of most music critics. There is genuine warmth and sweetness in his sound. When he nails a big top note, he likes to hang on, as he did at the end of Verdi's rousing aria ''Di quella pira,'' from ''Il Trovatore,'' which the crowd cheered.
But after a career of nearly 20 years (he turns 53 next Thursday), Mr. Bocelli still has not worked out some of the technical kinks in his singing, which are both masked and revealed by the amplification he routinely employs. His voice quavers on sustained notes; his tone is often thin and shaky. And for all the innate expressivity of his voice, his singing is sometimes curiously bland. His rhythmic delivery can be all over the place.
Still, he has brought operatic music and singing styles to millions. Major orchestras, conductors and opera singers have been quick to take part in Mr. Bocelli's profitable projects. On Thursday the bass-baritone Bryn Terfel was on hand to sing the final scene from Act I of Puccini's ''Tosca'' (''Va, Tosca!'') with the Philharmonic and the Westminster Symphonic Choir, which worked hard on this night, also joining in Mr. Terfel's unabashedly sentimental version of ''Home on the Range.''
The soprano Ana Maria Martinez joined Mr. Bocelli for the impassioned duet ''Vicino a te,'' from Giordano's ''Andrea Chenier.'' And the soprano Pretty Yende was his partner in the ''O soave fanciulla'' duet from Puccini's ''Boheme.'' But once again, other than the announcement of her name, there was no introduction of Ms. Yende, a young artist from South Africa who was a co-winner of Placido Domingo's Operalia competition this summer.
You could have guessed the encore: Puccini's ''Nessun dorma,'' from ''Turandot,'' which Luciano Pavarotti turned into one of the world's most recognizable melodies. The rain had stopped; the night was clear; the crowd went crazy. And I was again left in awe at the money, power and appeal of pop culture.

HEADLINE: For Jobs, It's War

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
The American political discussion has finally turned to the right target: jobs.
Even so, the president's jobs bill is already being nickeled and dimed from the right -- and the left -- even though it is only throwing nickels and dimes at the problem to begin with. But at least it's a start, even if a long-overdue one.
To understand just how overdue it is, one need look no further than the absolutely dreadful data issued this week by the Census Bureau about the increasing numbers of people falling into poverty. No matter how you slice it, it's bloody.
There are now 46.2 million poor Americans. 
Of those, 2.6 million fell into poverty last year.
At 15.1 percent, the poverty rate is at its highest since 1993.
Bloody, bloody, bloody.
But even those numbers somewhat obscure the true historic nature of the crisis and the effect that the recession, falling wages and chronic joblessness have had on those living in poverty. If you remove children and the elderly and just look at working-age adults -- those 18 to 64 -- the picture is even more bleak. The percentage of that group that is in poverty is the highest recorded since President Lyndon B. Johnson declared a ''war on poverty'' during his first State of the Union address in January 1964.
And it's not that most of these people don't have jobs. It's that they don't have good jobs that pay enough to push them out of poverty. Three out of four of those below the poverty line work: half have full-time jobs, a quarter work part time. Only a quarter do not work at all.
This raises an important distinction -- not only do we need to create more jobs, we need to increase the number of good jobs. And we can't see that quest for good jobs as an internal skirmish between warring political ideologies. It's an international war. At least that is the way Jim Clifton, chairman of Gallup, frames it in his fascinating -- and frightening -- new book, ''The Coming Jobs War.''
According to Clifton, ''the coming world war is an all-out global war for good jobs.''
(He defines a good job, also known as a formal job, as one with a ''paycheck from an employer and steady work that averages 30-plus hours per week.'')
In the book he makes this striking statement, drawing from all of Gallup's data: ''The primary will of the world is no longer about peace or freedom or even democracy; it is not about having a family, and it is neither about God nor about owning a home or land. The will of the world is first and foremost to have a good job. Everything else comes after that.'' The only problem is that there are not enough good jobs to go around.
Clifton explains that of the world's five billion people over 15 years old, three billion said they worked or wanted to work, but there are only 1.2 billion full-time, formal jobs. Therefore his conclusion ''from reviewing Gallup's polling on what the world is thinking on pretty much everything is that the next 30 years won't be led by U.S. political or military force.''
''Instead,'' he says, ''the world will be led with economic force -- a force that is primarily driven by job creation and quality G.D.P. growth.'' And guess who is vying for the lead? That's right: China.
And I must say, we don't appear to be poised to fight this war. In education we've gone from leading to lagging, our infrastructure is literally crumbling around us, ever-expanding health care costs threaten to suffocate us and our politics have succumbed to paralysis.
A widely-cited 2009 study by the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, ''The Economic Impact of the Achievement Gap in America's Schools,'' found that the recent American educational achievement gaps -- between black and Latino students and white ones; between low-income students and the rest; between low-performing states and the rest; and between the United States as a whole and better-performing countries -- not only cost the economy trillions of dollars, they also ''impose on the United States the economic equivalent of a permanent national recession.''
According to a recent report by the Urban Land Institute and Ernst & Young, China has ''about 9 percent of G.D.P. devoted to infrastructure, compared with less than 3 percent in the United States.'' And the Report Card for America's Infrastructure graded by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2009 was so full of C's and D's that it looked like Rick Perry's college transcript. The group estimated that $2.2 trillion of investment over five years was needed to bring conditions up to par. We're not even close to that.
Furthermore, Clifton points out that 30 percent of America's students drop out or do not graduate on time. He concludes, ''If this problem isn't fixed fast, the United States will lose the next worldwide, economic, jobs-based war because its players can't read, write or think as well as their competitors in a game for keeps.''
And, a Rand Corporation study released last week found that ''between 1999 and 2009, total spending on health care in the United States nearly doubled, from $1.3 trillion to $2.5 trillion. During the same period, the percentage of the nation's gross domestic product devoted to health care climbed from 13.8 percent to 17.6 percent. Per person health care spending grew from $4,600 to just over $8,000 annually.''
We simply can't sustain that sort of growth.
Clifton enumerates 10 ''demands'' that America will have to master to ''lead the new will of the world'' -- from drastically increasing exports, to having investments follow ''rare entrepreneurs versus the worldwide oversupply of innovation,'' to something as basic as doing a better job of identifying where likely customers are. But at the top of the list is understanding that the world has a shortage of good jobs and every decision of every leader must be informed by increasing the share of those jobs.
He puts it this way:
''The war for global jobs is like World War II: a war for all the marbles. The global war for jobs determines the leader of the free world. If the United States allows China or any country or region to out-enterprise, out-job-create, out-grow its G.D.P., everything changes. This is America's next war for everything.''

HEADLINE: Insuring Against Job Loss

BYLINE: By ANN CARRNS

 BODY:
With unemployment hovering around 9 percent, many Americans are relying on government unemployment benefits to make ends meet. Now, a new, private option is available that can help replace, at least temporarily, more of the income forfeited when you lose your job.
IncomeAssure is a supplemental unemployment insurance policy that, when combined with public unemployment insurance, can help temporarily replace up to half of your lost wages. Leslie Nylund, chief executive of the Assura Group of NY Ltd., which introduced the offering this summer, says she believes her firm is the only company currently offering such coverage. 
The main barrier to such offerings before has been overcoming the problem of adverse selection, an industry term referring to the propensity of people who most need a certain type of insurance to buy a lot of it, concentrating risk and making it difficult to offer coverage profitably.
Ron Lieber wrote about this problem with private unemployment insurance in a 2009 column.
But Ms. Nylund says the Assura Group thinks it has a workable formula, which includes a hefty waiting period (six months) before initial coverage begins, to avoid a rush to buy policies when a big layoff occurs or seems imminent, and a link of the private insurance to public jobless benefits. With high unemployment looking like a long-term feature of the economy, she says, supplemental insurance should be an attractive offering.
Public unemployment insurance, Ms. Nylund says, initially was meant to replace half of one's income, on a weekly or monthly basis. But since most states have imposed dollar caps on benefits they pay out - $400 or so a week is the typical maximum - benefits don't stretch that far for workers earning upwards of about, say, $50,000. So, IncomeAssure aims to sell insurance coverage to make up that difference.
The premiums for the coverage, which are based on the state where you work, your salary, and the industry in which you work, as well as unemployment statistics, range from 0.5 to 2 percent of your wages.
So, for instance, if you earn $100,000 working in manufacturing in Ohio, your premium would be about $130 a month. If you lost your job, you would receive $1,677 per month in state unemployment benefits. Using that as a base, IncomeAssure would pay $2,500 a month, bringing your monthly total to $4,177 a month. That's the monthly equivalent of $50,000 a year - half of your former annual pay.
But it's important to realize that the payments don't continue for a year; rather, they track state unemployment benefits, which typically run for 26 weeks. IncomeAssure payouts are triggered by the initiation of state unemployment benefits, so you must first file and receive approval for your state jobless claim before payments from IncomeAssure begin. There is then a two-week delay before payments begin, and they continue for a maximum of 24 weeks. While the federal government has funded the extension of public unemployment benefits beyond 26 weeks as a result of the sluggish economy, IncomeAssure payments stop after six months.
So, in the above example, you'd be paying about $1,560 a year to receive a maximum payout of just over $15,000.
Ms. Nylund notes that the current unemployment rate also is factored into the premiums, so they would very likely drop as unemployment falls (or, increase as unemployment rises).
The Web site offers a form that can give you a quick estimate, but it has a few glitches to iron out. I typed in a request for a hypothetical poultry industry executive in Georgia (using the ''agricultural'' classification) earning $80,000 a year, and it told me the estimated payout - $1,903 a month, on top of the state benefit of $1,430 - but not the premium. However, I was able to get that information quickly from ''Katie'' using the site's online chat function.
Katie told me the premium would be $107.28 per month, or $1,287 for a year, which could be paid monthly or quarterly. But if it were paid in a lump sum, it would be eligible for a discount of almost 9 percent, which would reduce the annual premium by $115.
That doesn't sound too bad, but there are some caveats. First, if you've already lost your job, you're out of luck; you have to be employed to buy the insurance in the first place, and then you have to wait six months to become eligible to collect. (If you buy a policy and are laid off two months later, the company refunds your premiums, Ms. Nylund said.)
The coverage is available for salaries up to $250,000. If you make more than that, you can buy coverage, but only up to that amount.
The policy is renewable every 12 months. The only likely reason the company wouldn't renew, Ms. Nylund said, would be if the worker changed jobs and became employed in a state where the Assura Group isn't authorized to sell insurance. IncomeAssure, which is underwritten by the Great American Insurance Company of Cincinnati, currently is available in 34 states and the District of Columbia, and is pending approval in additional states.
Policy holders can, of course, choose not to renew - if, for example, the premium offered rises and they decide they don't want to pay it, or if they think their employment has become more stable.
But Ms. Nylund is betting that people will hold onto coverage even if economic conditions improve, for peace of mind. The extra payments can help avoid depleting savings and cover monthly expenses, she says, while job seekers regroup and search for a position that's a good fit. ''This is something you should buy for a good night's sleep,'' Ms. Nylund said.
Do you think buying additional unemployment insurance is worth it?
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Household Net Worth Falls 0.3% In Quarter

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' wealth declined this spring for the first time in a year, as stocks and homes fell in value, a Federal Reserve report said Friday. At the same time, corporations increased the size of their cash stockpiles. 
The combination could slow an already weak economy because it implies that families have less to spend and businesses are reluctant to expand.
Household net worth dropped 0.3 percent to $58.5 trillion in the April-June quarter from the previous period, according to the Federal Reserve's Flow of Funds report. The decline followed three straight quarterly increases.
The value of Americans' stock portfolios fell 0.5 percent in the second quarter. Home values dropped 0.4 percent.
Corporations held a record $2 trillion in cash at the end of June, an increase of 4.5 percent.
Net worth is expected to fall even further in the current quarter because stocks plunged in late July and early August.
''August put a big dent in whatever confidence consumers had left,'' said Greg McBride, senior financial analyst at Bankrate.com. That's largely why retail sales were flat last month, he added.
Over all, household wealth, which mostly consists of home equity, stock portfolios, and other savings, has risen 15 percent since the recession officially ended in June 2009.
The increase is almost entirely the result of one of the fastest bull markets in history. Stocks began to recover in the spring of 2009 and had doubled in value by April of this year, as measured by the S.& P. 500 index.
But Americans' wealth has taken a hit since the second quarter, the period covered by the Fed report. The S.& P. index has tumbled 11 percent since its April 29 peak, and 8 percent since the end of the quarter. That likely means an even larger drop in household net worth in the July-September quarter.
Stock portfolios make up about 15 percent of Americans' wealth. That's less than housing but ahead of bank deposits, according to the Fed's report.
The likely drop in wealth comes at the same time that incomes are stagnating, particularly for middle-income households. Average household income, adjust for inflation, fell 6.4 percent last year from 2007, the year before the recession, the Census Bureau said earlier this week.
Americans also have less equity in their homes. The average homeowner has just 38.6 percent equity, down from 61 percent a decade ago.
The report found household debt declined at an annual rate of 0.6 percent from the previous quarter, helped by a big decline in mortgage debt, which has fallen for nine straight quarters.
But the decline is deceiving. Mortgage debt is coming down because so many Americans are defaulting and losing their homes to foreclosure, not just because people are paying off loans.

 BODY:
BERLIN -- The courtyard of the nightclub Picknick was packed with partygoers dancing, shouting over the music and snapping photographs of one another, by all appearances just another night in this dilettante party capital. But appearances, on this recent Saturday night, were very much deceiving.
The images snapped with iPhones and Android smartphones were projected in a constantly changing slideshow on the side of the neighboring building by a new photo-sharing application called EyeEm. The plastic foam clouds dangling from the wires crisscrossing overhead were the logos for the popular audio-sharing service called SoundCloud, which has roughly seven million users.
Both companies, co-hosts of the event, are part of Berlin's rapidly growing Internet start-up scene, which has won the attention of investors in Britain and California, including the high-profile actor-investor Ashton Kutcher, who is a backer of SoundCloud.
''I kind of get the feeling that the whole city of Berlin is a start-up,'' said Alexander Ljung, chief executive and one of the founders of SoundCloud. ''It's fast-moving, chaotic. You don't really know where it's headed, but you know it's headed in a good direction, and that's a start-up feel.'' 
Mr. Ljung and his co-founder and chief technology officer, Eric Wahlforss, met in the computer labs at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. But the two Swedes decided to move to Berlin to start their company, which now employs nearly 70 people there.
Berliners will vote Sunday to elect the city-state's next Parliament and, in the process, on the future of Klaus Wowereit, the city's long-serving, popular mayor. Polls suggest he will win re-election, but his ambitions for federal office -- he has even had his name bandied about in the media as a potential candidate for German chancellor, following in the footsteps of a former West Berlin mayor, Willy Brandt -- will be affected by the future of the city he has governed since 2001.
With the vote nearing, a national debate over the fate of the reunified capital has broken out in the German news media, over the pub-crawl tourism that residents say is ruining the downtown, over fast-rising rents and even the burning of automobiles that have been rampant this year. The city's heavy debt burden and reliance on money from richer states like Bavaria and Baden-Wurttemberg were the subject of a cover story in the weekly news magazine Focus.
It was Mr. Wowereit who coined the famous catchphrase of Berlin as ''poor, but sexy,'' that has stuck to the city, which has an unemployment rate of 13.3 percent, the highest of any state in Germany and well above the national average of 7 percent. He chose to aggressively market the city as a creative capital, emphasizing fashion, art and music, hoping that the magnetic effect of the city's popularity with tourists would rub off on the economy.
Peter Englisch, a partner with Ernst & Young in Germany responsible for midsize companies, said that Berlin had done a good job of marketing itself, but not as good a job nurturing the companies it attracted. ''A lot of other cities have start-up support, welcome packages,'' Mr. Englisch said. ''It's an inspiring environment, but the second step, turning potential into growth, is where I'm pretty sure Wowereit isn't doing enough.''
Berlin has been a creative hub and a destination for young expatriates from other places for years. But its hipness never translated into badly needed jobs for a metropolis that could not recover an industrial prowess that was wrecked by war and division. Now the developing Internet start-up community is offering a tantalizing glimpse of a possible economic future for a city that for years appeared to have none.
''With Depression, war, fascism, the wall and the mass migration of talent out of Berlin, it's quite clear that the city was set back by historical circumstances,'' said Richard Florida, professor of business and creativity at the University of Toronto, whose research has drawn a link between bohemians and economic growth. ''Looking at the experience of other cities that remade themselves, like Pittsburgh, shifting to an open technology-savvy creative economy takes at minimum a generation.''
One of the guests jostled by the crush of people at the party at Picknick was Florian Weber, a German who was one of the original engineers at Twitter and now one of the founders of a new site called Amen. ''When I moved to Berlin four or five years ago it was a very different time. You rarely saw start-ups. Now, in the last one or two years you see people really doing innovative things,'' Mr. Weber said.
It was perhaps inevitable that the start-up scene, concentrated around Rosenthaler Platz in the central Mitte district, would earn the moniker ''Silicon Allee,'' after the much-imitated Silicon Valley and the German word for avenue. The question is whether the city can live up to the hype.
''In the next two years we will have a multibillion-euro company here in Berlin,'' said Christian Reber, 25, the chief executive and one of the founders of the company 6Wunderkinder. Mr. Reber, who, unlike many of the foreigners, hails from the nearby city of Brandenburg, is a vocal booster of the tech community and an equally harsh critic of the clones of American and other foreign Web sites that Germany had been known for until recently.
''I was at a conference and a guy said Germans are perfect executors, but too uncreative to create technology,'' Mr. Reber said.
''I grew up learning we were the land of 'Dichter und Denker,' '' he said, using the German for poets and thinkers. ''I hate copycats. I hate stealing ideas.''
In the brick-and-mortar world, the center of the scene is St. Oberholz, a cafe at the busy intersection of Rosenthaler Strasse and Torstrasse, home to the monthly mixer known as the Silicon Allee meet-up. The advantages that made it so popular with the tech people that it was one of SoundCloud's unofficial first offices are not apparent at first sight: extra power outlets, unlimited free Internet and a welcoming attitude for people who want to set up shop and do their work there.
On an average afternoon the cafe could almost be mistaken for an Apple store, with all the Mac laptops open on the tables. Ansgar Oberholz, the cafe's owner, said the development had come in spite of the city government, not because of it. ''They don't grasp it structurally and when they do, they do it wrong,'' Mr. Oberholz said.

HEADLINE: Unbeaten Boxer Pioneers Ways to Make Money Hand Over Fist

BYLINE: By GREG BISHOP

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS -- On Saturday night, Floyd Mayweather Jr. will make tens of millions of dollars for an hour's worth of work, if that. He will be paid for what happens inside the ring and outside it, paid far more than any other boxer fighting today, for far more than just his performance in a welterweight title fight against Victor Ortiz.
On fight nights, if it were not for the din of the crowd and the sounds of fists striking chins, Mayweather could hear the ringing of cash registers. He earns a percentage of every ticket purchased, every pretzel consumed, every poster sold. He will earn from countries that paid for broadcasting rights and the theaters where the fight is shown.
Mayweather, regarded as one of the best boxers in history, fights under a highly unusual financial structure, exchanging upfront risk for back-end profit while retaining total control. He is even responsible for paying his opponent, in this case a business expense of at least $2 million. 
''It's never been done,'' Mayweather, who is 41-0, said about his financial model. ''Not in entertainment history. Not in sports history. You see that arena Saturday? It's all Mayweather money. Want a hot dog? Mayweather money. Want a T-shirt? Mayweather money. I need all that.''
He can pull this off because of the leverage he forged with his success in the ring. Few, if any, other boxers command such widespread attention and generate so much revenue with a single fight.
In his previous four fights, Mayweather earned $115 million. For Saturday night's event, he is expected to make about $40 million, and the checks will come for years, determined by the results of many things beyond the fight itself, like the gate and the pay-per-view television numbers. This makes Mayweather a regular among athletes on Forbes magazine's list of most powerful celebrities, even though the bulk of his annual income is usually generated in one night.
Mayweather, 34, described his business plan after a workout this week at the family boxing gym here. Sweat dripped down his face as he sat on the ring apron in business attire (shorts, hand tape), growing more animated over his favorite subject, money. Money earned. Money wagered. Money spent. Money flashed. Money lost.
On that topic, Mayweather said he collected $100,000 the previous night betting on N.F.L. games. He mentioned his 29 cars and charitable donations in the same sentence. He even compared his spending habits to a stimulus package: ''If I'm making it rain, I'm throwing it to American citizens. In a recession!''
For most of the first 10 years of his career, Mayweather fought for the promotional company Top Rank Boxing, under a more typical model, with most of his money guaranteed upfront. Their split, in 2006, was far from amicable, marked by lawsuits.
Once freed, Mayweather met with Leonard Ellerbe and Al Haymon, his most trusted advisers, to develop a new plan. They wanted to control every aspect of a promotion, including the promoters, whom Mayweather hires on a contract basis for each fight. He also changed his nickname, from Pretty Boy Floyd to Money Mayweather, part of a philosophical shift.
For his last four fights, Mayweather has hired Golden Boy Promotions, a company started by Oscar De La Hoya but run by Richard Schaefer, a former Swiss banker with no previous boxing background.
To explain the business model, Schaeffer starts with a pie. A little more than half goes to the distributors (Time Warner, DirecTV, etc.). The balance goes to the network, HBO or Showtime, which takes its distribution fees and hands the rest to the promoters.
In this case, Golden Boy has one contract with HBO and another with Mayweather Promotions. But the money, less what distributors and networks take, is under Mayweather's control; normally the promoter would control it.
That pie is only part of the total revenue, the pay-per-view TV part. To illustrate the other revenue streams, Schaefer pulled a piece of paper from his pocket, a spreadsheet written in 6-point typeface. Drawn out, Schaefer said it would take up two chalkboards, but on the sheet in his pocket, it was boiled down to a formula for how much Mayweather would earn, based on how many people bought the fight and what the other revenue streams brought in.
Those streams include foreign sales for a fight broadcast in 168 territories; closed-circuit revenues (in 2,000 or so bars and restaurants nationwide, in theaters and in rooms at Las Vegas casinos); site revenue (ticket sales, merchandise); and sponsorships. Most boxers would see little, if any, of that money, whereas, Schaefer said: ''All revenues here are Mayweather revenues. He gets part of everything.''
Roger Federer does not make money off the sales of strawberries and cream at Wimbledon, nor does Derek Jeter's contract include the Yankees' TV contract in Asia. Mayweather has devised an altogether different model for marquee athletes.
But, under this model, the expenses are Mayweather expenses, too, including advertising (radio spots, print ads, TV commercials), publicity (press tours, news conferences), sanctioning fees, legal contracts and insurance. For a fight of this magnitude, Schaefer said the expenses would run about $10 million.
First, Mayweather will write himself a check this week in the neighborhood of $25 million. This is similar, in concept, to the guaranteed money that other fighters receive from their promoters, but the check is much larger. Besides Mayweather, only Manny Pacquiao would command that much. What Mayweather earns in addition depends on the success of the event.
If 1.4 million or 1.5 million fans buy the fight -- which is expected -- Mayweather will make about $40 million, Schaefer said.
For comparison, consider Pacquiao. For his coming November fight, Top Rank has guaranteed $22 million and a percentage of other revenue for a total of $30 million, said Bob Arum, chairman of Top Rank. If the fight is canceled because of a natural disaster, for example, Pacquiao will still make $22 million, whereas Mayweather would stand to lose much of his total earnings.
Because Mayweather has averaged about 1.5 million pay-per-view buys in his last four fights, and because no natural disaster has wiped out any boxing event in recent memory, he considers his risk quite low. Even Arum, Mayweather's stated nemesis, conceded ''there's no loss, only profit.'' He added: ''In the end, it may be less than the guarantee, but it's all profit.''
Arum and others, however, believe that there is value in promotion and that Mayweather would make even more if he ceded total control. Mayweather disagrees, and even says the formula can be duplicated by other fighters -- for a fee, of course.
''That's going to cost you!'' he said.

HEADLINE: G.M. Reaches Tentative Deal With Workers

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- The United Automobile Workers and General Motors said late Friday that they had reached a tentative agreement on a new labor contract.
It is the first new labor pact for any of the Detroit carmakers since G.M. and Chrysler received government bailouts and went through bankruptcy in 2009. The deal will help G.M.'s 48,500 union workers share in the company's turnaround and should give them more job security, two top priorities for the U.A.W., though the tenuous nature of the economic recovery will continue to inject some uncertainty.
G.M. said the deal would cover four years. The union declined to give details but said the agreement included improved profit-sharing and ''significant improvements to health care benefits.'' The deal was also expected to include so-called signing bonuses worth at least several thousand dollars. And the U.A.W. had been seeking a wage increase for entry-level workers, who earn about half as much as other workers. 
The union said in a statement that it had successfully fought G.M.'s proposals to weaken retirement benefits and obtain major concessions to health benefits.
''In both pensions and health care, the U.A.W. was able to convince G.M. that far greater success could be achieved working together than by cutting pensions or health care,'' it said.
Negotiations with Chrysler and Ford Motor are continuing.
The union's president, Bob King, said the G.M. deal would ''get our members who have been laid off back to work'' and bring jobs to the United States from other countries.
''The U.A.W. approached these negotiations with new strategies and fought for and achieved some of our major goals for our members, including significant investments and products for our plants,'' he said in the statement.
Negotiators met for 14 hours on Friday, two days after agreeing to extend the old contract when they were unable to reach a deal. The deal was announced shortly after 11 p.m. Friday.
''We used a creative problem solving approach to reach an agreement that addresses the needs of employees and positions our business for long-term success,'' Cathy Clegg, G.M.'s vice president for labor relations, said in a statement. ''We worked hard for a contract that recognizes the realities of today's marketplace, enabling G.M. to continue to invest in U.S. manufacturing and provide good jobs to thousands of Americans.''
U.A.W. leaders from plants across the country are expected to gather in Detroit on Tuesday to vote on the deal. A ratification vote by rank-and-file workers is expected to occur in seven to 10 days, G.M. said.
Although the union did not confirm any changes to wages, its lead negotiator with G.M., Joe Ashton, said in the statement, ''The wages and benefits we negotiated in this tentative agreement reflect the fact that it was U.A.W. members who helped turn this company around.''
G.M. officials had said before the start of negotiations that they wanted to tie more of workers' pay to productivity, quality and profits. G.M. workers received profit-sharing checks averaging $4,400 this year as a result of the $4.7 billion it earned in 2010.
''There is something between the lines here that says this is an agreement that will result in a more successful General Motors and workers that share in that success,'' said Harley Shaiken, a professor of labor relations at the University of California, Berkeley. ''It will define competitiveness for Detroit.''
In its tradition of pattern bargaining, the union is expected to seek similar terms from Chrysler and Ford. But it is likely to have more difficulty doing so than in the past, given the disparate conditions of the three companies.
The union is expected to focus on achieving a deal at Chrysler before turning to Ford.

CORRECTION APPENDED
CHICAGO -- The University of Chicago, well known for Saul Bellow, Milton Friedman and its links to 85 Nobel Prizes, was once famous sea to shining sea for football. It boasted a legendary coach, a Heisman Trophy winner and a national championship.
Then, in 1939, it did something extraordinary. It gave up the game to save its soul.
''In many colleges, it is possible for a boy to win 12 letters without learning how to write one,'' Robert Maynard Hutchins, the university's president, had written acidly of sports in The Saturday Evening Post. He particularly disparaged football, deriding as myth the idea that the game produced men of good character or instilled a sense of fair play. Indeed, for a college to be a success on the field, he said, it must be something of a scoundrel beyond it.
Seventy-two years later, what Hutchins called the ''infernal nuisance'' of college football is troubling more university administrators than ever. Ohio State, Miami, Southern California, North Carolina and on and on: it is as if global warming were affecting the number of big-name colleges in hot water. 
And yet Chicago is quietly back on the field. Instead of euthanizing the game, Hutchins merely put it in a coma. In 1969, football returned as a varsity sport, oddly enough during the Vietnam War era when many rebellious students were comparing blocking and tackling to bombing and strafing.
Since then, the game has been thriving on its own measured terms in N.C.A.A. Division III, free of the highest level of competition. Winning is a preference and not an obsession. Players, though zealously recruited, are not given athletic scholarships. Championships are won but little noticed.
Chicago presents its own kind of parable: going from all to none before settling on a path in between.
''We're just a teaspoon in a larger sandbox,'' said Dick Maloney, the team's head coach since 1994. ''There are places where football is more like a giant shovel, but I prefer it when everything is kept in perspective.''
The university has 15,500 students, but a new version of Stagg Field, where the team plays, has only one short row of bleachers running the length of a single sideline. The old stadium, demolished to make room for a library that holds 4.5 million volumes, resembled a medieval castle complete with turrets. The former Stagg Field seated 55,000; the new one holds 1,600.
''I'd say 25 percent of the students don't even know we have a football team,'' said Jake Longtin, a defensive lineman who is also a team captain.
Last year, when the squad won the University Athletic Association championship, the clinching victory merited only 187 words in the hometown Chicago Sun-Times and none in The Chicago Tribune.
Of course, the Maroons of the University of Chicago no longer play Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota, as they did when they won seven conference titles in what later became the Big Ten. Nor do they play Michigan, the team they beat to win the national championship in 1905.
These days, Chicago's main rivals are other large urban universities that exist at the forefront of scholarly research and in the backwaters of football: Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh, Case Western in Cleveland and Washington University in St. Louis.
On a recent hot and drizzly Saturday night, the Maroons won their home opener against Beloit College, 44-25. School was not yet in session but a crowd of about 1,400 was enthusiastically, if moistly, observing. No band played, no cheerleaders cheered, no mascot turned somersaults.
John W. Boyer, the dean of the college, was not at the game, but in a subsequent interview he praised the football program, not necessarily for the team's play but for its appropriate niche within the university. He called it an important student activity, likening football to debating.
He said proudly, ''We have a nice and proper team.''
A Sport Dismissed
The University of Chicago was founded in 1890. John D. Rockefeller, in his wisdom and with his money, was its great patron, endowing an elite university in the centerpiece city of the American prairie. To get things going, 10 major buildings were hastily erected and renowned scholars were promptly assembled.
Prominence in the public eye, of course, was not something so speedily to be achieved, and for that the university's first president, William Rainey Harper, looked to a solution that would one day be the temptation of lots of up-and-coming colleges: big-time football.
Barely a generation old, the new sport, adapted from rugby, was a sensation in the Northeast. To summon it westward, Rainey hired a young Yale man, Amos Alonzo Stagg, enticing the coach not only with a sizeable salary but an associate professorship and full tenure. The Maroons soon became the original Monsters of the Midway. Stagg proved a brilliant formulator of X's and O's who likewise knew how to pluck the brawniest and nimblest from local high schools. His 1899 team was undefeated, knocking off, among others, Notre Dame, Cornell and Brown.
In many ways, football was rougher in those early days, with rulemakers still trying to distinguish between the violence that would be allowable and the choking, punching and stomping that would not. But the building blocks of the modern game were falling decisively into place: 10 yards produced a first down and a team had four plays to travel the distance. The forward pass, once considered a lunatic experiment, was adopted as a reliable tactic.
At the same time, the unsavory aspects of the game were taking root. The business of college football, like the business of America, was business. Massive stadiums were built, and winning teams were required to keep them full. Alumni slipped cash into secret slush funds, and the best football prospects were lured to the university that bid the highest. Special makeup exams rescued failing athletes from the annoyance of academic probation.
Chicago was considered relatively clean, and however deserved of this virtuous reputation, by the late 1920s its claims of rectitude were supported by a long skein of mediocre seasons. The university was simply unwilling to subsidize football players in the manner of its better opponents. Attendance at games thinned to embarrassing numbers. In 1932, Stagg, still a mythic figure, resigned and took his playbook west to the College of the Pacific.
College football, beset by cheating scandals, had many powerful enemies but perhaps no one was a more fetching phrasemaker than Hutchins, who in 1929 became the university's fifth president. ''As for me, I am for exercise as long as I do not have to take any myself,'' he said, among his many witticisms.
Hutchins allowed that ancient Athenians and Renaissance Italians were as crazy about sports as modern Americans, but he said they were wise enough not to mix them up with higher education. The life of the mind should not be sidetracked by the straining of muscle. Instead of football, he said, colleges should focus on sports useful later in life, like handball, skating and golf.
Though Hutchins's crusade against football had been made more acceptable by Chicago's retreat into mediocrity, nothing ran better interference for it than the season the Maroons put together in 1939. The team managed to beat Wabash and Oberlin but it was outscored in its other games, 306-0, including 61-0 defeats by Harvard and Ohio State and an 85-0 loss to its archrival, Michigan.
''The alumni were very upset with this string of totally humiliating defeats, though I expect the faculty were especially humiliated by being defeated by Harvard,'' said Boyer, an expert historian not only of the Habsburg Empire but the university itself. ''By then, doing nothing was not an option.''
Perhaps so.
And yet, giving up football was not the only alternative. Chicago could have played more games against the Oberlins and fewer against the Michigans. But it seems only so much pride could be swallowed. Competing against its lessers was deemed as disgraceful as a whooping from its betters.
''Football has the same relation to education that bullfighting has to agriculture,'' Hutchins said breezily in dismissing the game.
Other uses, ostensibly meritorious, were found for Stagg Field.
Three years later, scientists standing on the balcony of a squash court under the west stands set off the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction, an event that necessarily preceded the explosion of the world's most powerful bomb.
Recovering the Game
In 1956, Chicago hired Wally Hass as its athletic director. A former football coach, he began plotting the sport's revival, first by teaching a football class, then by beginning a football club that played games against featherweight opponents.
Hutchins was gone by then but other antifootball zealots were wary of the club metastasizing into an official team.
Just as some students once cheered the Monsters of the Midway, others now took pride in attending the university that had booted football out the door. Before a club game kickoff, several dozen protesters staged a sit-down strike on the 50-yard line. ''Ban the Ball'' read their placards, in English and in Greek.
Other students preferred to watch the game, failing to agree that football was a unit of the military-industrial complex. ''Football si, oddballs no,'' was their chant. According to an article in The New York Times, the dean of students rebuked the antifootball protestors as ''dogmatists'' who ''wouldn't let other people have their fun.''
Club football continued, and, finally, after a petition drive, the counter-revolution was complete with the game restored as a varsity sport in 1969. No immediate danger of a return to gridiron glory presented itself. A sparrow, not a phoenix, emerged from the ashes.
Mike Lockhart had been a football star in high school: ''I told Coach Hass I didn't want to go out for the team unless I was going to play, and he smiled and said I could probably start at 11 different positions. That's how it was, some good players and some others who didn't even know all the rules.''
Gary Leland, at about 215 pounds, was a lineman on offense and defense. ''It wasn't that I was so big,'' he said. ''It's just that no one else was bigger.''
The 1969 team was 2-4, a respectable enough record, though five opponents were the junior varsities of small colleges like Wheaton and Valparaiso.
Whatever the caliber of play, a few hundred students attended the games. The university was known more for eggheads than big biceps, and at halftime, instead of a marching band, a giant kazoo was brought onto the field. Fans followed with smaller versions of the instrument, moving about haphazardly rather than in formation, an activity meant to celebrate the concept of Brownian motion, the random movement of particles.
''People were there as much for the giant kazoo as the football,'' recalled the cheerleader Ramona Lauda. The university's reputation for ascetic intellectualism was wryly acknowledged. One cheer was:
Themistocles, Thucydides
The Peloponnesian War
X-squared, y-squared
H2SO4
Who for? What for?
Who we gonna yell for?
Go Maroons!
Chicago won only seven more games in the next six years. ''Wally Hass was improving the schedule faster than we were improving the team,'' said center Charlie Nelson. One of the early squads had a nose tackle who weighed but 135 pounds, so there was a kind of heroism in taking the field, ''like Hector preparing to fight Achilles,'' remembered Jeff Rasley, himself an undersize volunteer on the 1974 team, which was 0-8.
Patsies from the past now reared up in predation. In the 1974 homecoming game, with the legendary halfback Jay Berwanger, the first winner of what is now the Heisman Trophy, in the stands, the Maroons were thrashed by Oberlin, 69-0. ''Berwanger was too gracious to say anything,'' Rasley recalled. Besides, Chicago claimed a moral victory that day when Oberlin missed an extra point.
''We weren't a great team but we had great fun,'' said Bob Yovovich, a middle linebacker in 1970 and 1971. ''I know this is mouthing the party line, but it was also a tremendous learning experience.''
That's where Hutchins was mistaken, former players agreed. The game does build character. Players do learn how to lead; they do learn how to follow.
There was nothing inherently wrong with football.
Finding a Balance
During the first 25 years of what university record keepers call the modern era, Chicago's football team had but two winning seasons.
Given the university's chesty reputation for academic rigor, all that losing might well have been welcomed as a scholarly credential. But in the past few decades, it has been trying to modify its long-standing image as ''the place where fun goes to die.''
Football may not be synonymous with fun, but in the United States attending a game on a crisp autumn afternoon is widely considered a significant part of the college experience. Winning seems to make the activity more pleasant.
''In the '80s we were losing students who wanted a better quality of student life, and part of the solution was athletics, more coaches, better facilities,'' said Tom Weingartner, who has been the athletic director for 21 years.
Maloney, who is enormously personable, was hired. He had coached at the professional level in Canada; he had worked in the Ivy League. ''People asked me if I had a death wish, coming here to Chicago,'' he said. ''But this was an opportunity. There was an interest in not going 2-8 every year.''
But winning requires a recalibration of emphases. Successful recruiting is essential. To get able players, Maloney said he or members of his staff visited prospects in not only neighboring states but also California, New Jersey, Texas and Florida. They look at video of 3,000 players to compile a database of 700 athletes, of which they will pursue 200 in order to reel in 25.
Chicago's recruiting pitch carries the element of surprise, though that's hardly an advantage. ''I didn't even know they played football,'' said Nate Williams, a senior offensive lineman who grew up only 30 miles from the university.
Maloney pursues high school players who may have been all-region or all-conference but who are ''two inches too short or a half-second too slow'' to play at a major college. The depth of this talent pool drops immensely when it is further winnowed to students with superior grades and test scores.
When Maloney wants a player, he said, he brings the athlete's academic file to the admissions office, where ''the only advantage I get is quick service.''
But at Chicago, as at most of the nation's elite universities, a football player has the advantage of a big pair of cleats in the door. ''Admissions always tells us, 'There are 500 kids with perfect test scores we turned away,' '' Maloney said. ''But they also want kids who bring something else to the table -- sculptors and actors and, yes, football players.''
The Maroons have 80 on the team, all recruited, no walk-ons, Maloney said. Most likely, a purist like Hutchins would disapprove of such solicitations, even if two-thirds of the team are economics majors and its cumulative grade point average is ''something like 3.24,'' according to the coach.
So far this season the Maroons are 1-1, having dropped their second game to Concordia University Chicago, a college only a third the size. During Maloney's 18 years, the team has been 86-72.
Chicago's star player is wide receiver and kick returner Dee Brizzolara, a junior from Aurora, Ohio. The Maroons were not his first choice. He said Princeton recruited him really hard when he was in high school but he lost his opportunity to play in a big Ivy League stadium after an unfortunate run-in with the ACT exam.
Nevertheless, he insists he is happy where he is. He seems a cinch to break several of Chicago's ''modern era'' records and he ran through the list: all-purpose yards, receptions, receiving touchdowns, maybe even total scoring.
But that hardly makes him a big man on campus, he said, shrugging off the very notion. He said: ''People hear you're on the football team and they say, Oh yeah, what football team? Really, being a football player at the University of Chicago is no different than being anyone else.''
He added, ''Well, except we're usually larger.''
Correction: September 20, 2011, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about the University of Chicago football program, which was abandoned from 1939 to 1969 but is thriving again on its own measured terms, misspelled the surname of a star player. He is Dee Brizzolara, not Bizzolara.

HEADLINE: Borderline Ridiculous: The Republican presidential candidates get immigration wrong

 BODY:
The United States is home to 11 million illegal immigrants. The undocumented hold jobs, have children, pay taxes, use government services -- and too often live in fear. What is to be done about them? It's a difficult question, and one the Republican presidential candidates in the last two debates spent a great deal of effort avoiding.
Unlike Ronald Reagan, none of these Republicans favor ''amnesty,'' and President George W. Bush's comprehensive solution -- tougher enforcement and legalization, with penalties -- has gone nowhere. Comprehensive reform is President Obama's answer, too, which means no Republican today dares support it. 
Asked about illegal immigrants, the candidates settled on the simplest-sounding response: seal the border. What about immigrants already here? Same answer: seal the border. This was both a nonanswer and a call for billions in new government spending, which was very strange to hear from politicians also determined to slash even the most basic public services any chance they get. The seal-the-border answer is not only not a solution, it cynically misrepresents what's happening on the ground. It falsely paints the border region as a dangerous place when American border cities are among the safest in the country. It also denies the fact that Presidents Bush and Obama have already spent years and billions on border fencing, more Border Patrol officers and National Guard troops, spy planes, even seismic sensors.
As for spending billions more to stanch the ''flood,'' illegal crossings are at the lowest they have been in decades, because of the fence and the terrible economy.
We were hoping that Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, Rick Perry of Texas and Jon Huntsman of Utah would at least offer sensible solutions, having dealt with the reality of immigration in their years as governors. But reality is clearly not on the agenda.
Mr. Romney has slipped into and out of practically every immigration position possible. He endorsed President Bush's call to create a path to citizenship, but when Senators John McCain and Edward Kennedy offered a bill to do just that, he opposed it. As governor he blocked in-state tuition for undocumented students. He now opposes ''amnesty,'' rejects a ''special deal'' on legalization and supports building a fence, ''technologically.''
Mr. Perry maintains that fencing off Texas's 1,250-mile border is too expensive. Instead, he favors more troops and spy planes. Mr. Huntsman, who once endorsed comprehensive reform and driver's licenses for the undocumented, called Mr. Perry's skepticism about a fence ''pretty much a treasonous comment.''
Mr. Perry was also attacked for signing a bill giving in-state tuition to the undocumented. ''I'm proud that we are having those individuals be contributing members of our society rather than telling them, 'You go be on the government dole,' '' he explained. For that he was booed.
But even this assertion of an old American ideal -- of immigrants as contributing members of society -- was only a faint echo of Mr. Perry's former moderation. In 2001, he told The Dallas Morning News that he was ''intrigued'' by and ''open to'' President Bush's comprehensive reform approach. A legalization plan, he said then, was better than ''illegal immigrants living in fear of the law and afraid to access basic services.'' That's the definition of a sensible, pro-American immigration policy. Today, it's also Republican heresy.

HEADLINE: House G.O.P. Leaders Find Some Things to Like About Obama's Jobs Plan

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- House Republican leaders rejected some main elements of President Obama's jobs plan on Friday but told their rank-and-file members that they would support other components. Approvals ranged from the well-publicized parts, like an extension of the payroll tax holiday, to the more obscure, like continuing depreciation write-offs for businesses.
After a week of gingerly walking the line of conciliation, Speaker John A. Boehner and Representative Eric Cantor, the majority leader, sent a letter to their members specifying a few areas where they found common ground with Mr. Obama, who presented his proposed list of tax cuts and spending programs to Congress this month. 
Mr. Obama is also expected next week to suggest ways to cut the deficit to a bipartisan joint committee charged with recommending cuts, and to include his jobs package as part of the proposals.
While Republicans spent the first half of the year hammering on nearly every idea presented by the White House, they have taken a more guarded approach toward the president's jobs agenda, trying to avoid the rancor and voter disgust that divided government has produced.
''We believe there are areas of common agreement,'' the letter said, ''and areas worthy of further conversation where agreement, assuming there are good faith discussions, may be possible.''
Among the areas of agreement that Mr. Boehner and Mr. Cantor cite is the extension of the payroll tax holiday for employees and small business, although the letter criticizes the fine points of that proposal. They also said their party could back protections for small businesses against certain types of securities regulations, the extension of the ability of businesses to expense the cost of certain properties and tax credits for business that hire veterans. House Republicans also like the idea of a training program for unemployed workers.
But using language that Miss Manners might approve, the leaders also said there were ''some aspects of the president's proposal where it will be harder to find common ground.''
Chief among those are any tax increases or any policies proposing repeat or continued spending from the 2009 stimulus package.
For example, the Republicans said they opposed the proposed $30 billion in aid to state and local governments to prevent the layoff of teachers, law enforcement officers and other municipal employees, calling it a ''band-aid approach.''
They also rejected money for school construction, an idea Mr. Obama had pushed this week on his visit to sell the jobs plan to voters in North Carolina.
''School construction has historically been a state and local function,'' the leaders' letter to the Republican conference reads. ''In his 2009 stimulus proposal, President Obama proposed approximately $20 billion for school construction, but the Democrat-controlled Senate rejected the proposed funding.''
Also nixed was the president's plan to rehabilitate and refurbish homes in a program aimed at stabilizing neighborhoods that have been hit hard by foreclosures.
Responding to the letter, a White House spokeswoman, Amy Brundage, said, ''The American Jobs Act includes the kinds of proposals that have been supported by Democrats and Republicans in the past, and these bipartisan ideas need to be passed right away.''
The White House has been frustrated that many Democrats have also pushed back against some elements of his plan, particularly the ways of paying for it and its size.
While Mr. Obama may be counting on campaigning against Republicans by arguing that they stand against teachers or job creation, the Republicans are trying to pre-empt such strikes.
''We don't question the president's sincerity when he says he has crafted the right prescription for economic recovery,'' said the letter, sent to members late Friday. ''We believe good people can have honest disagreements without having their morals or commitment to country being called into question.''

HEADLINE: Sure, Obama Can Fire His Staff. So Should He?

BYLINE: By MATT BAI

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- He has probably been quoted more than any pundit on the planet since 1992 (which, by the way, was the last time he actually won an American campaign), but when James Carville opens his mouth, Democrats still tend to listen. And so it got a lot of people talking this week when Mr. Carville, in an open letter to President Obama on CNN's Web site, urged the struggling president to follow the example of some of his predecessors and just fire a bunch of people.
''For God's sake, why are we still looking at the same political and economic advisers that got us into this mess?'' Mr. Carville asked. ''It's not working. Furthermore, it's not going to work with the same team, the same strategy and the same excuses.'' 
The remarks resonated in part because some Democrats on Capitol Hill and even at the White House appear now to be circling ominously around William M. Daley, Mr. Obama's chief of staff. Since taking over the job in January, Mr. Daley has reportedly hardened the lines of command in the West Wing while also limiting access to the president. He deserves some credit for having deftly handled complex situations, most notably the operation against Osama bin Laden, and for trying to repair the breach between the administration and the business community.
And yet, for a lot of liberals frustrated with the president, Mr. Daley (along with other aides, like the economic adviser Gene Sperling) has become a symbol of what they consider the administration's centrist drift.
Critics on the left fear that Mr. Daley is more interested in finding elusive compromises with Republicans than in pursuing progressive policies. On Capitol Hill, some Democrats say Mr. Daley makes little effort to consult or work with them. When Politico asked Mr. Carville if he was talking specifically about Mr. Daley, Mr. Carville replied: ''I recuse myself. Bill's an old friend.'' Which, translated from Washingtonese, means something roughly equivalent to ''yes.''
Historians and management consultants can debate the merits of firing senior aides generally. As Mr. Carville noted, it seemed to work for Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton at precarious moments in their campaigns and presidencies. It worked less well for Jimmy Carter, who demanded the resignation of his entire cabinet days after his so-called malaise speech, perhaps in the hope that he could make everyone forget it.
The problem with Mr. Carville's prescription in this particular case, however, especially as it pertains to Mr. Daley, is that it would directly undermine the foundation of the case that Mr. Obama and his Democratic allies have been trying so hard to make.
The point that Mr. Obama has been driving home for at least the past year, when he started talking about how America's car had been driven into a ditch and all of that, is that he didn't create the mess we're in and therefore shouldn't be held entirely -- or even largely -- accountable for it. What Mr. Obama and other Democrats have argued, over and over, is that we didn't get into our economic morass in one year or two, and we can't expect him or anyone else to get us out of it any faster. Constancy in the face of crisis, they say, is the only sensible course.
But now here comes Mr. Daley, an outsider to the Obama world who became chief of staff nine months ago. He inherited a dispirited White House, a highly partisan and divided Congress and an economy that was about to sink back into turpitude. He has failed, to this point, to score any huge legislative deal or to mollify the president's critics on either the left or the right.
So what should Mr. Obama do with Mr. Daley? Send him packing! Do the Donald Trump on the guy! Where's the accountability?
There's an evident inconsistency here. If administrations are to be judged solely on results, rather than in the context of the times, then Mr. Obama can't possibly make a compelling argument for his own re-election -- not when unemployment refuses to fall below 9 percent. But if he intends to argue that the data points of his presidency are simply beyond anyone's control for the moment, and that good policy takes some time to work, then he can't very well go around firing senior aides who have failed, in a matter of months, to stop the slide.
Or, rather, he can, but it would contradict his own appeal to the voters for their continued faith. He would be judging his top aides by exactly the criteria that he is asking the public to set aside.
The White House is either largely responsible for this prolonged economic misery and the dysfunction in Washington, or it isn't. If it isn't, then there's not much reason to bring the hammer down on those who run the place. If it is, then someone will indeed be held accountable.
But as Mr. Carville knows better than anyone, having won a referendum against the elder George Bush 19 years ago, that someone can only be the president himself.

HEADLINE: Will a Powerful Bank Act the Part?

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- The European Central Bank still has plenty of ammunition left in its monetary policy bandoleers. The question is whether it will use it.
The bank provided a clue Thursday when it said it would join with the United States Federal Reserve and three other major central banks in ensuring that hard-pressed European banks have a steady supply of dollar credit.
It was a more cooperative hands-across-the-water attitude than Europe's main finance ministers displayed on Friday, when they reacted coolly to a bailout policy suggested by the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner. (American money speaks louder these days than American advice, evidently.)
The bank by agreeing Thursday to let euro zone banks borrow as many dollars as they want, indicated its willingness to deploy ''nonstandard measures,'' as the bank president, Jean-Claude Trichet, likes to call them. 
The deeper issue is how far the bank will be willing to depart from precedent as it tries to hold the euro together. The departure would require the central bank to act much less cautiously than it has so far during the long-running euro debt crisis.
''The E.C.B. can stop this crisis in a minute if they want to,'' said Guntram B. Wolff, deputy director of Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. The bank, he said, could simply overwhelm bond markets by buying huge quantities of debt from Greece, which is effectively insolvent, as well as other countries that have come under attack, like Italy. End of crisis.
Some economists have argued that the bank could buy more than $1 trillion in sovereign debt if it needed to.
But such an action would provoke howls from Germany and countries like Finland, where the bank is seen as having gone rogue because of its relatively modest purchases of debt from a list of countries that also includes Spain, Portugal and Ireland. In those beleaguered countries, meanwhile, the bank is regarded as insufficiently supportive.
The bank is ''in a very awkward position of trying to please everybody, which is impossible,'' Mr. Wolff said.
Even though Europe's sovereign debt crisis has mushroomed into a perceived threat to the world economy, the bank has so far been much more conservative than its peers. Worried about the prospect of inflation, the bank has raised interest rates this year, while the Fed and the Bank of England have kept theirs at rock-bottom levels.
The bank also stood on the sidelines while its counterparts in the United States and England flooded their economies with cash by way of so-called quantitative easing.
And the bank's purchases of sovereign bonds for 143 billion euros, or $197 billion, so far, as part of a program to keep the recipient governments' borrowing costs under control, is less than asset purchases by the Bank of England -- which represents one country while the euro zone has more than 20 nations.
Right or wrong, the restrained policy means that the bank still has considerable firepower in reserve.
''If there is a risk of severe economic fallout, you could see the E.C.B. do more,'' said Nick Matthews, an economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland. ''There are more options it has not used up.''
The most obvious is the classic central bank tool: manipulating interest rates. The bank has raised its benchmark rate twice this year, bringing it to 1.5 percent from 1 percent. The increases were widely criticized as treating the wrong symptom -- incipient inflation rather than depressed growth -- especially after euro zone growth promptly slowed almost to nothing.
Some economists are now forecasting that the bank will reverse course on interest rates before the end of the year. And some think that Mr. Trichet may deliver a cut in October, his last month on the job before he retires.
The reasoning is that Mr. Trichet will want to make life easier for his successor, Mario Draghi, currently the governor of the Bank of Italy. Mr. Draghi might have trouble overseeing a rate cut soon after taking office in November because he will be eager to establish his credentials as a hard-liner on inflation.
But apart from interest rates, the bank has other tools it can use, Mr. Matthews pointed out in a recent research note:
To help banks raise money to lend to consumers and businesses, it could resume purchases of commercial banks' so-called covered bonds, which are generally considered low risk because they are backed by packages of loans as well as the guarantee of the issuing bank. That measure, already used by the bank in 2009, would make sense if banks in France or other countries ran into trouble selling bonds because of worries about creditworthiness.
The central bank could encourage national central banks to expand so-called emergency lending assistance, which is already being used in Greece and Ireland to help banks that can no longer borrow easily on the open market.
It could lengthen the time period for its loans to banks. The central bank already lends banks in the euro area as much as they want for up to six months at the benchmark interest rate, provided the banks supply collateral. It could provide more certainty by resuming one-year loans, and it could expand the list of securities that it accepts as collateral.
None of those measures would be extremely controversial. The screaming would start if the bank did anything that looked like it was printing money or rewarding irresponsible behavior.
In Germany, which as the largest economy in the euro area has significant power to shape the debate, politicians have catered to fears of inflation mixed with resentment at having to bail out southern European countries, which they see as fiscally irresponsible.
Anxiety about the bank's direction was further enflamed last week when Jurgen Stark, a German on its executive board, said he would resign. Analysts interpreted his departure as a protest against increasing purchases of government bonds.
The German government nominated Jorg Asmussen, a deputy finance minister, to replace Mr. Stark on the six-member board. Both men spring from German establishment economics, with its reverence for price stability.
But Mr. Asmussen, a generation younger, may prove more pragmatic after spending several years in the thick of efforts to design a coordinated European approach to the debt crisis.
It is possible that Mr. Stark, who has not explained his resignation in detail, stepped down because he recognized that more aggressive action by the bank was imminent and did not want to be part of it.
And yet, the powers of the bank are not unlimited.
The bank cannot make Greeks pay taxes, force Spain to loosen its labor market regulations or recapitalize French banks. Nor can it otherwise solve by itself the underlying problem in the overly indebted countries: slow growth caused by poor economic policy-making.
As Mr. Trichet said this month, ''We are not in a position to replace economic agents, governments or any of the other elements of economic policy.''

HEADLINE: In Poll, Support for Obama Slips Among Base

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and MEGAN THEE-BRENAN; Allison Kopicki and Marina Stefan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
President Obama's support is eroding among elements of his base, and a yearlong effort to recapture the political center has failed to attract independent voters, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll, leaving him vulnerable at a moment when pessimism over the country's direction is greater than at any other time since he took office.
The president's effort to seize the initiative on the economy was well received by the public, and clear majorities support crucial pieces of his new job-creation program. But despite Mr. Obama's campaign to sell the plan to Congress and voters, more than half of those questioned said they feared the economy was already in or was headed for a double-dip recession, and nearly three-quarters of Americans think the country is on the wrong track.
Republicans appear more energized than Democrats at the outset of the 2012 presidential campaign, but have not coalesced around a candidate. Even as the party's nominating contest seems to be narrowing to a two-man race between Mitt Romney and Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, a majority of their respective supporters say they have reservations about their candidate. Half of Republicans who plan to vote in a primary say they would like more choices. 
A snapshot of the Republican Party, four months before the first primary ballots are cast, shows that voters are evenly divided between preferring a presidential nominee who can defeat Mr. Obama or one who aligns with them on most issues. A majority of voters who support the Tea Party movement place a higher priority on winning back the White House.
The Republican primary campaign is unfolding in a more conservative electorate than four years ago, with 7 in 10 Republican voters calling themselves conservative and one-quarter who say they are moderate.
The poll, which was conducted after Mr. Obama's economic address to Congress last week, contains considerable warning signs for the president. The poll found a 12-point jump since late June, to 43 percent, in the number of Americans who say the economy is getting worse. And for the first time since taking office, his disapproval rating has reached 50 percent in the Times and CBS News polls.
''I don't disapprove of Barack Obama as a person, but as a president he has disappointed me greatly,'' said Ann Sheets, 69, a Democrat from Chattanooga, Tenn., speaking in a follow-up interview. Ms. Sheets added, ''I'm realistic enough to know how difficult it is and I am not against compromise, but I voted for a backbone. You have to draw some lines in the sand, and I don't think he has done that.''
The poll found a 43 percent approval rating for Mr. Obama. It is significantly higher than Jimmy Carter, who had an approval rating of 31 percent at a similar time in his presidency, according to the Times and CBS News poll, which showed Ronald Reagan with an approval of 46 percent and the elder George Bush at 70 percent.
The president's support has fallen to its lowest levels across parts of the diverse coalition of voters who elected him, from women to suburbanites to college graduates. And a persistent effort over the past year to reclaim his appeal to independent voters has shown few signs of bearing fruit, with 59 percent of this critical electoral group voicing their disapproval.
While Mr. Obama has not yet succeeded in winning over independent voters, who comprise the most influential piece of the electorate, neither have Republicans. The field is largely unknown to independents, and few have a favorable opinion of any of the candidates.
As the Republican Party experiences something of a reinvention, with Tea Party activists often clashing with the party's weakening establishment, the poll found an overall electorate that is not entirely in step with the campaign messages of the party's candidates.
More than 8 in 10 Republicans voters would like to see the national health care law repealed, at least in part. About half say illegal immigrants should be deported, rather than offered a chance at citizenship or an opportunity to serve as guest workers.
Yet in stark contrast to the positions taken by some presidential candidates, three-quarters of Republicans say global warming exists -- either as a result of human activity, natural patterns in the earth's environment, or both. Nearly 6 in 10 favor allowing same-sex couples to either form civil unions or marry. And only one-third of Republicans support a ban on abortion.
A slim majority of Republican voters say it is important for a presidential candidate to share their religious beliefs. And more than one-third of Republican primary voters say that most people they know would not vote for a candidate who is Mormon.
Mr. Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, struggled during his presidential bid four years ago to explain his Mormon traditions to some voters. Mr. Perry speaks frequently to Republican audiences about his evangelical beliefs.
The poll was taken as Republicans hopefuls are drawing sharp distinctions with one another in a series of nationally televised debates.
A fight over Social Security has emerged as one of the early yet defining differences between Mr. Perry, who has called the program a ''monstrous lie,'' and Mr. Romney, who has called for maintaining the current system with some changes to shore up its long-term financial condition. The poll found that nearly three-quarters of Republicans said they thought Social Security and Medicare were worth their costs.
The crosscurrents across the Republican landscape show the promise and peril for the candidates. Nearly half of Republicans surveyed said they considered themselves supporters of the Tea Party, but that finding was tempered by two-thirds of Republicans who said a candidate's identification with the Tea Party made no difference in their vote.
''Any Republican who gets the nomination, whether it's my first choice or not, is going to be better than what we've got now,'' said Allen Hulshizer, 77, a Republican and retired structural engineer from Glenside, Pa. ''By the time you get down to the final selections, any one of the top contenders will certainly be better than Obama.''
The nationwide telephone poll was conducted from last Saturday through Thursday with 1,452 adults, of whom 1,356 were registered to vote. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points for both groups.
The poll found that most Americans are familiar with the American Jobs Act, the president's $447 billion proposal to create jobs. Almost half of the public is confident the plan would create jobs and improve the economy. A substantial majority of Americans support the main proposals aimed at creating jobs, including tax cuts for small businesses, improvements in the nation's infrastructure and payroll tax cuts for working Americans.
Yet despite their support, two-thirds of Americans from broad majorities across party lines are doubtful that Congressional Democrats and Republicans will be able to reach an agreement on a job-creation package despite near universal bipartisan support for compromise. The poll also found a historically low approval rating for Congress, with just 19 percent approving of Republicans, compared with 28 percent that approve of Democrats.
The poll had a few promising signs for Mr. Obama. Americans strongly support his position that creating jobs should be a higher priority than cutting spending. Democrats and independents agree on that view, while Republicans do not. And across party lines, Americans support his position that a deficit-reduction plan should include a mix of tax increases and spending cuts.
But the poll also found a dark mood on Mr. Obama's handling of the economy, with 34 percent approving and 57 percent disapproving. His numbers on job creation are similarly bleak, with 40 percent approving of his performance and 53 percent disapproving. Two-thirds of the public say Mr. Obama has not made progress in fixing the economy, even though a majority of people concede the condition of the national economy is not something a president can do a lot about.
''I have incredible empathy for the spot he's in. He walked into the huge mess left behind by George Bush,'' said Barbara Cornell, 56, a Democrat and hospital chaplain from Shoreline, Wash. Ms. Cornell added, ''I believe he is a good person, but there are all these issues and problems that aren't being dealt with.''

HEADLINE: On a Swing Through Early-Voting Iowa, Perry Finds Kindred Spirits

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

 BODY:
JEFFERSON, Iowa -- At several levels, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas seemed a perfect fit for this small Iowa farming community.
In a speech here on Thursday, he covered themes that have always served him well as a politician in Texas: his modest farm-country background -- as a young boy, he says, he did not have indoor plumbing, but he did have a mother who hand-sewed his clothes -- and his record in Texas, including his contention that his own policies and not the state's relatively robust energy-heavy economy deserve credit for creating jobs.
Interviews with dozens of Republicans who turned out to see him in several towns here this week suggested that while the governor was relatively new to the presidential field, his charisma and ''straight-talking Texan'' message, as one man here described it, might have wide appeal. Many see him as a successful governor with a good economic record who shares their values and background, one that he is now trying to contrast with Mitt Romney by suggesting that his chief rival was born holding ''four aces.'' 
''I like his down-to-earth style,'' said Beth Rasmussen, a central committee member of the Greene County Republican Party here. ''To me, he is a man of integrity.''
But Mr. Perry's campaign stops here were notable as much for what he did not say as what he did. Except for a couple of easy questions about credit unions at an industry convention in Des Moines, he took no questions in his first three stops. Instead he breezed through with short speeches that almost entirely avoided mention of his positions on issues that led to attacks by Mr. Romney and other rivals at Monday's debate, including on immigration and Social Security.
And those attacks appear to have had a demonstrable effect, even with Iowa Republicans bowled over by the polished delivery that helped vault Mr. Perry to six straight victories in Texas statewide elections. Especially about immigration, where there was bafflement and disappointment over Mr. Perry's stance, which includes granting children of illegal immigrants cheaper, in-state university tuition.
''These issues have to be addressed for him to remain the main contender,'' Roger Olhausen, the Greene County Republican chairman, said after Mr. Perry's speech here. Had Mr. Perry taken any questions, Mr. Olhausen said, he also would have been asked about federal requirements to use ethanol in gasoline, which are critical to Iowa farmers enjoying corn prices that have tripled in the past half-dozen years. Mr. Perry has sharply criticized the mandates as governor, saying they drive up feed prices for Texas cattle ranchers.
Mr. Perry's visit was meant to acquaint him with voters in this early caucus state, where Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, took a quarter of the vote in 2008. Mr. Perry is in a battle with Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota for the support of social conservatives who can help decide which way the nominating contest goes.
With a turnout of 250, the Thursday night speech was the largest Republican political event held at the Greene County fairgrounds, far outpacing the second-largest turnout, an appearance by Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, that drew 175 people, Mr. Olhausen said.
But while he was among those impressed with Mr. Perry's performance, he suggested that the support remains contingent on getting more answers. ''I'm a little surprised how popular he is because these issues are important to Iowa Republicans,'' he said.
Several people who attended the speech here and talks in Newton and Des Moines on Friday said they generally agreed with the governor on the issues. But others like David McQuillen, a retired military police officer in Jefferson, said they had concerns, despite their favorable impression of Mr. Perry as a campaigner.
''He says what a lot of people want said, but I'm not that sure about his Social Security thing,'' Mr. McQuillen said. ''It's great if he is going to change it to strengthen it, but don't denigrate it. That's not what we need.''
Mr. Perry has derided Social Security as a ''Ponzi scheme'' and a ''monstrous lie'' and has raised questions about its constitutionality, although in the last week he has tempered his tone.
Jerry Litzel, who also attended the speech here, seemed similarly of two minds about the candidate. ''I just like the way he talks -- like a tough Texan,'' Mr. Litzel said, before adding that he was not sure he liked Mr. Perry's political positions, partly because he could not figure out what they are. ''He keeps changing his mind. Like Social Security. Is he for it?''
Mr. Perry's sole concession to his rivals' attacks seemed to be a continuation of his more restrained tone on Social Security. In response to a question about credit unions at a lunchtime address in Des Moines on Friday, he improbably segued into perhaps his most conciliatory language yet about the issue, saying that ''we will fix the Social Security system so that it will be there for our young workers.''
The Romney campaign, meanwhile, fired back at Mr. Perry on Friday after Mr. Perry's comments about Mr. Romney's more privileged background. ''He was clearly rattled by his poor debate performance in Tampa, and as a result he is trying desperately to distract people from the very serious questions raised about his record,'' said Andrea Saul, a Romney spokeswoman.

PERSON: Maria Haley 

HEADLINE: Maria Haley, 70, Clinton White House Aide

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Maria Haley, a longtime aide to former President Bill Clinton, died here on Tuesday. She was 70.
Her death was confirmed by the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. 
Ms. Haley worked for Mr. Clinton when he was governor of Arkansas and when he was president -- originally in the presidential personnel office and then, from 1994 to 1999, on the board of the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Since 2007, she had been director of the Arkansas Economic Development Commission under Gov. Mike Beebe.
Ms. Haley came under scrutiny during her years at the Export-Import Bank because of her friendship with James T. Riady and John Huang, key figures in an investigation of foreign campaign contributions in 1996. More than $1 million in Democratic National Committee contributions raised by Mr. Huang was returned because of questions about their origin.
Ms. Haley met Mr. Huang met in the 1980s, when she was at the Arkansas development agency and he worked for the Worthen Banking Corporation, which at the time was partly controlled by the Riady family of Indonesia.
Ms. Haley said she was not influenced by her friendships with Mr. Huang and Mr. Riady. She was not charged.
After leaving the White House, she worked at Kissinger McLarty Associates, former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger's consulting group, and as an adviser to the president of the Philippines, her home country.
Ms. Haley moved to Arkansas in 1971 when she married John Haley, a lawyer. In 1979 she joined the Arkansas Industrial Development Commission, where she focused primarily on international business. Ms. Haley divorced her husband in the early 1990s. He died in a plane crash in 2003.
Ms. Haley died the same day as Jim Pickens, 74, who had run the Arkansas Economic Development Commission for three years under Gov. Mike Huckabee.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg, on Radio, Raises Specter of Riots by Jobless

BYLINE: By KATE TAYLOR

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg takes every opportunity these days to mention what he says are two major problems facing the country's economy: enormous public debt and high unemployment. But on the radio show he appears on with John Gambling on Friday mornings, Mr. Bloomberg took his comments further than usual. 
''You have a lot of kids graduating college can't find jobs,'' he said in response to a question about the poverty rate. ''That's what happened in Cairo. That's what happened in Madrid,'' he continued, referring to the uprising that overthrew President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and the more recent protests against the Spanish government's austerity measures. ''You don't want those kinds of riots here.''
Riots or no, Mr. Bloomberg does have reason to be concerned about unemployment. He frequently describes New York City as having recovered from the recession more fully than the rest of the country. At an event on Tuesday to announce a new round of job creation and training grants, he noted that, while the nation as a whole had gained back only one out of every four jobs lost during the recession, New York City had gained back all of the lost jobs and added some, too.
Recently, though, the difference between New York and the rest of the country is not looking so clear. Figures released on Thursday by the State Department of Labor show that the city's official unemployment rate rose to 8.7 percent in August from 8.6 percent in July, as the total number of jobs declined. (Age groups were not broken out in that report. Statewide, the unemployment rate among 22- to 27-year-olds in the first half of 2011 was 11.4 percent, compared with an overall unemployment rate for people 16 and over of 8 percent.)
The mayor is watching these numbers closely. On Tuesday, he said that creating jobs ''remains our No. 1 priority.''
Perhaps the mention of riots was his subtle way of trying to prod Washington to pass a jobs bill. He has been known to invoke the possibility of riots before, when looking to spur a divided Legislature into action.
The last time was in 2009, when it looked possible that the New York State Legislature would not renew mayoral control of the schools. ''If they didn't do that, I think that there'd be riots in the streets, given the improvement'' in schools, Mr. Bloomberg said at the time, prompting many riot-themed headlines. The Legislature ultimately did renew mayoral control.

SEPTEMBER
'ATYS' The season is off and running. And a thoroughbred put out to pasture after a few great years is back in the gate: William Christie's acclaimed presentation of Lully's opera ''Atys'' with Les Arts Florissants, seen at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1989 and 1992, a landmark in the modern early-music movement. Some of the old costumes and wigs were dispersed to museums as Mr. Christie went on to other triumphs. But one Brooklyn Academy patron, Ronald P. Stanton, couldn't put the experience behind him. Avid to see the production again and having the wherewithal to do something about it, he financed this revival -- which has already made its way around Europe and appeared at Versailles, where the opera had its premiere in 1676 -- to the tune of $3.1 million. Once again, Jean-Marie Villegier directs, and Mr. Christie conducts Les Arts Florissants. Anything Mr. Christie is involved with carries an almost ironclad guarantee of quality. But this promises to be something truly special, as the Academy acknowledges by presenting it to kick off celebrations of its 150th anniversary. Opens today. BAM Howard Gilman Opera House. 
NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC After a hectic September preseason -- live accompaniments to the film of Bernstein's ''West Side Story''; a Mahler ''Resurrection'' Symphony for Sept. 11 (on Sept. 10, actually, with performances to follow on Sept. 22, 24 and 27); an Andrea Bocelli blowout in Central Park; and Walton's music for Shakespeare's ''Henry V'' with narration by Christopher Plummer -- Alan Gilbert and the orchestra finally get around to starting their season officially. The soprano Deborah Voigt, fresh off her portrayal of Annie Oakley in ''Annie Get Your Gun'' at the Glimmerglass Festival, shifts moods drastically and repeatedly in ''Dich, teure Halle'' from Wagner's ''Tannhauser,'' ''Andromache's Farewell'' by Samuel Barber and the final scene from Strauss's ''Salome.'' Ms. Voigt will presumably remain offstage, or at least clothed, as the orchestra adds Strauss's ''Dance of the Seven Veils.'' The concert is to be broadcast in the ''Live From Lincoln Center'' series on PBS; let's hope that the players appear a happier bunch than they did in the glum PBS close-ups of last year's opening concert. Wednesday. Avery Fisher Hall.
KRONOS QUARTET This group has long been recognized as much for its pioneering social and internationalist mission as for its music-making, so a program addressing the 10th anniversary of Sept. 11 comes as no surprise. ''Awakening,'' originally presented in San Francisco for the fifth anniversary in 2006 and described as a musical meditation, has its New York premiere here. Composers represented include Michael Gordon, Terry Riley and Osvaldo Golijov, and the Brooklyn Youth Chorus joins in arrangements of traditional songs of various cultures. Wednesday-Saturday. BAM Harvey Theater.
'ANNA BOLENA' The Russian soprano Anna Netrebko is the lovely face (and sometimes bosom) of the Metropolitan Opera season, undoubtedly showing on a poster near you, as Manon if not Anna Bolena. For starters, the company has given Ms. Netrebko not only a new production and an opening-night showcase but a Donizetti work never presented in the house. How well the role's vocal fancywork will suit her voice in the big house remains to be seen, but one way or the other, she instantly becomes a part of Met history. David McVicar directs a cast that also includes Ekaterina Gubanova, Stephen Costello and Ildar Abdrazakov. Marco Armiliato conducts. Sept. 26. Metropolitan Opera House.
SEATTLE SYMPHONY Ludovic Morlot, in one of his first subscription series as this orchestra's new music director, serves up a doozy of a program, opening with Stravinsky's epochal ''Sacre du Printemps'' and closing with a work that carried it to its logical, raucous conclusion, Varese's ''Ameriques.'' In between, Mr. Morlot whimsically eases the pressure with, of all things, Gershwin's perky ''American in Paris.'' Well, the honking car horns, at least, should fit right in with the churning chaos that surrounds them. Sept. 29, Oct. 1. Benaroya Hall, (206) 215-4747 or (866) 833-4747, seattlesymphony.org.
BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA In what was supposed to be the last season of his contract as the orchestra's music director, James Levine, by present plans, will not conduct it at all. After the March announcement of his resignation, forced by chronic back problems (for which he continues to have operations), he was scrubbed from the schedule before it was announced, though some of his trademark programming remains in place, including a continuing cycle of the symphonies of John Harbison. As for Mr. Levine's eventual replacement, the orchestra -- which had to canvas conductors and their agents repeatedly to fill his vacancies in recent seasons -- must have a pretty good idea of who is out there. But now it accelerates the search with a parade of conductors that presents, along with elderly and fledgling maestros, plausible candidates, including Riccardo Chailly, surprisingly in his Boston Symphony debut; Andris Nelsons, who evidently impressed others in his debut with the orchestra in March more than he impressed me; and Esa-Pekka Salonen. But the season opens in understated fashion, with Anne-Sophie Mutter playing and leading the five Mozart violin concertos over two nights. Ms. Mutter, for her part, has made it clear that she has no conducting ambitions beyond overseeing her own performances. Sept. 30-Oct. 1. Symphony Hall, Boston, (617) 266-1492, bso.org.
VICTORIA SACRED WORKS You would expect the quiet celebrations of the 400th birthday of Tomas Luis de Victoria that are scattered about in concerts and on disc. What you might not have expected is a 10-CD set of 93 works newly recorded, some for the first time. But here it is, from Michael Noone and the 10-year-old Ensemble Plus Ultra, a London-based group specializing in Spanish Renaissance liturgical music, on Deutsche Grammophon Archiv. A Deutsche Grammophon blurb describes Victoria as ''a towering composer whose works glow with the passion and vibrant tonal palette of El Greco,'' presumably the case these recordings are trying to make. September.
OCTOBER
'THE THREEPENNY OPERA' Robert Wilson directs the Weill-Brecht classic, performed in German by the Berliner Ensemble, descended from the company founded by Bertolt Brecht and his wife in 1949. Mr. Wilson, the Brooklyn Academy says, has drawn on ''the striking designs of German Expressionist cinema and the shattering, seductive world of Weimar-era cabaret.'' There is also talk of a geometric concept, presumably coupled with a certain angularity of gesture, unless Mr. Wilson has lost his spots. Oct. 4-8. BAM Howard Gilman Opera House.
CARNEGIE HALL It is a boon to latter-day Carnegie Hall programmers and marketers that Tchaikovsky -- having conducted a work of his own at the hall's opening concert, in 1891 -- can forever be commemorated as a sort of founding father. The hall continues its celebration of the 120th anniversary of that opening (which occurred last May) with a citywide festival, Tchaikovsky in St. Petersburg. Along with music, ballet and exhibits, there will be talks and panel discussions focusing on New York at the turn of the 20th century. One of St. Petersburg's great orchestras, the Mariinsky, and its maestro, Valery Gergiev, are in residence for the occasion, and they open the season here with Tchaikovsky's Variations on a Rococo Theme, with the cellist Yo-Yo Ma as soloist, and Shostakovich's ''Festive Overture'' and Rimsky-Korsakov's ''Scheherazade.'' Oct. 5.
MARIINSKY ORCHESTRA Carnegie is spending so much Tchaikovsky capital celebrating its 120th anniversary that you have to wonder what it has in mind for its 125th, seemingly a bigger deal. (Fear not; the planners are already at work.) Here Valery Gergiev conducts his St. Petersburg-based ensemble in all six Tchaikovsky symphonies, in each case pairing an overfamiliar later work with a less familiar earlier one. The opening juxtaposition of the ever fresh First Symphony (''Winter Dreams'') with the soul-weary Sixth (''Pathetique'') should be especially striking, even disconcerting. Oct. 6, 9-10. Carnegie Hall.
DANIIL TRIFONOV Valery Gergiev, who as the new chairman of the International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow, scored points for lending greater transparency and presumably more probity to the judging process in June, comes with a grand prize winner in tow. This young pianist, who also won the Rubinstein International Master Piano Competition in Tel Aviv in May and drew acclaim for a New York recital in July, joins Mr. Gergiev and the Mariinsky Orchestra in -- what else? -- Tchaikovsky's First Piano Concerto. The orchestra also plays Shostakovich's First Symphony and three selections from Prokofiev's ''Romeo and Juliet.'' Oct. 11. Carnegie Hall.
JORDI AND FERRAN SAVALL Inveterate followers of early music have come to know and love not only the virtuoso violist da gamba Jordi Savall but also his family: especially his wife, Montserrat Figueras, a wide-ranging vocalist, and their daughter, Arianna Savall, a harpist and singer. But I, for one, have encountered their son, Ferran, a lutenist and singer, only once, when all four performed together at the Metropolitan Museum. To say that he more than held his own in this exalted company is to say a lot. In ''Folias and Variations: Music Dialogues From Orient and Occident,'' a program presented by the Morgan and the Boston Early Music Festival, Ferran Savall, singing and playing theorbo, joins his father in works from the 13th through 17th centuries by Tobias Hume, Marin Marais and others. Oct. 12. Morgan Library & Museum, 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, ext. 560, themorgan.org.
'DON GIOVANNI' There will be plenty to attend to onstage in a new production of Mozart's opera by Michael Grandage. Mariusz Kwiecien takes the title role opposite the scene-stealing Luca Pisaroni as Leporello. But a newly heightened curiosity will also be directed to the pit, as Fabio Luisi, suddenly the principal conductor at the Met, replaces an ailing James Levine on the podium. Separate article by Anthony Tommasini. Opens Oct. 13. Metropolitan Opera House.
LONDON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Lincoln Center's Great Performers series has yet to plunge into the brightness of the White Light Festival, but the venerable maestro Colin Davis can hardly be said to remain in the dark as he plies a specialty in the music of Sibelius: the Violin Concerto, with Nikolai Znaider as soloist, and the Second Symphony. Oct. 19. Avery Fisher Hall.
YUJA WANG Fashionistas may vie with pianistas for the good seats when this gifted and attractive young Chinese pianist makes her New York recital debut. Ms. Wang seems bent on radically altering concert dress, to judge from reports of her recent appearance at Hollywood Bowl wearing what The Los Angeles Times called ''an orange, thigh-grazing, body-hugging dress atop sparkly gold strappy stiletto sandals.'' Well, Hollywood Bowl is one thing; Carnegie Hall may be another (let alone the Ladies' Morning Musical Club in Montreal, three days later). The program, should anyone be listening, offers sonatas by Beethoven (''Moonlight''), Liszt (B minor) and Prokofiev (No. 6), and the performances are almost sure to be wonderful. So what does Ms. Wang wear for an encore? Oct. 20. Carnegie Hall.
AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA The seemingly indefatigable and ever voluble Leon Botstein, president of Bard College, music director of this ensemble and inveterate champion of thematic programming, adds to his workload this season with preconcert chats, ''Conductor's Notes Q&As,'' presented an hour before each program. The first concert, ''Bauhaus Bach,'' tracing connections between Bach and modernism, follows on the exhibition ''Lyonel Feininger: At the Edge of the World'' at the Whitney Museum of American Art and presents works of Bach orchestrated by Wolfgang Graeser, Reger and Schoenberg; Schoenberg's Variations for Orchestra; and Feininger's own composition Three Fugues. Oct. 21. Carnegie Hall.
WHITE LIGHT FESTIVAL ''It's such a great work, it should never be performed,'' Colin Davis has said of Beethoven's ''Missa Solemnis.'' Happily, he has not lived by that bit of hyperbole (reported by John Canarina in his book ''The New York Philharmonic: From Bernstein to Maazel,'' Amadeus Press, 2010), and Mr. Davis tries to take the measure of the work again, with the London Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, as the second annual White Light Festival at Lincoln Center gets rolling. Then Gianandrea Noseda leads the orchestra and chorus in another daunting masterpiece, Britten's ''War Requiem,'' with the tenor Ian Bostridge and the baritone Simon Keenlyside delivering the death-haunted poetry of Wilfred Owen. Oct. 21, 23. Avery Fisher Hall.
PACIFICA QUARTET With Hilde Limondjian having left her position as director of concerts and lectures at the Metropolitan Museum more than a year ago, and her successor, Limor Tomer, having arrived only in May, this will be a season of transition in programming. Lisa Doyle, the senior manager of concerts and lectures, and the staff did most of the planning, and some old formulas now seem open to question. But this one remains strong: a series of Saturday evening concerts by a resident string quartet in the Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium. For more than four decades, it was the Guarneri Quartet; since 2009, it has been the Pacifica. Having dispatched the 15 Shostakovich quartets last season, the Pacifica now presents a complete cycle of Beethoven's 16 quartets. The first program sets the pattern, with works early (Op. 18, No. 2), middle (Op. 74) and late (Op. 131). Oct. 22 (also Nov. 12, Dec. 10, Jan. 7, Feb. 25, March 10). Metropolitan Museum.
JENNIFER KOH Two seasons ago, this fine violinist played Bach's unaccompanied sonatas and partitas one per day in a popular series of free lunchtime concerts presented by the Miller Theater in Philosophy Hall of Columbia University. Now she puts all six works together in a single afternoon in the theater itself. To judge from reports on the earlier performances, tickets will probably be scarce. Oct. 23. Miller Theater, 2960 Broadway, at 116th Street, (212) 854-7799, millertheatre.com.
ANNA NETREBKO The Russian diva is almost as ubiquitous as Tchaikovsky this season, and -- no surprise -- she sings 8 of his songs here, in her New York recital debut, alongside 11 by Rimsky-Korsakov. Elena Bashkirova is the pianist. Oct. 26. Carnegie Hall.
'SIEGFRIED' What can Robert Lepage possibly add to the technological wonders of the first two installments of his unfolding Wagner ''Ring'' cycle at the Met? Why, the latest wrinkle, of course: 3-D. ''If the technology works as advertised, the singers will appear to move inside a three-dimensional world created by projections,'' Daniel J. Wakin and Steve Lohr reported in The New York Times. ''But tuxedo-clad operagoers will not face the indignity of wearing goofy 3-D glasses.'' Amazing, to be sure, but none of this helps -- you have to hope that it doesn't hinder -- the poor tenor at center stage for most of five hours, singing his heart and his voice out: in this case, Gary Lehman, replacing Ben Heppner, who withdrew from the punishing role in February because, according to his manager, it ''was just not the right repertoire for him.'' The opera is also a long haul for the conductor, and here again, Fabio Luisi has replaced James Levine. Deborah Voigt sings Brunnhilde; Bryn Terfel, the Wanderer; Eric Owens, Alberich. Opens Oct. 27. Metropolitan Opera House.
BUDAPEST FESTIVAL ORCHESTRA The thoughtful Hungarian-born pianist Andras Schiff begins his season-long Carnegie Perspectives series, focusing on Bartok, with favorite collaborators: the conductor Ivan Fischer and the Budapest players, who are becoming regular and welcome visitors to New York. Mr. Schiff performs the three Bartok piano concertos over two evenings. Mr. Fischer and the orchestra fill out the programs with works of Schubert, including the Fifth and Ninth Symphonies, and more Bartok. Separate article by Vivien Schweitzer. Oct. 28-29. Carnegie Hall.
MIDORI This excellent violinist, possessed of a rare aesthetic and social sensibility, has carved out a major career on her own terms, devoting at least as much effort to education and public service as to performing. After her repertory adventures and commissioning projects of recent years, she reverts to standard fare -- works of Mozart, Schubert, Schumann and Shostakovich -- for this recital, and she should be at her communicative best in the Y's intimate hall. Ozgur Aydin is the pianist. Oct. 29. 92nd Street Y.
JONAS KAUFMANN The way cancellations have gone in recent seasons, the Met should post betting odds with its rosters. This German tenor, who has swept all before him in recent seasons at the house, is scheduled to make his New York recital debut there less than two months, it turns out, after surgery to remove a node from his chest. Helmut Deutsch is the pianist. So what are the odds? Oct. 30. Metropolitan Opera House.
ANDRAS SCHIFF AT CARNEGIE The pianist Mr. Schiff rounds out the opening volley of his Perspectives concerts with a recital in the Stern Auditorium, offering more Bartok, the Piano Sonata, along with Bach's Three-Part Inventions and Beethoven's ''Diabelli'' Variations. Separate article by Vivien Schweitzer. Oct. 31. Carnegie Hall.
IVES VIOLIN SONATAS Hilary Hahn is the latest in a line of superb active female violinists with a fiercely independent streak, not following in the footsteps of Anne-Sophie Mutter, Midori or anyone else. It is only appropriate that Ms. Hahn should alight on the music of the surly nonconformist Charles Ives. Valentina Lisitsa is the equally fine pianist on this Deutsche Grammophon release, which should do much to establish these four works in the active repertory. October.
NOVEMBER
ROBERT ASHLEY A big season for the composer Robert Ashley begins with several nights of old and new pieces performed by his associates Tom Hamilton and Thomas Buckner with a number of young players, followed by a guerrilla performance of his opera ''Perfect Lives'' by the experimental ensemble thingNY in private and public spaces on the Lower East Side. Separate article by Steve Smith. Nov. 1, 4-5. St. Mark's Church in the Bowery, 131 East 10th Street, (212) 420-1916, incubatorarts.org. Nov. 6. Various locations.
'KOYAANISQATSI' Though no expert on film, admittedly, I found this effort by Godfrey Reggio hopelessly simplistic in its lamentation of the ''life out of balance'' of the subtitle, despite its gorgeous cinematography. Some might level a similar charge against Philip Glass's music, but for me it was the best part of the film: enough to elevate it above the ordinary. The New York Philharmonic and the Philip Glass Ensemble play the score live to accompany a screening of the film, with Michael Riesman conducting. Separate article by Allan Kozinn. Nov. 2-3. Avery Fisher Hall.
PHILADELPHIA ORCHESTRA As its financial doldrums drag on and key players decamp or contemplate new positions, the orchestra waits yet another season for its new music director, Yannick Nezet-Seguin, to arrive. The stalwart Charles Dutoit continues in the interim position of chief conductor, and in a significant gesture, Mr. Nezet-Seguin has added a fourth week of subscription concerts to the three he was scheduled to conduct this season. But the dispirited ensemble needs more than gestures, and you have to wonder how long the center can hold. For his first subscription week, Mr. Nezet-Seguin offers Mozart's Symphony No. 40 and -- with the soprano Dorothea Roschmann, the baritone Matthias Goerne and the Westminster Symphonic Choir -- Brahms's ''German Requiem.'' Nov. 3-5. Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts, (215) 893-1999, philorch.org.
'SATYAGRAHA' Richard Croft returns as Gandhi in a revival of Phelim McDermott's production of this touchstone work by Philip Glass. Separate article by Allan Kozinn. Opens Nov. 4. Metropolitan Opera House.
OPERA ORCHESTRA OF NEW YORK In his first concert as the company's full-fledged music director, Alberto Veronesi conducts Cilea's ''Adriana Lecouvreur.'' The ''dream cast,'' as the company's Web site (operaorchestrany.org) calls it (wait, aren't the newly enriched Philadelphia Eagles the dream team?), is led by Angela Gheorghiu and Jonas Kaufmann: a sort of consolation prize for the Gheorghiu-Kaufmann partnership that won't be happening in the Met's ''Faust,'' even if Mr. Kaufmann has recovered from his preseason surgery by then, because of Ms. Gheorghiu's withdrawal. Nov. 8. Carnegie Hall.
'DARK SISTERS' As New York awaits a Nico Muhly opera on a large scale -- ''Two Boys,'' which opened to considerable acclaim at the English National Opera in June and is due at the Metropolitan in the 2013-14 season -- the Gotham Chamber Opera presents the premiere of one on a small scale. Set to a libretto by Stephen Karam and based in part on reports out of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, it deals with the plight of a woman trapped in a polygamous relationship and those of her sister wives. Opens Nov. 9. Gerald W. Lynch Theater, John Jay College, 899 10th Avenue, at 58th Street, (212) 279-4200, gothamchamberopera.org.
HUELGAS ENSEMBLE The White Light Festival at Lincoln Center seems to have adapted Thomas Tallis's 40-part motet, ''Spem in Alium,'' as a sort of theme song. Last year the festival, in its first season, presented an installation based on the work: an electronic deconstruction that placed listeners inside a circle of 40 speakers, each delivering mainly the sound of a single voice. Now this excellent Belgian choir, directed by Paul Van Nevel, performs the work straight, in the first of two festival concerts in more or less neighboring churches. That program, ''Utopia,'' also offers works by Gabrieli, Striggio, Brumel, Josquin and others. The second program, ''Medieval Apocalypse,'' includes works by Perotin, Machaut, Ciconia and Matteo de Perugia. Nov. 10. Fourth Universalist Church, 160 Central Park West. Nov. 12. Church of St. Mary the Virgin, 146 West 46th Street, (212) 721-6500, whitelightfestival.org.
VIENNA SYMPHONY No question, this is Vienna's other orchestra, though still in a very good league. Unlike the Vienna Philharmonic, it has a principal conductor, Fabio Luisi, whom New York is quickly getting to know as an opera maestro, now the principal conductor of the Metropolitan Opera and the presumptive heir to James Levine as music director. But the Vienna orchestras have things in common beyond their home city: for one, of the 25 or so Vienna Symphony players pictured in Lincoln Center's brochure, 2, maybe 3, are women, and fuller pictures on the orchestra's Web site (wiener-symphoniker.at) show an even smaller percentage of women. In two programs, Mr. Luisi conducts works by Beethoven (Triple Concerto), Brahms (Second Symphony), that Austrian favorite Franz Schmidt (Fourth Symphony) and Rachmaninoff (Second Piano Concerto, with Lisa de la Salle as soloist). Nov. 13-14. Avery Fisher Hall.
'KOMMILITONEN!' British eyebrows twitched when the Scottish composer Peter Maxwell Davies, a former enfant terrible, was appointed master of the queen's music in 2004. Did the queen (or whoever dispenses such honors) know what she was getting? Had Sir Peter gone soft in his knighthood (conferred in 1987)? Not entirely, it seems. ''My new opera deals with brave students who stood up for what they believed in and triggers a wonderful example of adversity,'' Mr. Davies has said of ''Kommilitonen (Young Blood!),'' which had its premiere in March at the Royal Academy of Music in London. The opera interweaves three stories of students embroiled in political activity, in Germany, China and the United States. ''At the end,'' Mr. Davies says, ''everything comes together in a great cry of freedom.'' Anne Manson conducts the Juilliard Orchestra and Juilliard Opera singers in the American premiere of the work, commissioned by the Juilliard School and the British academy. David Pountney, the librettist, directs. Nov. 16, 18, 20. Peter Jay Sharp Theater, Juilliard School.
'THAT MORNING THING' Robert Ashley's 1967 opera receives a new production as part of the Performa 11 series. Separate article by Steve Smith. Nov. 19-21. The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, (212) 255-5793, thekitchen.org.
'FAUST' Again, you have to make allowances for the pace of Jonas Kaufmann's recovery from surgery in September. Mr. Kaufmann is scheduled to take the title role here as -- in Des McAnuff's production, shared with the English National Opera -- an aging nuclear physicist in the aftermath of Hiroshima. (Other Fausts, Roberto Alagna and Joseph Calleja, are to appear later in the run in any case.) Marina Poplavskaya replaces the originally announced Angela Gheorghiu as Marguerite, and Rene Pape is a Mephistopheles not likely to be lost in the shadows. Yannick Nezet-Seguin conducts. Opens Nov. 29. Metropolitan Opera House.
DECEMBER
'MESSIAH' There is no lack of excellent performances of Handel's seasonal oratorio at Christmastime (no matter that this is not the season Handel wrote for) in New York. Kent Tritle alone will conduct two different versions on three consecutive days at Carnegie Hall (Dec. 19, the Mozart arrangement with the Oratorio Society of New York; Dec. 20 and 21, straight Handel with Musica Sacra), both eminently recommendable. But the St. Thomas Choir of Men and Boys, trained and conducted by John Scott, is generally first off the mark and often stands up as the best in the end. As always, the orchestra is the fine period-instrument Concert Royal. Dec. 6, 8. St. Thomas Church, Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street, (212) 757-7013, saintthomaschurch.org.
ELLIOTT CARTER The birthdays keep coming, and so do the compositions. The cellist Fred Sherry is organizing a concert for Mr. Carter's 103rd birthday that will include the premiere of a string trio and the American premieres of a double trio and a work called ''Trije Glasbeniki'' (''Three Musicians,'' in Slovenian). And who knows? Maybe Mr. Carter will have dashed off another piece or three for the occasion. Dec. 8. 92nd Street Y. TRINITY CHOIR And yet another run of ''Messiah'' performances. The Trinity Choir and its attendant orchestras, in their many activities for the Sept. 11 anniversary, gave considerable evidence that under Julian Wachner's directorship, they are very near the top of musical life in New York, and you can expect further proof here. Yes, I know, music may be incidental to their higher purpose, but they sure know how to pull music lovers into a church that for most of them is well out of the way. Dec. 11, 12. Trinity Church, Broadway at Wall Street, (212) 602-0800, trinitywallstreet.org. Dec. 19. Alice Tully Hall.
CONTACT! O.K., so maybe things are changing, incrementally, at the New York Philharmonic. The orchestra continues to ghettoize contemporary music in this series of concerts off premises, but it celebrates Beethoven's birthday in the quirkiest fashion imaginable (though not the most contemporary), with H. K. Gruber singing his 1977 magnum opus, ''Frankenstein!!'' Alan Gilbert conducts a program that also includes Magnus Lindberg's ''Gran Duo'' and Alexandre Lunsqui's ''Fibers, Yarn and Fabric.'' Dec. 16. Metropolitan Museum. Dec. 17. Symphony Space.
'THE ENCHANTED ISLAND' For the man who has every role: this pastiche -- cobbled together in good Baroque fashion from music of Handel, Vivaldi, Rameau and others by Jeremy Sams, who supplies his own English libretto -- gives Placido Domingo a way to expand his seemingly limitless repertory without having to resort to more baritone roles or conductorial gigs. He sings Neptune in a loose revamp of Shakespeare's ''Tempest'' and ''Midsummer Nights' Dream.'' Joyce DiDonato is Sycorax; Danielle de Niese, Ariel; David Daniels, Prospero. William Christie conducts, and Phelim McDermott directs. This confection may be just frothy enough for New Year's Eve. How it will stand up on long, cold, punishing nights in January and February remains to be seen. Opens Dec. 31. Metropolitan Opera House.
JANUARY
GREEN MOUNTAIN PROJECTPerformances of Monteverdi's 1610 Vespers by this group, built around Jolle Greenleaf's vocal ensemble Tenet, at the Church of St. Mary the Virgin were highlights of the New York season for two Januarys running. Now, evidently trusting that the third outing will be an even greater charm, the project is relocating and expanding, with a second performance in New York and a third in Cambridge, Mass. It is also deepening its explorations, this time presenting what it calls ''Vespers of 1640,'' combining music from Monteverdi's ''Selva Morale e Spirituale'' with works of Giovanni Gabrieli. Jan. 3-4. Church of St. Jean Baptiste, 184 East 76th Street. Jan. 7. St. Paul's Church, Cambridge, (646) 470-5809, tenetnyc.com.
MAHLER PROJECT Gustavo Dudamel conducts all the Mahler symphonies in just over three weeks: Nos. 1, 4, 6, 9 and 10 (Adagio) with the Los Angeles Philharmonic; Nos. 2, 3, 5 and 7 with the Simon Bolivar Symphony Orchestra (formerly Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra) of Venezuela; No. 8 (''Symphony of a Thousand'') with both orchestras. For good measure, in the first program -- alongside the Fourth Symphony, with the soprano Miah Persson as soloist -- Mr. Dudamel throws in the ''Lieder Eines Fahrenden Gesellen,'' sung by Thomas Hampson. Then, with all that behind them, the Los Angeles players will follow Mr. Dudamel and the Venezuelans to Caracas, where they will perform the symphony cycle again in mid-February. Jan. 13-15 (also Jan. 19-21, 22, 24, 26-29, 31; Feb. 2-5). Walt Disney Concert Hall, Shrine Auditorium (No. 8), Los Angeles, (323) 850-2000, laphil.com.
MUSIC OF TEREZIN Will to Create, Will to Live is an interdisciplinary series of concerts, films, exhibits and lectures focusing on artists who, in the Y's description, ''during World War II faced the horrors of incarceration and death yet managed to persevere and raise their voices.'' The Nash Ensemble of Britain presents three programs, sharing two of them with the baritone Wolfgang Holzmair and the pianist Russell Ryan. Another pianist, Shai Wosner, accompanies Mr. Holzmair in a fourth concert. Jan. 17, 19, 21, 23. 92nd Street Y.
THOMAS HAMPSON Much of the Met Museum's concert programming this season is tied to exhibitions or openings of galleries. In this case, to greet the New American Wing Galleries for Paintings, Sculpture and Decorative Arts, which opens on Jan. 16, the estimable baritone Mr. Hampson continues his multiyear project ''Song of America,'' performing works of Copland, Barber, Ives, Thomson and others in the American Wing, with Craig Rutenberg as pianist. Jan. 22. Metropolitan Museum.
'GOTTERDAMMERUNG' And now that Robert Lepage has constructed his wondrous technological contraption of a Wagner ''Ring'' cycle, it is time for it all to come crashing down. Even in lower-tech productions, the final conflagration has occasionally produced moments of actual physical danger for some on stage. (Hildegard Behrens was decked by a stray beam at the Met in 1990.) Enough has already gone wrong with the current mechanisms, and enough pratfalls have occurred on the monstrous set, that a shiver of real fear may accompany the illusion of Valhalla's collapse. This will also be the time to check in on James Levine's recovery, since he now projects these performances as his return to the podium. Opens Jan. 27. Metropolitan Opera House.
FOCUS! FESTIVAL On one hand, this contemporary-music event's focus is narrower than usual, since it centers on a single composer, John Cage, in honor of his centenary. On the other hand, Cage was in some ways the least focused of composers, ranging restlessly through musical styles and the sounds of silence, and venturing into the worlds of literature, dance and visual art. The festival will touch mostly on the musical manifestations and will touch on other American composers in performances by the New Juilliard Ensemble and the Juilliard Percussion Ensemble. Jan. 27-Feb. 3. Peter Jay Sharp Theater, Paul Hall, Juilliard School; Alice Tully Hall.
KAYHAN KALHOR Here is another concert at the Met Museum inspired by a new display space, in this case the New Galleries for the Art of the Arab Lands, Turkey, Iran, Central Asia and Later South Asia, which opens on Nov. 1. No one familiar with the Iranian Mr. Kalhor's emotionally rich yet superbly nuanced playing of the kamancheh (a Persian spike fiddle) -- and many Westerners are familiar with it, thanks especially to Yo-Yo Ma's Silk Road Project -- will want to miss this evening of traditional Persian music. (Mr. Kalhor's latest recording, ''I Will Not Stand Alone,'' is to be released by World Village in connection with the concert.) Jan. 28. Metropolitan Museum.
'RIENZI' When Eve Queler gave up the music directorship of the Opera Orchestra of New York in the spring, she left some business unfinished. In the 2008-9 season, the company, hit hard by the recession, had to cancel a concert performance of this early Wagner opera, which it had made something of a specialty over the decades. It promised the work for the next season but is only now catching up. Ms. Queler, as music director laureate, conducts the New York Choral Society and a cast including Ian Storey and Elisabete Matos. Jan. 29. Avery Fisher Hall.
AMERICAN COMPOSERS ORCHESTRA With ''Koyaanisqatsi'' and ''Satyagraha'' already out of the way, there continues to be a lot of music by Philip Glass this season, much of it in connection with his 75th birthday. The performance here, the American premiere of his Ninth Symphony, hits the birthday right on the nose. Dennis Russell Davies, a longtime Glass champion, conducts a program that also includes the New York premiere of Arvo Part's ''Lamentate.'' Separate article by Allan Kozinn. Jan. 31. Carnegie Hall.
FEBRUARY
MET + JUILLIARD Two years ago in this space, through a slip of the brain, I attributed the ''Armida'' being presented by the Metropolitan Opera to Gluck rather than Rossini. Now I can properly welcome Gluck's ''Armide,'' which in fact was performed in concert in that 2009-10 season, by Opera Lafayette, and which Anthony Tommasini called ''a seemingly flawless masterpiece'' in The New York Times It will be jointly presented here by the Met and the Juilliard School in a semistaging directed by Fabrizio Melano. Jane Glover conducts the Juilliard Orchestra and singers from the Met's young artist development program and Juilliard's institute for vocal arts. Feb. 8, 11. Peter Jay Sharp Theater, Juilliard School.
IMMORTAL INVESTMENTS The good thing about a festival devoted to, say, Tchaikovsky or Oswald von Wolkenstein, is that you have a pretty good idea what you're going to get. With the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center's high-concept fall festival, Dedications (Mozart dedicated to Haydn, Schumann dedicated to Mendelssohn; Nov. 4, 6), and its higher-concept winter festival here, the title tells you little. ''Immortal investments'' refers to patronage, tributes and commissions. So there are Haydn and Beethoven quartets commissioned by Prince Lobkowitz; works by the mutual admirers Joachim and Brahms; music by Stravinsky, Debussy, Faure and others associated with salons hosted by the Princesse de Polignac; and pieces by Ravel, Bartok, Poulenc and Copland commissioned by Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge. It all fits into a season-long theme of synergy: a tough one for a marketing department to wrap its cliches around. Feb. 10; 12; 24; 26, 28. Alice Tully Hall.
'LA TRAVIATA' The newly nomadic New York City Opera finally opens its season of full productions. On a recent visit to The New York Times, administrators of the Brooklyn Academy of Music made clear that they were happy to provide a home for City Opera performances, but only if the presentations jibe with Brooklyn Academy's own programming philosophy. Verdi's war horse, for example, might not otherwise have qualified, but the director of this new production (with scenery and costumes created for the Glimmerglass Opera and the Vancouver Opera) is Jonathan Miller, whose work has generally played well at the house. Laquita Mitchell sings the title role, David Pomeroy is Alfredo, and Steven White conducts. Opens Feb. 12. BAM Howard Gilman Opera House.
CHICAGO SYMPHONY IN SAN FRANCISCO The two programs, conducted by Riccardo Muti, will be performed in Chicago first, but here they are part of an American Orchestra Series the San Francisco Symphony is presenting to celebrate its centennial. It has invited six major ensembles to perform two concerts each, including works they have commissioned. Chicago presents works by its composers in residence, Mason Bates's ''Alternative Energy'' (with Honegger's ''Pacific 231'' and Franck's Symphony in D minor) and Anna Clynes's ''Night Ferry'' (with Schubert's Ninth Symphony and an entr'acte from his incidental music for ''Rosamunde''). Other orchestras participating are the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Boston Symphony, the Cleveland Orchestra, the New York Philharmonic and the Philadelphia Orchestra, Feb. 14, 15. Davies Symphony Hall, San Francisco, (415) 864-6000, sfsymphony.org.
'PRIMA DONNA' When challenged recently as to why, with only four productions to spare this season, the scaled-down New York City Opera would stake so much on a Rufus Wainwright opera that even some of Mr. Wainwright's staunchest admirers found wanting at its premiere in Manchester, England, in 2009, George Steel, City Opera's general manager and artistic director, rose to a spirited defense. ''It's a beautiful and remarkably accomplished work,'' he said, ''a love letter to French opera. It's never been performed in the United States, and it's precisely the kind of thing City Opera ought to perform.'' The Brooklyn Academy's administrators seem to agree. The rest will be history, of one sort or another. Opens Feb. 19. BAM Howard Gilman Opera House.
ERIK OWENS This bass-baritone turned the seemingly thankless role of Alberich in Wagner's ''Rheingold'' into a star vehicle last season. And now -- in addition to singing Alberich this season in ''Rheingold,'' ''Siegfried'' and ''Gotterdammerung'' -- Mr. Owens does what stars do, taking over the stage for a solo recital. The program includes works by Schubert, Schumann, Wolf, Debussy, Duparc, Ravel and, yes, Wagner; and the pianist, in a bit of glamour casting, is the conductor Robert Spano. Feb. 21. Zankel Hall.
BERLIN PHILHARMONIC When last heard in Carnegie, in 2009, Simon Rattle and this great orchestra had to compete with sounds intruding from a concert of Cape Verdean music in Zankel Hall. Carnegie seems to have ironed out that wrinkle in its programming strategy and made the world safe for pianissimos again. Of those there will be many (often opposite mighty fortissimos), in Debussy's ''Prelude a l'Apres-Midi d'un Faune,'' Schoenberg's ''Verklarte Nacht'' and Elgar's ''Enigma Variations'' on the first night; a completion of Bruckner's Ninth Symphony on the second; and Mahler's ''Resurrection'' Symphony on the third. Feb. 23-25. Carnegie Hall.
TUNE-IN MUSIC FESTIVAL This event, in its second season, is one of many celebrations of Philip Glass's 75th birthday and includes a performance of the huge and seminal Music in 12 Parts. Separate article by Allan Kozinn. Feb. 23-26. Park Avenue Armory, 643 Park Avenue, at 67th Street, (212) 616-3930, armoryonpark.org.
MARCH
THE MODERN BEETHOVEN You don't need much of a pretext to sell a Beethoven festival to your marketing department, especially at the New York Philharmonic. David Zinman conducts the orchestra in all the master's symphonies except the Fifth (say, what?), the Sixth (presented earlier in the season) and the Ninth, interspersed with 20th-century concertos of sorts by Stravinsky, Barber and Karl Amadeus Hartmann. Beethoven's Second and Seventh and Stravinsky's Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra lead off. Expect brisk tempos from Mr. Zinman, one who supports the notion that Beethoven's metronome marks, disputed over the centuries, were probably what he wanted after all. March 1-3, 6 (also March, 8, 10, 13; 15-17, 20). Avery Fisher Hall.
VIENNA PHILHARMONIC As New Yorkers well know, if only from his tenure with their Philharmonic, Lorin Maazel can be an exasperating conductor, given to overcontrolling mannerisms. But he can also be deeply satisfying in certain repertory, and he has often proved so in Sibelius. The first of these three concerts, with Sibelius's First, Fifth and Seventh Symphonies, could well be a knockout. And to whatever extent Mr. Maazel just lets this magnificent band play, the other programs should hold many rewards, too, with Mozart's Symphony No. 40 and Mr. Maazel's own Wagner arrangement, ''The Ring Without Words,'' on Saturday evening and works by Richard Strauss and the Johann Strausses on Sunday afternoon. March 2-4. Carnegie Hall.
KAIJA SAARIAHO Ms. Saariaho, who occupies the composer's chair at Carnegie Hall this season, will be represented in concerts by the Finnish Avanti! Chamber Ensemble (Nov. 30), the St. Louis Symphony (March 10) and the Cleveland Orchestra (May 23). And with the cellist Anssi Kartunen, she will conduct a professional training workshop for composers and solo string players. Here she is featured in Carnegie's Making Music series with a program of her works performed by the French vocal ensemble Solistes XXI. March 5. Zankel Hall.
BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Before three Carnegie concerts by the orchestra in March, there was a last-minute scramble to find replacement conductors for James Levine after his cancellation for health reasons. Around the same time, for the same reasons, Mr. Levine gave up the music directorship of the orchestra, which thus had plenty of time to find replacements for this season. They are Kurt Masur (himself seemingly in parlous health) in Beethoven's ''Missa Solemnis,'' Christoph Eschenbach in a program of Berlioz and Ravel, and Stephane Deneve in works by Ravel, Stravinsky and Shostakovich. March 6-7, 9. Carnegie Hall.
PIATIGORSKY INTERNATIONAL CELLO FESTIVAL The American cellist Ralph Kirshbaum, long resident in London, founded the respected Manchester International Cello Festival at the Royal Northern College of Music in 1988, which ran at two- or three-year intervals, and oversaw it to its end, in 2007. Mr. Kirshbaum has since moved to Los Angeles, where he teaches at the University of Southern California and now unveils a successor event, a partnership involving the university's music school, the Colburn School and the Los Angeles Philharmonic. More than 20 noted cellists are scheduled to appear, and 6 of them will divvy up the Bach solo suites in a single evening (March 11). Three will perform concertos in Philharmonic concerts conducted by Neeme Jarvi in the Walt Disney Concert Hall: Mr. Kirshbaum in the Dvorak Concerto (March 15), Mischa Maisky in the Shostakovich First (March 17) and Alisa Weilerstein in Tchaikovsky's ''Rococo'' Variations and Respighi's ''Adagio con Variazioni'' (March 18). March 9-18. Various locations in Los Angeles, (213) 740-3129, usc.edu/piatigorsky--festival.
L'ARPEGGIATA Carnegie Hall bestows the honor of a Perspectives series on an early-music group for the first time. And it does so to performers who made their North American debut just last fall, in Zankel Hall, and are known in this country almost solely through recordings. But those recordings are impressive, as were reports on the Zankel concert, which The New York Times didn't manage to cover on a typically hectic October evening of performances. March promises to be the other busy month this season, but it will be hard to miss this lineup of four programs, which bring those recordings to life and will undoubtedly add novelties and surprises, for they appear to be rich in the group's trademark quasi-jazz improvisations. The repertory reflects its specialty in early-17th-century French and Italian music. Christina Pluhar, a lutenist and harpist, is the artistic director. March 14-17. Zankel Hall, Weill Recital Hall.
AMSTERDAM BAROQUE ORCHESTRA AND CHOIR You may think you know nothing of Bach's Cantata No. 147 (''Herz und Mund und Tat und Leben''), but if you know the tune ''Jesu Joy of Man's Desiring,'' you're two chorales ahead of the game. And if you don't know Bach's spectacular and wonderfully compact Magnificat, you're in for a second huge treat. All that -- and another cantata, ''Du Hirte Israel, Hore'' (No. 104) -- by expert performers, led by Ton Koopman. Not to be missed. March 15. Alice Tully Hall.
CALLAS ON FILM You saw ''Master Class,'' with Tyne Daly if not before. You've read about charisma, courtesy of Zachary Woolfe in The New York Times. Now see and hear Maria Callas in action (insofar as the technology of the era allowed) in Alain Ferrari's 1978 documentary ''Vissi d'Arte,'' a film of a 1959 Hamburg concert and a selection of clips of the diva in conversation and on stage. March 17-18. Walter Reade Theater.
'COSI FAN TUTTE' Christopher Alden, who directed an acclaimed production of ''Don Giovanni'' at the New York City Opera in 2009, continues his survey of the Mozart operas to librettos by Lorenzo Da Ponte. Separate article by Zachary Woolfe. Opens March 18. Gerald W. Lynch Theater, John Jay College, 899 10th Avenue, at 58th Street, (212) 870-5600, nycopera.com.
'ST. JOHN PASSION' A Bach Passion can rise (or fall) on the strength (or weakness) of the tenor singing the Evangelist. Bernard Labadie's expert performances of Handel's ''Messiah'' and Bach's ''Christmas Oratorio'' at Carnegie Hall with his Violons du Roy and Chapelle de Quebec in 2009 would have raised expectations for another major outing in any case, despite some suspect work by vocal soloists. But here Mr. Labadie and his forces have the inestimable advantage of -- to judge from recordings, at least -- a great Evangelist, the English tenor Ian Bostridge. And if Mr. Bostridge is not the best Bach Evangelist at work today, then it can only be the English-German tenor Rufus Muller. New Yorkers have the remarkable opportunity to hear them both in the ''St. John'' within less than a week. Mr. Muller, who performs the work with the St. Thomas Choir of Men and Boys and the period-instrument Concert Royal, conducted by John Scott, has so internalized the role that he sings it from memory. Unable to choose between them, I choose to hear both. Labadie-Bostridge, March 25. Carnegie Hall. Scott-Muller, March 30. St. Thomas Church, Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street, (212) 757-7013, saintthomaschurch.org.
'MANON' And here is Anna Netrebko in another new production. New to the Met that is. Laurent Pelly's staging of Massenet's opera originated at the Royal Opera in London, where, according to one quaintly mixed metaphor in the British press, it ''triggered'' a ''shower of plaudits.'' The cast also includes Piotr Beczala and Paulo Szot, and Fabio Luisi conducts. Opens March 26. Metropolitan Opera House.
AMERICAN MAVERICKS Michael Tilson Thomas and the San Francisco Symphony return to a concept they developed in 2000, presenting music by strong-willed Americans of the 20th and now 21st centuries, this time transporting it to New York as well. The Carnegie series opens (after a few neighborhood concerts) with a celebration of John Cage, in honor of his centenary, by So Percussion. Then the orchestra chimes in -- in whole (Varese's ''Ameriques'') or in part (Steve Reich's ''Six Marimbas'') -- with four programs of music by American pioneers (Ives, Cowell, Ruggles, Partch) and latter-day settlers (John Adams, David Del Tredici, Mason Bates, Meredith Monk). March 26-30. Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall.
APRIL
'DER RING DES NIBELUNGEN' Unless the climactic conflagration of ''Gotterdammerung'' has by now swallowed up Robert Lepage's mighty machine along with all Valhalla, the Met will stretch the four operas of its new Wagner ''Ring'' cycle end to end for the first time, then a second and a third. Next comes the question of its future. Once you know all the technological tricks, will you want to see the thing again? True, hearing it -- with James Levine's splendid orchestra and a generally fine cast -- is something else, and since the production undoubtedly cost too much even to contemplate scrapping it quickly, seeing it again will undoubtedly be the price operagoers have to pay to hear ''The Ring'' here again anytime soon. Mr. Levine's future should also be clearer by now. He is scheduled to conduct all three cycles, but from this distance the notion that he could muster the necessary strength and stamina seems a forlorn hope. Then again, any hope is better than none. Opens April 7. Metropolitan Opera House.
MITSUKO UCHIDA This superb pianist plays the three great posthumous sonatas of Schubert (D. 958-60), and I can only repeat much of what I said two seasons ago, when she played the three last sonatas of Beethoven: Ms. Uchida, who does so many things well, is typically at her best when plumbing the philosophical depths of late works by composers like Beethoven and Schubert, and I, for one, ache to hear her play an evening of the ineffable late piano works of Brahms, miniature in form but vast in expressive content. That, clearly, remains for another day. Meanwhile, we can only welcome Ms. Uchida's latest thoughts on Schubert; her earlier thoughts, on Philips recordings, were already remarkable. April 11. Carnegie Hall.
ORCHESTRA OF ST LUKE'S The versatile maestro Ivan Fisher scored many points as a Mozartean this summer at Lincoln Center's Mostly Mozart Festival, directing as well as conducting a concert staging of ''Don Giovanni'' and leading a program of the ''Jupiter'' Symphony and sacred works, early and late. Here he offers a variation on that concert, with Mozart's Symphony No. 34 (in C, like the ''Jupiter'') and the unfinished Requiem, with the orchestra joined by Musica Sacra and vocal soloists. April 12. Carnegie Hall.
FASIL SAY Some prominent features of recent Met Museum seasons seem to have gone by the board, at least for this transitional year, like the series of piano recitals in the Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium. The outing here, by a sometimes quirky but compelling pianist, in works by Janacek and Prokofiev and music of his own, should be fascinating. It had better be, since that's pretty much it for the season. April 20. Metropolitan Museum.
'GHOSTS OF VERSAILLES' In an ambitious undertaking, the Manhattan School of Music Opera Theater presents a major opera by John Corigliano, who studied composition at the school as a graduate student and taught composition there from 1971 to 1991. The work was commissioned by the Metropolitan Opera (in days when the Met wasn't doing much of that sort of thing) and given its premiere there in 1991. Jay Lesenger directs, and Steven Osgood conducts. April 25, 27, 29. Borden Auditorium, Manhattan School of Music, 120 Claremont Avenue, (917) 493-4428, msmnyc.edu.
MAY
ANDRAS SCHIFF AT ZANKEL For his second Perspectives recital, Mr. Schiff adds contemporary composers, Gyorgy Kurtag and Jorg Widmann, to his earlier three B's (Bach, Beethoven and Bartok) in a program of miniatures. Separate article by Vivien Schweitzer. May 2. Zankel Hall.
SPRING FOR MUSIC This festival, wisely placed at a time of year when the concert season has started to slow, generated considerable attention in its first outing last May and great excitement for several North American orchestras that had seldom if ever played in Carnegie Hall. In the festival's second season, the Alabama Symphony Orchestra, based in Birmingham and conducted by Justin Brown, and the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra of Alberta, conducted by William Eddins, will make their Carnegie Hall debuts. Also appearing are the Houston Symphony, the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra, the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra and the Nashville Symphony. Since the choices were made on the basis of innovative programming ideas and tickets are priced at $25, the potential rewards far outweigh the risks. May 7-12. Carnegie Hall.
'ORPHEUS' The New York City Opera has played no small part in the Handel opera revival of recent decades. Now, in a season in which the newly nomadic company looks to extend its traditions with any number of twists, it turns its Baroque attentions to Telemann, a composer steeped in a German style less influenced by the Italian than Handel's. Those unfamiliar with the work -- almost everyone, surely -- would do well to bone up with Rene Jacobs's recording of it on Harmonia Mundi. The baritone Daniel Teadt sings the title role in an auditorium said by some who know it to be acoustically and atmospherically ideal for Baroque opera. Opens May 12. Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, (212) 870-5600, nycopera.com.
CHRISTIAN TETZLAFF When a performer sells you on a work that used to seem intractable, you remember. For me, hearing Mr. Tetzlaff play Schoenberg's Violin Concerto with Christoph von Dohnanyi and the Cleveland Orchestra in 1988 was such an experience. Here Mr. Tetzlaff plays the Schoenberg with the Met Orchestra, still scheduled to be conducted by James Levine, and for most violinists, that would be more than enough exertion for a day. But Mr. Tetzlaff also throws in Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto in E minor and Mozart's Adagio in E (K. 261). Truly, what does he do for an encore? May 20. Carnegie Hall.
CLEVELAND ORCHESTRA Franz Welser-Most, who may have won new fans in New York with his performances of Bruckner and John Adams at the Lincoln Center Festival this summer, would like you to know that -- now the general music director of the Vienna State Opera -- he can also be a formidable opera conductor. The second program here is a blockbuster: a concert performance of Strauss's ''Salome,'' with the fast-rising dramatic soprano Nina Stemme in the title role, Eric Owens as Jochanaan and an orchestra starrier than either. The first program is as multifaceted as the second is single-minded, offering Brahms's Second Piano Concerto, with Yefim Bronfman as soloist; Shostakovich's Sixth Symphony; and the New York premiere of Kaija Saariaho's ''Laterna Magica.'' May 23-24. Carnegie Hall.
'THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO THE OTHER MARY' Here, in its premiere, is another in a line of evening-length oratorios that John Adams began with ''El Nino,'' based on the nativity of Jesus, in 2000. This one takes off from Jesus' Passion and incorporates the story of Lazarus. Peter Sellars produced the libretto, using writings of the Mexican poet Rosario Castellanos, Dorothy Day, Louise Erdich and June Jordan. Gustavo Dudamel conducts the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Los Angeles Master Chorale and soloists including three countertenors, who carry the narration. May 31; June 1-3. Walt Disney Concert Hall, Los Angeles, (323) 850-2000, laphil.com.
JUNE
'SINFONIA ESPANSIVA' Alan Gilbert continues to work his way through the symphonies of Carl Nielsen with the New York Philharmonic, here adding the Third. Mr. Gilbert and the orchestra are recording the symphonies and concertos for the Danish label Dacapo. The Third will be released with the Second, performed last January, in the first release, next fall, and the project is to run to 2015. ''I'm sure Nielsen's time has now come,'' Mr. Gilbert has said, and high time, though whatever neglect Nielsen's music may have suffered over the decades has not been for lack of excellent recordings. Here's hoping that Mr. Gilbert has whatever touch or timing is needed to make the difference. June 14-16. Avery Fisher Hall.
PHILHARMONIC AT THE ARMORY Kurt Masur, as music director of the New York Philharmonic in the 1990s, had his eye for a time on the Park Avenue Armory as a site for a series of summer concerts akin to the BBC Proms concerts in the vast Royal Albert Hall in London. Well, there's no series yet, but here is a program that takes his idea and walks with it. Alan Gilbert conducts, joined by two other maestros, Magnus Lindberg and Matthias Pintscher, as needed, since the main attraction is Karlheinz Stockhausen's ''Gruppen'' (''Groups''), which divides the ensemble into three separate orchestras playing simultaneously and at odds with one another. The program also includes works by Ives, Pierre Boulez and Mozart. Mozart? The Act I finale from ''Don Giovanni'' was chosen, presumably, because Mozart uses three little bands playing competing dance tunes at the same time. Now can we expand on this delightful escapade? And invite Mr. Masur back to conduct in the next outing? June 29-30. Park Avenue Armory, 643 Park Avenue, at 67th Street, (212) 875-5656, nyphil.org.

HEADLINE: Meetings on European Debt Crisis End in Debate, but Little Progress

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE

 BODY:
WROCLAW, Poland -- European finance ministers ended a two-day meeting here Saturday without making substantial progress toward solving the region's debt crisis, or any pledge to recapitalize Europe's banks.
The meetings were highlighted by the appearance by Timothy F. Geithner, the United States treasury secretary, whose advice, and warnings, drew a tepid reaction from the euro zone's finance ministers. And Mr. Geithner's rejection Friday of a European idea for a global tax on financial transactions prompted a debate about whether Europe should go ahead on its own.
Meanwhile, with an October deadline looming for international lenders to agree to the release of around 8 billion euros, or $11 billion, of aid to Greece, without which it could default on its debt, George Papandreou, the Greek prime minister, canceled a trip to the United States. 
''The coming week is particularly critical for the implementation of the July 21 decisions in the euro area and the initiatives which the country must undertake,'' Mr. Papandreou said in a statement on Saturday.
The attendance of an American official at Friday's meeting was unusual, and Jacek Rostowski, the finance minister of Poland who invited Mr. Geithner, said it showed ''unity within the transatlantic family.''
That glossed over the grumbling about Mr. Geithner's comments from several European ministers Friday, including Maria Fekter of Austria, who publicly said she was unimpressed with Mr. Geithner's contribution.
Yet the American plea for urgent decisions to shore up the euro zone was echoed Saturday by two European ministers whose nations have stayed outside the single currency.
''The euro zone leaders know that time is running out, that they need to deliver a solution to the uncertainty in the markets,'' said George Osborne, Britain's chancellor of the Exchequer, who told the BBC he wanted action over Greece and the ''weakness'' in Europe's banking system.
''The problem is that the politicians seem to be behind the curve all the time,'' added Anders Borg, Sweden's finance minister. ''We really need to see some more political leadership,'' he said, citing a ''clear need for bank recapitalization.''
Almost two months after a deal was struck on a second bailout of Greece, Finland is holding up its implementation by requesting collateral for new loans -- a demand that has complicated the negotiations.
Meanwhile, the Greek government must still convince international lenders that it has done enough to justify the release of the next round of aid.
One European official, not authorized to speak publicly, said the ministers ''seemed to come to no operational decisions at all.'' The only positive news was an outline agreement on new laws to tighten the rulebook for the euro -- though that was struck in Brussels.
Saturday's meeting ended promptly around noon, allowing ministers to leave before a demonstration in Wroclaw against austerity measures in Europe.
But Mr. Geithner's contribution continued to reverberate after his departure on Friday. Though there was no discussion of it in detail, his idea of increasing the firepower of the 440 billion euro ($608 billion) bailout fund through leverage -- as the United States did in some programs in 2008 -- prompted debate, but not consensus.
Some European countries consider such a financial transaction tax a way of ensuring that the financial sector contribute to ending the crisis, but others oppose it.
After Mr. Geithner's comments, Belgium's finance minister, Didier Reynders, called for Europeans to press ahead.
''I'm sure that if it's impossible at the worldwide level, we'll need to organize that in the E.U. and at least in the euro zone, but of course with a lower level of taxation in one jurisdiction than on the worldwide level,'' he said.
Mr. Borg ruled out Swedish participation. ''We have substantial experience in Sweden,'' he said. ''Basically most of our derivative and bond trading went to London during the years we had a financial transaction tax, so if you don't get a solution that is universal, it is very likely to be detrimental for European financial markets.''

HEADLINE: Fathers and the XX-Factor

BYLINE: By ALEX WILLIAMS

 BODY:
SCIENCE confirmed last week what A. J. Jacobs had already feared.
''I knew that my testosterone was at a low point when I found myself wearing my wife's polka-dotted breast-feeding pillow strapped around my waist in an attempt to feed a bottle of milk to my infant son,'' said Mr. Jacobs, a writer who lives in Manhattan with his wife and three young children.
He and new fathers everywhere were calibrating the state of their manhood after the release of a much-discussed study of 600 men that indicated that testosterone -- the defining hormone of maleness -- drops after a man becomes a father.
If that were not enough, the study seems to suggest that practice actually makes imperfect when it comes to the hours men spend in rearing children. It found that the more time a man spends each day, say, strapping Crocs onto his toddler's feet or helping her off the monkey bars, the more the hormone flags. 
In a Mr. Mom era, where society encourages (and family schedules often demand) that men enthusiastically embrace a 50-50 split of every parenting duty short of breast-feeding, the question on many fathers' minds is whether all of their efforts to be the ideal contemporary man are also making them less of one.
''A study like this implies you are scientifically less manly just when you'd like to think you've hit a new plateau of manhood,'' said Robert Fahey, an online auto salesman in Burlington, Mass., whose second son was born this month. ''You've spread your seed, so to speak, and joined the ranks of your own father.''
Now, he lamented, ''not only are you a dork when you lapse into goo-goo talk, but now you're less of a man scientifically.''
As soon as the findings were released, fathers were tweeting them to friends and posting links on their Facebook walls, inviting comment. On playgrounds before work, and likely in bars after, men wondered: Does their inner Hemingway come with a built-in ''off'' switch that is activated the first time they empty a Diaper Dekor?
There was, to be sure, a certain macho indignation at the suggestion. ''I don't find myself to be less of a man because I change diapers and can make a bottle in the dark,'' said Jason Maloni, a Washington father of a daughter, 3, and a son, 1.
''Just because our hormones shift a little doesn't mean we're going to grow breasts,'' added Josh Kross, of New York, whose three children are under the age of 7.
''There was a time -- not too long ago -- when I was wild and unfettered. Dare I say riddled with testosterone,'' John Cave Osborne wrote in a column on Babble, a Web site for hip young parents. Reminiscing about alcohol-fueled tailgate parties and five-day backpacking trips, he confessed that he no longer had the energy for such he-man carousing, thanks to having four children under the age of 4. ''But it still never occurred to me that these rug rats were robbing me of my testosterone. My manliness.
''I'm tired,'' Mr. Osborne concluded. ''But I've not morphed into a woman, for crying out loud.''
Such newfound identity crises come at a challenging time for fathers. Economic pressures mean that both parents are often forced to work longer hours and manage more stress. Yet, if anything, the social obligation to be a hands-on Superdad is greater than ever. Even President Obama ducks out of the Oval Office to show up on the sidelines of his daughters' soccer games.
''There is a greater cultural emphasis on men who are actively involved in child care than there was a generation ago,'' said Adam Mansbach, the author of ''Go the -------- to Sleep,'' the best-selling satirical children's book that became a new bible for weary parents. Mr. Mansbach himself is a 35-year-old father of a 3-year-old daughter. ''There's very different expectation: The amount of time you spend with the kids, the relationship you have with your kids -- fundamentally, that work is not a valid excuse for not spending time with or having a strong relationship with your kids.''
At the same time, the image of the perfect American father, 2011-style, seems fuzzier than ever. The classic pop-culture archetypes -- silver-templed sages in cardigan sweaters (Ward Cleaver, Cliff Huxtable) -- seem as outmoded as rabbit ears in an era where fathers would rather act like their children's best friend than square-jawed authority figures.
Today's Generations X and Y dads are closer in spirit to Will Arnett in the new NBC situation comedy ''Up All Night''-- potty-mouthed guys in pocket T-shirts and stubble. They exchange bro-hugs with their children and dream of someday outshredding them on the snowboard slopes. Overgrown boys themselves, they may not feel ready for the responsibilities of co-parenting, but they feel obligated to fake it mightily.
And now this? Forget about playing the eternal dude, Dad, you have even less mojo than you thought. And it is not just the accumulated exhaustion of all those 5 a.m. wake-ups.
Mr. Jacobs is also a humorist by profession, and the best he could hope for was to turn the dispiriting finding into a punch line. He had his worst suspicions confirmed when he visited a urologist while researching his coming book, ''Drop Dead Healthy: One Man's Humble Quest for Bodily Perfection,'' in which he chronicles his attempts to become the healthiest man alive. Tests showed lower-than-normal testosterone, and the doctor suggested hormone-replacement therapy.
''When the doctor said he wanted to raise my testosterone, he told me that it would boost my libido,'' he recalled. ''And I said: 'That's not appealing at all. What exactly would I do with that extra libido? I'm a new dad with an overtired wife. That doesn't help anybody.' ''
Also, many new fathers are having to confront this exhausting double whammy (feeling overwhelmed, yet lacking physical verve) at a time when it seems socially unacceptable to vent. Women, in the common view, enjoy a greater freedom to spout off to friends about the crushing pressures of trying to ''have it all'' (that is, juggle it all). A vast and highly active Web of mommy blogs, books and even movies, like the new Sarah Jessica Parker film ''I Don't Know How She Does It,'' exists as a support network.
Many men still feel an expectation to keep a stiff upper lip, a vestige of the days when the authoritarian father rarely let slip any admission of frailty, perhaps because he had a pipe clenched between his teeth.
But maybe men are finally starting to close the gap. The testosterone study inspired crackling debate on the many fatherhood blogs cropping up. And in support and social groups like NYC Dads Group, which has more than 400 members, many men dissected the findings with one another and looked to the study's more positive aspects to reassure themselves that they were strong, contemporary fathers.
''It's a natural process,'' Matt Schneider, a stay-at-home father of two young children who lives in Battery Park City in Manhattan, said of the testosterone dip reported in the study. The finding, he said, was unfortunately being interpreted by some ''as a way to emasculate men, when really it should be used as a way to show us all that we're meant to be part of the caregiving process.''
That, in fact, was a point that the study's authors emphasized: a dip in testosterone does not mean a man is less virile. Rather, it seems to be nature's way of slightly adjusting impulses, to make him less likely to stray once he has a family to look after, and more likely to focus on the tasks at hand. (The much-deliberated relationship of testosterone to ''manly'' behavior became a raucous side debate in the days after the study's release.)
Mr. Kross, a member of the NYC Dads Group, said he hoped that such findings might signal a watershed moment when people finally ditch the lingering stereotype that men, at some deep biological level, are inherently inferior at child-rearing. He said attitudes have shifted in the two years since he and his wife, who works in finance, decided that he would spend the days taking care of the children while she served as the breadwinner, despite the fact that he has an M.B.A. in operations management.
''It's been dramatic,'' Mr. Kross said. ''It's changed from the biggest concern being, 'Can you really manage to do that?' to people saying, 'Wow, you can actually can do that.' Most of the wives I've met say, 'Yeah, he's at least as good as me at being the caretaker.' ''
Such thinking was evident outside the sensitive-male breeding grounds of New York City, too. Robert Saxton, a father of three in Bemidji, Minn., met the study's findings with a shrug.
''Manhood is measured in so many ways,'' he said. ''That's easy for me to say, I reckon: you are conversing with a guy who bow-hunts, fishes, plays hockey and used a chain saw just hours ago, so I guess I feel pretty secure.''

HEADLINE: The South Ain't Just Whistlin' Dixie

BYLINE: By KAREN L. COX. 
The public editor is off today

 BODY:
Karen L. Cox is an associate professor of history at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte, and the author of ''Dreaming of Dixie: How the South Was Created in American Popular Culture.''
Charlotte, N.C.
IF you go by the sheer number of programs and casting calls, reality television has become thoroughly Dixiefied. Whether it's Lifetime's ''Glamour Belles,'' truTV's ''Lizard Lick Towing'' or CMT's ''Sweet Home Alabama,'' series purporting to show a slice of Southern life are huge, and getting bigger: more than a dozen new programs have been introduced so far this year, while others have been renewed for second or even third seasons.
Such shows promise new insight into Southern culture, but what they really represent is a typecast South: a mythically rural, white, poorly educated and thickly accented region that has yet to join the 21st century. If you listen closely, you may even hear banjos.
These stereotypical depictions are insulting to those who live in the region and know that a more diverse South exists. Even worse, they deny the existence of a progressive South, or even progressive Southerners. 
Southern reality TV programs fall into a few subcategories. Sometimes, producers seek to portray the South as culturally foreign to the rest of America, and they choose characters or remote locations that reinforce this image.
The History channel's ''Swamp People,'' for example, focuses on alligator-hunting season in southern Louisiana by showcasing individuals who live and work in the Atchafalaya Swamp, thereby preserving their ''ancient way of life.'' The show uses subtitles to emphasize the cultural differences between the bayou and the rest of the country, even though the ''stars'' speak plain English.
Other shows focus on those Southerners that Americans feel as if they already know, like Southern belles and hillbillies. In its own bid to buy into the trend, Animal Planet has given us ''Hillbilly Handfishin','' in which two Oklahomans, Skipper Bivins and his pal Trent Jackson, teach people, generally big-city Northerners, how to catch catfish by using their own limbs as bait.
Then there's ''Sweet Home Alabama,'' a Dixiefied version of ''The Bachelorette,'' only in this setting she is choosing between city slickers and Southern boys. It's not unlike the show with the catfish duo: both feature a competition between country and city or, put more pointedly, North and South. The message is reduced to a Hank Williams Jr. song: a country boy can survive.
THESE stereotypes have a long history -- we've been here before, with ''The Dukes of Hazzard'' and ''Green Acres'' -- and it's no surprise that more than one production company wants to take us back there. Alongside ''Hillbilly Handfishin' '' is ''Redneck Riviera,'' a show still in development that trumpets itself as the Southern ''Jersey Shore'' and that has selected the racially insensitive Confederate battle flag for its logo.
The show is casting for type by seeking ''guys and gals'' who answer ''yes'' to the loaded question, ''Do you drink sweet tea, talk endlessly about Nascar, sport a rebel flag (on your bikini or jacked-up pickup truck), listen to loud country and/or Southern rock, or enjoy walking around shirtless or in Daisy Dukes?''
There's no doubt that more than a few people would answer yes, especially when money and potential fame are involved. But millions of Southerners would say no -- including the Indian communities of Mississippi, the Latinos who are now the largest minority in towns across the region and the thousands of white suburbanites who feel more of a connection with exurban Chicago or Denver than Lizard Lick, N.C.
In fact, the last decade has brought dramatic demographic changes to the region. The South's population is more ethnically and racially diverse than it ever has been. Hispanics are the fasting-growing ethnic group in the country and, according to census statistics, most of that growth has been concentrated in the South.
The region is increasingly urban and cosmopolitan, and has become more economically and politically powerful. Atlanta hosted the 1996 Summer Olympics, and Charlotte, N.C., will be home to the 2012 Democratic National Convention.
Therefore, you might expect better programming from the History channel. But don't hold your breath. It recently introduced the show ''You Don't Know Dixie,'' which promises to educate people about the South. But evidence to the contrary is right there in the opening credits: the term ''Dixie'' (instead of ''South''), and the use of the Confederate battle flag to illustrate the ''X,'' tell us the show is more concerned with simplistic mythmaking than piecing apart contemporary cultural complexities.
Indeed, the program is heavy on regional trivia and relies on ''well-known Southerners'' like Ty Pennington and Jeff Foxworthy (and a hillbilly moonshiner whose speech, like that of the folks on ''Swamp People,'' required subtitles) to tell us ''hidden truths'' about the region. These ''truths'' rarely involve women, and they reduce African-Americans to cooking and singing the blues.
And in ''You Don't Know Dixie,'' as in all these shows, ''Southern'' almost always means ''white,'' regardless of the central role that blacks play in the region's culture.
It's not that other reality TV shows don't trade in stereotypes of other places, too -- say, New Jersey or Los Angeles. But those shows never pretend to show the entirety of Jersey or Southern California life, just a cliched corner of it. Many of the Southern reality TV programs, on the other hand, trade in age-old stereotypes that indict the entire region.
Of course, one could ask why all the fuss about what is, ultimately, mindless entertainment? But there are two big problems. First, it gives non-Southerners license to point their fingers at a supposedly culturally deficient region, while ignoring their own shortcomings.
And second, it reinforces a message to Southerners themselves, particularly whites, that they are in fact benighted and backward -- so why change?
To present the full scale of the South's diversity would do more than just undermine negative popular perceptions of the region. It would also ruin the stock in trade that has long been used by the dominant media to represent the South as a place that is culturally different from the rest of the country. Although of course, it wouldn't be as entertaining.

''A little geographical imagination helps to convey the scale of joblessness in the West,'' The Economist observed this month. Elaborating on the idea, this graphic compares the worsening poverty figures released last week by the Census Bureau and the latest unemployment totals with the populations of various states. The poverty and income numbers invite other comparisons as well. 
How does the official poverty line compare with the value of a new car? How does the median annual family income stack up against the cost of a year in the Ivy League? Solutions to the nation's economic problems may be scarce, but ways to put them into perspective are not.

HEADLINE: The Future, Retrenched

BYLINE: By PHILIP NOBEL

 BODY:
WHAT may be the biggest architecture event of the year ahead has not yet been scheduled. But when it happens, it'll be a doozy: MGM Resorts International recently announced its intention to demolish the Harmon, a tower by Norman Foster that is a prominent component of the new CityCenter development in Las Vegas. Construction flaws were found years ago, and the building was never completed or occupied. Still, the spectacle of a boom-time project by one of the world's most celebrated designers razed by a controlled implosion is sure to spark talk about the state of architecture today.
The fate of Mr. Foster's building is a timely metaphor. Institutional work, with its longer project timelines and steadier financial supply, is continuing apace through the recession. Some ambitious commercial plans, like the development of the West Side rail yards in Manhattan, are moving forward. But the days of true extravagance, exemplified by CityCenter and its collection of flashy buildings by big-name architects, is over for now, in Western nations at least. 
The months to come will offer few grand openings of the kind that merit front-page coverage and spotlights on the street. Most major projects that were in the construction pipeline before the 2008 financial crash have either been completed or indefinitely postponed; ambitious new buildings, like the crop of 1,000-foot-plus towers planned for or under construction in Midtown Manhattan, are years away.
Preston Scott Cohen's interesting new building for the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, important as the first major work of a theorist who has garnered a lot of critical attention in recent years, may stand out as something of an exception, even an anachronism, when it opens on Nov. 2. So too may the Military History Museum in Dresden, Germany, designed by Daniel Libeskind as a brutal insertion into an existing structure and set to be unveiled on Oct. 14. Renzo Piano's large but sensitive addition to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston is scheduled to open its doors on Jan. 19, but Mr. Piano's light modernist touch is less likely to invite comparisons to the past decade's architectural excesses in the way Mr. Libeskind's and Mr. Cohen's museums, with their more aggressively convoluted forms, seem ready to.
As they are completed in the months to come the many buildings under construction for next summer's Olympic Games in London may turn the conversation back to formal experimentation in the building arts. Until then there is a reprieve. We are starting to see a natural turn toward substance, an interest in engagement with the world via architecture -- and examinations of architecture's place in the world -- that goes beyond daring structural innovation or crowd-pleasing surface effects.
In April the Museum of Modern Art in New York announced an initiative to research architectural responses to the foreclosure crisis, in partnership with the Temple Hoyne Buell Center for the Study of American Architecture at Columbia University. Five interdisciplinary teams have been imagining better-built futures for the country, and the resulting projects will be shown in an exhibition, ''Foreclosed: Rehousing the American Dream,'' opening on Feb. 14.
The Canadian Center for Architecture in Montreal seems to be moving along similar salutary lines. ''Imperfect Health,'' organized by Giovanna Borasi and Mirko Zardini, is a look at how the architecture of our cities contributes to pollution, anxiety and illness. The show opens on Oct. 25. Those wishing to know more about the state of architecture in our uncertain times should mark the entire month of October on their calendars. Archtober, a program coordinated by the Center for Architecture and the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects, will fill the city next month with exhibitions, film screenings, tours and lectures on our buildings, our cities and where we might go from here.

HEADLINE: How Should New York Proceed on Hydrofracking?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The League of Women Voters of New York State supports delay in issuance of hydraulic fracturing regulations until finalization of the Supplemental Environmental Statement (''Too Fast on Drilling,'' editorial, Sept. 12). 
While there is an initial appeal to fast-forwarding this process in times of dire economic downturn, there is a potential cost to such action. Failure to understand fully and plan adequately for the potential adverse consequences of drilling will transfer the risk and cost of such events from drillers to individual citizens or to New York's taxpayers.
We expect government to play a role in planning for and protection of the public welfare. Therefore, we must resist the political and economic expediency that compressing the review process would provide. The gas is not, after all, a transient resource. It has been there for millenniums; it will be there upon completion of an unabridged review and regulatory process.
BETSEY SWAN President, League of Women Voters of New York State Menands, N.Y., Sept. 12, 2011
To the Editor:
Safely regulated development of shale natural gas will bring badly needed jobs to New York State. The Energy Department's natural gas subcommittee report on hydraulic fracturing recognizes that more than 200,000 jobs have been created in recent years by domestic shale gas and that tens of thousands more will be created with continued development.
Development of Marcellus Shale gas is estimated to increase revenue for New York by at least $11.4 billion.
The New York Department of Environmental Conservation monitors all aspects of permitting, drilling and hydraulic fracturing. Its stringent regulations have prevented any known instances of groundwater contamination from previous horizontal drilling or hydraulic fracturing projects in the state.
The agency would require an approved wastewater process to be in place before any permit is issued, and treatment plants must demonstrate that wastewater can be treated. The agency also endeavors to mirror Pennsylvania, which reuses flowback water for subsequent fracturing operations.
I am confident that the industry can demonstrate the strength of its safeguard measures in New York so that New Yorkers can enjoy more jobs and greater energy security.

HEADLINE: Saving on Mortgage Taxes

BYLINE: By VICKIE ELMER

 BODY:
HOMEOWNERS looking to refinance their mortgage will need to compare interest rates, loan terms and fees, but some who live in New York may also want to arrange for what's known as a mortgage assignment, when the balance on the loan is transferred to the new lender from the old.
Not all lenders permit such transfers, but if both do, borrowers can skip paying a second helping of mortgage recording taxes (they paid the first round when they bought the home). 
New York State charges a mortgage recording tax of 0.5 percent of the loan, and with other special taxes added in, New York City residents pay a total of 1.8 percent on loans under $500,000, state tax included, and 1.925 percent for those at or above that amount. Among the various counties, total mortgage taxes in Westchester and Rockland run 1.3 percent, while in Nassau, Suffolk, Dutchess, Orange and Putnam it's 1.05 percent.
There is no mortgage recording tax in New Jersey or Connecticut, according to Michael Moskowitz, the president of Equity Now, a direct mortgage lender. Co-op owners are also absolved from paying, because they hold shares in a building rather than real property, explained Lawrence F. DiGiovanna, a Brooklyn real estate lawyer.
But for those who are hit with this tax, it can certainly add up at the closing. On a $450,000 refinanced loan, a borrower living in New York City can expect to pay an additional $8,100.
Instead of granting and recording a new loan when a borrower refinances, the assignment process transfers a mortgage to a new lender, which then revises it. Lenders sometimes call the process a ''Consolidation, Extension or Modification Agreement,'' or ''Modification, Extension, Consolidation Agreement.''
It's important to inquire about a mortgage assignment at the very beginning of the refinancing process, mortgage experts say, because locating and transferring all the necessary paperwork could be time-consuming. If the mortgage has been sold or handed off to a servicing company, the homeowner must get that company to sign on.
Once borrowers have determined that their new and old lenders will work with them on the loan assignment, they must ''understand what the potential savings are and weigh that against the overall cost of doing this,'' said Marc Kunen, the Manhattan branch manager for Mortgage Master, a mortgage banker.
Yes, there is a cost. Borrowers still have to pay assignment fees. Each bank typically charges several hundred dollars to $1,500, or more, according to Equity Now, which keeps a database on New York-area assignment fees.
If you're refinancing a low loan balance, say $100,000 or less, it may not be worthwhile to assign, Mr. Moskowitz said, adding that paying the tax may be easier and cost the same or less than the fee.
Borrowers must keep in mind, too, that only the balance from the old loan is sheltered from the mortgage tax. Anything added to the loan amount -- perhaps to pay for home renovations or consolidate debts -- would be taxed.
Even though most banks have established procedures for assignments, sometimes there are snags that can add days or weeks to the process. ''Do not lock in your rate until you understand what the time parameters are expected to be,'' Mr. DiGiovanna said.
He also suggests that borrowers examine the new lender's commitment letter, so they understand the stipulations that need to be met for refinancing.
Occasionally banks will not be able to locate an original loan and related documents. If the original lender still is operating, those documents can be recreated, said Stephen Chiaino, an associate in Mr. DiGiovanna's law firm. The new lender probably will not accept the homeowner's documents, unless they are certified copies, he added.

HEADLINE: Prosecutor Candidates Support 'Restorative Justice'

BYLINE: By TREY BUNDY. 
tbundy@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
On Wednesday, Betty Renee Ricks stood inside San Francisco County Jail and told 40 inmates how she was first prostituted at age 12, and how one pimp broke her teeth, beat her with hangers until she bled and poured Brut cologne into her wounds.
''My name was bitch,'' she said. ''That's all I knew.''
The men, all charged with violent offenses, listened for an hour, jotting down on worksheets the crimes perpetrated against Ms. Ricks. The point was to help them understand how their own crimes had affected victims.
The exercise was part of a program based on a practice known as restorative justice, which brings together offenders, victims and community members to discuss the impact of a crime and help repair the damage through accountability and rehabilitation rather than punishment. 
Restorative justice has long had proponents in some corners of the criminal justice system, but it is now gaining prominence in an unlikely forum: the San Francisco district attorney's race.
Often, candidates for a county's top law enforcement office compete to show who can be toughest on crime. But San Francisco has a history of freethinking district attorneys -- Terence Hallinan, who held the office from 1996 to 2004, advocated the legalization of marijuana and prostitution -- and restorative justice has become a buzzword in this year's five-way race.
David Onek, a lawyer, a former police commissioner and founder of the Berkeley Center for Criminal Justice, has led the charge, making incarceration alternatives and restorative justice the centerpiece of his campaign.
''Do you know what happens when you're locked up?'' he said. ''You sleep all day and watch daytime TV. You're watching Jerry Springer, and someone feeds you three hot meals a day. Admitting what you did, confronting your actions, hearing from a victim about the impact that things have had on them, that's tough.''
Mr. Onek said he would start by using restorative justice techniques broadly in the district attorney's juvenile division, in an attempt to steer young offenders away from jail.
George Gascon, the former police chief who was appointed district attorney in January when his predecessor, Kamala Harris, ascended to state attorney general, has embraced the cause as well. That has raised some eyebrows, as Mr. Gascon, the presumptive favorite in the race, is considered to be well to the right on San Francisco's left-leaning political spectrum.
Mr. Gascon noted in a recent interview that his office already oversees restorative programs like ''neighborhood courts,'' where victims and community members can weigh in on consequences for low-level offenders.
A third candidate, Sharmin Bock, a 22-year Alameda County prosecutor, is also promoting the concept.
The sudden interest in what critics say amounts to a ''soft on crime'' approach is partly driven by economics. On Oct. 1, California's criminal justice system will be realigned, transferring responsibility for low-level offenders from the state to the counties, many of which already have overcrowded jails.
''One of the things that's compelling this is absolute material necessity,'' said Ken Walsh, a professor of criminal justice at San Francisco State University. ''When resources are not there, you are forced to do things differently.''
The hope that new approaches can succeed in rehabilitating offenders and healing victims and their communities is part of the dynamic, too. Restorative justice proponents say traditional punishment is clearly failing on those fronts.
Mr. Gascon said budget realities would force the city to stop sweeping the crime problem under the rug by simply locking up offenders, who often come from poor neighborhoods. ''The social impact has been resonating with some for many years, but perhaps it remained invisible to many because we could afford it,'' Mr. Gascon said. ''Now we can't afford it anymore.''
None of the candidates have suggested mediations with victims or alternatives to prison for the most serious crimes. Still, Ms. Bock said she believes the basic principles could be used even with prisoners.
''There's not a downside to helping offenders understand their role in the cycle of violence and how to break it,'' she said, describing restorative justice as a way of ''improving the emotional existence and ethical awareness'' of dangerous offenders.
That kind of language does not go far with two of the other candidates for district attorney.
''We don't need a D.A. that's a social worker,'' said Vu Trinh, a veteran Orange County defense lawyer. ''The district attorney should be focused on enforcing laws first. When I'm talking about restorative justice, I'm talking about victims' rights.''
Bill Fazio, a defense lawyer who also worked as a prosecutor in the San Francisco district attorney's office for 20 years, said he supports restorative justice, but that mediations between victims and perpetrators have limited effectiveness in a city as diverse as San Francisco.
''A 15-year-old gangbanger who's been smashing car windows since he was 10 isn't going to care about sitting in a room with some housewife from Pacific Heights,'' he said. ''If you've got a gangbanger who's posting signs testifying to the prowess of his gang in a community that's plagued with gang violence, he's not going to get much sympathy.''
Mr. Walsh agreed that the economic disparities in various parts of San Francisco present challenges.
''When you try to implement restorative justice in tougher neighborhoods, it's hard because nobody is thinking about community when they're trying to meet their own necessities first,'' he said.
Indeed, many supporters of the concept are cautious about its potential.
''They're going to package it in a way that sounds like win-win-win all the way around, but the implementation is key here,'' said William Siffermann, chief of juvenile probation for San Francisco. ''The whole thing of restorative justice is that it's a buzzword that sounds great. It's not a program, but you can build programs around that philosophy.''
Resolve to Stop the Violence Project, a San Francisco Sheriff's Department effort that was started in 1997, is one such program. Part of it involves Ms. Ricks, the one-time prostituted child, who is now a social worker in San Francisco. She has been sharing her story with violent offenders for 12 years, acting as a surrogate victim, trying to educate perpetrators so their actual victims don't have to.
''We do this thing called destruction cycle where we can actually plug in acts of violence that we've committed,'' said Eric Martin, 32, who is serving a five-month sentence for domestic violence. ''It can kind of give us an overview of exactly how that's affected other people and where that anger and violence is coming from inside.''
Jaramie Aiken, 37, has attended the program for more than a year while locked up on an attempted-murder charge. He said it took months before he bought into the classes, but that now he sees them as his only chance to make it after his release.
''I'm 37, and since I was 15 I've lived a life of violence,'' he said. ''I've known my violent self longer than I've known my authentic self. My biggest fear now is that I want to get enough information in here before I leave, to save my life on the street.''

Sylvia Nasar is the author of ''Grand Pursuit: The Story of Economic Genius.''
FOR someone who's been dead for 65 years, John Maynard Keynes has amazing presence. Open a paper, click on a blog or TV, and, voila, like Waldo, he's everywhere. The British economic oracle -- whose boyhood nickname Snout should tell you that a pretty face isn't why he's hot -- gets more Google hits than Leonardo DiCaprio. Gov. Rick Perry of Texas apparently got so fed up with the old scene stealer that he interrupted a recent Republican debate to flash his rivals the news that Keynes was, well, deceased.
For some, Keynes is the hero who rescued the West from the Great Depression, for others the villain to blame for the current mess. To me, he's neither, but rather the Winston Churchill of economics, radiating optimism when things looked bleakest, never so happily engaged as in a national or global emergency. 
An emergency is what we're having now, of course. Unemployment has been stuck around 9 percent for more than two years. Business is treading water. Families have less cash to spend. Markets are in turmoil. All our old anxieties have us by the throat again: the American Dream is dead; the middle class is disappearing; our children won't live as well as we do. Never mind that similar fears proved groundless in the past. When you're scared in the middle of the night, it's almost impossible to imagine morning.
Keynes could, though. He had a surprising ability to see beyond the grim present to better days -- especially for someone who famously noted that ''in the long run we are all dead.''
Keynes's sunny optimism was most striking in the midst of one of the darkest chapters of modern economic history. If we think of the recession of 2007-9 as a Category 1 hurricane, the Great Depression would qualify as a Category 5. Income, per person, was one-fifth of what it is today, adjusted for inflation. Unemployment was nearly three times as high. More than a third of the population was destitute. There were virtually no government benefits.
Preachers talked of Armageddon, and pundits contemplated ''the possibility that the Western system of society might break down and cease to work.'' Keynes, however, reassured fellow citizens, in a silvery, seductive voice that was one of his sexiest features, that what came before ''was not a dream. This is a nightmare, which will pass away with the morning.''
Admittedly, Keynes had no more seen the hurricane coming than his counterparts predicted the crises of 1893 or 1907 or those of the 1990s or 2008. Irving Fisher's ill-timed pronouncement, just before the crash of 1929, that ''stocks have reached a permanently high plateau'' will never be forgotten. Keynes was equally surprised and forced to put his two favorite Impressionist paintings up for sale. Still, he wasn't about to waste time ruing past failures when panic was in the air. Instead, he quickly began reassuring the British public that ''we are suffering just now from a bad attack of economic pessimism.'' Boldly, he predicted that by the time his great-nieces and great-nephews were adults, mankind would have solved its ''economic problem.'' At least in the West, the material requisites for a good life would be available to all.
He did not dismiss the dangers of 25 percent unemployment, nor advocate that government embrace nature's cure and wait it out. But he disagreed vehemently with those who called for draconian or dictatorial measures. He insisted that the Western economies were suffering from a mechanical breakdown for which there was a relatively easy fix. (For someone who didn't drive, he was inordinately fond of vehicular metaphors.)
There was, moreover, a solution. Breaking the vicious circle that deflation was creating for farmers and businessmen was well within the power of governments. All the monetary authorities had to do was lower interest rates by creating more money until business could raise prices and would find it worthwhile to begin investing again.
When the Depression failed to respond to monetary policy but instead deepened and spread, Keynes went back to the drawing board. By 1936 he had worked out a new theory of slumps resistant to the usual cures of easy money and low interest rates, calling it, with his trademark lack of modesty, ''The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money.''
What never changed during the Depression and the Second World War was Keynes's positive mind-set.
On what, exactly, did Keynes's faith in the future rest, apart from his upbeat temperament and can-do British spirit? Confidence in the ''apparatus of the mind,'' his term for thinking like an economist. His great innovation was to create -- in parallel with America's Fisher -- an ''economics of the whole'' that was useful for understanding and treating temporary but dangerous economic breakdowns.
KEYNES straddled the Old World notion that the best a member of the working classes could do was to accept his station in life, and the New World order in which it was accepted that nations and people could make their own destinies. By the time he settled on economics, the once dismal science had become, if not exactly gay, then no longer grim, hopeless or resigned.
Alfred Marshall, the man most responsible for Keynes's career choice, was also the one most responsible for the new way of thinking. To paraphrase a great American economist, Paul Samuelson: before Marshall, economics was about what you couldn't change. The new economics was about what you could.
Consider the dismal science when Marshall took it up. There was no cheering up Karl Marx, who, landing in London in 1849, witnessed the Victorian economic miracle and, to quote Gladstone, 20 years of improvement in the ''average condition of the British laborer ... unexampled in the history of any country and of any age.'' The British founders of political economy were scarcely less glum. John Stuart Mill, a libertarian, socialist and supporter of unions and women's rights, doubted whether democratic reforms or technological progress could have much effect on how the average Briton lived.
When he published ''Das Kapital'' in 1867, Marx claimed that he was revealing society's ''law of motion.'' Yet he had never bothered to visit a single factory. Marshall devoted months every year to touring factories in virtually every major industry, interviewing businessmen, trade union leaders and workers. A trip to America confirmed that competition was the ingenious mechanism that compelled managers to constantly improve their operations, then to share the gains with workers. If wages depended on productivity, workers themselves -- and their elected representatives -- could influence their prospects by pursuing or promoting mobility, education and public health.
The new, cheerful social science that Marshall pioneered and Keynes and others innovated was a genuine revolution in human thinking that changed the lives of everyone on the globe. What would Keynes say if he were, say, to appear on CNBC tomorrow? That we've overcome a dozen challenges as bad or worse, that the tenfold rise in standards since Jane Austen's lifetime shows that we've done more things right than wrong, and that the ''apparatus of the mind'' -- which demands that we let facts change our minds, engage our critics and see common ground -- is infinitely more helpful in a crisis than ideology or raw emotion.
And what would Keynes do now? Go shopping, I suspect. This was the ''incorrigible optimist,'' his biographer Robert Skidelsky relates, who made a big bet on the United States recovery in 1936 and hung on when it collapsed again in 1937. It may have looked like midnight but Keynes knew that morning would come again.

HEADLINE: New Fantasy: Viewing Like It's 1979

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
IN advance of the debt-ceiling debate in Congress this summer, morning-show pundits repeatedly compared the moment with 1979 both in terms of specific economic realities and the bleak, broader cultural mood. In 1979 the country similarly faced the danger of defaulting on its financial obligations; growth lagged; the Iranian revolution sparked turmoil in the Middle East. Catastrophists found validation for their unease in the disaster at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania just as bizarre shifts in weather patterns today seem to confirm our darkest worries about global warming. 
Historical analogies that serve political pundits occasionally aid observers of television trends just as concisely. As it happens, there is much to remind us of the 1979 television season in the one now beginning, and I refer here to more than the obvious example of ''Charlie's Angels,'' begun in 1976 and resuscitated as a network series on ABC. Glancing at the schedule one is struck by the number of new series set in fantastical or futuristic worlds: places where certain citrus fruits attain the status of precious commodity (''Terra Nova'' on Fox); where the darkest dimensions of fairy tales animate otherwise anodyne suburban existences (''Once Upon a Time'' on ABC and ''Grimm'' on NBC); where the development of a brainy and mysterious machine assists in the pre-emption of violent crimes (''Person of Interest'' on CBS).
Although by the late '70s the social realist comedies of Norman Lear and Larry Gelbart were still very much dominating the consciousness -- ''The Jeffersons'' and ''M*A*S*H'' -- an interest in the world not as we know it had begun to take expression in a decisive way for the first time since the original ''Star Trek'' series went off the air a decade earlier.
Spurred on by the popularity of ''Star Wars'' the networks invested in science fiction and fantasy, delivering the first iteration of ''Battlestar Galactica'' in 1978 and ''Buck Rogers in the 25th Century'' a year later. ''Buck Rogers'' imagined that a nuclear holocaust had taken out Earth, but that the human race had ultimately been recreated and put under the protection of the Earth Defense Directorate, a kind of more ambitious Department of Homeland Security. In 1979 it was also possible to watch the earthling-alien romance ''Mork & Mindy'' as well as ''Out of the Blue,'' a comedy about an apprentice angel working as a schoolteacher, presuming you caught one of the show's nine episodes.
None of the current offerings are meant to be funny, though some share the campier aspects of their forebears and the obvious wish to reproduce both the aura and popular kitsch of the current culture's vampire production mill. Chief among the culprits in this regard is ''Grimm,'' a series about an Oregon homicide detective who suddenly starts to see monstrous imagery on the faces of ordinary people. Why? Because he is a descendant of some kind of demon-chasing aristocracy. On ''Grimm'' people speak with great urgency to one another and make ominous pronouncements like: ''There are things you don't know -- things about your family.''
If there is a larger point to the series beyond the notion that the world is scary and things are rarely what they seem, it is not evident from the initial episode. Cheekier in disposition but guided by the same sense of airy, soft-core paranoia is ''Once Upon a Time,'' which gives us a bail bondswoman, played by Jennifer Morrison (last seen as Cameron on ''House'') inadvertently reunited with the little boy she'd given up years earlier, a child who is convinced that they are fairy-tale characters trapped, by cruel chance, in the mundane world.
Unfortunately for the boy, the woman raising him is the evil queen of ''Snow White'' and the mayor of a bizarre, ''Witches of Eastwick''-like New England hamlet called Storybrooke. ''Once Upon a Time'' seems, in one sense, to aspire to speak to fantasies of an easier, more enchanted life and in another to serve as caution against giving babies up for adoption.
Both ''Terra Nova,'' which has Steven Spielberg as a producer, and ''Person of Interest'' are rooted in more palpable collective anxieties. Set in the 22nd century ''Terra Nova'' fashions a world whose resources have been overexploited and which is at the brink of extinction. Very little can grow; oranges are a rarity. The series opens with a family being investigated for violations of population-control ordinances. Before long, though, its members are transported back to a primeval time where an experiment is looming to rebuild civilization, this time more in accordance with the dictates of Greenpeace.
The dream of prevention is also at play in ''Person of Interest,'' a series set in the very real world of present-day New York, where a remnant device of a post-9/11 counterintelligence effort is being deployed to stop murders from happening as they are being planned. Behind the initiative is a mysterious billionaire, played by Michael Emerson, who gave us the mysterious islander Benjamin Linus on ''Lost.'' (J. J. Abrams, a creator of ''Lost'' is one of the new show's executive producers.) That casting choice alone would have put the series in the territory of the surreal. And yet despite the grimly earnest tone there is something almost sunny eyed about an enterprise that imagines violent crime as the greatest threat to the city at a time when crime rates have plummeted. In its own way ''Person of Interest'' is also a fairy tale.

HEADLINE: Spectators' Deaths Highlight Risks of Popular Aerial Racing

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY; Reporting was contributed by Ian Lovett from Los Angeles; Elizabeth A. Harris, Sarah Maslin Nir and Lisa Schwartz from New York; and Eric Lichtblau from Washington.

 BODY:
RENO, Nev. -- It was, for fans and followers of the high-speed sport of air racing, a sure sign of serious trouble: the vintage P-51 Mustang, the World War II fighter known as the ''Cadillac of the skies,'' pitching violently skyward in a frantic effort by the pilot to gain altitude -- and to buy time.
And then, just seconds later, that fight -- and the flight -- was over, as the plane plunged into a crowd assembled at the National Championship Air Races and Air Show in Reno. By Saturday afternoon, the death toll had reached nine, including the pilot, Jimmy Leeward, 74. The accident also injured dozens of others, with some victims in critical condition and others with severed limbs.
''I saw him pull up and then tip over to the right,'' said Howard Struble, a member of a competing team. ''And then our hearts stopped, because we knew what was coming.'' 
In an inherently risky sport, Friday's crash was one of the deadliest. And whatever the cause, it seemed likely to raise questions over whether the thrill of the events, billed as the ''world's fastest motor sport,'' was reason enough to risk fans' lives.
Air racing is like aerial Nascar, with low-flying pilots negotiating a racecourse marked by pylons at up to 500 miles per hour and sometimes flying wingtip to wingtip. The sport is risky, as are the much more widely attended air shows, where thousands gather to watch aerial acrobatics and stunts. Those shows have an even longer record of accidents involving pilots and spectators.
Among the worst came on July 27, 2002, when 77 people were killed and 543 injured after a military jet flew into a crowd of spectators and exploded at an air show at the Sknyliv Air Base in Ukraine. The pilots ejected from the aircraft and survived. In August 1988, 70 people were killed during a show at the United States air base in Ramstein, West Germany, when three jets from an Italian stunt-flying team collided and crashed into the crowd. Hundreds among the 350,000 spectators were severely injured.
And even as federal aviation officials were arriving here on Saturday to take the lead in the investigation, a stunt pilot was killed in Martinsburg, W.Va., when his post-World War II plane crashed and burst into flames at an air show. No spectators were injured.
The Federal Aviation Administration does have some oversight over air races, including the one here this weekend. Organizers must file plans with the agency showing any possible disruption of commercial flights, the location of spectators and the availability of emergency equipment. While supporters say that spectator safety is paramount at the events, and that they are closely regulated by the F.A.A., the world of air shows has a more accident-ridden recent past than the nation's commercial carriers, which have strict rules about everything from hours worked to mandatory retirement age.
Each of 19 previous fatal accidents in the Reno race involved only pilots, and each time they set off calls for increased safety. Race officials have heeded some of those calls, softening some of the sharp turns on the course after crashes in nearby neighborhoods in 1998 and 1999. In 2007 and 2008, four pilots were killed at the races, prompting local school officials to consider barring student field trips to the event, The Associated Press reported.
But the annual races generate tens of millions of dollars for the Reno economy, and for the pilots, there is the lure of $1 million in prize money. On Friday, a Reno casino sports book -- for the first time in the history of the race -- took bets on the outcome. The betting was suspended after the crash.
On Saturday afternoon, Mark Rosekind, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board, said investigators discovered both a ''component'' from the plane and a partial piece of its tail, where a three-foot crater marked the spot of impact. That discovery may lend credence to speculation about a mechanical failure of a critical control at the back of the plane known as the trim tab. But Mr. Rosekind said other issues were also under scrutiny, including the ages of the pilot and the plane, how the plane had been modified, its maintenance records and the race's safety procedures.
''We're not just interested in the metal,'' said Mr. Rosekind, who added that the board would also be evaluating the F.A.A.'s oversight of the air race.
Fans of air racing are just as ardent as car racing fans, and see the danger as part of the sport.
''I don't think they should cancel air shows; you can't take away every risk,'' said Marcy Klatt, 46, a frequent air show spectator from Pembrook Pines, Fla. ''Me getting in a car and driving down the street is a risk. You can get hit crossing the street or break your neck falling out of bed.''
''You just do what you can to be sure that you're putting in the safety procedures,'' she added.
Air race officials said that Mr. Leeward, a real estate developer from Ocala, Fla., had flown in the event many times. According to his Facebook page, he had more than 30 years of flight experience. He was flying a modified P-51 Mustang nicknamed the Galloping Ghost, and had commented in an interview with Live Airshow TV, which broadcasts aviation events, that his plane was ''as fast as anybody in the field, or maybe even a little faster.''
''We'll see on Friday what happens,'' he said.
The accident occurred about 4:30 p.m. at Reno-Stead Airport, a small general aviation outpost in the hills north of the city, on a fair afternoon with little wind. It was the last race of the day, a marquee event noted for its blistering speeds, skilled pilots and altitudes as low as 100 feet.
Mr. Leeward was running behind the leaders when disaster struck. ''We saw them come through: No. 1, No. 2 and he was 3,'' said Jack Reinholz, a retired police officer from California who was watching from a parking lot packed with R.V.'s just south of the airstrip. ''And all of the sudden he pulled straight up.''
R. John Hansman Jr., a professor of aeronautics and astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said P-51 Mustangs were ''the fastest piston-engineered planes ever built,'' capable of speeds of more than 400 miles an hour.
Such conditions, he said, can turn fatal quickly. ''It's definitely higher risk than normal flight operations, sort of like racecars versus normal cars,'' Dr. Hansman said. ''They're flying very, very close to the ground, so there is very little margin for error.''
How high the death toll here might go was uncertain, but the shock of the accident was still palpable on Saturday, as witnesses and race participants struggled to make sense of what happened.
''We're here to entertain,'' said David Costa, a pilot and owner of one of the competing airplanes. ''We're here to get their heart pumping a little bit. We're not here to kill them.''
One witness, Cameron Mason, an airplane mechanic, said he had seen the plane's impact from a nearby hangar.
''He crashed into an area where I was hoping there wouldn't be a big crowd of people,'' said Mr. Mason, who stood outside a crew area early Saturday morning, chain-smoking and shivering. ''But there was.''
Mr. Mason said that he and other aircraft mechanics at the race had spent the hours after the crash wondering if a failure of Mr. Leeward's trim tab might have led to a more catastrophic mechanical error. ''If it flutters enough,'' he said, ''your flight controls can rip off.''
Such theories were still conjecture as investigators searched the wreckage on Saturday afternoon.
The disaster was the latest in a series of deadly accidents this year at air shows. Last month, an aerial stuntman plunged 200 feet to his death as he attempted a plane-to-helicopter stunt in Harrison Township, Mich. He was standing on the wing of a small plane, then twice grabbed the skid of a helicopter and fell on the third try. Days before that, a pilot was killed in Kansas City, Mo., as his plane spiraled into a fiery crash after he could not complete a stunt meant for the show.
On Saturday afternoon, a pall had fallen over the airstrip, as followers of the sport -- who track planes and pilots the way some fans might follow the Yankees -- pulled up stakes and headed home. Crews, some still wearing flight suits, also prepared to leave, as dozens of vending stands sat abandoned.
But despite the accident, most spectators interviewed on Saturday said that the races should continue.
Mark Rouch, 44, a private pilot, said he had attended the Reno races for more than two decades and seen other accidents unfold. ''I don't know that they could change anything,'' he said. ''It's a tragedy. But the sport is what it is.''
To be sure, competitors have been killed in the Reno air races before. In 2007, three pilots died in three crashes over four days -- one when his plane stalled shortly after takeoff, another when his jet crashed during a race and the third after colliding with another pilot. In 2008, a pilot died when the wings fell off her home-built plane during practice, the 19th death in the history of the races, which started in 1964.
But Mr. Costa, the competitor, said that Friday's accident was different, taking the lives of those on the ground as well as one of those plowing through the air.
''We fly fast aircraft, close to the ground,'' he said. ''We sign up for that. But nobody wants to see anybody in the crowd get hurt.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about the aftermath of a plane crash that killed 11 at an air show in Reno, Nev., on Sept. 16 described incorrectly a plane that crashed the next day during another air show in Martinsburg, W.Va.. That plane, a T-28, was built in 1958; it was not a ''World War II-era'' aircraft.

IS MARRIAGE FOR WHITE PEOPLE?
How the African American Marriage Decline Affects Everyone
By Ralph Richard Banks
289 pp. Dutton. $25.95.
The unmarried black woman is a figure of cultural fascination these days. Cable news specials, popular books by Steve Harvey and T. D. Jakes, the films of Tyler Perry, and newspaper articles about single black women and their children born out of wedlock send waves of dismay through the American public. The explanations offered for this phenomenon tend to be of two sorts: prurient accounts of black male promiscuity and irresponsibility, or caricatures of aggressive and unreasonable black women. It is rare for the popular media to include careful social or historical analyses. Rather, they are often purveyors of a moral panic presented without root or reason. 
Upon reading the title ''Is Marriage for White People?'' I assumed the book, by the Stanford law professor Ralph Richard Banks, would follow in this trend. But I was wrong. Banks doesn't offer a jeremiad about the decline of black family values in the way of so many others who do little more than regurgitate Daniel Patrick Moynihan's 1965 report, ''The Negro Family: The Case for National Action,'' which described black family structure as ''a tangle of pathology.'' Refreshingly, Banks offers a well-researched and probing discussion of why marriage rates are so low among black Americans.
In clean and efficient prose, Banks presents a lucid picture of romantic life in black America. Moreover, he disposes of the mythology that the failure to marry is primarily an underclass phenomenon, turning his attention especially to the lives of middle-class black women. He has set out to answer the question: Why are black women ''half as likely as white women to be married, and more than three times as likely as white women never to marry''?
Banks conducted some 100 interviews with African-Americans about their experiences with marriage and dating, and his findings guided him as he sought additional answers in the social science research. He correctly notes that while divorce is common in the United States, and while out-of-wedlock birth is increasing across demographic groups, marriage remains a social ideal and status marker in American culture. He writes that African-Americans value marriage as much as other groups, despite the statistics, but that the impediments to marriage for black people are daunting and multifaceted.
Black women significantly outperform black men in high school and college. As a result, the black middle class is disproportionately female and the black poor are disproportionately male, and the gap is widening. Extraordinary rates of incarceration for black men, and the long-term effects of a prison record on employment, exacerbate this situation. Banks refers to studies indicating that ''in evaluating potential mates, economic stability still matters more for African-Americans than for other groups.'' Yet they may never find that security, and therefore never marry.
Moreover, the benefits of marriage don't accrue as readily for African-Americans as for other groups precisely because of their economic instability. Marriage simply isn't an essential component for their well-/being. For example, Banks cites data showing that black children with married parents fare no better academically or economically in the long run than their born-out-of-/wedlock counterparts. Nor can we assume, Banks says, that children born to unmarried parents do not have a paternal presence, or that children born to married parents are living in a stable household. Case in point: The rates of divorce and reported dissatisfaction among married black couples are higher than those among married white couples.
Banks handily extinguishes the myth that black women are too picky when seeking a mate. In fact, he notes that black women are more likely than women of other groups to marry men who are less successful than they are, educationally or occupationally. With the rich detail afforded by extensive interviews, Banks sheds light on the powerful specter of stereotypes about welfare queens and Jezebels, and plumbs the emotional lives of black women, describing the loneliness they feel when marriage prospects are dim. He also explains that because economically successful black men are relatively rare, their power on the dating market is heightened; affluent black men can ''play the field'' indefinitely, and this too has a negative impact on marriage.
This leads to my primary criticism of the book. The prescriptive measure Banks concludes with is: Black women should be more open to marrying outside their race. Banks argues that to their detriment, black women will marry ''down'' but not ''out'' -- they're more likely to marry less-educated and lower-earning black men than to marry interracially. He treats black women's resistance to interracial dating with great sensitivity (though he pays too little attention to the history of nonconsensual and exploitative sexual relationships between white men and black women that may be the root of many black women's reluctance). And as a statement of values, Banks's position is laudable: people should be open to forming relationships across ethnic lines in a heterogeneous society; after all, romantic love is serendipitous -- it doesn't neatly comport with expectations. But given that Banks identifies a devastating social reality for black men as the foremost explanation for low African-/American marriage rates, you might expect a logical first-order solution to address that reality. Attention to the abundant research on the discrimination faced by black men in schools, in the workplace and in the realm of law enforcement would have been useful here. A solution to the marriage question rooted in dating preferences treats the problem as an individual one rather than as societal or structural, which seems odd in a book about such a fundamental social institution.
Banks also fails to delve into issues confronting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender black people in romantic relationships. This is a notable absence in a work about sexual unions. Although Banks is attentive to the economic diversity of blacks, he doesn't attend much to other forms of diversity. On that same point, a look at marriage across black ethnicities would have been informative. The population of first- and second-generation black immigrants has risen over the past four decades. Given the distinct histories and relatively higher educational outcomes of many of these groups, it would be interesting to compare their marriage rates with those of other blacks.
Despite these shortcomings, ''Is Marriage for White People?'' is an important book, and not only for those interested in African-American life. Banks effectively argues that black Americans are leading a trend of relationship instability that is growing rapidly in nonblack communities as well. He distinguishes between marriage and healthy relationships, noting the prevalence of stable, long-term unmarried relationships in Europe (where the marriage decline is not considered a crisis, he writes). Hence, his book is not a romanticization of the institution of marriage, but an alarm bell warning of the failure of American partnerships. He alerts us to the consequences for families, and I would add that the alarm rings beyond marriage, to a broader social collapse that includes distrust of neighbors, weakened social networks and community institutions, evictions, foreclosures, diminished opportunity, hostility toward those we deem different and skepticism toward enduring human connection. In short, the ties that bind need tightening.

HEADLINE: A Hail-Mary Pass as the Clock Runs Down

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
THE phrase ''troubled adoptions'' brings to mind rescued pit bulls or the neglected children from third-world orphanages. Now there's an automotive analog to trouble prospective parents: the cars of Sweden's embattled Saab.
Barely 18 months after Saab was rescued by Victor Muller --the car-crazy founder of a tiny Dutch automaker, Spyker Cars -- in a last-minute purchase from General Motors, the reconstituted Saab Automobile is again walking the ledge of bankruptcy or dissolution.
Its factory in Trollhattan, Sweden, which produces the 9-3 and 9-5 sedans, has been largely shut down since April after unpaid suppliers halted deliveries. The company announced a $322 million loss for the first six months of the year. And two unions have filed bankruptcy petitions, citing unpaid wages for both blue- and white-collar workers.
At a hearing on Sept. 26, if Saab fails to convince a court that is financially viable, the company could collapse. 
Rather than making cars, Saab's main activity seems to have been engineering financial lifelines. The company hopes to sell a majority stake to a pair of Chinese auto companies for about $350 million. But regulatory approvals from China and Sweden seem far from certain.
Considering all the cliffhanger suspense, it would be hard to fault a consumer for being leery of buying a new Saab, no matter how terrific they might be. But the all-new Saab 9-5 sedan is middling, not miraculous, and it found just 1,354 buyers in the United States through August, a reception that can't have been helped by the corporate turmoil.
Yet against all odds, the Saab 9-4X, the latest product of this broken home, turns out to be a fairly winning luxury crossover. While the vehicle has its flaws, including excess weight and lackluster fuel economy, it is easily as compelling as the Cadillac SRX on which it is based.
While it is small consolation to fans, the last Saab to spring from the company's checkered association with G.M. packs a surprising degree of Scandinavian charm -- the kind that eluded such generic duds as the Subaru-sourced 9-2X (the notorious ''Saabaru'') and the 9-7X, a thinly disguised Chevy TrailBlazer.
The Saab crossover's mechanicals, including the platform, its V-6 engines and its 6-speed automatic transmission, all derive from G.M. The 9-4X isn't even built in Sweden, but in Ramos Arizpe, Mexico, alongside its Cadillac cousin. Yet Saab has managed to create its own distinctive exterior design and interior environment, and to massage the parts beneath to create a sharper, more European-feeling machine.
From the curb, a rough resemblance to the SRX (and the more pedestrian Chevrolet Equinox) is obvious. But the Saab is the best looking of the three, with its blacked-out pillars, sloping roofline and elegantly detailed rear end.
Inside, the Saab strives to dye its G.M. roots to announce its own style. As with the 9-5, the materials and switches are no threat to a Lexus or an Audi. But in the design world, there's good monochrome and bad monochrome, and this one is good: your eye takes in its charcoal-tone surroundings in a clean, unbroken sweep. The cabin is also just right for the jet-inspired Saab, a blast of individualism against the more conformist vibe of, say, an Acura MDX or Lexus RX.
The attractive bits include the sporty small-circumference steering wheel, the egg-crate vents and the metal-and-leather shifter. The gauge needles seem inspired by the Green Lantern's power ring. A cool redundant speed readout recalls a jet altimeter or a bathroom scale, depending on your Mittyesque frame of reference. Press the Saab-signature Night Panel button and the main instruments and infotainment readouts switch off, leaving only the speedometer illuminated.
The G.M.-based touch-screen navigation system was fine three or four years ago, but it's beginning to fall behind the curve in ease-of-use and sharp graphics.
The front seats are supportive, but the rear cushions are a bit flat for my taste. And while passengers enjoy spacious accommodations, the cargo efficiency is poor for a crossover that's roughly eight inches longer than an Audi Q5 or Volvo XC60. A Lexus RX is about two inches shorter and an inch narrower than the Saab, yet it has about 30 percent more cargo space.
One Saab tradition never changes, as I was reminded when I drove the 9-4X Aero model: for seemingly 20 years now, Saab models have struggled to find their pricing niche. There's a base version that's attractively priced but not quite luxury-class in terms of power or features, and a stuffed trophy model whose price seems, shall we say, optimistic.
The Aero expresses that optimism in a $48,835 base price, or $52,130 after adding a $1,450 panoramic moonroof and a rear-passenger package ($1,845) with twin DVD screens, heated rear seats and three-zone climate control.
More reasonably, the standard 9-4X starts at $34,205, but that's with front-wheel-drive, G.M.'s lukewarm 265-horsepower 3-liter V-6 and a short list of features.
The Aero hunts bigger game with the 300-horsepower 2.8-liter turbo V-6, an excellent Haldex all-wheel-drive system, a limited-slip rear differential, chunky 20-inch alloy wheels and all the toys: Navigation and premium audio systems, xenon adaptive headlamps, heated and ventilated front seats, rain-sensing wipers, a six-month OnStar subscription and three months of satellite radio. And don't forget the cooled glovebox.
In theory, the Aero engine might seem a tattered calling card. In the SRX, the breathless turbo and its lurching 6-speed transmission proved such a poor match that Cadillac killed the combination after just one year. For 2012, the SRX gets the solid 3.6-liter V-6 from the CTS sedan.
But Saab applied its turbocharging expertise to smooth the 2.8 engine and tweak the throttle response for more seamless operation (though the transmission still delivered clunky shifts).
The Saab may be no quicker than the Cadillac, at a manufacturer-estimated 7.7 seconds from 0 to 60 miles per hour, but it sure feels like it.
With up to 4,650 pounds to drag around, the 9-4X isn't a mountain goat in the vein of lighter, higher-performance crossovers like the BMW X3. That weight is reflected in the Aero's unimpressive rating of 15 miles per gallon in town, and 22 on the highway. The front-drive nonturbo version is rated 18/25 m.p.g.
Yet on the highway, this Saab comes alive, chewing up miles, passing at will, evincing a high-speed confidence that's impossible to fake. The Aero's top speed of 145 m.p.h. is one indication of that ability; the basic model tops out at 130 m.p.h.
The steering, pleasingly quick and direct, contributes to that feeling, especially when you dial the Aero's adaptive suspension to its Sport setting. Saab engineers, if their paychecks clear, could still fine-tune the system: the ride quality of the 9-4X in Sport mode can set teeth to chattering on bad roads. And as in the 9-5, the brakes just feel weird. The pedal is hard as granite, yet stopping power doesn't increase in a progressive fashion as you add more pressure.
Yet for all its flaws, I enjoyed the 9-4X in a way that's hard to express in words. That's what good Saabs have always been like -- they were rarely the best performers in a strict sense, but they had an undeniable appeal. And ultimately, this new Saab's technical issues pale in comparison with the company's larger problems.
For decades, the automotive world welcomed small-scale underdogs like Saab, with its loyal individualist owners. But that world is dying, and even once-huge brands that could not compete -- Pontiac, Plymouth, Oldsmobile, Mercury and Saturn -- have been sent into exile.
Today, Saab's true-hearted fans have to ignore more than the competitive set; now they're asked to ignore potential resale-value losses or service issues if Saab ceases to exist and leaves them holding an orphan. (Leasing the car, in this case, may be the smarter play.)
Even if Saab loyalists are smitten with the 9-4X, they must be willing to take that chance. Everyone else is likely to ignore it. Where that leaves this once-proud company is anyone's guess.

HEADLINE: The 83-Year-Old Money Tree

BYLINE: By HOPE REEVES

 BODY:
Earlier this summer, I found myself in the passenger seat of 83-year-old Mary Donnelly's Ford Escape as she darted around Block Island, dodging dozens of half-drunk tourists spilling into the street.
''Ever heard of a crosswalk?'' she yelled, as she puckered up her face and waved a young couple across. ''Just one thing keeps me from running them over,'' she said, ''and that's jail. They're not worth it.''
Finally, after several more terrifying minutes of navigating the island's winding roads and swerving around bicyclists, we made it to the Block Island Power Company. The sign outside said ''Closed,'' but it was Thursday afternoon -- business hours -- and Donnelly didn't so much as pause as she pushed through the front door. 
''Nice try with the sign,'' she said to the office manager, as a deeply tanned woman slouched in a chair nearby, ''but you had to know it wouldn't work with me.''
After a few more friendly gibes, Mary D., as she's known on this picturesque island that is 13 miles off the coast of Rhode Island, handed over a check for $184.44 to cover someone's electric bill. As every Block Islander knows, that's what Donnelly does: she pays other people's bills.
Aside from being a nurse on the island for the past 53 years, the 5-foot-2 mother of seven is the sole administrator of the Mary D. Fund, a charity meant to help the 1,000 or so residents who call Block Island their year-round home. They're a different breed from the upper-crusters who flood the island in May and take off around Labor Day. Many are paid under the table during the busy months and then struggle to live off that through the winter. The unemployment rate can reach 27 percent in the off-season. As one year-round establishment explains on the front of its T-shirt: ''We're all here because we're not all there.''
Last year, thanks to donations and fund-raisers like the annual Mary D. Ball, Donnelly distributed about $50,000. She estimates that she has helped close to 30 percent of the island's families over the past few years.
Tracy Muller was filling in behind the counter at an antique shop on a recent Monday afternoon (she also works as a school-bus monitor), and she had no problem telling me her Mary story.
''This past winter, I had been in an accident, and I had broken about three of my front teeth,'' she said.
Muller, who doesn't have health insurance, had to go to the mainland for the dental work. The cost of the first two appointments alone added up to more than $1,500. She didn't know what to do. ''Then I was talking to someone who was a really good friend of Mary's,'' Muller told me, ''and they said, 'Why don't you give me the bill and let me submit it to Mary?' So she sent it in, and the bill was paid. I never even saw her.''
Muller's eyes went teary right there in the antique store. ''I cried for three days over it,'' she said. ''I've only been out here five years, and for someone I didn't even know to be so generous? You have to be kidding me.''
The requests for Donnelly's help usually come through the mail or as little notes jammed into her cubby at the Block Island Medical Center. Some feature family portraits crayoned by children; others are simply envelopes stuffed with bills to be paid.
Over the years, Donnelly has given as much as $2,500 for a mortgage payment and as little as $13.95 for a ferry ticket to the mainland so a man could go to therapy. Sometimes she deals with people she calls ''chronic, chronic'' -- the ones she has to bail out repeatedly. And every now and again, people will grouse about her paying certain bills for certain people, because even though the whole process is supposed to be anonymous, Block Island is an amazingly small place.
Donnelly has only two stipulations: One, that applicants be year-round residents, and, two, that they let her pay the bills herself so that they don't take the money and blow it all at the Poor People's Pub (until recently the Albion), a local dive bar.
''I always just say, 'I am only able to pay this much this month and, p.s., I think you need a class in money management,'' she said. ''People write me back and say that I'm the rudest person they've ever met, but I have to say it.''
As she filed through the latest requests in her office at the medical center, she went on at length about how much she loves her job, how good it feels to forestall foreclosures or get the lights back on. But then she said that she'll retire ''sooner than you think'' and that she hoped to pass the baton to the island's other nurse, Linda Closter.
''So it'll become 'The Linda C. Fund'?'' I asked.
Mary looked at me like I just sat on her cat.
''Oh, no,'' she said. ''I'm keeping the name.''

HEADLINE: AUTISM, GROWN UP; Autistic and Seeking a Place in an Adult World

BYLINE: By AMY HARMON

 BODY:
MONTCLAIR, N.J. -- For weeks, Justin Canha, a high school student with autism, a love of cartoons and a gift for drawing, had rehearsed for the job interview at a local animation studio.
As planned, he arrived that morning with a portfolio of his comic strips and charcoal sketches, some of which were sold through a Chelsea gallery. Kate Stanton-Paule, the teacher who had set up the meeting, accompanied him. But his first words upon entering the office were, like most things involving Justin, not in the script.
''Hello, everybody,'' he announced, loud enough to be heard behind the company president's door. ''This is going to be my new job, and you are going to be my new friends.''
As the employees exchanged nervous glances that morning in January 2010, Ms. Stanton-Paule, the coordinator of a new kind of ''transition to adulthood'' program for special education students at Montclair High School, wondered if they were all in over their heads. 
Justin, who barely spoke until he was 10, falls roughly in the middle of the spectrum of social impairments that characterize autism, which affects nearly one in 100 American children. He talks to himself in public, has had occasional angry outbursts, avoids eye contact and rarely deviates from his favorite subject, animation. His unabashed expression of emotion and quirky sense of humor endear him to teachers, therapists and relatives. Yet at 20, he had never made a true friend.
People with autism, whose unusual behaviors are believed to stem from variations in early brain development, typically disappear from public view after they leave school. As few as one in 10 hold even part-time jobs. Some live in state-supported group homes; even those who attend college often end up unemployed and isolated, living with parents.
But Justin is among the first generation of autistic youths who have benefited throughout childhood from more effective therapies and hard-won educational opportunities. And Ms. Stanton-Paule's program here is based on the somewhat radical premise that with intensive coaching in the workplace and community -- and some stretching by others to include them -- students like Justin can achieve a level of lifelong independence that has eluded their predecessors.
''There's a prevailing philosophy that certain people can never function in the community,'' Ms. Stanton-Paule told skeptics. ''I just don't think that's true.''
With some 200,000 autistic teenagers set to come of age in the United States over the next five years alone, little is known about their ability to participate fully in public life, or what it would take to accommodate them. Across the country, neighbors, employers, colleagues and strangers are warily interacting with young adults whose neurological condition many associate only with children.
Some advocates of ''neurodiversity'' call this the next civil rights frontier: society, they say, stands to benefit from accepting people whose brains work differently. Opening the workplace to people with autism could harness their sometimes-unusual talents, advocates say, while decreasing costs to families and taxpayers for daytime aides and health care and housing subsidies, estimated at more than $1 million over an adult lifetime.
But such efforts carry their own costs. In this New York City suburb, the school district considered scrapping Ms. Stanton-Paule's program almost as soon as it began, to save money on the extra teaching assistants who accompanied students to internships, the bank, the gym, the grocery store. Businesses weighed the risks of hiring autistic students who might not automatically grasp standard rules of workplace behavior.
Oblivious to such debates, many autistic high school students are facing the adult world with elevated expectations of their own. Justin, who relied on a one-on-one aide in school, had by age 17 declared his intention to be a ''famous animator-illustrator.'' He also dreamed of living in his own apartment, a goal he seemed especially devoted to when, say, his mother asked him to walk the dog.
''I prefer I move to the apartment,'' he would say, reluctantly setting aside the notebook he spent hours filling with tiny, precise replicas of every known animated character.
''I prefer I move to the apartment, too,'' his father, Briant, a pharmaceutical company executive, replied on hard days.
Over the year that a New York Times reporter observed it, the transition program at Montclair High served as a kind of boot camp in community integration that might also be, for Justin, a last chance. Few such services are available after high school. And Justin was entitled to public education programs, by federal law, until only age 21.
Ms. Stanton-Paule had vowed to secure him a paid job before he left school -- the best gauge, experts say, of whether a special needs student will maintain some autonomy later in life. She also hoped to help him forge the relationships, at work and beyond it, that form the basis of a full life.
But more prosaic lessons arose at every turn: when he should present money at the pizza place (not until after he ordered), how close to stand to the person using the weight machine he wanted at the gym (not so close), what to say when he saw a co-worker drinking a Coke (probably not ''Coca-Cola is bad for your bones''). Often, Ms. Stanton-Paule and her staff seemed to spend as much time teaching the residents of Montclair about Justin as teaching him the tasks at hand.
''Don't tell me, tell him,'' they directed cashiers. ''We need your help to make this work,'' they pleaded with potential employers. ''Justin has autism,'' Ms. Stanton-Paule explained to librarians, the manager at the animal shelter, students at the local college. ''How he communicates might be different from what you're used to.''
For his part, Justin sometimes flagged in his pursuit of autonomy. ''When do I retire from this?'' he asked of drills in phone etiquette. But he never stopped trying, sometimes warbling the theme song to his favorite movie, ''Pinocchio,'' as a means of soothing himself.
''When you wish upon a star,'' he sang, ''makes no difference who you are.''
''Pinocchio,'' he informed anyone who asked, ''is about a wooden puppet who was brought to life by a blue fairy and goes through mischief and mayhem so he can be approved to be a real boy.''
If he recognized himself in Pinocchio's classic quest for acceptance, Justin did not say it in so many words.
Family That Won't Take 'No'
Justin's adulthood had been looming for his parents, Briant and Maria Teresa Canha, ever since he was given his diagnosis in 1993 at age 3. Like many parents of autistic children before them, they wondered what would become of their son, who threw frequent tantrums, looked straight through them and did not answer to his name.
But some things were changing for the better. The explosion of research that followed the formal recognition of autism as a psychiatric diagnosis in 1980 underscored its biological basis, lifting some of the stigma that persisted through the 1970s, when bad mothering was often blamed for the condition's mix of social impairments and circumscribed, repetitive behaviors.
And Justin's parents were not alone. As the condition's hallmark behaviors became better recognized, many children who were previously designated as mentally retarded or just dismissed as strange were being given an autism diagnosis, a trendthat has continued. Some experts also believe that the actual number of people with autism has been climbing.
Even now, autism's root causes remain unknown; many genetic and environmental factors are believed to contribute to its different forms and degrees of severity. Justin, for example, is unusually sensitive to noise; others are uncomfortable with light or touch. Some are physically aggressive, others withdrawn. About half score low on I.Q. tests, a handful are savants, and many, like Justin with his drawing, shine brightly in one particular area and stumble in others.
But emboldened by the growing understanding of what it means to be autistic, parents in the 1990s were increasingly demanding full access to education for their children and searching for ways to help them.
Many interventions the Canhas tried -- gluten-free diets, neurofeedback therapy, high doses of vitamin B6 powder -- made no apparent difference. A trip to Israel ''to swim with those sweet bottle-nosed dolphins,'' as Justin later described it, was a boon for a boy whose affection for animals contrasted with the indifference he showed people, but it yielded no breakthroughs.
Months of intensive language and cognitive therapy at age 4, however, did seem to help Justin, who learned a few words in sign language. To communicate with him, Justin's brother, Julian, 18 months older, learned them, too.
If Briant occasionally raised an eyebrow at his wife's tireless trial and error, he never held her back. He could not bring himself to have the third child she wanted, unwilling to risk another with autism. But the decision made the search all the more pressing: Julian, they knew, might one day be his brother's sole caretaker.
The family had been living in Europe, where Briant had a promising career in international business and Maria Teresa, the daughter of a Brazilian diplomat, had embraced an expatriate lifestyle. There Justin found some comfort drawing characters from the Disney videos he watched incessantly; at 5, he littered the Canha home with hundreds of likenesses of Dumbo, Simba and a ''Jungle Book'' favorite, Baloo the Bear.
But when Justin was in first grade, near Munich, his tantrums became so frequent that he was often removed from the classroom. For months, he would eat only grilled cheese sandwiches. A generation earlier, his parents might have placed Justin in an institution. Instead, the Canhas returned to the United States in 1997 to look for better services.
The realization that Justin was among the most severely impaired in the classroom set aside for children with autism in their new Florida school district was a blow to his mother, already battling depression. But with help from a new form of behavioral therapy that would prove to be one of the few effective interventions for some with the condition, Justin's tantrums subsided.
With positive reinforcements for small tasks, Justin was coaxed by his therapists to answer questions like ''what did you do today?'' by drawing, providing a first glimpse of the confusion behind his outbursts, as well as his sense of humor.
The day a teacher at school took his markers away, he drew himself crying on a long, winding road home. After his father returned from a fishing trip, Justin drew a ''bad dream'': his own body on a plate, a fish above him with knife and fork, ready to dig in. By the time the Canhas moved to be near family in Providence, R.I., Justin, 9, had taken the top award in a cartooning contest for students in kindergarten through 12th grade. His diet, still devoid of all vegetables, had expanded. He spoke a few short phrases.
And by the time Briant was offered a job in northern New Jersey a year later, Maria Teresa had learned of ''inclusion,'' a practice that allowed students with disabilities to participate fully in mainstream classes. Said to produce better academic outcomes for such students and instill compassion in their classmates, it held the chance for Justin, his mother believed, to learn the social language that was still so foreign to him.
It took a year to find a public school that would take Justin on those terms; over the 1990s, federal courts had ruled that districts must try to integrate students with disabilities, but gave them discretion. Three superintendents told his mother without even meeting Justin that they would bus him to a specialized private school.
But in Montclair, her plea to have her son educated in the community where she hoped he would one day work and live had been sounded by other parents just a year earlier. Having already trained teachers and adapted material so that six middle school children with other special needs could attend regular classes, there was no reason, the superintendent agreed, not to accommodate Justin.
A Celebrity, of Sorts, in School
The move to Montclair in 2002 took its toll on Justin, who clung to routine. In his high-pitched singsong, he ticked off to himself each place the Canhas had lived. ''Five moves,'' he said. ''I hate it.'' With a new cognitive behavior therapist, he practiced making eye contact and strategies to stanch the steady stream of ''self-talking'' that drew stares even as it soothed his anxiety.
Alone in his room, he filled composition books with a vast cast of miniature characters, drawing swiftly with a mechanical pencil that he sharpened after every two strokes. He learned the release date of every Disney film, its animators, its voiceover stars and whether it was ''one of the best movies of all time'' or ''bombed at the box office,'' both outcomes he proclaimed with relish. He memorized entire episodes of ''The Simpsons'' and ''Family Guy.''
And with new computer software, he developed his own cartoon animations and a comic strip called ''Jickey and Fanky'' about a fox and a wolf that sometimes took on a decidedly personal twist. In ''Jickey Goes to Behavior Therapy,'' for instance, Dr. Fanky P. Wolf gets his eyes gouged out by his patient, Jickey, whom he is prodding to make eye contact.
When Maria Teresa probed his feelings, Justin brushed her off.
''Don't be curious,'' he told her in what became an oft-used refrain. ''Don't be interested.''
But at his new middle school, Justin's autistic qualities earned him a kind of celebrity status. His classmates stifled smiles when he yelled ''You're fired!'' at an unpopular teacher, and the novelty of his composition book served as a social bridge.
''I drew Baloo from 'The Jungle Book,' '' he would say to fellow students, opening to a page. ''Do you like 'The Simpsons'? What's your favorite character?''
If he did not exactly have friends, he had admirers.
With simplified copies of school books and an aide to keep him focused, Justin participated in the same lessons as his peers, often using art to complete assignments. And when the Ricco Maresca gallery sold more than a dozen of his drawings for as much as $4,000 each at the Outsider Art Fair in Manhattan shortly after Justin entered high school, the Canhas allowed themselves the thought that he might one day support himself through his art.
The family paid for mentoring sessions with an art facilitator and arranged a tour of Pixar Animation Studios in California, where Justin informed the guide, ''I am in heaven here.''
Julian, by phone from the University of Michigan, where he was attending college, voiced concern. ''You're investing so much in Justin's art career,'' he told his mother. ''What if that doesn't work out?''
But meeting regularly with Justin's family, under the new requirements of a civil rights law called the Individuals With Disabilities in Education Act, school officials encouraged him to pursue independence. The term became a mantra of sorts for the Canhas. For Justin, like any adolescent, it seemed the key to freeing himself from his parents' grip -- and from the very activities designed to help him reach that goal.
''Mom, when is the last day of Dr. Selbst?'' Justin asked on the weekly trips to the cognitive behavior therapist.
''Well, Justin, what's the goal?'' his mother asked. ''Why do we go to Dr. Selbst?''
''Independence,'' Justin sighed, turning on classical music on his iPod and settling in for the ride.
At bustling Montclair High, where Justin wore giant ear protectors to block out hallway noise, he faced a less gentle side of inclusive education. A gym teacher threw him out when the murmur of his self-talking broke an order for ''total silence.'' His middle school fans shrugged him off when he approached with his composition book. ''They're busy,'' Justin reported when his mother asked if he ever had lunch with classmates or wanted to invite anyone over.
Some students purposely set off Justin's emotional outbursts. ''Kill Elmo,'' they whispered, aware of his fascination with Internet videos portraying the demise of the popular ''Sesame Street'' character. ''Why?'' Justin would exclaim, sometimes loud enough to get sent to the principal's office. ''Why kill Elmo? Why?''
He still had trouble with basic math, and with understanding someone else's point of view. His speech was halting, almost formal, and he never asked a reciprocal question in conversation except when prompted. He bristled at criticism, particularly of his artwork (''No opinions, please'' was a Justinism his teachers knew well).
Yet by senior year, Justin had, in his way, assimilated. He had traded the earmuffs for discreet earplugs. He had railed against racism in a social justice class (''It's not fair!'') and cultivated his skill in posing provocative questions that would get a rise out of classmates. ''Why is it not O.K.,'' he often wondered aloud of the adviser of the school cartoon club, ''to say 'Mr. Tucker is a sucker?' ''
And sometimes, the rules bent his way. Justin's aide braced herself when he raised his hand one day in a class that had focused for several months on Africa. The students had just finished reading a book on apartheid.
''Mr. Moore,'' Justin complained, ''I'm tired of learning about sad black people.''
The teacher, who is black, turned around.
''You know what, Justin?'' he said. ''Me too.''
Justin would walk with his classmates at graduation in June 2009. But at 19, he would be staying on for two years devoted to preparing for adult life. That spring, Ms. Stanton-Paule asked him to design a poster to present at a leadership conference for students with disabilities.
''If you could achieve anything, what would it be?'' she challenged him.
He contemplated the outline she gave him: in a bubble at the top, he was to write his vision of the future. On steps leading to his goal, he would write his course of action.
On graduation day, he dressed in a cap and gown. As he paced in the overheated hallway, talking loudly to himself, his classmates calmed him. When they marched out on stage together, they made sure he took his place in line.
A Teacher's Mission
Before Justin joined her program, Ms. Stanton-Paule drove her teaching assistants to a low-slung building near the high school known as a ''sheltered workshop.'' There, in a windowless room, people with autism and other developmental disabilities sorted colored combs and placed them in plastic bags. They were paid by the piece at subminimum-wage rates, based on how fast they performed compared with the prevailing rate for nondisabled workers.
Some family members see such government-subsidized facilities as safe, productive alternatives to keeping disabled adults idle at home. Others criticize them as a form of segregation, where people cannot reach their potential.
To Ms. Stanton-Paule, the workshop represented one of the grim realities her students might face should they fail to find real jobs before leaving school. And for Justin, the stakes were particularly high. Post-high-school programs that have had some success in placing adults with disabilities like Down syndrome in rewarding jobs are often ill suited for those with autism, whose challenges center more on social and communication barriers than basic cognitive functioning.
''School is over when it's over,'' Ms. Stanton-Paule told her assistants. ''And then it's like, life.''
Like all of the nation's public school districts, Montclair was required by federal law to provide some kind of transition program to prepare special education students to live independently. As in many schools, Montclair had traditionally assigned them to a classroom equipped with appliances, so they could practice skills like cooking and folding laundry. Some also worked in town a few hours a week.
But in the fall of 2008, Ms. Stanton-Paule had moved nine such students out of the school building entirely and into the town. Individually supervised, they shopped for food, went to the gym and worked at the local businesses that provided internships in response to her combination of charm, persistence and offers of free labor.
The approach, sometimes called ''community-based instruction,'' is widely viewed by educators as the best way to prepare special needs students to navigate real-life settings. But the federal government, which pays states extra for their education, does not require that school districts track which students are employed in the years after they leave school to determine the relative success of different transition programs.
And experts say few schools implement programs based fully in the community, which require a type of very public teaching for which there is little training.
''We're asking teachers to get out of the classroom,'' said Dan Baker, a pediatrics professor at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School who was hired by New Jersey's Education Department to promote the model to its own schools. ''That is not necessarily in their comfort zone.''
Deceptively calm, with straight blond hair and an unflinching green gaze, Ms. Stanton-Paule, 49, had long championed the approach: a decade earlier she had found jobs for several special needs students who still worked in town, at a hair salon, at the library, at the Y.M.C.A. The same group of activist parents who had inspired the Canhas' move to Montclair had requested that Ms. Stanton-Paule be hired back when their children reached high school, and another teacher, Leslie Wallace, quickly volunteered to be her co-director. The program, they argued, could serve even the students most severely affected by autism and other disabilities.
But others saw them as overly idealistic.
The vice provost at Montclair State University, for example, suggested at a meeting that it would not be in the best interest of Ms. Stanton-Paule's students to audit college classes, even if the institution had resources to handle them. ''This is a competitive environment,'' she told the teacher.
And a year after she started the community-based program, Ms. Stanton-Paule was already clashing with administrators about whether they would assign enough teaching assistants, at a cost of about $20,000 per student, to continue it.
Regardless of the expense, some school officials were not convinced the program was right for students who needed so much help just to navigate high school. One student ''was lost in the school building the other day,'' a colleague pointed out. ''Do you really think she's going to be safe in the community, Kate?''
As for Justin, another colleague warned her, ''The world can be a rough place.''
''People out there will help Justin,'' insisted Ms. Stanton-Paule, who has a master's degree in special education and rehabilitation psychology. ''We'll show them how.''
The Canhas were counting on it. Their quest for inclusive education had all been aimed at enabling Justin's independence. But so far, the only place he went by himself was the volunteer job Ms. Stanton-Paule had set up at the Montclair Township Animal Shelter -- where he excelled, as it turned out, at ''socializing'' stray cats.
''Please stand by us,'' Justin's mother pleaded in an e-mail to school administrators, who ultimately reinstated the program's teaching assistants. ''What we have achieved so far would be lost if Justin could not continue to be supported as he has been in Montclair.''
The morning he was to present his ''Dream'' poster at the statewide conference at a local college, Justin buzzed with excitement.
''O.K., Kate, when am I going to talk about my poster?'' he demanded. Finally, he stood before a room filled with several dozen students, teachers and local television news reporters and held it up. On the lower steps of the poster, he had written ''learn how to take the bus.'' At the top, he had drawn himself at a drafting table, in a jacket and tie, with a red-brick apartment building. ''Famous animator-illustrator'' he had written, and, on the step marked 2014, ''move to the apartment.''
In large blue letters, he had also written the word ''Single.'' ''Marriage,'' he said, drawing out his words in his exaggerated style, ''is too comp-li-cat-ed.''
Ms. Stanton-Paule, listening, thought, ''Don't be so sure.''
Working Toward a Dream Job
It had taken months for Ms. Stanton-Paule to persuade Randy Rossilli, the president and founder of the start-up animation studio Nightstand Creations, to meet Justin.
''Call me next week,'' Mr. Rossilli, whose company had won a regional Emmy for a children's show, told her over the fall of 2009.
There were other disappointments that fall as the teachers sought internships for Justin, promising on-the-job support that would fade only when everyone was ready. The supervisor at the public library where Justin volunteered to shelve books gave him high marks for accuracy, but budget cuts meant there would be no paid position. Artware, a store that made custom T-shirts and coffee mugs, declined to take him on.
''I can't do it, Kate,'' said Diana Polack, the owner, who had recently employed someone with disabilities and found the extra attention he required too costly.
Justin's other volunteer job, assisting an elementary school art teacher, was initially going well. The first graders delighted in his deft animal sketches, and he laid down the law with a moral clarity that might be attributed to his autism.
''Children,'' he told students snickering at one boy's drawing. ''Stop being mean. Be kind.''
The art teacher, Kathleen Cooney, who had had some trepidation about Justin's internship, started to relax. But one afternoon in December, when Justin repeatedly mentioned the coming Christmas holiday to his students, Ms. Cooney asked him to stop talking about religion at school.
''Well, I believe in Jesus Christ, and I want to say 'Merry Christmas,' '' he insisted. ''Why it is not O.K. to say 'Christmas?' Why?''
He paced in the hall, his self-talking growing louder. He made explosion sounds. Ms. Cooney summoned Ms. Stanton-Paule to help calm Justin.
It was when rules of social behavior rang false to him, Ms. Stanton-Paule suspected, that he found them especially hard to grasp. But later that month, she saw a new empathy in her student when she accompanied Justin to distribute holiday cards he had hand-made for colleagues.
''I'm not allowed to say 'Merry Christmas,' Marilyn,'' Justin said abruptly to one of the librarians, thrusting a card at her. ''So, happy holidays.''
He turned to walk away as she started to thank him.
''Justin,'' Ms. Stanton-Paule said with unusual sharpness, ''I think Marilyn was speaking.''
He stopped.
''I appreciate that you said 'happy holidays,' Justin,'' the librarian said calmly, ''because I celebrate Hanukkah.''
''Oh,'' he said, as though it had never occurred to him. ''Happy Hanukkah then.''
And when Mr. Rossilli finally agreed to meet on that cold morning in January 2010, in an office with posters of Mickey Mouse on the wall, Justin was better prepared than he had ever been.
''Hi, Randy,'' he said, sticking out his hand. ''What is your favorite Disney animation?''
Mr. Rossilli did not miss a beat. ''My favorite Disney animated film was 'Jungle Book,' and my favorite character of all time is Baloo the Bear,'' he answered.
'' 'Jungle Book' is a great Disney animated film,'' Justin concurred. ''It was released in 1969.''
''As a matter of fact, let me show you how much I love the film,'' Mr. Rossilli said, rolling up his sleeve to reveal a tattoo of Baloo.
''Oh,'' Justin said reverently, reaching out his hand to touch it. ''That's beautiful.''
With Ms. Stanton-Paule and Ms. Wallace on the sofa beside their student, Mr. Rossilli flipped through Justin's portfolio and his composition book, trying to ignore the feeling that he was interviewing a star who had come with his manager.
''How do you keep your focus when you're doing your art?'' he asked.
''I don't know,'' Justin replied, staring off at the Mickey Mouse poster.
Ms. Stanton-Paule forced herself to remain silent.
Then Justin looked his potential first boss in the eye. ''I use my brain,'' he said.
Mr. Rossilli was impressed with Justin's passion for a craft he loved himself. But his offer of a two-day-a-week unpaid internship was a business decision. The company was developing a property called ''Tinosaurs.'' There was no doubt that Justin could draw tiny, and he just might have the attention to detail it would take to learn animation.
''We've got the same haircut,'' Mr. Rossilli joked at the end of the meeting. ''People might think you're a better-looking version of me.''
''Yeah,'' Justin agreed, unaware that he was teasing.
Mr. Rossilli smiled. Somehow, it made him all the happier to give Justin a chance.
Finding His Own Voice
Justin had long relied on his mother for direction, and few were more tenacious advocates. Maria Teresa and her husband had divided up their labor, relying on Briant's job, which required frequent travel, for income, while she focused on their son. Even as Justin's internship began at Nightstand, she was pressing his portfolio into the hands of an acquaintance at ''Sesame Street.''
But as the snow melted in the spring of 2010, Justin began to develop what Ms. Wallace called ''his own voice.'' His teachers encouraged it.
Maria Teresa, for instance, encouraged Justin to pack his lunch.
''Do you want to buy lunch sometime?'' Ms. Stanton-Paule asked Justin one morning. Several of the other students went to local restaurants during their breaks.
''I like to buy lunch, but Maria Teresa forbids me,'' Justin replied in his formal way, exaggerating slightly for effect.
''Yeah, but whose life is it?'' Ms. Stanton-Paule asked.
''Mine!'' Justin said.
On another occasion, he complained about his after-school schedule, packed with therapy and social skills classes.
''Kate, I dislike Maria Teresa's opinion sometimes,'' he said. ''I prefer to foil her plans.''
''Well, you need to tell her, Justin,'' Ms. Stanton-Paule said. ''You have to say, 'I would rather do it at a different time.' ''
Justin spoke his mind, too, in a cartooning class he was auditing at Montclair State University (Ms. Stanton-Paule quietly helped him enter through the college's program for the gifted, avoiding the provost's objections). One classmate credited Justin's suggestion that she use Porky Pig in an illustration of swine flu with making her project funnier and improving her grade.
And if Nightstand was not the permanent job they had all hoped for, it was a work experience that could not have been replicated in school.
Justin's teachers taught him to take the public bus to the office, first accompanying him and then spying from afar. Since he did not talk to himself when he listened to music, Ms. Stanton-Paule coached him to avoid drawing hostile looks by turning on his iPod.
Ms. Wallace advised him on his dress.
''You look like a geek, Justin,'' she told him when he pulled his pants up too high one day.
''A geek!'' Justin exclaimed, fascinated. ''Why do I look like a geek?''
''Let your pants ride,'' she said, and he pushed them down on his hips.
Most days, Justin remembered to greet his colleagues by name and to ask, ''How was your weekend?'' Next came a lesson in following up. How about, Ms. Stanton-Paule suggested, ''Did you have a good time?''
Because Justin could be overwhelmed by verbal information, Ms. Stanton-Paule asked his co-worker and chief tutor, Javier Manzione, 30, to sit next to him with his computer and encouraged him to refocus Justin when necessary. ''You're not hurting his feelings,'' she assured him.
Over the following weeks, Justin learned to animate an arm, to lip-sync a character's voice and, perhaps just as importantly, to make small talk with colleagues. It helped that their interest in animation was as genuine as his.
One afternoon, Mr. Manzione heard Justin muttering lines from ''Family Guy.'' ''Was that the episode they were on the couch throwing up in the living room?'' he asked.
''Yes!'' Justin answered, surprised. No one had ever interrupted his self-talking before except to tell him to stop.
He completed every assignment he was given and was the only one to complain when a snow day forced the office to close. But when Justin came in for a morning entirely on his own, yawned, used the bathroom several times and was unable to focus, Mr. Rossilli reported to Ms. Stanton-Paule. And small disruptions to routine threatened his growing social confidence.
One Tuesday morning, for instance, he marched up the steps to the high school to meet Ms. Stanton-Paule before going to work, unaware that standardized tests were being given that day. Ignoring the man with a ''volunteer'' badge at an official-looking table near the entrance, he turned down the hall.
''Can I help you?'' the man asked testily.
Oblivious to the subtle signals that carry so much social meaning -- a tone of voice, a furrowed brow -- Justin took the question literally. ''I don't need your help,'' he said.
''Yes, you do,'' the man replied, his voice rising. Justin, with his dark buzz cut and large backpack, appeared to be just another test-taker arriving late -- and rude to boot. ''Do you have ID?''
''I don't have ID because I graduated,'' Justin proclaimed proudly. ''I'm here to see Kate Stanton-Paule.''
A guard hearing the ruckus advised him, not unkindly, to come back another time. But when Justin, outside, called Ms. Stanton-Paule's cellphone, as she had taught him to do in emergencies, he grew confused by her voice mail and hung up.
''I am waiting patiently,'' he informed a snowdrift.
For Ms. Stanton-Paule waiting inside, the episode was among the most nerve-racking in the program so far. Her boss, Keith Breiman, who supervised special education at the high school, was the one to spot Justin kicking the snow outside his window.
''Kate,'' Dr. Breiman said, delivering him to the meeting room. ''I believe Justin was looking for you.''
Practicing for Independence
When Ms. Stanton-Paule visited Florida with her family the following month, she received a message from Justin.
''Hello,'' it said. ''I wanted to talk to Kate about -- how is, uh, how is -- how is the day, in Florida? See you later!''
Weeks of cellphone practice had paid off. Later that month, when Justin's parents drove to Michigan for Julian's college graduation, leaving Justin alone for the first time, he promised to keep in touch by texting, his new preferred mode of communication. ''Why are you interrupting my independence?'' he asked his mother when she called from the road.
Less successful were the friendships Ms. Stanton-Paule had sought to foster with other students in the program. Fearing that Justin would not leave his room all weekend, the Canhas paid one of his teaching assistants to meet him at Starbucks. Told that they were to meet ''for a drink,'' Justin had his drink and immediately departed.
He was more interested in completing his latest ''Tinosaur'' sketch for Mr. Rossilli -- a kind of ''Where's Waldo?'' with dinosaurs. His first rendition had too much white space, Mr. Rossilli told him, a comment Justin took with a new humility.
''Randy gave me a feedback,'' Justin told his co-worker, Mr. Manzione, and revised the drawing until Mr. Rossilli declared it perfect.
But Justin still needed more one-on-one training to become an animator than Nightstand could provide, and by the summer of 2010, Mr. Rossilli had signaled that the internship would need to end. The business was faltering, and he needed to lay off his last two employees.
The Canhas learned too, that the state's Division of Developmental Disabilities, where Justin would apply for support after the transition program ended, had threatened major budget cuts. And in the fall, they were told, Ms. Wallace's hours in the transition program would be cut in half.
At home, Briant and Maria Teresa's voices rose as they discussed Justin's future. None of Justin's artwork had sold that year.
''Maybe 'Sesame Street' will come through,'' Maria Teresa ventured.
''Let's just deal with what's in front of us,'' Briant insisted.
''I don't like the parents discussing in the background,'' Justin told a visitor. ''I prefer the apartment.''
The next month, he woke his mother in the night, crying. He had had a nightmare, about ''parents' death and my death,'' he told her.
It was, his mother thought, the first time he had registered what it would mean to truly be on his own.
A Friend, at Last
In January 2010, Gower Nibley, another student with autism who had joined the transition program the previous fall, received a text on his cellphone from Justin.
''My baloney has a first name, it's H-O-M-E-R,'' it read, the first line of a ''Simpsons'' takeoff on an iconic advertising jingle. Gower's phone soon buzzed again: ''My baloney has a second name,'' this text said. ''It's H-O-M-E-R.''
On his way to his internship at a nursing home, Gower, 20, let out a giggle.
The grin that spread across Justin's face whenever he saw Gower was striking. And Ms. Stanton-Paule, who was struggling to convince Justin's parents that this budding friendship was a priority, hastened to schedule time for the two to eat lunch together. She created ''Plan an Activity'' worksheets so that they would not stand each other up by accident when they intended to get together, as had already happened more than once.
But with just five months left in the program, a rare fissure had opened between the teacher and Justin's parents. Maria Teresa insisted that Justin was spending too much time on activities that did not involve finding work. ''Kate,'' Maria Teresa had told her sharply in a voice mail, ''you need to get on top of this!''
Over the summer of 2010, the Canhas had enrolled Justin in a cake-decorating course; if he could not immediately find employment in animation, a job at a bakery, they all agreed, would allow him to use his artistic talent. He would enjoy decorating cakes with cartoon characters, Justin told his teacher, ''because it cheers people up.''
That September, Maria Teresa had peppered Ms. Stanton-Paule with suggestions of gourmet bakeries where Justin might intern. The voice mail followed when a few weeks passed and the busy teacher had not yet followed up on all her leads.
But by October, Ms. Stanton-Paule had prevailed on Gencarelli's Bakery in nearby Bloomfield to train Justin to dip cookies. And at a tense meeting in January, she told the Canhas that Justin needed to spend time with fellow students, even taking time to attend a class she was teaching on relationships and sexuality.
Maria Teresa objected. How could they be sure Gencarelli's would turn into a real job? Perhaps he should take an animation class at Montclair State.
Briant, jet-lagged from a trip, closed his eyes.
Ms. Stanton-Paule held her ground. ''Justin's social competence is going to be a huge gauge of whether he is accepted in the workplace,'' she said. Beyond that, she thought, he simply needed a friend.
Gower, who liked classic Hanna-Barbera cartoons like ''Scooby-Doo,'' took Justin's probing, often repetitive questions about animation with a seriousness that no one else did. (''Sadly, in 2006, William Barbera passed away,'' Justin had informed his friend.)
''You know, Brooks,'' Gower commented to a teaching assistant who was with them at the supermarket, ''I think if there were ever a trivia contest about cartoons, Justin would win.''
''Thanks,'' Justin said, looking sideways at Gower.
But Gower was considered higher-functioning than Justin. His interests included weather and geography, and he had a girlfriend. Fearing that Gower would tire of Justin's single-minded focus, Ms. Stanton-Paule had urged Justin to broaden his discussion topics. But it was slow going.
At the meeting in January, Ms. Stanton-Paule finally turned to Justin: ''Would you like to continue to make time for getting together with Gower?''
''Yes!'' he exclaimed.
Maria Teresa began to cry. Of course she wanted her son to have a friend. It was just that the responsibility for Justin's future was suddenly almost unbearable, she apologized. She wanted so desperately for him to live up to his promise.
''Kate,'' she said, ''what will we do without you?''
Her husband reached over and put his hand on her arm.
Going It Alone
One day as Justin dipped cookies in chocolate in the bakery, a baker bumped into a co-worker carrying a tub of custard.
''Oh, did I hit the bucket?'' she exclaimed, her words slurring somewhat in her alarm.
Justin, thinking she had used profanity to express frustration, rushed over. ''It is not appropriate to curse at work,'' he lectured her, proceeding to supply a lengthy list of alternatives. She might consider ''fudge,'' for instance, or ''fiddlesticks.''
''You're right, Justin,'' the woman said, though she explained through her laughter that she had not, in fact, cursed.
The report of the incident, by amused bakery employees, filled Ms. Stanton-Paule with unexpected joy. Justin had not needed her prompting to interact with his colleagues. And they had not needed her to decipher his quirks.
Ariel Tuck, 21, Justin's supervisor, found herself enjoying his spontaneous off-key singing. Justin was not quite as fast as the other interns, Ms. Tuck told the bakery's co-owner, but his work was neater. Justin was filling up entire racks of cookies now, 14 trays at a time. With each new assignment, she had learned to ask him to use the notepad Ms. Stanton-Paule had supplied; drawing the shapes helped him remember which cookies went with which color sprinkles.
Justin received his first paycheck, for $84, in March, shortly after the Valentine's Day rush, where he learned to write with chocolate for the first time. For now, he would work two days a week, at minimum wage.
''Right now I am dipping cookies,'' Justin told people. ''Maybe someday I will decorate cakes.''
That winter his mother made time to arrange a visit for Justin with Paloma Kalisch, a Manhattan teenager and fellow animation buff with a form of high-functioning autism who was, as Justin put it, ''a big fan of me.''
Paloma had followed Justin's art career on his Web site after meeting him once at an exhibit, and her mother had sought out Maria Teresa. When the two met at the Kalisches' home, Justin drew Paloma's favorite character, Tod the Fox, in a composition book she had bought as an homage to him. A few months later, both mothers drew back as Justin took Paloma's hand after a visit to his solo exhibition at the gallery in Chelsea.
''Don't be curious,'' he told his mother when she asked about the pile of fox pictures he was collecting on his desk at home. ''Don't be interested.''
If there was a hint that something more than friendship could grow -- perhaps with Justin's adoption of vegetables into his diet, after watching Paloma eat a salad -- their discussion seldom strayed from animation.
But one spring morning with Gower, Justin took a conversational leap. ''I hate moving,'' Justin confided on their walk in a local park, recounting the places and dates of his moves, as he had so often done for himself over the years. Gower told him that he, too, disliked moving.
The young men lay down in a field and looked up at the sky. Justin told Gower that he planned on saving money, and that he might get a cat when he moved to his own apartment.
''Once I move into the apartment I'm going to feel so relieved,'' Justin said. Gower would be welcome to visit whenever he wanted.
Ms. Stanton-Paule visited the bakery once more before the transition program ended in June, just as Ms. Tuck -- whom Justin enjoyed calling ''my boss'' -- was showing him how to make cookies that looked like rolled-up diplomas and hats.
Another part-time job had come through for him too, stocking shelves at an art supply store. And this year, at least, he would have a state-financed job coach a few hours a week and $16,000 in aid for continued training in independent living skills like banking, shopping and cooking.
His teacher watched him for a while as he worked.
Finally, he turned around.
''What are you still doing here, Kate?'' he asked, his trademark bluntness making her smile.
''I'm just watching, Justin,'' she said. ''Is it O.K.?''
''Oh, O.K.,'' he said.
She stayed for a little longer. Then she slipped away, the glass door closing behind her.

HEADLINE: In Berlin's Tech Scene, Hopes for the Economy

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH

 BODY:
BERLIN -- The courtyard of the nightclub Picknick was packed with partygoers dancing, shouting over the music and snapping photographs of one another, by all appearances just another night in this dilettante party capital. But appearances, on this recent Saturday night, were very much deceiving.
The images snapped with iPhones and Android smartphones were projected in a constantly changing slideshow on the side of the neighboring building by a new photo-sharing application called EyeEm. The plastic foam clouds dangling from the wires crisscrossing overhead were the logos for the popular audio-sharing service called SoundCloud, which has roughly seven million users.
Both companies, co-hosts of the event, are part of Berlin's rapidly growing Internet start-up scene, which has won the attention of investors in Britain and California, including the high-profile actor-investor Ashton Kutcher, who is a backer of SoundCloud.
''I kind of get the feeling that the whole city of Berlin is a start-up,'' said Alexander Ljung, chief executive and one of the founders of SoundCloud. ''It's fast-moving, chaotic. You don't really know where it's headed, but you know it's headed in a good direction, and that's a start-up feel.'' 
Mr. Ljung and his co-founder and chief technology officer, Eric Wahlforss, met in the computer labs at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. But the two Swedes decided to move to Berlin to start their company, which now employs nearly 70 people there.
Berliners will vote Sunday to elect the city-state's next Parliament and, in the process, on the future of Klaus Wowereit, the city's long-serving, popular mayor. Polls suggest he will win re-election, but his ambitions for federal office -- he has even had his name bandied about in the media as a potential candidate for German chancellor, following in the footsteps of a former West Berlin mayor, Willy Brandt -- will be affected by the future of the city he has governed since 2001.
With the vote nearing, a national debate over the fate of the reunified capital has broken out in the German news media, over the pub-crawl tourism that residents say is ruining the downtown, over fast-rising rents and even the burning of automobiles that have been rampant this year. The city's heavy debt burden and reliance on money from richer states like Bavaria and Baden-Wurttemberg were the subject of a cover story in the weekly news magazine Focus.
It was Mr. Wowereit who coined the famous catchphrase of Berlin as ''poor, but sexy,'' that has stuck to the city, which has an unemployment rate of 13.3 percent, the highest of any state in Germany and well above the national average of 7 percent. He chose to aggressively market the city as a creative capital, emphasizing fashion, art and music, hoping that the magnetic effect of the city's popularity with tourists would rub off on the economy.
Peter Englisch, a partner with Ernst & Young in Germany responsible for midsize companies, said that Berlin had done a good job of marketing itself, but not as good a job nurturing the companies it attracted. ''A lot of other cities have start-up support, welcome packages,'' Mr. Englisch said. ''It's an inspiring environment, but the second step, turning potential into growth, is where I'm pretty sure Wowereit isn't doing enough.''
Berlin has been a creative hub and a destination for young expatriates from other places for years. But its hipness never translated into badly needed jobs for a metropolis that could not recover an industrial prowess that was wrecked by war and division. Now the developing Internet start-up community is offering a tantalizing glimpse of a possible economic future for a city that for years appeared to have none.
''With Depression, war, fascism, the wall and the mass migration of talent out of Berlin, it's quite clear that the city was set back by historical circumstances,'' said Richard Florida, professor of business and creativity at the University of Toronto, whose research has drawn a link between bohemians and economic growth. ''Looking at the experience of other cities that remade themselves, like Pittsburgh, shifting to an open technology-savvy creative economy takes at minimum a generation.''
One of the guests jostled by the crush of people at the party at Picknick was Florian Weber, a German who was one of the original engineers at Twitter and now one of the founders of a new site called Amen. ''When I moved to Berlin four or five years ago it was a very different time. You rarely saw start-ups. Now, in the last one or two years you see people really doing innovative things,'' Mr. Weber said.
It was perhaps inevitable that the start-up scene, concentrated around Rosenthaler Platz in the central Mitte district, would earn the moniker ''Silicon Allee,'' after the much-imitated Silicon Valley and the German word for avenue. The question is whether the city can live up to the hype.
''In the next two years we will have a multibillion-euro company here in Berlin,'' said Christian Reber, 25, the chief executive and one of the founders of the company 6Wunderkinder. Mr. Reber, who, unlike many of the foreigners, hails from the nearby city of Brandenburg, is a vocal booster of the tech community and an equally harsh critic of the clones of American and other foreign Web sites that Germany had been known for until recently.
''I was at a conference and a guy said Germans are perfect executors, but too uncreative to create technology,'' Mr. Reber said.
''I grew up learning we were the land of 'Dichter und Denker,' '' he said, using the German for poets and thinkers. ''I hate copycats. I hate stealing ideas.''
In the brick-and-mortar world, the center of the scene is St. Oberholz, a cafe at the busy intersection of Rosenthaler Strasse and Torstrasse, home to the monthly mixer known as the Silicon Allee meet-up. The advantages that made it so popular with the tech people that it was one of SoundCloud's unofficial first offices are not apparent at first sight: extra power outlets, unlimited free Internet and a welcoming attitude for people who want to set up shop and do their work there.
On an average afternoon the cafe could almost be mistaken for an Apple store, with all the Mac laptops open on the tables. Ansgar Oberholz, the cafe's owner, said the development had come in spite of the city government, not because of it. ''They don't grasp it structurally and when they do, they do it wrong,'' Mr. Oberholz said.

HEADLINE: Staying Put In a City of Change

BYLINE: By SAM DOLNICK

 BODY:
LOUIS SAVARESE, the son and grandson of butchers, was raised to know the difference between a rib-eye roast and a cross-rib roast, but he is the first in his family to appreciate the finer points of cow hooves and chicken feet.
The Savarese family has run Michael's Prime Meats on Nostrand Avenue in Flatbush, Brooklyn, since 1931. As the neighborhood changed from a mix of Irish, Jewish and Italian families to a solidly Caribbean enclave, the fare has changed as well.
''Forty years ago, we wouldn't have a cow foot,'' Mr. Savarese said, pointing to a bucket of them. Goat meat, oxtail, Jamaican curry powder -- these are the gradual changes that have allowed Michael's to stay open as so many of its neighbors have closed to make way for wig stores and West Indian bakeries.
''We're the last one,'' Mr. Savarese said, slicing into a side of beef. 
In a city where Jewish neighborhoods turn Puerto Rican, then African and then something else, Mr. Savarese belongs to the sparse ranks of holdouts who have held firm amid the city's churn, even as newcomers have remade the streets around them. They dig in for many reasons: love of place, loyalty, optimism or sheer stubbornness. Nostalgia grounds some, inertia others. But all of them can still imagine, as they look out on their reshaped blocks, the neighbors and businesses that left decades ago.
At Michael's, a woman carrying two shopping bags pushed open the door on a recent afternoon and asked, in a Caribbean lilt, for the price of the oxtail. It was $6.29 a pound, she was told. ''Lord have mercy,'' she said, backing out the door.
Mr. Savarese's disparate tribe of holdouts includes an Irish bar owner in Brooklyn's version of Chinatown, an artist hanging on in a zone of shoppers and tourists, and a drum maker who still creates them by hand. Taken together, they offer a twist on New York's famous promise of reinvention. Theirs are stories of staying put.
''I call it the die-hard effect,'' said Joseph J. Salvo, the director of the population division of the Department of City Planning. ''There are people who will not leave. Irrespective of the change that is occurring, they regard that as their home.''
''The smaller the number gets,'' Mr. Salvo added, ''the stronger the die-hard effect.''
ONCE upon a time -- actually, about 40 years ago -- two brothers from Ireland bought two popular bars in Brooklyn, where longshoremen and firefighters played darts and bought their friends round after round. The families still own the bars, and the brothers, if they were still alive, would recognize much about them: shamrock posters, weathered dartboards, old men nursing morning beers.
But thanks to New York's fickle demographic tides, the two bars have found themselves in very different worlds, with very different fortunes.
The Soccer Tavern, in Sunset Park, has flourished, adopted by the Chinese community around it. Meanwhile, the Lief Erickson in Bay Ridge -- its name a vestige of the Norwegians who settled in the neighborhood -- is languishing amid a growing population of Arabs who frown on alcohol.
''Chinese people drink,'' said Julie Walsh, owner of the Lief Erickson, which sat nearly empty on a recent afternoon. ''If every Middle Easterner around here would be spending money, the place would be booming.''
Over in Sunset Park, the changes are impossible to miss. Census data show that the area's Irish population fell by half, to about 1,347, from 1980 to 2009, while the number of Chinese grew more than tenfold, to over 26,000.
But even more striking evidence can be found among the dart trophies that line the back wall opposite Jimmy Gillick, daytime bartender and keeper of the house corned-beef-hash recipe. A scratched plaque from the NYC Dart League lists the champions for 1998-99: Farley, Luno, O'Sullivan, Connolly, Hennessy, Price.
The winter 2009 trophy: Mei, Chan, Zhu, Manczuk, Farley.
''When we walk into other bars, they say, 'Here comes the Chirish team,' '' Brendan Farley, the bar's owner, said in a thick brogue.
Other changes have crept in. A Chinese calendar hangs on the wall. Chinese New Year is one of the bar's biggest nights. On Christmas, the tavern hosts an international pot luck dinner; the Chinese regulars bring in a whole roasted pig, and Mr. Gillick cooks up his hash.
Irish or Chinese, his customers speak a common language of tipped glasses and back slaps. In their own dive-bar way, they have broadened one another's worlds.
''I didn't even know what bok choy was,'' said John Bleszcz, a retired city sanitation worker, sitting at the bar the other morning.
''It's a mild cabbage,'' answered Steve Constantin, a few stools down. ''Or a mild radish.''
About a mile away, Mr. Farley's cousin, Ms. Walsh, waited for customers, who rarely trickle in from the nearby mosques, halal butchers and hookah shops.
''We got them, and they don't drink and they put people like me out of business,'' she said. ''That's what happens.''
WHEN Ivy Brown moved into a fourth-floor loft in the meatpacking district of Manhattan in 1985, the blocks around her building were a desolate precinct of transvestite prostitutes, sex clubs and slaughterhouses.
''Nobody lived here,'' Ms. Brown, 49, said. ''It was nasty. It was gritty. It was gross.''
Friends and family were afraid to visit her apartment, on Hudson Street near 14th Street. Her electricity was spotty. But over the years, this self-described ''nice Jewish girl'' grew to love her adopted neighborhood, where she cycled through 17 roommates and was free to make art and, eventually, open a gallery that she still operates in her living room.
She gave her old dresses to the prostitutes, who made sure she got home safe. She befriended the bouncers and stopped eating meat, even if she grew to almost like the smell of animal blood. She was home.
But Ms. Brown, a birdlike woman with a pixie haircut, stylish glasses and always-moving hands, has spent the past decade watching her neighborhood slowly vanish. ''Things start to disappear,'' she said. ''We lost the laundromat and the shoemaker and the hardware store.''
What was once the Locker Room, a sex club where patrons checked their clothes at the door, is now a cosmopolitan bar with pressed-tin ceilings. J's Hangout, a gay club in her building into which men used to vanish for days, is now a splashy Mexican restaurant with blaring dance music and tacos that cost $18. Stretch Hummers and off-duty bankers have replaced the meat trucks and swingers. The Whitney Museum of American Art is moving nearby.
Ms. Brown said she used to feel as if she were living in a surreal movie. From her window, she could see butchers ''in white coats covered in blood, warming their hands over fires in oil cans as pig carcasses are flying by.''
Now she has a view of the Apple store, where lines wind around the block whenever a new gadget is released. ''I'm used to seeing some things outside,'' she said, ''but not white people in sleeping bags.''
She has become something of a hero to stalwarts; a blog dedicated to ''Vanishing New York'' has cataloged her memories. She has thought about moving, but not seriously; her rent-stabilized apartment and its 18 windows would be impossible to match.
Ms. Brown pines for the old days -- ''I cannot believe I miss that stench!'' -- but she understands the futility of New York nostalgia. ''If you embrace this city, you have to embrace the fact that it's not going to stay the same,'' she said.
Instead, she is waiting for the neighborhood to change again. ''Somewhere else is going to be the area, and everyone will go there,'' she said.
And until then, she added, ''I'm still holding on.''
AT this year's Miss Norway competition in Bay Ridge, only 2 of the 13 contestants were from Brooklyn. They both lost.
A generation ago, not only would the entire slate have hailed from the borough, but most would probably have been from the Bay Ridge neighborhood, the hub for Norwegians in New York, said Arlene Rutuelo, a pageant organizer who doubles as the neighborhood's de facto cultural ambassador.
Ms. Rutuelo and her mother, Helene Bakke, run Nordic Delicacies, a business that has become much more than just a shop for cod liver oil and lingonberry jam.
As the neighborhood's Norwegian-American population plummeted, to 1,135 from a high of tens of thousands around World War II, according to the most recent census estimates, and nearly every other Norwegian business in Bay Ridge closed, Nordic Delicacies became a Scandinavian clearinghouse. People call requesting recipes for dishes their grandmothers used to make. They ask for the date of the annual parade, and for the phone number of the Swedish Consulate. So many people asked for souvenirs that Ms. Rutuelo set aside a counter, next to the cold cuts, for miniature flags and traditional Scandinavian troll dolls.
''We're the official Norwegian information center,'' she said.
When the store opened in 1987, the plan was for Ms. Bakke to cook the head cheese and salted lamb rib, using recipes from her childhood in Kvinesdal, Norway, and for Ms. Rutuelo to run the business. Bay Ridge ''was a Norwegian village,'' Ms. Rutuelo recalled. ''Every business you could think of had a Norwegian.''
Today, her neighbors include a falafel shop, a sushi bar, two Polish diners, a Russian bodega, a Mexican grocery and an Indian restaurant.
On a recent afternoon, a customer walked into Nordic Delicacies and eyed the pickled herring, next to the fish balls in brine, before settling on the pea soup.
''I wouldn't have thought 25 years ago that we would be the last one left,'' Ms. Bakke said. ''I never would have imagined.''
IN Cali Rivera's workshop in the South Bronx, layers of smoke and grime that are older than his grandchildren cover the heaps of jumbled tools he has used to make countless drums of every pitch and size for more than 40 years.
His business, J. C. R. Percussion, has stayed open year after year despite pressure from all sides. Development around the new Yankee Stadium threatened to push him out, but he stayed firm -- and rooted for the Mets. When rents rose and old neighbors left, he dug in even deeper.
But his lifelong battle extends beyond the borders of Highbridge, a neighborhood of bodegas and fried-plantain shops, to the economy of cookie-cutter factories, outsourced labor and even modernity itself. In an era when youngsters play the drums on iPhone apps and pop music is made on laptops, Mr. Rivera, hunched over a welder's flame in a smoke-filled closet, is a holdout against time.
''Everything you see here, I put it together,'' he said, surrounded by cowbells, bongos and faded photographs tacked to the wall. ''It was created by me!''
Most of his competitors have their drums made in factories overseas, but Mr. Rivera's instruments are made in his basement workshop, where his assistant clatters and bangs to a blaring salsa soundtrack.
''If you don't do it by hand, it doesn't go coo-coo,'' Mr. Rivera said, smacking a cowbell he made that morning. ''It goes blegh-blegh.''
The neighborhood has changed as many Puerto Ricans have left, to be replaced by Dominicans, Mexicans and Africans. But new neighbors have made for new customers. Downstairs, Mr. Rivera's assistant worked one day on a set of Ashiko drums for an African musician.
''I'm not going to be rich, never,'' Mr. Rivera, 61, said. ''But it satisfies me.''
His spit-and-sweat operation seems galaxies away from 21st-century New York. His drumheads, stored in a bathroom, are the stretched skins of mules and goats from Venezuela. To loosen them up, he soaks the skins in a bucket in another bathroom, beneath the urinal.
Mr. Rivera starts most sentences with a curse word and ends them with a wheezy laugh. His stoop serves as a local clubhouse where men drink beer and tell jokes in Spanish.
Mr. Rivera was born in Puerto Rico and came to Highbridge in the late 1950s. He began making cowbells in his apartment, then switched to a studio on Ogden Avenue. He took over his current space, once an Irish bar, about two decades ago.
Business has been slow lately, and his daughter has been nagging him to give up the shop. But orders still come in, and customers still stop by to play the timbales and discuss salsa.
''This is the only place I got,'' Mr. Rivera said. ''This is what made me happy. We'll keep banging.''

HEADLINE: Steps Away, But Living Worlds Apart In the City

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE. 
E-mail: bigcity@nytimes.com

 BODY:
For decades, the intersection of Park Avenue and 96th Street has remained one of the city's most obvious and despairing emblems of disparity, with East Harlem and its challenges spreading out to the north, and a vast gridlock of extraordinary privilege colonizing the acreage below. It is worth debating whether a visit to this corner ought to be mandated for tourists; few spots so profoundly render the truths of New York's economic extremism. Liberal parents hoping to foster their own political values in their children might consider pilgrimages. When I stood there, as a teenager, for the first time in the early 1980s, I felt a call to fierce and equalizing justice, ready, suddenly, for Latin American guerrilla work and the Red Brigades.
Park and 96th may have no equal in impact, but years of gentrification have given it many rivals. On Schermerhorn Street between Hoyt and Bond in Brooklyn, the contrasts between those who need and those who want have become so stark they might have been conjured by satirists. On Tuesday afternoon, not far outside No. 225, home to the Addison, a doorman-attended apartment building of recent vintage, an aging African-American man dressed in jeans and a hospital gown was being led into a police car in handcuffs as Fresh Direct boxes were loaded onto the sidewalk, readied for delivery. 
Just around the corner at the Linden branch of the city's Human Resources Administration, Lawanna Warren, 90 days out of prison on a drug sale charge, looked unsuccessfully for work and wished for her previous job cleaning floors at Chelsea Piers. At 253 Schermerhorn there is an office providing food stamps to those subsisting on Social Security. Across the street from it, at No. 200, is Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare, a two-year-old restaurant whose single offering is a prix fixe of 18 to 20 small courses for $185 a person (before tax and gratuity). Reservations are taken six weeks in advance.
Among the echelons of the upper middle class, there is a smug pride often taken in the edgy address, as if poor people existed to lend the better off a veneer of adventurous chic. If this column has an agenda, it is, in part, to actively record the incongruities and hypocrisies that so easily attach to life in this city -- to document, substantiate and contextualize them, to observe the lives and mechanisms of New York from their various and discordant vantage points.
It can be easy to focus on the glossy residential towers by name-brand architects and the continued presence of $3,000 pumps at Barneys and imagine that the city has been largely buffered from the economic hardships siphoning the spirit of so much of the country. For most of this year, the unemployment rate for New York has sat below the national average. Tourists have come (close to 49 million of them last year). Economists have evinced surprise at what is considered to be a recession of shorter duration and less penetration here.
But as with so much of the business of interpreting New York, the affluent world of Manhattan and its satellites appear misleadingly to represent the whole. The August unemployment statistics, announced Thursday, put the city's rate at 8.7 percent -- again slightly below the country's rate. In Manhattan in July, the figure stood at 7.1 percent, but in the Bronx the same month, the number remained in the double digits at 12.3 percent. For every month this year, unemployment in the Bronx has hovered more than three percentage points above the city average. (Bronx County has the highest rate of unemployment in the state.) In Brooklyn, New York's most populous borough, unemployment has not succeeded in falling below 9 percent this year.
And then there is the pronounced and endlessly dispiriting racial discrepancy in the numbers. For the 12-month period beginning in August 2010 and ending in July, black unemployment rates in New York averaged 12.8 percent, more than five points higher than those of whites, while Hispanic rates were close to four points higher than those of whites. The gap between blacks and whites has narrowed since the earliest days of the recession, but only because white unemployment has jumped; ultimately, the recession has just widened the divide.
In the country, New York ranks third behind Washington and Atlanta as a city with a population over 250,000 with the highest income inequality. Manhattan on its own, however, leaves all of its competitors far behind. At $837,668, the average household income (a 2009 figure) of those Manhattanites in the top 5 percent is 81 times as much as the average income of those in the bottom 20 percent ($10,328). Among the lowest quintile living in the Bronx, the figure is even lower: $6,692.
Bolstering the distorted image of an ever-glistening and prosperous city is a popular culture that has generally not let the recession interfere with its vision of New York as a fantasy place where shopping and mating lucratively would seem to make up the sole purpose of human endeavor. During the recession of the late 1980s and early '90s, movies like ''Working Girl,'' ''The Bonfire of the Vanities'' and ''Jungle Fever'' took the city's class and racial tensions as their prevailing themes.
The recent downturn has instead given us ''Confessions of a Shopaholic'' (recovering retail addict winds up with wealthy businessman), ''Bride Wars'' (where the goal is to marry at the Plaza), ''The Switch'' (Jennifer Aniston finds her happily ever after with a friend/sperm donor/financial analyst living on the Promenade in Brooklyn Heights) and, most splashily of all, ''Sex and the City 2'' and its world of lacquered East Side domesticity. In the film, spending panic sets in only at the threat of a $20,000-a-night hotel-room bill. (''Precious,'' though a rare document of poverty, is set during the Reagan era.)
It is worth comparing as well Sinatra's ''New York, New York'' to Jay-Z's ''Empire State of Mind,'' the first an anthem of aspiration, the second a flamboyant chronicle of arrival. (''I am Sinatra,'' Jay-Z declares in a song that also references Anna Wintour.)
One of the many disheartening aspects of being out of work for any protracted period is the extent to which it can eradicate the ambition this city so feverishly romanticizes. In recent visits to two Workforce1 job-placement centers run by the city, one in the Bronx and the other in Brooklyn, I met a few women who had been laid off and forced onto public assistance, their confidence drained. At the Workforce1 office on East 149th Street, I watched a job counselor, Rhodina Smith, assisting someone in a better but still difficult circumstance. The applicant, Michelle Joseph, had a college degree and had worked for 12 years in the St. Lucia Mission to the United Nations. She spoke Creole and some French and had trained diplomats.
''If I had a magic wand and could give you any job you wanted, what would it be?'' Ms. Smith asked.
''Anything,'' was the reply.

HEADLINE: The Vital Importance of Manufacturing

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Woe is us if the headline on your recent article, ''Is Manufacturing Falling Off the Radar?'' (Sept. 11), is answered in the affirmative.
If the economic downturn has revealed anything, it is that true, sustainable wealth creation -- and the jobs that come along with it -- will not arise from the gambling casinos of Wall Street. The key to a healthy economy, and the viability of a middle class, can only be found in an innovative manufacturing sector.
While many Americans believe in manufacturing's importance to the economy, many also have an outdated view of manufacturing as a sweaty, grimy business. Nothing, of course, could be further from the truth, as productivity gains in our increasingly high-tech manufacturing sector attest. 
This perception problem is at the root of the article's provocative question. Many industry executives and associations have been working hard to change this unfortunate view, but without leadership at the national level, the problem has persisted.
That is why I and others have suggested a cabinet-level Department of Manufacturing. This agency would help put industry on the strategic footing it needs -- in the federal government, in the industry itself and in the hearts and minds of all Americans. It would help drive home the idea that manufacturing is the bedrock of the economy.
David R. Brousell
Manhattan, Sept. 11
The writer is editor in chief of Manufacturing Executive.
To the Editor:
As for the financial sector replacing manufacturing in its effect on the economy, do we really need more derivative products and the like?
Obviously, one benefit of the manufacturing sector, besides jobs, is the income it generates for the middle class. In my experience, the decreasing size of the manufacturing sector is directly responsible for increasing income disparities, which in turn has a direct economic impact in the form of anemic overall growth. Robert E. Anderson

Tax Cuts for Business?
To the Editor:
In ''How to Make Business Want to Invest Again'' (Economic View, Sept. 11), N. Gregory Mankiw suggested a cut in corporate taxation as a first step toward encouraging companies to investment in the economy. Other business columnists have made similar recommendations, all despite news reports that some major corporations have paid either minimal or no taxes for years.
Business organizations clamor for tax cuts as the solution to any problem they face. But when you ask individual business owners about their lack of investment, they often cite a lack of orders and customers. The current tax rates, especially when rarely paid, are no more a hindrance to investment than they were during the boom decade preceding the downturn.
Arthur D. Aptowitz
Forest Hills, Queens, Sept. 12
To the Editor:
As one possible way to encourage the economy's long-term growth, Professor Mankiw suggested ''tax reform that reduced the burden on capital income and shifted it toward consumption.''
But such a view appears antithetical to any theory for responsible government policy during an economic slowdown. Consumer spending, not corporate investment, is the main driver of the economy, and depressing it further with new tax burdens would be counterproductive to any recovery.
Moreover, the cost of capital is not the main impediment to new capital investment today; instead, it is lack of demand for the additional goods that might be produced. Corporate capital costs are already subsidized with historically low interest rates from the government's aggressive monetary policy.

Sales Pitches on Campus
To the Editor:
In ''On Campus, It's One Big Commercial'' (Sept. 11), we learn that students are working as brand representatives at their schools, promoting products and assisting on corporate-sponsored field trips for late-night shopping sprees.
What has happened to the long-established function of a university as a marketplace of ideas? Oh well, a plain old marketplace will have to do.
David Charak
Boca Raton, Fla., Sept. 12
To the Editor:
Your article on campus commercialization makes me wonder: Why not take the idea an absurd step further?
Seeing that the cost of college education is growing rapidly, and that online education is still derided because a student will lose the ''college experience,'' I propose the following:
Offer all classes online but conduct exams only at the store that bids the most for that class. It's win-win-win: Students can go to school at a greatly reduced price, university coffers are filled and companies can ruthlessly market their wares to teenagers.
And if students and the administrators want to do a little dance in the aisles on the way out from the first exam, all the better -- for the store, at least.

HEADLINE: From an American in London, Global Warnings

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
WOTTON-UNDER-EDGE, England
GOVERNMENTS are pushing austerity; bankers are hoarding cash; a recession looms in the United States and Europe. But Adam S. Posen has a solution: a shock-and-awe display of coordinated central bank attacks aimed at reviving sluggish economies.
An American economist on the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, Mr. Posen is no academic scribbler or lonely blogger, but someone inside the central banking establishment.
And, as a leading expert on what is often called Japan's lost decade, he is particularly worried that the Federal Reserve in the United States and the European Central Bank are making the same monetary policy mistakes that left Japan's once-robust economy stagnant all through the 1990s and even into the 21st century. 
For months now, Mr. Posen -- who got his bully pulpit at the Bank of England by answering an ad in The Economist -- has been warning that policy makers in Washington and in Europe have been too optimistic about how quickly the global economy would recover from the financial crisis.
The joint action by central banks on Thursday to make it easier for weak European banks to borrow dollars is no doubt a policy nod in Mr. Posen's direction, but it is still a far cry from the type of unified bond purchasing program, or quantitative easing, that he is advocating.
When Fed officials meet this week, they are widely expected to take further action to reduce long-term interest rates, a significant turnabout after months of suggesting that a recovery was solidly under way. The European Central Bank has not yet gone so far, but officials have recently signaled a new openness to reducing interest rates or at least to stop raising them.
In simplest terms, Mr. Posen wants central banks to print more money. A lot more money.
There is a certain tilting-at-windmills aspect to his crusade. The Fed will probably stop well short of the aggressive bond buying that Mr. Posen has advocated. Already, some Fed officials -- and most Republican leaders, including the presidential hopefuls Rick Perry and Mitt Romney -- believe that the Fed is at risk of rekindling inflation.
But that hasn't stopped Mr. Posen from pressing his case. Earlier this month, he had lunch with Kiyohiko Nishimura, a deputy governor at the Bank of Japan, and Charles Evans, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. And, last Tuesday, he traveled to this small hamlet in southwest England to issue his most passionate cry yet ''I am here to warn policy makers in the United States, Europe, everywhere that we cannot take our foot off the pedal,'' Mr. Posen said before a roomful of small-business leaders and bankers. ''The outlook is grim -- the right thing to do now is engage in more monetary stimulus.''
Although a few bubbles of sweat appeared on his forehead, Mr. Posen argued his brief here with aplomb -- mixing self-deprecating remarks that touched on the oddity of a 44-year-old American prescribing monetary policy in Britain (''I get paid in pounds and pay rent in pounds,'' he assured his audience) with a trenchant analysis of the economy's various ills (stagnant growth, increasing unemployment and banks that will not lend).
His listeners hailed his proposal that the Bank of England and the British Treasury form a government-backed bank to make small-business loans. But on a day when inflation ticked up to 4.5 percent, among the highest annual rates in Europe, his call to monetary arms received a muted response.
''I am very worried about the consequences of quantitative easing,'' said John Thurston, chairman of Watts, a local company that supplies parts and services to commercial vehicles. Watts has felt the effect of the business slump, but the inflationary impact of more government bond buying worried him.
''I just don't know how you unwind it,'' he said.
Mr. Thurston is not alone in his concern.
On the Bank of England's nine-member monetary policy committee, Mr. Posen was the only one to vote last month for the bank to resume its bond purchasing program, according to minutes of the meeting.
IN addition to the Fed's reluctance to start another bond-buying effort, the European Central Bank is also not expected to continue its current program of purchasing the bonds of weak euro zone economies for much longer.
Mr. Posen's central premise is that governments in Japan, Europe and the United States are running the risk of repeating the policy mistakes of the 1930s, when the conventional wisdom called for strict monetary policy and budget cutting, only deepening the Depression.
Not that central bankers have exactly been sitting on their hands.
Their efforts clearly helped prevent the sharp recession of 2008-9 from turning into something much worse, and the Fed, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan have all bought large amounts of government bonds to help push down interest rates.
Now, with rates touching zero, the view has taken hold that to do more would risk stoking inflation and damage the credibility of central bankers.
But for Mr. Posen, such hand-wringing over inflation when unemployment is spiking in developed countries is not just misguided but irresponsible.
''I am really angry -- we are getting these incredibly wimpy excuses for inaction,'' Mr. Posen said, speaking broadly of central bank attitudes.
''My proposal is that the Bank of England buy $:50 billion in gilts, although a good case can be made for doing more,'' he said, referring to British government bonds.
Amid the secretive world of central banking, Mr. Posen strikes an arresting contrast. He is voluble, eager to please and, not being immune to a bit of gossip, has to restrain himself from revealing market-sensitive details about the bank's inner workings.
More policy entrepreneur than wonk, Mr. Posen used his perch at the Peterson Institute of International Economics in Washington to push his core, Keynes-colored notion that governments and central banks must jump-start economies stuck in a slump when banks and the private sector show that they cannot.
A spate of papers on this topic that pointed to policy dithering in Japan brought him a measure of renown. He also showed an ability to ally himself with name-brand economists and policy makers on both sides of the Atlantic. Early supporters include the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, while he was at Princeton, as well as Mervyn King, before he became governor of the Bank of England.
But it was not until 2009, when Mr. Posen joined the Bank of England, that he was given a chance to advance his views from inside the temple. Unlike the Fed or the European Central Bank, the Bank of England reserves several slots on its policy-making panel for outsiders.
He has an office at the bank's grand headquarters on Threadneedle Street, is expected to show up there no more than three days a week and has the use of two trained economists to assist him in his big thinking and speech-making.
''It's like being a governor of the Federal Reserve, only better because you are not stuck with the crap work,'' Mr. Posen said. He is also very adept at explaining the dry arcana of monetary policy in a way that is understandable and offers up good guys (those in favor of quantitative easing) and bad guys (those who are not).
''Adam is very confident that inflation will come down, and he has said he will eat his hat if that does not happen,'' said Charles Goodhart, an expert on central banks at the London School of Economics and an early mentor to Mr. Posen. ''He may well be right -- but many of his colleagues do not share this belief.''
While it is expected that economists become policy advocates, it is unusual for central bankers to fly their philosophical colors with the ardor that Mr. Posen has shown. ''Amid a culture of group-think, Adam sticks his neck out,'' said Hans-Helmut Kotz, a former board member at the Bundesbank of Germany.
Mr. Posen acknowledges late-night rants on his Facebook page earlier this year when his core thesis -- that extraordinary action was needed to keep Britain from slipping into a second recession -- was not being accepted by his colleagues on the bank's monetary policy committee.
''It was agonizing. I mean I have been doing this for 25 years and here was the possibility that I could be fundamentally wrong,'' he said. ''I was lying awake at night -- ask my wife.''
Even now, with signs of global weakness increasing by the day, it is unclear whether Mr. Posen will win the day.
In fact, many economists argue that with Europe and the United States burdened with a huge overhang of debt, with banks undercapitalized and reluctant to lend and with the American and British housing markets still in the doldrums, central banks are largely powerless to revive growth on their own.
''My position is that once interest rates come to zero, there is not much more a central bank can do to stimulate the economy,'' said Kazuo Ueda, an economist in Tokyo who served on the monetary policy board of the Bank of Japan as it struggled, unsuccessfully, to inject life into the Japanese economy.
In his recent paper, ''The Effectiveness of Nontraditional Monetary Policy Measures: The Case of the Bank of Japan,'' Mr. Ueda suggests that in Japan, structural economic defects and deflation were too powerful for even the most creative monetary policy interventions.
ECONOMISTS who share his view say that what is happening in Europe reinforces the point. Radical monetary easing, they argue, is no substitute for wrenching, yet necessary, structural changes like cutting wages and government spending and recapitalizing zombie banks. If anything, it's an excuse not to put such reforms in place. But to Mr. Posen, those arguments are a poor excuse for inaction.
''The Austrians would say you just have to suffer through it,'' he said, referring to a school of laissez-faire economic thought popularized by Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig Von Mises. ''But suffering is not good for the soul -- monetary policy won't solve all your problems, but it can make things easier.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about the American economist Adam S. Posen, who serves on the Bank of England's policy committee, misspelled part of the name of the town in the dateline and referred incorrectly to its location. Mr. Posen recently spoke in Wotton-Under-Edge in southwest England -- not Wooten-Under-Edge in the southeast of the country.

HEADLINE: Darwin, the Market Whiz

BYLINE: By ROBERT H. FRANK. 
Robert H. Frank is an economics professor at the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University. This essay is adapted from his new book, ''The Darwin Economy: Liberty, Competition and the Common Good.'' (Princeton University Press).

 BODY:
WHO was the greater economist -- Adam Smith or Charles Darwin?
Since Darwin, the pioneering naturalist, never thought of himself as an economist, the question seems absurd. Yet his understanding of competition describes economic reality far more accurately than Smith's. Within the next century, I predict, Darwin will be seen by most economists as the intellectual founder of their discipline.
Smith is renowned for his ''invisible hand'' theory. According to his modern disciples, it holds that unbridled market forces harness self-interest to serve the common good. Darwin understood that individual and group interests sometimes coincide, as in Smith's framework. But Darwin also saw that interests at the two levels often conflict sharply. In those cases, he said, individual interests trump.
A spectacular example from nature illustrates his point. The massive antlers of bull elk are often four feet across and weigh more than 40 pounds. Why so big? Darwin's explanation began with the observation that bull elk, like males in most vertebrate species, take more than one mate if they can. If some succeed, others end up with no mate at all, making them the ultimate losers in the contest to pass along their genes. So bulls fight bitterly for females, and mutations coded for larger antler size help them win. That arms race has produced the gigantic antlers we see today. 
As a group, bulls could better escape from wolves in densely wooded areas if their antlers were smaller, yet any individual bull with relatively small antlers would never win a mate. So bull elk are stuck with unwieldy antlers.
Many 19th-century social Darwinists mistook Darwin's message to be that whatever emerges from the struggle to survive is morally praiseworthy. But Darwin believed no such thing. He understood that competition often favored traits that brought misery to all, and he knew animals like elk could do nothing about it. But human beings, who face similar conflicts, have better options.
Darwin's insight can help us resolve a host of seemingly intractable economic problems in the United States, and in nations that have followed our lead. Applied properly, it would lead to simple steps that could liberate trillions of dollars in resources each year -- enough to end perennial battles over budget deficits, restore our crumbling infrastructure and pay for the investments needed for a sustainable future. No painful sacrifices would be required. No cherished freedoms would be threatened. Just a few changes in the tax code would suffice.
These bold claims evoke an alchemist's promise to transform lead into gold. But they rest on sound logic and compelling evidence.
POLITICAL gridlock in Washington has many causes. A seldom-discussed one is that the current rhetoric often rests on basic misunderstandings of how markets work.
On one side, advocates of minimal government invoke Smith's invisible hand to argue that we could make the economy more efficient by pushing government aside and letting markets work their magic. Liberals counter that markets aren't truly competitive. We need extensive government regulation, they say, because powerful elites would otherwise exploit workers and consumers.
Close reading of Smith's work shows that his position was very similar to the modern liberal's. He thought it remarkable that self-interest often promoted the common good, but he never claimed it always did. Like modern liberals, he saw market failure as rooted in insufficient competition. In ''The Wealth of Nations,'' he wrote, ''People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.''
Today, though, markets are far more competitive than ever, just as conservatives maintain, but they're also hugely more wasteful. The apparent paradox is resolved once we recognize that market failure stems from the very logic of competition itself. As Darwin knew, when individual and group interests diverge, competition not only fails to promote the common good, it also actively undermines it.
The modern marketplace is rife with individual-versus-group conflicts like the one that spawned outsized antlers in bull elk. If you're one of several qualified applicants seeking an investment banking job, for example, it's in your interest to look good during your interview. But looking good is a relative concept. If other applicants wear $600 suits, you'll make a more favorable impression if you wear one costing $1,200.
Trading up is wasteful for the group, however, because the applicants are no more likely to get the positions if they all spend more on suits. But from each individual's perspective, that's no reason to regret buying the pricier suit.
When the ability to achieve important goals depends on relative consumption, all bets on the efficacy of Smith's invisible hand are off. As Darwin saw, many important aspects of life are graded on the curve, and in such cases, individual incentives often lead to mutually offsetting efforts.
MOST parents want to give appropriate gifts, just as they want their children to attend good schools. But ''appropriate'' and ''good'' depend on context. When the rich spend more on mansions and gifts, the frames of reference for the near-rich shift, too, causing them to spend more as well, and so on, all the way down.
The median size of a new single-family house in 2007 was over 2,300 square feet, more than 50 percent larger than its counterpart from 1970. That creates a problem for concerned parents, because good schools are usually found in affluent neighborhoods. To send your children to one, you must outbid others for a house in a good school district. Yet when all families increase their bidding for such houses, they succeed only in driving up their prices. No matter how much parents pay, only half of all children can attend schools in the top half.
Much of this waste could be eliminated by a few relatively simple changes in the tax code. Scrapping the current progressive income tax in favor of a more steeply progressive tax on consumption is probably the single most productive change we could make.
What's a progressive consumption tax? First of all, it's not a sales or value-added tax, neither of which takes individual income into account. Those taxes are imposed on the spot when someone buys a good or a service.
Under a progressive consumption tax, taxpayers would report their incomes, much as they do now. They'd also report their annual savings, much as they do for tax-exempt retirement accounts. The tax would be based on ''taxable consumption'' -- the difference between their income and annual savings, less a standard deduction of, say, $30,000 for a family of four. Rates on additional expenditures would start low and rise gradually with taxable consumption.
Because savings would be tax-exempt, the biggest spenders would save more and spend less on luxury goods, leading to greater investment and economic growth, without any need for government to micromanage anyone's behavior. Consumers in the tier just below, influenced by those at the top, would also spend less, and so on, all the way down the income ladder. In short, such a tax would attenuate the expenditure cascade that has made life for middle-income families so expensive.
Adopting a progressive consumption tax would be like creating wealth out of thin air. Its magical quality stems from the fact that luxury spending is strongly context-dependent, just as antlers are. If everyone spends less, you can still have the biggest mansion -- or antlers -- on the block, but you'll also be able to do many other useful things. The money saved could help resolve the current fiscal impasse. And it could also be used to fix roads and bridges and support a host of other genuine improvements.
Changing the tax code in a fundamental way won't be easy. But as the late Herb Stein, Richard M. Nixon's chief economist, once remarked, ''if something can't go on forever, it won't.'' The dysfunctional system now in place threatens to destroy our economic future. If we don't change it now, we'll have to change it later.
Can anyone imagine anti-government conservatives embracing a progressive consumption tax? Actually, yes. It's perhaps the only important policy option that could win support from both ends of the political spectrum. A version of it, for example, was proposed in 1995 by Senators Pete V. Domenici, a Republican, and Sam Nunn, a Democrat.
Many conservatives advocate a flat tax -- essentially, a national sales tax -- but most realize that its adoption is unlikely because it would fall disproportionately on people with lower incomes. If the alternative is to stick with the current income tax, however, a progressive consumption tax begins to look pretty good to many conservatives. And once they understand how it would reshape spending patterns, they often become openly enthusiastic about it.
In 1997, shortly after publishing an article advocating this kind of tax, I received a warm letter from Milton Friedman, widely hailed as the patron saint of small-government conservatism.
He questioned my claim that additional tax revenue could be put to productive uses in the public sphere. But he added that if the government did need additional revenue, the progressive consumption tax would be by far the best way to raise it. Attached to his letter was a reprint of his article published in the 1943 American Economic Review in which he advocated the progressive consumption tax as the best way to pay for the World War II effort.
IN the current climate, it's not likely that this tax will become law soon. That's actually a good thing, since we wouldn't want to discourage consumption during a deep economic downturn. But if the tax were passed now and phased in once the economy returned to full employment, it would kill two birds with one stone. It would reassure deficit hawks that we're committed to putting our fiscal house in order, and it would encourage an immediate burst of private spending by people eager to avoid the tax.
In a nutshell, Darwin's simple insight reveals that the modern economy is not only far less efficient than Adam Smith's modern disciples think it is, but also that it would be relatively easy to improve matters. That simple truth will someday be self-evident. But until then, the wasteful aspects of the competitive process will continue to impose enormous costs on everyone.

HEADLINE: Strangers In a Strange School

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
The phone rang, and my stomach clenched when I heard her voice. ''Daddy? I want to go home,'' said my 8-year-old daughter, Arden. Two hours earlier, I dropped Arden and her two siblings off at their new school in a squat building in a forest of Soviet-era apartment blocks on Krasnoarmeyskaya (Red Army) Street in Moscow. They hugged me goodbye, clinging a little too long, and as I rode the metro to my office, I said a kind of silent prayer to myself that they would get through the day without falling apart.
But Arden had just spent the minutes between class periods hiding in the bathroom so no one would see her crying. Finally, she composed herself, found her teacher and pantomimed that she needed to talk to me. ''I don't understand . . . anything,'' she told me. I tried to respond with soothing words, but I had no idea what to do. You can tell your kid to tough it out when she transfers from one school to another in your hometown. This was different. 
My three children once were among the coddled offspring of Park Slope, Brooklyn. But when I became a foreign correspondent for The New York Times, my wife and I decided that we wanted to immerse them in life abroad. No international schools where the instruction is in English. Ours would go to a local one, with real Russians. When we told friends in Brooklyn of our plans, they tended to say things like, Wow, you're so brave. But we knew what they were really thinking: What are you, crazy? It was bad enough that we were abandoning beloved Park Slope, with its brownstones and organic coffee bars, for a country still often seen in the American imagination as callous and forbidding. To throw our kids into a Russian school -- that seemed like child abuse.
Most foreign correspondents, like expatriates in general, place their children in international schools. Yet it seemed to us like an inspiring idea. After all, children supposedly pick up language quickly. So what if mine did not speak a word of Russian and could not find Russia on a map. They were clever and resilient. They would adapt, become fluent and penetrate Russia -- land of Dostoyevsky and Tchaikovsky, the Bolshoi Ballet and the Hermitage Museum -- in ways all but impossible for foreigners.
But the fantasy of creating bilingual prodigies immediately collided with reality. My children -- Danya (fifth grade), Arden (third grade) and Emmett (kindergarten) -- were among the first foreigners to attend Novaya Gumanitarnaya Shkola, the New Humanitarian School. All instruction was in Russian. No translators, no hand-holding. And so on that morning, as on so many days that autumn of 2007, I feared that I was subjecting them to a cross-cultural experiment that would scar them forever.
I told Arden that I would call her back, and then I called my wife, Julie Dressner. ''What should we do?'' I asked. We had decided together on a Russian school, but it would become a source of tension between us. Our children were miserable, which caused us to doubt moving abroad -- and to sometimes turn on each other. I wanted to give the school more time and not demand more from the teachers. Julie was alarmed and thought that we had to do something. But Julie was frustrated by our options, short of pulling them out. At one point, after a lengthy discussion with several of the teachers, she walked out of the school nearly in tears. She was studying Russian, but she realized that she had missed much of what had been said. How can you help your children when you can barely communicate with their teachers?
Julie and I talked. I wondered whether it might be better if I went to the school and persuaded Arden to stay until the end of the day, if only in a quiet room, reading a book in English. Julie wanted her picked up, reasoning that it would be smarter to start fresh tomorrow. I didn't want to argue about it. When I found her at school, she brightened. It was as if she were being rescued. I held her hand as we walked to the metro, and I told her that I recognized that what she was doing was hard. I gently added that it would be nice if this were the last time that she left school early because she was upset. I suspected that it wouldn't be.
When we started searching for schools, we assumed that a large public one in Moscow would be too daunting. Julie stumbled upon the Web site of New Humanitarian, a private school with 150 or so pupils and small classes. It promised an enlightened and innovative interpretation of the classic Soviet education -- all the rigor, without the suffocating conformity. Moscow progressives! Maybe the transition wouldn't be too rocky.
We were, of course, naive. New Humanitarian, which runs kindergarten through high school, was still rooted in Russia's educational and societal traditions. Students recite by heart from Pushkin's ''Yevgeny Onegin'' (''My uncle was a man of virtue. . . .'') and tackle algebra as early as fourth grade. Children older than 9 are regularly rated, based on test scores. Student rankings are posted on a central wall for all to gawk at, like the latest sports stats.
In those first months, our kids found themselves bewildered and isolated. Danya was a typical oldest child, a coper who rarely lost control. At night, though, she had insomnia. In class, she braced herself for that moment when she was asked for homework. She sometimes did not know whether it had been assigned. During Russian grammar, the words on the blackboard looked like hieroglyphics. She tried to soothe herself by repeating a mantra: ''It's O.K. to feel like an idiot. This is going to take time.'' But she felt betrayed. We had assured her that children grasp language effortlessly, and there she was, the dumb foreigner.
Arden was resisting getting out of bed in the morning, hugging her blanket in her room, where we had painted the walls to resemble green hills and blue skies. At recess, while others played vyshibaly, a Russian version of dodgeball, she passed the time walking back and forth on the curb, all alone, as if on a balance beam. Back at P.S. 321 in Park Slope, she relished her relationships with teachers, sometimes preferring to hang out with them instead of going to recess. At New Humanitarian, she could barely talk to them.
We hoped that Emmett would fare better, because he was only 51/2 when he started. But one morning, he did so poorly on a minor exercise, involving drawing lines on graph paper, that he refused to hand it in. ''Please let me see it,'' his teacher implored. ''Everyone is just learning here.'' Finally, he crumpled the paper and smothered his face in it.
One night, he complained that he was not getting called on in class and knew why.
''Why?'' I asked.
''Because I'm an American,'' he said.
I tried not to laugh. Though I could have used a good laugh.
I convinced myself that what they were doing was no different from what millions of immigrants in the United States do all the time. Yet my unease stemmed from more than the school. When we arrived in Russia, the country was still suffering through the aftermath of the humiliating Soviet collapse in 1991. Vladimir Putin, a former K.G.B. agent who scorned Western-style democracy, was ruling undisputed. Many Russians -- fed up with post-Soviet disorder -- applauded him.
With oil prices soaring, the economy, based on natural resources, was riding high. In Moscow, newly prosperous Russians embraced a breathtaking materialism, making up for Soviet deprivation. They sped down Tverskaya Street in Lexus S.U.V.'s, outfitted their homes with Poggenpohl kitchens and piled into Cantinetta Antinori and other restaurants run by celebrity chefs from Europe. Moscow has 10 million people, and most are not wealthy. But after a few months, I remember thinking, Was this a society that I wanted to embed my kids in?
We first visited New Humanitarian when Danya, Arden and Emmett were being evaluated for admission. We were met by a man with a shock of steel-wool hair and teeth whose color and arrangement suggested decades of Soviet dentistry and heavy smoking. His name was Vasiliy Georgievich Bogin, and he was the school's founder and maestro.
We had just left Brooklyn and were spending our first year in Russia in St. Petersburg, the country's second-biggest city, where I was studying intensive Russian before starting my job in Moscow. The kids were at a private school in St. Petersburg that had a program for foreigners who wanted to learn Russian. Their language skills were rudimentary.
At the school in Moscow, Bogin spent 45 minutes with each of the three, speaking to them in English. He gave Danya an algebra problem that was clearly too hard for her. He constructed the outline of a fish with toothpicks and asked Arden to make the fish face in the opposite direction by moving only a few pieces. He had Emmett take apart and rebuild a house made of blocks. He seemed to care about the way they thought, not what they knew. The children found him bizarre. But Bogin was giving us a taste of his methods.
Bogin, who is in his 50s, would be nearly six feet tall if he had better posture, but he always seems to lean forward, drawn to something else as he prowls the school. His eyes have the impish gleam of a man cooking up a brainteaser for the next person he encounters. (''Anyone who thinks that 2 + 2 = 4 is an idiot,'' he likes to say. But more on that later.)
When Bogin was growing up in the Soviet era, the party used schools to mold loyal Communists. Teachers wove propaganda through the lessons and enforced memorization like drill sergeants. Bogin detested it. ''I didn't want to be a slave,'' he told me. ''I didn't want to be a person who is ordered and must obey the orders without any thinking. I didn't consider myself to be a person who repeats texts without any criticism or thinking or any alternatives.''
Just as political dissidents fought the Soviet regime, so, too, did others oppose the educational system. Bogin was one of them. After studying English in college and serving in the army, he decided to become the kind of teacher he craved as a child. At a school in the Moscow suburbs in the late 1980s, he challenged pupils to challenge him -- and everyone else. It was the height of perestroika under the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev.
Soon after Communism's fall, Bogin opened New Humanitarian, one of the first private schools in Russia, in a cramped building that had been a nursery school for children of workers at a military factory. New Humanitarian remains there, and Bogin's inability to renovate the building or find a bigger one reflects to some extent the establishment's ambivalence toward his brilliance as an educational provocateur. (While the school is private, it is still heavily regulated by the government.)
After Bogin met my children that day in 2006, he told us that he very rarely admitted nonnative Russian speakers, let alone Americans, and he made clear that he could not provide separate classes for my children. We thought that he was preparing us for rejection. Then he said, ''But I will take them.''
As the kids struggled during those first months, we promised them that they could switch to an international school at any time. Yet even as we fretted, they were developing survival skills on their own. They asked teachers for extra help after class. To prove to classmates that they were not clueless, they tried to do well in subjects that did not require a lot of Russian, like math. The girls employed a tactic that they called the smile-and-nod when they didn't understand what someone was saying. They remembered the words and furtively looked them up.
All three were starting to converse in Russian, albeit with accents and grammatical errors, as if the language were seeping into their consciousness. ''It was kind of like solving a code, because every day, you just have to figure out something new to say and some new way you have to act,'' Danya later told me.
Even Russian-literature class seemed less daunting. Arden's teacher was discussing Russian fairy tales one morning when she realized that Arden did not know the classic ending to many. It was akin to ''. . . and they lived happily ever after.''
She asked Arden to repeat each word. Arden did. She told Arden to recite the sentences by herself. Arden hesitated, as if she were going to refuse, as she had many times before.
But then she did it. Her classmates applauded, and she beamed.
At the beginning of the year, the other children treated Danya, Arden and Emmett as curiosities. They occasionally mocked the three for their mangled syntax, though the school cracked down on that. Bogin even devised a ploy for Emmett's class: one of the school's English teachers conducted a lesson entirely in English. ''This is what every day is like for Emmett,'' the teacher explained. One boy was so tormented trying to follow along that he burst into tears.
The teasing eventually stopped, and some children started looking out for mine, assisting them with homework and inviting them to birthday parties.
Bogin had been concerned that our kids would not make it. But he saw that they were progressing and that they were an example for the rest of the school. By that point, we were enthralled by Bogin -- he was a character out of our romanticized notion of the Russian intelligentsia. He could take humdrum topics -- say, how children raise their hands in class -- and turn them into lengthy dialogues that were never boring. Julie and I once had a meeting with Bogin to discuss Emmett's study habits. It went nearly three hours. Bogin began to believe in our kids and became invested in their success. We drew strength from that.
Late in the spring of 2008, Danya came home with a startling announcement: Bogin had chosen her for the academic Olympiad team, largely for her math prowess. We could not fathom it. How could she understand the questions? She assured us that she was getting it. For the first time, a feeling of optimism washed over us.
Julie and I all but panicked early on, in large part because we felt powerless. Our inclination as parents had been to intervene to protect our children. But maybe it was better that they had to win these battles by themselves. As Bogin often says, ''Life is the best teacher.''
As things settled, we were discovering that New Humanitarian was a pretty remarkable place. Bogin set up a system of what he called curators, two or three teachers whose job was to oversee the 10 to 15 children in each grade. Curators generally do not conduct lessons but observe classes, identify problems and take children to meals and activities. Everyone ate breakfast, lunch and snacks in the cafeteria, where comfort food, from borscht to blinis to cinnamon rolls, was served by doting cooks. My kids gobbled it up, and Emmett stopped wielding a fork and knife like a caveman. Many children, including ours, stayed at school until 6 p.m., doing homework with curators. This was a godsend for us, because we had difficulty helping with assignments.
New Humanitarian had standard subjects, like history and math, and Danya had many hours of homework a week. But Bogin added courses like antimanipulation, which was intended to give children tools to decipher commercial or political messages. He taught a required class called myshleniye, which means ''thinking,'' as in critical thinking. It was based in part on the work of a dissident Soviet educational philosopher named Georgy Shchedrovitsky, who argued that there were three ways of thinking: abstract, verbal and representational. To comprehend the meaning of something, you had to use all three.
When I asked Bogin to explain Shchedrovitsky, he asked a question. ''Does 2 + 2 = 4? No! Because two cats plus two sausages is what? Two cats. Two drops of water plus two drops of water? One drop of water.''
From there, the theories became more complex. In practice, though, the philosophy meant that Bogin delighted in barraging children with word problems and puzzles to force them to think broadly. It was the opposite of the rote memorization of the Soviet system.
At dinnertime, the kids taunted me with riddles. ''Ten crows are sitting on a fence,'' Arden announced. ''A cat pounces and eats one crow. How many are left?'' ''Umm, nine,'' I said, fearing a trap. ''No, none!'' she gleefully responded. ''Do you really think that after one crow is eaten, the others are going to stick around?''
Bogin had another innovation: classes were videotaped. This was not a vestige of Soviet surveillance. Rather, he wanted to critique how teachers interacted with -- and nurtured relations between -- children. Bogin and his staff often worked late into the night, reviewing footage and discussing methodology.
Life at New Humanitarian was full of academic Olympiads, poetry-reciting contests and quiz bowls. The school stressed oral exams, even in math, where children had to solve an equation at the blackboard and explain methodology. Children were graded and ranked, with results posted. We were not accustomed to this: in Brooklyn, the school instilled an everyone's-a-winner ethos. At New Humanitarian, Danya says, ''they send an entirely different message to the kids: 'Learning is hard, but you have to do it. You have to get good grades.' ''
At first, when rankings were posted, the school left off Danya and Arden to avoid embarrassing them. (Emmett was too young to be ranked.) As the girls became more comfortable in Russian, their names began appearing. As the months went by, I noticed that they were creeping up the list.
New Humanitarian cost about $10,000 a child our first year. We could afford it -- like many companies that send workers abroad, The Times paid tuition. Yet for Muscovites, the school was a strange breed. It was too expensive for most but not appealing to the rich, who often preferred compliant teachers and lavish facilities. With its warped floors and narrow hallways, New Humanitarian looked like an old annex to a public school in Queens.
The school attracted upper-middle-class parents who were impressed with Bogin. In my children's grades, the parents were lawyers, professors, bankers, architects, publishers, restaurateurs and a cosmetics manufacturer. They drove nice cars, lived in apartments that had been privatized in the post-Soviet era and vacationed in Western Europe.
I looked upon them as Russian versions of the parents who populate the Upper West Side, TriBeCa or Park Slope. Moscow has some strong public schools, but the system as a whole is dispiriting, in part because it is being corroded by the corruption that is a post-Soviet scourge. Parents often pay bribes to get their children admitted at better public schools. There are additional payoffs for good grades.
The parents at New Humanitarian exhibited one stark difference from their counterparts in New York: they were apolitical and often fatalistic about their nation's future. Like many Russians in the Putin era, they turned inward, shunning public life and focusing on the personal. To do otherwise was risky. You can criticize the government in private as much as you want -- K.G.B. snoops no longer lurk. But anything more than that and you might be fired or lose a contract or get a visit from the police. That anxiety is always there.
Aleksei Skvortsov, a retail executive who was the father of a boy in Emmett's class, reminded me of the devoted dads I used to see taking their children to P.S. 321. When I asked Skvortsov what had happened to his generation, he responded: ''I think that most people in Russia do not in any way believe that they can influence changes in society. So they concentrate on those changes that affect their personal lives.''
Still, the parents' choice of New Humanitarian was in some sense an act of rebellion. They realized that after Bogin was done with their children, they would not succumb to anyone's demagoguery.
Bogin disliked the Russian leadership, especially Putin, who seemed too Soviet to him. But Bogin was not active in politics, knowing that to support the opposition was to court unfavorable attention from the authorities. I was curious, though, how the government perceived him. He had devised a compelling model that could help rescue the education system. But he was ignored.
Last spring, I went to see Valery Fadeyev, a prominent journalist who is a member of the Public Chamber, a Kremlin advisory council, and has close ties to the liberal wing of Putin's ruling party. Fadeyev's daughter attends New Humanitarian, and he was thrilled with the school. He told me that the Kremlin's educational bureaucracy was aware of Bogin but too calcified to care.
''The authorities do not prevent him from working, but they don't have any use for him either,'' Fadeyev said. ''They don't understand that education reform is the only real source for the revitalization of our country.''
Somehow, as the second year was melting into the third and fourth, life at New Humanitarian became normal. Danya was going to the coffee shop with her friends Masha and Dasha. Arden was excelling at Russian grammar, perhaps because she learned the rules from scratch, unlike native speakers. Both girls were at the top of the academic rankings. Emmett, still too young to be rated, was also thriving.
When I dropped them off in the morning, I was amazed as they bantered with other children. They no longer translated from English to Russian in their heads -- the right words tumbled out. On the streets of Moscow, they were mistaken for natives. (Foreign residents have long resented how Russian theaters and museums charge foreigners a steep premium. We took great pleasure in sending the kids in to buy our tickets at the cheaper price.)
Their fluency and familiarity with the culture unlocked doors everywhere. On a long train ride to Estonia, they befriended a middle-aged construction executive and his wife, a doctor, who were from southern Russia. The couple set out black bread, pickled vegetables and smoked fish for the kids, and everyone sat there snacking and chatting for hours.
Arden joined a troupe that did not only ballet but also modern dance. At school, Danya was assigned Tolstoy and Chekhov, and then on her own, she started reading Mikhail Bulgakov's ''The Master and Margarita,'' one of the most famous Russian novels of the 20th century, in the original.
The kids' sense of belonging raised an awkward issue: Were they becoming more Russian than American? Were they assimilating, like immigrants everywhere? Julie and I had grown to love Russia and its people, but aspects of the country -- its drift toward authoritarianism, its conservative social mores -- still troubled us.
The children, as always, figured it out before we did. They integrated their American identities into the school, rather than spurning them. They helped the English teachers. They described life in the United States to friends. I knew that we had nothing to worry about when one of Arden's curators, Galina Lebedeva, recounted how Arden demanded that girls move tables during cleanup, just like boys. ''Arden, our American feministka, said the girls were as capable of doing the lifting as the boys,'' Lebedeva told me with a smile. ''We said, 'Fine.' ''
And then, after five years in Russia, it was time to return to Brooklyn.
Danya, now nearly 14, was ambivalent about leaving, drawn toward being a teenager in New York City. But Arden and Emmett would have gladly stayed. ''I feel like I'm tugged in two ways, and I have no idea what to do,'' Arden told me last spring. ''That's the one problem with living abroad. You end up getting those weird feelings like, Oh, I can't leave; I can't stay.''
On the kids' final day, Bogin called an assembly to wish them goodbye. He started praising them for all they had overcome but then stopped. This, too, would not be just a lecture.
''What would we not have had if these three had not been here?'' he asked. ''How did they enrich our school?''
''Theater!'' someone shouted back.
''The school newspaper!''
''Great friendships!''
A chant began. ''Spa-si-bo! Spa-si-bo!'' (''Thank you!'')
Some teachers and children had tears in their eyes.
I went onstage to express my deep appreciation but was too choked up to speak. Suddenly, Arden strode forward and took the microphone. In confident and flawless Russian, she thanked the school for all of us.

HEADLINE: Suddenly, Over There Is Over Here

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
THE debt crisis in Europe has finally, and officially, washed up on American shores. Last week, the mighty Federal Reserve moved to help European banks that have been having trouble finding people who are willing to lend them money.
Some of these banks are growing desperate for dollars. Fearing the worst, investors are pulling back, refusing to roll over the banks' commercial paper, those short-term i.o.u.'s that are the lifeblood of commerce. Others are refusing to renew certificates of deposit. European banks need this money, in dollars, to extend loans to American companies and to pay their own debts.
Worries over the banks' exposure to shaky European government debt have unsettled markets over there -- shares of big French banks have taken a beating -- but it is unclear how much this mess will hurt the economy back here. American stock markets, at least, seem a bit blase about it all: the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.3 percent last week. 
But stock investors have a bad habit of dismissing problems in the credit markets until it is too late. Back in the summer of 2007, the stock market was roaring, despite obvious problems in the mortgage market.
Make no mistake: the troubles of Europe and its debt-weakened banks will imperil the United States. For many, it is no longer a question of whether but when Greece will default on its government debt. How far the sovereign debt crisis might spiral, and its precise ramifications, are unknowable, but some fault lines are evident.
Carl B. Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., outlined what he sees as the major risks -- and they fall into two categories. One is the potential for losses incurred by financial institutions that wrote credit insurance on European government debt and the European banks that own so much of that paper. The other is the likely economic hit as banks in the euro zone curb lending significantly.
A crucial mechanism linking financial players in the United States to the problems in Europe involves credit default swaps, those insurance-like products that did so much damage during the 2008 financial crisis. (Think American International Group.)
Billions of dollars in swaps have been written on sovereign debt, guaranteeing that those who bought the insurance will be paid if Greece or other countries default. As of Sept. 9, some $32 billion in net credit insurance exposure was outstanding on debt of Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Spain, according to Markit, a financial data provider. An additional $23.6 billion has been written on Italy's debt. Billions more in credit insurance have also been written on European banks, many of which hold huge positions in troubled sovereign obligations.
But since these instruments trade in secret, investors don't know who would be on the hook -- as A.I.G. was in its ill-fated mortgage insurance -- should a government default or a bank fail.
''If Greece folds its tent and that takes out a big institution, we don't know who wrote the swaps,'' Mr. Weinberg said. ''Can they raise the cash to perform on their obligations? Can they take the balance-sheet hits? We have a lot of unknown unknowns.''
Even after what we went through with A.I.G., the huge market in credit default swaps remains unregulated and still operates in the shadows. You can thank big banks that trade these instruments -- and their lobbyists -- for that.
As for the broader economic effects of Europe's woes, Mr. Weinberg expects credit around the world to become even scarcer. ''Outside the U.S., we never really resumed credit growth since 2009,'' he said. ''Another hit now would bring credit down and impose a huge squeeze on small businesses throughout Europe and over here also.''
ONE troubling aspect of the euro zone crisis is just how large the European banks' sovereign debt holdings are. At many institutions, the positions dwarf what American institutions held in mortgage-related securities, for example, when compared to book values.
Why? Regulators encouraged European banks to hold huge amounts of European government debt by letting them account for these investments as if they posed zero risk. That meant the banks didn't need to set aside a single euro in capital against those holdings.
Now, according to an analysis by Autonomous Research, 43 large European banks hold debt in troubled sovereigns that is equal to 63 percent of those institutions' book values.
Adding to the peril is that these banks are funded primarily by short-term investors, like buyers of commercial paper, rather than by depositors, as is more often the case with American banks. This was the same problem faced by Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, which collapsed after short-term lenders fled in panic.
Measuring the loans made to European banks against their deposits tells the story. Across Europe, according to Autonomous Research, loans to banks exceed their deposits by 6 percent. Among French banks, loans exceed deposits by 19 percent. In Greece, they swamp deposits by 32 percent.
In the United States, by contrast, banks are borrowing less than 90 percent of their deposits, on average.
This is why it is becoming such a problem for European banks that so many short-term lenders are declining to renew when loans come due. Money market funds, traditionally big investors in short-term paper issued by European banks, have been reducing exposures. A recent Fitch Ratings report shows that for the two months ended July 31, the 10 largest United States prime money market funds pared their holdings in European banks by 20.4 percent, in dollar terms. In the same period, the funds cut their exposure to Italian and Spanish banks by 97 percent.
But these money funds, with total assets of $658 billion, held $309 billion in debt obligations issued by European banks. That's equivalent to 47 percent of these funds' total assets.
''We're seeing a lot of the same things in the markets that we saw in the Lehman era,'' Mr. Weinberg said, referring to that awful episode three years ago. ''I can't tell you specifically and exactly how the fallout from Europe will pass through to us, but I certainly can't tell you it won't.''

HEADLINE: 'Stolen' Property?

BYLINE: By ARIEL KAMINER

 BODY:
I bought a house that a previous owner had nearly destroyed. He knocked holes in walls and doors, trucked away the deck and trashed the aboveground pool, etc. I assumed he was angry at his wife, but it turned out that he was angry at the bank, which had foreclosed, taking everything the couple had put into the property. When a mutual friend invited the former owners to visit, the wife wept and said she could never bear to see our improvements on a house that had been ''stolen.'' I know we didn't steal her home, but I resolved never to buy a foreclosed house again. It seems to be an evil thing to do, to profit from another family's misfortune. Is it? ELIZABETH MURPHY, NORFOLK, VA.
Great house, steep discount, vacated under duress. In today's real estate listings, that pitch sounds like an opportunity, but in other circumstances -- a war zone, say -- it might suggest an outrage. So you are right to care how a house came to market. Still, your fears are unnecessary. 
If banks could never foreclose, they couldn't offer mortgages in the first place, and the vast majority of people would lose the ability to buy a home. The past few years, however, have shown how this practical necessity can descend into an ethical, financial and personal nightmare. A small fraction of recent foreclosures may even have been outright theft, with banks laying claim to houses that were not in default or on which they did not hold the mortgage.
The vast majority of cases were not quite so stark; they were a result of loans that banks should never have approved or that home buyers should never have sought. Or a housing market that tanked (in part because of those very practices). Or a bank's failure to negotiate a more favorable outcome.
If you are disgusted by the whole sordid mess, you could take a principled stance and refuse to be part of it. If you were really motivated, you could even organize a nationwide boycott of foreclosed homes. It's possible you would teach the banks a valuable lesson.
It just might not be the lesson you intended. As William C. Wheaton, a professor of economics and real estate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, explains: ''If a large block of people refuse to buy the houses, the bank can still foreclose and sell them -- to investors, who will turn around and rent them. Investors, we can assume, don't quite have the same moral anguish that individuals do.''
By declining to buy a foreclosed house, you cannot help the traumatized former owners. But by making the opposite choice, you can do a lot to help their neighbors.
A single house, sitting foreclosed and unsold, can depress property values all up and down the street. So take the boards off the windows, get the grass cut, install an alarm system and keep the nice folks who live next door from becoming collateral damage. You can still show your commitment to principle -- by doing research on the various mortgage lenders and refusing to do business with any of those that disgraced themselves.
Still, it's hard enough living with a difficult ethical choice; actually living in it can be excruciating. There's no sense living somewhere you can't sleep at night. If you don't feel comfortable inhabiting a home that someone else pines for, then by all means, turn to the next listing.
My roommate is a high-strung moron. I told her I was hoping to get a goldfish for my room, and she flipped out, saying that she didn't want me cleaning it in the sink (which I don't plan to) and that she thinks fish are gross. But it's going to be in a bowl in my room! I consider myself very experienced with aquatic life. (I had frogs for two years in college until my landlord mistakenly assumed I'd left them for dead and set them free in a marsh, where he ''knew there wouldn't be any predators.'') Anyway, am I under any ethical obligation to listen to my roommate's shrill complaints? I don't want to ruin the tattered, dog-eared little friendship we've got, but I think her stance is ridiculous and immature. Or am I the fishy one here? NAME WITHHELD, NEW YORK
Sometimes a letter leaps out because of the depths of a writer's pain. Sometimes it's the intractability of the conflict. This time it was the evocative line ''my roommate is a high-strung moron.''
As life's problems go, buying a goldfish is pretty small fry. But this is an example of how the way we frame a question can be more important than the answer.
Your roommate's demand seems nonsensical, but it (presumably) arises out of real feelings. If you start from the premise that she is simply impossible to deal with, you excuse yourself from having to accede to her demand, but you also excuse yourself from ever having to understand the feelings that gave rise to it -- or any other feelings she may have, for that matter. That approach is almost guaranteed to make her more shrill. More important, if you take that approach, there can be no friendship left to save. You'll get better companionship from a goldfish.
That said, your roommate might indeed be a nightmare. (I don't recommend washing a fish, that's for sure.)
But if you can't imagine a situation in which her inconvenient opinions could ever be valid, it's probably time to look for a new roommate. It's hard enough living with a difficult ethical choice; sharing a bathroom with it can be excruciating.

HEADLINE: The Affliction of Comfort

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
Milan
JUST when you thought that absolutely nothing could make you feel warm and fuzzy about the American political system, I bring tidings from Italy. Here there are 945 active members of Parliament, in contrast with 535 members of the United States Congress, though Italy's population is less than a fifth of America's.
Italy has roughly twice as many members of Parliament per capita as Germany, and more per capita than France and Spain as well. The Italian Parliament is one larded body of government, fatter than a haunch of prosciutto. 
You're figuring that with power scattered across so many lawmakers, each makes a pittance. Figure again -- and get ready to fantasize about a new job as chairman of the Subcommittee to Oversee Trevi Fountain Coin Removal. (I made that assignment up, but in the context of Italian cronyism and waste, it's entirely plausible.)
Once you add the members of Parliament's salaries and an array of supplements -- including travel allowances, even though lawmakers fly and take trains within the country free -- all of them earn well above $100,000, while many make closer to $200,000. That's not to mention handsome pensions and subsidized health care, which reportedly covers thermal baths.
Such bloat spreads, like a Prada-shod Blob, from Rome. As Rachel Donadio reported in The Times last week, one Sicilian town of just 960 people has nine traffic officers on the payroll.
Italians outside of government -- still, thankfully, a majority -- are suitably outraged. They turned ''La Casta'' (''The Caste''), a 2007 expose of government privilege, into a publishing sensation, with more than one million copies sold.
But when the Italian Parliament passed a $74 billion austerity package last week, government salaries didn't take a huge hit, and for the obvious reason: people on those salaries passed the package. They gave as much consideration to the preservation of their own comfort as to the broader interests of the country, which needs every euro it can muster for education, for infrastructure -- for the future.
That underscores a central tension in these brutal, fearful economic times in much of Europe and America as well. Will the people who have already made it cling as tightly as ever, or perhaps more tightly than before, to their privilege and affluence, even if doing so lengthens the odds of outsiders' gaining traction? Or will they budge enough so that opportunity still exists, some sense of fairness is preserved and investments with long-term payoffs can be made?
That question has turned Europe into a battleground. Pensioners push back against decreased benefits while students scream that the largess their forebears long enjoyed -- not to mention the debt these forebears racked up -- has raised the cost of their own education and bequeathed them an economy leached of hope.
In America there aren't as many demonstrations, but it's otherwise not so very different. Without additional revenue or entitlement reform -- and it would be best to have both -- we can't spend as much money as we should on schools, roads and much else to stay globally competitive and position ourselves for optimal growth.
But there's potent resistance. Entrenched interests dig in further; sacred cows die hard. Last week's Republican debate demonstrated that Social Security remains a political grenade to be lobbed back and forth rather than a subject of serious, constructive discussion. And the latest round of Obama v. Boehner affirmed that any increase in taxes won't come easy, if at all.
Meantime, we keep slipping educationally, and the gap between rich and poor widens. Last week's joyous revelations? The College Board reported that for the high school class of 2011, the average SAT reading score was the lowest on record, while the Census Bureau reported that the percentage of Americans living below the poverty line last year, 15.1 percent, was the highest since 1993. These aren't the building blocks of a better tomorrow.
In Italy, the specter of present realities jeopardizing future possibilities looms especially large. The country's stubbornly low birth rate threatens to throw the balance of pensioners and tax-paying workers (or tax-evading ones, as is often the Italian case) wildly out of whack.
AND Italy has its own education failures. Roberto d'Alimonte, an Italian political scientist from whom I've often sought insight, told me that only about 14 percent of Italians between the ages of 25 and 64 have college degrees or the equivalent. That puts Italy far behind France, the United States, South Korea and many other countries.
''It's one of the phenomena that explains continued support for the Berlusconi government,'' he said. ''Low education.''
In Italy there's also the problem of professionals -- lawyers, pharmacists, notaries, journalists, government employees -- who sometimes operate like members of exclusive orders, establishing systems and accumulating perks designed principally for self-protection. Many of the Italians I talked to mentioned and rued this.
''Older generations have closed ranks,'' said Maurizio Viroli, a political theorist whose 2010 book about Silvio Berlusconi's Italy, ''La Liberta dei Servi'' (''The Liberty of Servants''), will be published in English next month by Princeton University Press. Without enough new blood, he told me, ''There's an impoverishment of leadership.''
D'Alimonte said that in too many sectors of Italian life, ''There's no meritocracy. And this dampens growth and the capacity to innovate. You don't get the best from people, and a society only thrives if you allow people to give the best of themselves.''
He added that portions of northern Italy, with its vibrant manufacturing activity, were a robust exception to the doldrums of the rest of the country. But elsewhere, he said, the country was to some extent mired in competition-choking, incentive-depressing rules and entitlements.
And favors. Can't forget favors, which brings us back to government, a capacious trough of ready money on national, regional and municipal levels. One of the people currently supping at it is Nicole Minetti, 26, a former dental hygienist who will learn from a Milan court next month if she's to be tried for allegedly procuring prostitutes for Berlusconi.
Last year, thanks to his placing her on his party's ticket, she was elected to the legislature for the region of Lombardy. She reportedly makes more than $15,000 a month in that job, and doesn't have to worry the way she once did about plaque and gingivitis.

HEADLINE: Playwrights Bring Uncommon Bond To Broadway

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
TO the casual theater observer, and sometimes even to the obsessed aficionado, one Broadway season can look very much like the next. Names of stars more familiarly splashed on movie trailers are glowing from marquees around the district. The London-to-Broadway express delivers its usual cargo of prestige attractions. New musicals based on popular movies cause devotees to lament the days when Broadway was not a recycling plant but a hotbed of cultural creativity.
This season is in most ways no exception, but in at least one sense it is distinctly anomalous. This fall will bring to Broadway two new plays by African-American women: ''The Mountaintop'' by Katori Hall, opening Oct. 13 at the Bernard Jacobs Theater, and ''Stick Fly'' by Lydia R. Diamond, opening Dec. 8 at the Cort Theater. Suzan-Lori Parks's contributions to the revised version of ''The Gershwins' Porgy and Bess,'' which is scheduled to arrive on Broadway this winter, brings to three the number of black women whose work will be seen in the country's premier theatrical marketplace this season. 
In an ideal world this confluence would be incidental. Playwrights rightly bristle at being sorted into categories and resist having their works considered from the perspective of the author's racial or ethnic background. Good work should speak for itself, and ideally to audiences of all kinds. But the fact is Broadway remains to a dispiriting degree hidebound in terms of the kind of work being presented and the audience being served.
Lorraine Hansberry's ''Raisin in the Sun'' -- the first play by a black woman to be produced on Broadway, in 1959 -- was a landmark but hardly a breakthrough. And the 20 years and more of August Wilson's works being acclaimed (if rarely profitable) on Broadway did not result in a new wave of black playwrights being presented on New York's most prestigious stages. New plays by women -- of any color -- remain by far the exception to the rule on Broadway.
Kenny Leon, the director of the recent smash revival of ''Fences,'' is directing both ''The Mountaintop'' and ''Stick Fly.'' He notes, ''I can't remember the last time there were three women playwrights on Broadway during the same season, let alone three African-American women.''
Although the backgrounds of their authors makes them notable, ''The Mountaintop'' and ''Stick Fly'' come to Broadway via the traditional routes and with some of the familiar assets required to brave the increasingly star-centric Broadway economy. Ms. Hall's play, which depicts a fictionalized version of the last night in the life of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., received critical acclaim and the prestigious Olivier Award for best play when it was produced in the West End in London, after moving from a smaller theater. This production has new stars, the powerhouse team of Samuel L. Jackson as Dr. King and Angela Bassett as a maid at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, where Dr. King spent the night before his assassination.
Ms. Hall, 29, is amused at suggestions she's heard that having her play produced in London was a savvy strategic move.
''Everyone thinks I was a sneaky girl who had this play produced over there because it was controversial,'' she said in an interview. ''The fact was, the opportunity arose. I had acted in the director James Dacre's play three years before. I e-mailed him the play, and a couple of weeks later he e-mailed me and said he'd convinced his theater to do it. At the time I was working on a bare-bones workshop production here. After the workshop I flew to London and two days later was working on a full production -- in a theater over a pub.''
Ms. Hall's desire to write grew out of her frustrations as an actress.
''At Columbia I took an acting course, and my acting partner and I were assigned to do a scene from a play with two young black women,'' she recalled. ''We go to the library and start pulling down plays, and eventually gave up. 'Maybe we can share the role of Tituba in 'The Crucible'?'' she remembered saying. ''In that moment I thought, I have to write.''
Her ebullience over reaching Broadway is tempered by an awareness that this season is hardly a usual one. ''I'm used to the Great White Way being the Great White Way,'' she said, ''so yes it feels really good. But I'm hesitant to celebrate because next season we may be back to white male writers only. Let's be cautious.''
Ms. Diamond's ''Stick Fly,'' a comedy about generational conflicts in a well-to-do black family on Martha's Vineyard, comes to Broadway after achieving a critical mass of well-received productions at regional theaters across the country. She mentioned Mr. Leon's championing of the play, which he directed in a co-production for the Arena Stage in Washington and the Huntington Theater Company in Boston, as being integral to attracting the interest of Broadway producers. Among them, adding a soupcon of the necessary star luster all but required for presenting plays on Broadway these days, is the pop singer-songwriter Alicia Keys. The cast includes the TV and movie actor Mekhi Phifer and the stage veteran Ruben Santiago-Hudson.
Ms. Diamond, 41, acknowledged the excitement arising from a comparatively unknown playwright splashing down on Broadway; her only previous New York production was a staging of ''The Bluest Eye,'' an adaptation of the Toni Morrison novel, at the small Duke on 42nd Street theater. But having forged a 20-year career as a playwright outside the sometimes insular precincts of New York, she has always seen the American theater as a much larger canvas.
''When you decide to major in playwriting in college,'' she explained, ''aunts and uncles say, 'Oh I hope one day we'll see your plays on Broadway.' But the way you build a career in Chicago is very different. You don't necessarily think of Broadway as the light at the end of the tunnel.''
Ms. Diamond hesitated to opine on the issue of whether black audiences remain underserved on Broadway, but she has witnessed the enthusiasm and the sheer numbers of African-Americans coming to Broadway that has made the recent revivals of ''Fences,'' and ''A Raisin in the Sun'' (also directed by Mr. Leon) and the all-black staging of ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,'' directed by Debbie Allen, solid hits. (An all-black ''Streetcar Named Desire'' is on the docket for 2012.)
''I remember standing in line for 'The Color Purple' with my in-laws and my mother,'' in 2005, she said, ''and seeing black audiences lined up around the block twice. That was sort of mind blowing for me. I thought, I don't know why we don't see more things like this here if there are this many people lining up to see them.''
But even at the major regional theaters where her work has been produced, Ms. Diamond noted that she has had to take a hand in recruiting African-American audiences, which do not normally make up a large percentage of regular subscribers.
''I've worked very hard with marketing people to include African-Americans,'' she said. ''I know that there's a huge population interested in seeing themselves reflected onstage.'' Yet, she added, ''At the same time I don't think my work speaks only to an African-American audience.''
Mr. Leon pointed to other black female writers who deserve to have their work seen on New York's largest -- or at least most paid-attention-to -- stages.
''Lynn Nottage is a top-of-the-line, Pulitzer Prize-winning writer who should have her plays on Broadway,'' Mr. Leon said. ''Regina Taylor is writing some great work. Pearl Cleage is still writing good plays.''
It is, of course, an uphill battle for any emerging playwright to new work presented on Broadway. But while Ms. Hall cheerfully said, ''The fact that me and Lydia and Suzan are coming to Broadway I have to see as something of a triumph,'' she still has discouraging memories of regional theaters, where much new American work first gets seen.
''I've had frank conversations with theaters who say, 'We love your play, but we've already done a play by another black person this year,' or 'I don't think the kind of people you write about are the ones our audience wants to see,' '' she said. ''Up and coming young black female writers are still struggling to have their voices heard and have their plays produced. I may be on the mountain right now, but they are still in the trenches.''

HEADLINE: The Joy of Making Things

BYLINE: By MARY ISBISTER. 
As told to Patricia R. Olsen.

 BODY:
MY mother was a German war bride. I was born in Albany, and my parents divorced when I was 2.
My mom went for medical training and worked very hard to support the two of us as a chief radiology technologist in a hospital. Although we never owned a home, and we rented a room to students from a local college, I never felt I lacked anything.
My dad lived near us, and my first job was cleaning his apartment. Before long, other residents in his complex hired me to clean their apartments. 
My parents believed strongly in helping others and taught me to do the same. In high school, I tutored children with cognitive disabilities. As my summer job in college, I was a tutor-counselor for an Upward Bound program, working with economically and socially disadvantaged high school students. Giving back to the community will always be important to me.
I wanted to study microbiology, but my mother wasn't sure I could make a living in that field and advised me to become a chemist. In 1986, I graduated with a bachelor of science degree in chemistry from the State University of New York at Plattsburgh.
My first job after college was as a bench chemist, creating and purifying molecules and compounds, at Pfizer in Groton, Conn. After three years, I moved to the clinical research department, where I monitored clinical research trials. I returned to school for an M.B.A. at night and became the clinical research operations coordinator for Pfizer's chief medical officer. I had a wonderful 11-year career with Pfizer. It turned out that I loved being a chemist, creating molecules and helping to discover treatments for diseases.
My husband, Eric, and I moved to Wisconsin in 1997. He was designing nuclear submarines at General Dynamics Electric Boat in Connecticut when the cold war ended. With production declining at the shipyard, Eric wanted more of a challenge, so when a friend offered him a job at the Eaton Corporation in Milwaukee, he accepted.
Two years later, my husband, who had always wanted to own a business, bought General Metal Works with a partner. We bought out his partner in 2001, and I joined my husband in the company. We both agree that we are each other's best business partners.
GenMet converts flat sheets of steel or aluminum into a wide array of parts, from shelving units and snowplows to parts for military vehicles and wind turbines.
People don't always realize how important manufacturing is. Without fabricators, we wouldn't have the parts necessary to generate sustainable energy or to make medical devices.
Eric is our C.E.O. He is very involved in community development and the strategic evolution of GenMet. I'm focused primarily on internal operations and as an advocate for manufacturing.
Last year, I was appointed to a two-year term on the Manufacturing Council, which reports to the secretary of commerce. I'm co-chair of the work force development committee.
We're both interested in working with educational institutions to help prepare the manufacturing work force of the future. We have to show kids today that manufacturing is exciting.
You can't be risk-averse as a successful business owner -- your company can falter or fail at any time, often because of circumstances beyond your control. I learned early in my career that if you're nervous about something, you need to feel the fear and do it anyway.
The best opportunities are often the ones that scare us the most. Having grown up with very little, I knew that if we ever failed, I'd survive.

HEADLINE: G.M. Offers Bonuses To Workers In New Deal

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC and NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- The United Auto Workers union won $5,000 signing bonuses for its workers and a promise to reopen an assembly plant in Tennessee as part of its tentative new contract with General Motors, according to people briefed on the negotiations.
In what is being viewed as a landmark deal, the union also preserved health care and pensions and improved profit-sharing for its roughly 48,000 members who work at G.M. 
Officials at G.M. and the union declined to discuss specific terms of the deal. But people briefed on the negotiations said that workers would receive a signing bonus of $5,000 in lieu of cost-of-living wage increases. Entry-level workers, who are paid about $14 an hour, are expected to receive an increase of $2 to $3 an hour.
The company has also agreed to reopen its idled assembly plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., the people said.
The U.A.W.'s tentative, four-year agreement with G.M., announced late Friday, also opens the door for the automaker to bring back laid-off workers and move jobs back into the United States.
G.M. is the first of Detroit's Big Three to reach a deal with the union. Details of the agreement were being withheld until the union can inform members, who will vote on ratification over the next two weeks.
The union's president, Bob King, said in a statement that union members would get a larger share of the profits from G.M.'s comeback from its federal bailout and bankruptcy in 2009.
''When G.M. was struggling, our members shared in the sacrifice,'' Mr. King said. ''Now that the company is posting profits again, our members want to share in the success.''
G.M.'s lead negotiator, Cathy Clegg, said the agreement allows G.M. to continue adding jobs as it increases market share in the United States.
''We worked hard on a contract that recognizes the realities of today's marketplace, enabling G.M. to continue to invest in U.S. manufacturing,'' she said.
Industry analysts said the union achieved its goals of balancing economic gains in the agreement with solidifying G.M.'s cost structure for future growth.
''I think the U.A.W. went way beyond holding the line here,'' said Harley Shaiken, a labor professor at the University of California, Berkeley. ''The union made some real gains in the contract in the context of where G.M. becomes a more competitive company.''
''They are bringing back work from other countries,'' Mr. Shaiken added. ''In this environment, to be creating jobs is not an insignificant achievement.''
Increasing jobs in the United States was a critical goal for U.A.W. leaders under pressure to show that the government's bailout of G.M. is producing positive economic benefits.
Mr. King took the unusual step of acknowledging the Obama administration's support of the industry in his statement: ''None of this would have been possible without the efforts of President Obama, who invested federal funds to help turn the company around, protect the auto supplier base and keep good-paying jobs in America.''
The union said that it had successfully fought off G.M.'s proposals to weaken pensions and obtain major concessions on health-care benefits.
Mr. King's next task is to seek broad support among local union leaders and G.M. workers for the tentative deal. U.A.W. leaders from plants across the country are expected to gather in Detroit on Tuesday to hear the details.
''No one's going to like the entire contract,'' said Jim Graham, president of U.A.W. Local 1112 in Lordstown, Ohio. ''I'm not going to like all of it. But if I like 90 percent of it, I'm behind it.''
He added: ''I have no doubts it will get ratified.'' Then Mr. King will most likely move to Chrysler, which is smaller and less profitable than G.M., and may not match the $5,000 bonuses.

HEADLINE: Will Work For Work

BYLINE: By Tina Rosenberg. 
Tina Rosenberg is the co-author of Fixes, a series on social change.

 BODY:
In a time bank, the unit of currency is not a dollar, but an hour. Members indicate what services they might be able to offer: financial planning, computer de-bugging, housecleaning, child care, clothing alterations, cooking. People teach Mandarin and yoga and sushi-making. 
Time banks -- more than 300 of them -- exist in 23 countries. The largest one in New York is the Visiting Nurse Service of New York Community Connections TimeBank. Exchanges are easiest when people live in the same neighborhood.
Home repair, child care, visiting shut-ins and taking someone to the doctor are now often commercial transactions; a time bank is a return to an era when neighbors did these tasks for one another. But a time bank is also something radical. It throws out the logic of the market -- in a time bank, all work has equal value. A 90-year-old can contribute on an equal basis with a 30-year-old. The value of a time bank during a time of high unemployment is obvious. It is a way for underemployed people to put their skills to use. Forty percent of the members of the Visiting Nurse Service's time bank, for example, have an annual income of less than $9,800. Many members of time banks are older and living on a fixed income.

HEADLINE: Six Actresses Not in Search of TV Work

BYLINE: By DAVE ITZKOFF

 BODY:
BURBANK, Calif.
IN her dressing room, so newly occupied that the only visible decoration was a bag of Reese's Pieces, Kat Dennings was pointing out the couch where she'd had a minor meltdown here on the Warner Brothers lot the night before.
That evening she was preparing to face a studio audience and film her second episode of ''2 Broke Girls,'' a CBS comedy that will make its debut on Monday, and she freely admitted she didn't handle the pressure well.
''I was talking on the phone to my mother,'' said Ms. Dennings, 25, a spirited, self-deprecating actress whose film credits include ''The 40-Year-Old Virgin,'' ''Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist'' and ''Thor.'' ''I was like: 'Mom, there's no air. I'm going to throw up. What do I do?' She's like: 'Go out there, you'll be great. Go get some water. Eat a piece of fruit.' '' 
Ms. Dennings said she was revitalized once she took the stage, but she might want to keep her mother on speed dial anyway. This season she is among a handful of actresses in their 20s and 30s who are hardly household names yet have been given the pressure, the obligation and the opportunity of carrying their own network shows.
In a crop of new series that run the gamut from bawdy comedies (like ''2 Broke Girls,'' on which Ms. Dennings plays a sassy waitress who befriends an heiress who's hit the skids) to ''Mad Men''-style period dramas, the notoriously dues-paying medium of television has turned to these relatively untested young women to be the faces and voices of its broadcast networks.
Their resumes vary considerably. Some have played one or two prominent film parts or labored in the salt mines of supporting television roles, while others have hardly been seen on screen before. One possesses a quaint acting trophy called a Tony Award. None has the long track record or recognizability that usually prefigures a starring prime-time role.
Yet they understand that they came to their positions through some combination of the shifting popular culture, coincidence and the experimentation (or random flailing) of the networks -- not any specific outreach to female talent or viewers.
''I don't think that these shows are on because women are the stars of them,'' said Whitney Cummings, 29, a creator of ''2 Broke Girls'' and the star of her own NBC comedy, ''Whitney.'' ''The shows that just happened to be the best this year happened to be centered around women.''
They are also hopeful that their shows -- if they survive the season -- might signify a moment when characters who are their ages and in circumstances they recognize from their lives are finally considered worthy of their own narratives.
''There is something very interesting about a woman in her late 20s, early 30s,'' said Laura Benanti, a Tony winner for the 2008 revival of ''Gypsy'' who is co-starring in the NBC drama ''The Playboy Club.'' ''She's clearly on the cusp of something, changing from something into something else. And that leads to many more stories to tell.''
It is a first-year class that includes Zooey Deschanel, a star of the romantic comedy ''(500) Days of Summer'' and lead singer of the retro-rock band She & Him. She is playing a socially awkward single woman living with male roommates in the Fox comedy ''New Girl.'' At 31, she has had a healthy film career, but she said her goofy charm made her an oddity in the movie industry. As she described it, the reaction she elicits from Hollywood is: '' 'She's not a cheerleader, she's not a jock, she's not a goth. We don't know what to do with her. Who is she?' Well, I'm my own thing.''
Ms. Deschanel said that the offbeat roles she covets have become even harder to come by in recent years, and Ms. Dennings echoed this point, saying that the harsh reality of filmmaking economics was a strong incentive to consider a transition to television. ''It was really disappointing to lose something because you won't get any money for the production,'' she said.
Without comparable film or television credits, Ms. Cummings has been making her own luck as a stand-up comedian, parlaying jobs on Comedy Central's celebrity roasts into a one-hour special and a pilot deal with that network. Though that project was not made into a series, it caught the attention of Michael Patrick King, who produced ''Sex and the City'' and directed its two films, with whom Ms. Cummings wrote the pilot script for ''2 Broke Girls.'' That show, in turn, was picked up by CBS just as NBC gave the green light to ''Whitney,'' a comedy about Ms. Cummings's relationship with a live-in boyfriend. (She continues to receive creative and consulting credits on ''2 Broke Girls.'')
Though she knows unfamiliar viewers may believe she is the beneficiary of overnight success, Ms. Cummings said she had been ''aggressively, violently failing'' for years.
''I'm calling my agents: 'Will they see me for that part? Do they want to meet me?' '' Ms. Cummings said. ''They're like, 'No, just go to law school, you're embarrassing yourself.' ''
It is that do-it-yourself spirit that these women most admire about professional idols like Tina Fey, Amy Poehler and Chelsea Handler (whose memoir ''Are You There, Vodka? It's Me, Chelsea'' is being adapted as an NBC comedy), and they want to see that quality reflected in the roles they play: independent, un-self-conscious, occasionally foul-mouthed characters once reserved exclusively for male performers.
(As Ms. Dennings put it, ''Women are supposed to be mysterious, and there's a veil you don't cross, but vagina jokes are just gold, man.'')
In the pilot episode of the deeply irreverent comedy ''Apartment 23,'' which ABC is planning for a midseason debut, the lead character played by Krysten Ritter sells drugs, lets her neighbors watch her walk around naked and splits up her roommate from her fiance.
But Ms. Ritter, 29, who has appeared on ''Breaking Bad'' and in movies like ''Confessions of a Shopaholic,'' said she saw her character as ''this disenfranchised girl who refuses to conform and makes her money in these twisted ways.'' She added: ''I think that speaks to a generation. Everyone's out there hustling. No one wants to climb a corporate ladder anymore.''
To find these roles two actresses said they had to turn the clock back to the 1960s, or at least the version of that decade depicted in ''The Playboy Club,'' a drama about the Chicago nightspot and its bunny-costumed hostesses during an era of social upheaval.
This series has already met resistance from KSL Television, an NBC affiliate in Salt Lake City that said it will not broadcast it, and Gloria Steinem, who once worked at the Playboy Club in New York, who said the show ''normalizes prostitution and male dominance.''
Amber Heard, who portrays one of the principal Bunnies, said she was ''playing a real character.'' ''In the '60s, there were different opportunities and responsibilities afforded to women,'' said Ms. Heard, 25, who has appeared in the films ''Pineapple Express'' and the coming ''Rum Diary.''
''That being said, in 2011 I am a part of a group of women who do not have to choose between combat boots and an apron,'' Ms. Heard continued. ''Denying a woman's sexuality is just as chauvinistic, if not worse.''
Ms. Benanti, 32, who plays a Bunny being pushed out of her job at the age of 30, drew a more direct line from the transgressive ''Playboy Club'' characters to the present day. ''It's because of women like this,'' she said, ''who are creating options for themselves that you get to have shows like 'Whitney.' ''
It's not only the series about women clad in cottontails that have the potential to rile viewers. Ms. Ritter's series, ''Apartment 23,'' has already had its title shortened from ''Don't Trust the Bitch in Apartment 23.'' (''My publicist said it's for the best they're not calling it that,'' she lamented. ''We'd have such a hard time.'')
And ''2 Broke Girls'' and ''New Girl'' have stirred debate by describing their adult protagonists as girls, though Ms. Dennings said she fully endorsed the title of her show.
''When someone describes me as a woman,'' she said, ''I'm like, 'Ucch, O.K.' It's like being called 'ma'am.' It's more of a proper term, and propriety doesn't have much of a place in TV comedy.''
Among the actresses there was no consensus as to why all of their shows landed in the same season. Maybe the success of the summer film comedy ''Bridesmaids'' demonstrated a larger appetite for stories about young women, or maybe enough female writers had risen through the ranks to create them. (In addition to the female creators of ''Whitney'' and ''2 Broke Girls,'' ''New Girl'' was created by Elizabeth Meriwether, the screenwriter of ''No Strings Attached,'' and ''Apartment 23'' was created by Nahnatchka Khan, a producer of ''American Dad!'')
Or maybe, Ms. Benanti said, ''networks have finally realized that women are watching television, and they buy things.''
Whatever had brought them together these women said they felt a strong sense of camaraderie with the actresses they already knew and those they hoped to meet someday: they were watching one another's pilots and sending supportivemessageson Twitter.
''There's room for everybody,'' Ms. Ritter said. ''If one is successful, we all get to come up together. It's all about cheering each other on.''
Ms. Deschanel agreed, saying, ''It's feeling like a very exciting time to be a woman.'' She paused to correct herself: ''A girl. A lady. Female. It always feels like it doesn't describe me because it seems too old. But I'm a grown woman, I know.''

SEPTEMBER
'ATYS' The season is off and running. And a thoroughbred put out to pasture after a few great years is back in the gate: William Christie's acclaimed presentation of Lully's opera ''Atys'' with Les Arts Florissants, seen at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1989 and 1992, a landmark in the modern early-music movement. Some of the old costumes and wigs were dispersed to museums as Mr. Christie went on to other triumphs. But one Brooklyn Academy patron, Ronald P. Stanton, couldn't put the experience behind him. Avid to see the production again and having the wherewithal to do something about it, he financed this revival -- which has already made its way around Europe and appeared at Versailles, where the opera had its premiere in 1676 -- to the tune of $3.1 million. Once again, Jean-Marie Villegier directs, and Mr. Christie conducts Les Arts Florissants. Anything Mr. Christie is involved with carries an almost ironclad guarantee of quality. But this promises to be something truly special, as the Academy acknowledges by presenting it to kick off celebrations of its 150th anniversary. Opens today. BAM Howard Gilman Opera House. 
NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC After a hectic September preseason -- live accompaniments to the film of Bernstein's ''West Side Story''; a Mahler ''Resurrection'' Symphony for Sept. 11 (on Sept. 10, actually, with performances to follow on Sept. 22, 24 and 27); an Andrea Bocelli blowout in Central Park; and Walton's music for Shakespeare's ''Henry V'' with narration by Christopher Plummer -- Alan Gilbert and the orchestra finally get around to starting their season officially. The soprano Deborah Voigt, fresh off her portrayal of Annie Oakley in ''Annie Get Your Gun'' at the Glimmerglass Festival, shifts moods drastically and repeatedly in ''Dich, teure Halle'' from Wagner's ''Tannhauser,'' ''Andromache's Farewell'' by Samuel Barber and the final scene from Strauss's ''Salome.'' Ms. Voigt will presumably remain offstage, or at least clothed, as the orchestra adds Strauss's ''Dance of the Seven Veils.'' The concert is to be broadcast in the ''Live From Lincoln Center'' series on PBS; let's hope that the players appear a happier bunch than they did in the glum PBS close-ups of last year's opening concert. Wednesday. Avery Fisher Hall.
KRONOS QUARTET This group has long been recognized as much for its pioneering social and internationalist mission as for its music-making, so a program addressing the 10th anniversary of Sept. 11 comes as no surprise. ''Awakening,'' originally presented in San Francisco for the fifth anniversary in 2006 and described as a musical meditation, has its New York premiere here. Composers represented include Michael Gordon, Terry Riley and Osvaldo Golijov, and the Brooklyn Youth Chorus joins in arrangements of traditional songs of various cultures. Wednesday-Saturday. BAM Harvey Theater.
'ANNA BOLENA' The Russian soprano Anna Netrebko is the lovely face (and sometimes bosom) of the Metropolitan Opera season, undoubtedly showing on a poster near you, as Manon if not Anna Bolena. For starters, the company has given Ms. Netrebko not only a new production and an opening-night showcase but a Donizetti work never presented in the house. How well the role's vocal fancywork will suit her voice in the big house remains to be seen, but one way or the other, she instantly becomes a part of Met history. David McVicar directs a cast that also includes Ekaterina Gubanova, Stephen Costello and Ildar Abdrazakov. Marco Armiliato conducts. Sept. 26. Metropolitan Opera House.
SEATTLE SYMPHONY Ludovic Morlot, in one of his first subscription series as this orchestra's new music director, serves up a doozy of a program, opening with Stravinsky's epochal ''Sacre du Printemps'' and closing with a work that carried it to its logical, raucous conclusion, Varese's ''Ameriques.'' In between, Mr. Morlot whimsically eases the pressure with, of all things, Gershwin's perky ''American in Paris.'' Well, the honking car horns, at least, should fit right in with the churning chaos that surrounds them. Sept. 29, Oct. 1. Benaroya Hall, (206) 215-4747 or (866) 833-4747, seattlesymphony.org.
BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA In what was supposed to be the last season of his contract as the orchestra's music director, James Levine, by present plans, will not conduct it at all. After the March announcement of his resignation, forced by chronic back problems (for which he continues to have operations), he was scrubbed from the schedule before it was announced, though some of his trademark programming remains in place, including a continuing cycle of the symphonies of John Harbison. As for Mr. Levine's eventual replacement, the orchestra -- which had to canvas conductors and their agents repeatedly to fill his vacancies in recent seasons -- must have a pretty good idea of who is out there. But now it accelerates the search with a parade of conductors that presents, along with elderly and fledgling maestros, plausible candidates, including Riccardo Chailly, surprisingly in his Boston Symphony debut; Andris Nelsons, who evidently impressed others in his debut with the orchestra in March more than he impressed me; and Esa-Pekka Salonen. But the season opens in understated fashion, with Anne-Sophie Mutter playing and leading the five Mozart violin concertos over two nights. Ms. Mutter, for her part, has made it clear that she has no conducting ambitions beyond overseeing her own performances. Sept. 30-Oct. 1. Symphony Hall, Boston, (617) 266-1492, bso.org.
VICTORIA SACRED WORKS You would expect the quiet celebrations of the 400th birthday of Tomas Luis de Victoria that are scattered about in concerts and on disc. What you might not have expected is a 10-CD set of 93 works newly recorded, some for the first time. But here it is, from Michael Noone and the 10-year-old Ensemble Plus Ultra, a London-based group specializing in Spanish Renaissance liturgical music, on Deutsche Grammophon Archiv. A Deutsche Grammophon blurb describes Victoria as ''a towering composer whose works glow with the passion and vibrant tonal palette of El Greco,'' presumably the case these recordings are trying to make. September.
OCTOBER
'THE THREEPENNY OPERA' Robert Wilson directs the Weill-Brecht classic, performed in German by the Berliner Ensemble, descended from the company founded by Bertolt Brecht and his wife in 1949. Mr. Wilson, the Brooklyn Academy says, has drawn on ''the striking designs of German Expressionist cinema and the shattering, seductive world of Weimar-era cabaret.'' There is also talk of a geometric concept, presumably coupled with a certain angularity of gesture, unless Mr. Wilson has lost his spots. Oct. 4-8. BAM Howard Gilman Opera House.
CARNEGIE HALL It is a boon to latter-day Carnegie Hall programmers and marketers that Tchaikovsky -- having conducted a work of his own at the hall's opening concert, in 1891 -- can forever be commemorated as a sort of founding father. The hall continues its celebration of the 120th anniversary of that opening (which occurred last May) with a citywide festival, Tchaikovsky in St. Petersburg. Along with music, ballet and exhibits, there will be talks and panel discussions focusing on New York at the turn of the 20th century. One of St. Petersburg's great orchestras, the Mariinsky, and its maestro, Valery Gergiev, are in residence for the occasion, and they open the season here with Tchaikovsky's Variations on a Rococo Theme, with the cellist Yo-Yo Ma as soloist, and Shostakovich's ''Festive Overture'' and Rimsky-Korsakov's ''Scheherazade.'' Oct. 5.
MARIINSKY ORCHESTRA Carnegie is spending so much Tchaikovsky capital celebrating its 120th anniversary that you have to wonder what it has in mind for its 125th, seemingly a bigger deal. (Fear not; the planners are already at work.) Here Valery Gergiev conducts his St. Petersburg-based ensemble in all six Tchaikovsky symphonies, in each case pairing an overfamiliar later work with a less familiar earlier one. The opening juxtaposition of the ever fresh First Symphony (''Winter Dreams'') with the soul-weary Sixth (''Pathetique'') should be especially striking, even disconcerting. Oct. 6, 9-10. Carnegie Hall.
DANIIL TRIFONOV Valery Gergiev, who as the new chairman of the International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow, scored points for lending greater transparency and presumably more probity to the judging process in June, comes with a grand prize winner in tow. This young pianist, who also won the Rubinstein International Master Piano Competition in Tel Aviv in May and drew acclaim for a New York recital in July, joins Mr. Gergiev and the Mariinsky Orchestra in -- what else? -- Tchaikovsky's First Piano Concerto. The orchestra also plays Shostakovich's First Symphony and three selections from Prokofiev's ''Romeo and Juliet.'' Oct. 11. Carnegie Hall.
JORDI AND FERRAN SAVALL Inveterate followers of early music have come to know and love not only the virtuoso violist da gamba Jordi Savall but also his family: especially his wife, Montserrat Figueras, a wide-ranging vocalist, and their daughter, Arianna Savall, a harpist and singer. But I, for one, have encountered their son, Ferran, a lutenist and singer, only once, when all four performed together at the Metropolitan Museum. To say that he more than held his own in this exalted company is to say a lot. In ''Folias and Variations: Music Dialogues From Orient and Occident,'' a program presented by the Morgan and the Boston Early Music Festival, Ferran Savall, singing and playing theorbo, joins his father in works from the 13th through 17th centuries by Tobias Hume, Marin Marais and others. Oct. 12. Morgan Library & Museum, 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, ext. 560, themorgan.org.
'DON GIOVANNI' There will be plenty to attend to onstage in a new production of Mozart's opera by Michael Grandage. Mariusz Kwiecien takes the title role opposite the scene-stealing Luca Pisaroni as Leporello. But a newly heightened curiosity will also be directed to the pit, as Fabio Luisi, suddenly the principal conductor at the Met, replaces an ailing James Levine on the podium. Separate article by Anthony Tommasini. Opens Oct. 13. Metropolitan Opera House.
LONDON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Lincoln Center's Great Performers series has yet to plunge into the brightness of the White Light Festival, but the venerable maestro Colin Davis can hardly be said to remain in the dark as he plies a specialty in the music of Sibelius: the Violin Concerto, with Nikolai Znaider as soloist, and the Second Symphony. Oct. 19. Avery Fisher Hall.
YUJA WANG Fashionistas may vie with pianistas for the good seats when this gifted and attractive young Chinese pianist makes her New York recital debut. Ms. Wang seems bent on radically altering concert dress, to judge from reports of her recent appearance at Hollywood Bowl wearing what The Los Angeles Times called ''an orange, thigh-grazing, body-hugging dress atop sparkly gold strappy stiletto sandals.'' Well, Hollywood Bowl is one thing; Carnegie Hall may be another (let alone the Ladies' Morning Musical Club in Montreal, three days later). The program, should anyone be listening, offers sonatas by Beethoven (''Moonlight''), Liszt (B minor) and Prokofiev (No. 6), and the performances are almost sure to be wonderful. So what does Ms. Wang wear for an encore? Oct. 20. Carnegie Hall.
AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA The seemingly indefatigable and ever voluble Leon Botstein, president of Bard College, music director of this ensemble and inveterate champion of thematic programming, adds to his workload this season with preconcert chats, ''Conductor's Notes Q&As,'' presented an hour before each program. The first concert, ''Bauhaus Bach,'' tracing connections between Bach and modernism, follows on the exhibition ''Lyonel Feininger: At the Edge of the World'' at the Whitney Museum of American Art and presents works of Bach orchestrated by Wolfgang Graeser, Reger and Schoenberg; Schoenberg's Variations for Orchestra; and Feininger's own composition Three Fugues. Oct. 21. Carnegie Hall.
WHITE LIGHT FESTIVAL ''It's such a great work, it should never be performed,'' Colin Davis has said of Beethoven's ''Missa Solemnis.'' Happily, he has not lived by that bit of hyperbole (reported by John Canarina in his book ''The New York Philharmonic: From Bernstein to Maazel,'' Amadeus Press, 2010), and Mr. Davis tries to take the measure of the work again, with the London Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, as the second annual White Light Festival at Lincoln Center gets rolling. Then Gianandrea Noseda leads the orchestra and chorus in another daunting masterpiece, Britten's ''War Requiem,'' with the tenor Ian Bostridge and the baritone Simon Keenlyside delivering the death-haunted poetry of Wilfred Owen. Oct. 21, 23. Avery Fisher Hall.
PACIFICA QUARTET With Hilde Limondjian having left her position as director of concerts and lectures at the Metropolitan Museum more than a year ago, and her successor, Limor Tomer, having arrived only in May, this will be a season of transition in programming. Lisa Doyle, the senior manager of concerts and lectures, and the staff did most of the planning, and some old formulas now seem open to question. But this one remains strong: a series of Saturday evening concerts by a resident string quartet in the Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium. For more than four decades, it was the Guarneri Quartet; since 2009, it has been the Pacifica. Having dispatched the 15 Shostakovich quartets last season, the Pacifica now presents a complete cycle of Beethoven's 16 quartets. The first program sets the pattern, with works early (Op. 18, No. 2), middle (Op. 74) and late (Op. 131). Oct. 22 (also Nov. 12, Dec. 10, Jan. 7, Feb. 25, March 10). Metropolitan Museum.
JENNIFER KOH Two seasons ago, this fine violinist played Bach's unaccompanied sonatas and partitas one per day in a popular series of free lunchtime concerts presented by the Miller Theater in Philosophy Hall of Columbia University. Now she puts all six works together in a single afternoon in the theater itself. To judge from reports on the earlier performances, tickets will probably be scarce. Oct. 23. Miller Theater, 2960 Broadway, at 116th Street, (212) 854-7799, millertheatre.com.
ANNA NETREBKO The Russian diva is almost as ubiquitous as Tchaikovsky this season, and -- no surprise -- she sings 8 of his songs here, in her New York recital debut, alongside 11 by Rimsky-Korsakov. Elena Bashkirova is the pianist. Oct. 26. Carnegie Hall.
'SIEGFRIED' What can Robert Lepage possibly add to the technological wonders of the first two installments of his unfolding Wagner ''Ring'' cycle at the Met? Why, the latest wrinkle, of course: 3-D. ''If the technology works as advertised, the singers will appear to move inside a three-dimensional world created by projections,'' Daniel J. Wakin and Steve Lohr reported in The New York Times. ''But tuxedo-clad operagoers will not face the indignity of wearing goofy 3-D glasses.'' Amazing, to be sure, but none of this helps -- you have to hope that it doesn't hinder -- the poor tenor at center stage for most of five hours, singing his heart and his voice out: in this case, Gary Lehman, replacing Ben Heppner, who withdrew from the punishing role in February because, according to his manager, it ''was just not the right repertoire for him.'' The opera is also a long haul for the conductor, and here again, Fabio Luisi has replaced James Levine. Deborah Voigt sings Brunnhilde; Bryn Terfel, the Wanderer; Eric Owens, Alberich. Opens Oct. 27. Metropolitan Opera House.
BUDAPEST FESTIVAL ORCHESTRA The thoughtful Hungarian-born pianist Andras Schiff begins his season-long Carnegie Perspectives series, focusing on Bartok, with favorite collaborators: the conductor Ivan Fischer and the Budapest players, who are becoming regular and welcome visitors to New York. Mr. Schiff performs the three Bartok piano concertos over two evenings. Mr. Fischer and the orchestra fill out the programs with works of Schubert, including the Fifth and Ninth Symphonies, and more Bartok. Separate article by Vivien Schweitzer. Oct. 28-29. Carnegie Hall.
MIDORI This excellent violinist, possessed of a rare aesthetic and social sensibility, has carved out a major career on her own terms, devoting at least as much effort to education and public service as to performing. After her repertory adventures and commissioning projects of recent years, she reverts to standard fare -- works of Mozart, Schubert, Schumann and Shostakovich -- for this recital, and she should be at her communicative best in the Y's intimate hall. Ozgur Aydin is the pianist. Oct. 29. 92nd Street Y.
JONAS KAUFMANN The way cancellations have gone in recent seasons, the Met should post betting odds with its rosters. This German tenor, who has swept all before him in recent seasons at the house, is scheduled to make his New York recital debut there less than two months, it turns out, after surgery to remove a node from his chest. Helmut Deutsch is the pianist. So what are the odds? Oct. 30. Metropolitan Opera House.
ANDRAS SCHIFF AT CARNEGIE The pianist Mr. Schiff rounds out the opening volley of his Perspectives concerts with a recital in the Stern Auditorium, offering more Bartok, the Piano Sonata, along with Bach's Three-Part Inventions and Beethoven's ''Diabelli'' Variations. Separate article by Vivien Schweitzer. Oct. 31. Carnegie Hall.
IVES VIOLIN SONATAS Hilary Hahn is the latest in a line of superb active female violinists with a fiercely independent streak, not following in the footsteps of Anne-Sophie Mutter, Midori or anyone else. It is only appropriate that Ms. Hahn should alight on the music of the surly nonconformist Charles Ives. Valentina Lisitsa is the equally fine pianist on this Deutsche Grammophon release, which should do much to establish these four works in the active repertory. October.
NOVEMBER
ROBERT ASHLEY A big season for the composer Robert Ashley begins with several nights of old and new pieces performed by his associates Tom Hamilton and Thomas Buckner with a number of young players, followed by a guerrilla performance of his opera ''Perfect Lives'' by the experimental ensemble thingNY in private and public spaces on the Lower East Side. Separate article by Steve Smith. Nov. 1, 4-5. St. Mark's Church in the Bowery, 131 East 10th Street, (212) 420-1916, incubatorarts.org. Nov. 6. Various locations.
'KOYAANISQATSI' Though no expert on film, admittedly, I found this effort by Godfrey Reggio hopelessly simplistic in its lamentation of the ''life out of balance'' of the subtitle, despite its gorgeous cinematography. Some might level a similar charge against Philip Glass's music, but for me it was the best part of the film: enough to elevate it above the ordinary. The New York Philharmonic and the Philip Glass Ensemble play the score live to accompany a screening of the film, with Michael Riesman conducting. Separate article by Allan Kozinn. Nov. 2-3. Avery Fisher Hall.
PHILADELPHIA ORCHESTRA As its financial doldrums drag on and key players decamp or contemplate new positions, the orchestra waits yet another season for its new music director, Yannick Nezet-Seguin, to arrive. The stalwart Charles Dutoit continues in the interim position of chief conductor, and in a significant gesture, Mr. Nezet-Seguin has added a fourth week of subscription concerts to the three he was scheduled to conduct this season. But the dispirited ensemble needs more than gestures, and you have to wonder how long the center can hold. For his first subscription week, Mr. Nezet-Seguin offers Mozart's Symphony No. 40 and -- with the soprano Dorothea Roschmann, the baritone Matthias Goerne and the Westminster Symphonic Choir -- Brahms's ''German Requiem.'' Nov. 3-5. Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts, (215) 893-1999, philorch.org.
'SATYAGRAHA' Richard Croft returns as Gandhi in a revival of Phelim McDermott's production of this touchstone work by Philip Glass. Separate article by Allan Kozinn. Opens Nov. 4. Metropolitan Opera House.
OPERA ORCHESTRA OF NEW YORK In his first concert as the company's full-fledged music director, Alberto Veronesi conducts Cilea's ''Adriana Lecouvreur.'' The ''dream cast,'' as the company's Web site (operaorchestrany.org) calls it (wait, aren't the newly enriched Philadelphia Eagles the dream team?), is led by Angela Gheorghiu and Jonas Kaufmann: a sort of consolation prize for the Gheorghiu-Kaufmann partnership that won't be happening in the Met's ''Faust,'' even if Mr. Kaufmann has recovered from his preseason surgery by then, because of Ms. Gheorghiu's withdrawal. Nov. 8. Carnegie Hall.
'DARK SISTERS' As New York awaits a Nico Muhly opera on a large scale -- ''Two Boys,'' which opened to considerable acclaim at the English National Opera in June and is due at the Metropolitan in the 2013-14 season -- the Gotham Chamber Opera presents the premiere of one on a small scale. Set to a libretto by Stephen Karam and based in part on reports out of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, it deals with the plight of a woman trapped in a polygamous relationship and those of her sister wives. Opens Nov. 9. Gerald W. Lynch Theater, John Jay College, 899 10th Avenue, at 58th Street, (212) 279-4200, gothamchamberopera.org.
HUELGAS ENSEMBLE The White Light Festival at Lincoln Center seems to have adapted Thomas Tallis's 40-part motet, ''Spem in Alium,'' as a sort of theme song. Last year the festival, in its first season, presented an installation based on the work: an electronic deconstruction that placed listeners inside a circle of 40 speakers, each delivering mainly the sound of a single voice. Now this excellent Belgian choir, directed by Paul Van Nevel, performs the work straight, in the first of two festival concerts in more or less neighboring churches. That program, ''Utopia,'' also offers works by Gabrieli, Striggio, Brumel, Josquin and others. The second program, ''Medieval Apocalypse,'' includes works by Perotin, Machaut, Ciconia and Matteo de Perugia. Nov. 10. Fourth Universalist Church, 160 Central Park West. Nov. 12. Church of St. Mary the Virgin, 146 West 46th Street, (212) 721-6500, whitelightfestival.org.
VIENNA SYMPHONY No question, this is Vienna's other orchestra, though still in a very good league. Unlike the Vienna Philharmonic, it has a principal conductor, Fabio Luisi, whom New York is quickly getting to know as an opera maestro, now the principal conductor of the Metropolitan Opera and the presumptive heir to James Levine as music director. But the Vienna orchestras have things in common beyond their home city: for one, of the 25 or so Vienna Symphony players pictured in Lincoln Center's brochure, 2, maybe 3, are women, and fuller pictures on the orchestra's Web site (wiener-symphoniker.at) show an even smaller percentage of women. In two programs, Mr. Luisi conducts works by Beethoven (Triple Concerto), Brahms (Second Symphony), that Austrian favorite Franz Schmidt (Fourth Symphony) and Rachmaninoff (Second Piano Concerto, with Lisa de la Salle as soloist). Nov. 13-14. Avery Fisher Hall.
'KOMMILITONEN!' British eyebrows twitched when the Scottish composer Peter Maxwell Davies, a former enfant terrible, was appointed master of the queen's music in 2004. Did the queen (or whoever dispenses such honors) know what she was getting? Had Sir Peter gone soft in his knighthood (conferred in 1987)? Not entirely, it seems. ''My new opera deals with brave students who stood up for what they believed in and triggers a wonderful example of adversity,'' Mr. Davies has said of ''Kommilitonen (Young Blood!),'' which had its premiere in March at the Royal Academy of Music in London. The opera interweaves three stories of students embroiled in political activity, in Germany, China and the United States. ''At the end,'' Mr. Davies says, ''everything comes together in a great cry of freedom.'' Anne Manson conducts the Juilliard Orchestra and Juilliard Opera singers in the American premiere of the work, commissioned by the Juilliard School and the British academy. David Pountney, the librettist, directs. Nov. 16, 18, 20. Peter Jay Sharp Theater, Juilliard School.
'THAT MORNING THING' Robert Ashley's 1967 opera receives a new production as part of the Performa 11 series. Separate article by Steve Smith. Nov. 19-21. The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, (212) 255-5793, thekitchen.org.
'FAUST' Again, you have to make allowances for the pace of Jonas Kaufmann's recovery from surgery in September. Mr. Kaufmann is scheduled to take the title role here as -- in Des McAnuff's production, shared with the English National Opera -- an aging nuclear physicist in the aftermath of Hiroshima. (Other Fausts, Roberto Alagna and Joseph Calleja, are to appear later in the run in any case.) Marina Poplavskaya replaces the originally announced Angela Gheorghiu as Marguerite, and Rene Pape is a Mephistopheles not likely to be lost in the shadows. Yannick Nezet-Seguin conducts. Opens Nov. 29. Metropolitan Opera House.
DECEMBER
'MESSIAH' There is no lack of excellent performances of Handel's seasonal oratorio at Christmastime (no matter that this is not the season Handel wrote for) in New York. Kent Tritle alone will conduct two different versions on three consecutive days at Carnegie Hall (Dec. 19, the Mozart arrangement with the Oratorio Society of New York; Dec. 20 and 21, straight Handel with Musica Sacra), both eminently recommendable. But the St. Thomas Choir of Men and Boys, trained and conducted by John Scott, is generally first off the mark and often stands up as the best in the end. As always, the orchestra is the fine period-instrument Concert Royal. Dec. 6, 8. St. Thomas Church, Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street, (212) 757-7013, saintthomaschurch.org.
ELLIOTT CARTER The birthdays keep coming, and so do the compositions. The cellist Fred Sherry is organizing a concert for Mr. Carter's 103rd birthday that will include the premiere of a string trio and the American premieres of a double trio and a work called ''Trije Glasbeniki'' (''Three Musicians,'' in Slovenian). And who knows? Maybe Mr. Carter will have dashed off another piece or three for the occasion. Dec. 8. 92nd Street Y. TRINITY CHOIR And yet another run of ''Messiah'' performances. The Trinity Choir and its attendant orchestras, in their many activities for the Sept. 11 anniversary, gave considerable evidence that under Julian Wachner's directorship, they are very near the top of musical life in New York, and you can expect further proof here. Yes, I know, music may be incidental to their higher purpose, but they sure know how to pull music lovers into a church that for most of them is well out of the way. Dec. 11, 12. Trinity Church, Broadway at Wall Street, (212) 602-0800, trinitywallstreet.org. Dec. 19. Alice Tully Hall.
CONTACT! O.K., so maybe things are changing, incrementally, at the New York Philharmonic. The orchestra continues to ghettoize contemporary music in this series of concerts off premises, but it celebrates Beethoven's birthday in the quirkiest fashion imaginable (though not the most contemporary), with H. K. Gruber singing his 1977 magnum opus, ''Frankenstein!!'' Alan Gilbert conducts a program that also includes Magnus Lindberg's ''Gran Duo'' and Alexandre Lunsqui's ''Fibers, Yarn and Fabric.'' Dec. 16. Metropolitan Museum. Dec. 17. Symphony Space.
'THE ENCHANTED ISLAND' For the man who has every role: this pastiche -- cobbled together in good Baroque fashion from music of Handel, Vivaldi, Rameau and others by Jeremy Sams, who supplies his own English libretto -- gives Placido Domingo a way to expand his seemingly limitless repertory without having to resort to more baritone roles or conductorial gigs. He sings Neptune in a loose revamp of Shakespeare's ''Tempest'' and ''Midsummer Nights' Dream.'' Joyce DiDonato is Sycorax; Danielle de Niese, Ariel; David Daniels, Prospero. William Christie conducts, and Phelim McDermott directs. This confection may be just frothy enough for New Year's Eve. How it will stand up on long, cold, punishing nights in January and February remains to be seen. Opens Dec. 31. Metropolitan Opera House.
JANUARY
GREEN MOUNTAIN PROJECTPerformances of Monteverdi's 1610 Vespers by this group, built around Jolle Greenleaf's vocal ensemble Tenet, at the Church of St. Mary the Virgin were highlights of the New York season for two Januarys running. Now, evidently trusting that the third outing will be an even greater charm, the project is relocating and expanding, with a second performance in New York and a third in Cambridge, Mass. It is also deepening its explorations, this time presenting what it calls ''Vespers of 1640,'' combining music from Monteverdi's ''Selva Morale e Spirituale'' with works of Giovanni Gabrieli. Jan. 3-4. Church of St. Jean Baptiste, 184 East 76th Street. Jan. 7. St. Paul's Church, Cambridge, (646) 470-5809, tenetnyc.com.
MAHLER PROJECT Gustavo Dudamel conducts all the Mahler symphonies in just over three weeks: Nos. 1, 4, 6, 9 and 10 (Adagio) with the Los Angeles Philharmonic; Nos. 2, 3, 5 and 7 with the Simon Bolivar Symphony Orchestra (formerly Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra) of Venezuela; No. 8 (''Symphony of a Thousand'') with both orchestras. For good measure, in the first program -- alongside the Fourth Symphony, with the soprano Miah Persson as soloist -- Mr. Dudamel throws in the ''Lieder Eines Fahrenden Gesellen,'' sung by Thomas Hampson. Then, with all that behind them, the Los Angeles players will follow Mr. Dudamel and the Venezuelans to Caracas, where they will perform the symphony cycle again in mid-February. Jan. 13-15 (also Jan. 19-21, 22, 24, 26-29, 31; Feb. 2-5). Walt Disney Concert Hall, Shrine Auditorium (No. 8), Los Angeles, (323) 850-2000, laphil.com.
MUSIC OF TEREZIN Will to Create, Will to Live is an interdisciplinary series of concerts, films, exhibits and lectures focusing on artists who, in the Y's description, ''during World War II faced the horrors of incarceration and death yet managed to persevere and raise their voices.'' The Nash Ensemble of Britain presents three programs, sharing two of them with the baritone Wolfgang Holzmair and the pianist Russell Ryan. Another pianist, Shai Wosner, accompanies Mr. Holzmair in a fourth concert. Jan. 17, 19, 21, 23. 92nd Street Y.
THOMAS HAMPSON Much of the Met Museum's concert programming this season is tied to exhibitions or openings of galleries. In this case, to greet the New American Wing Galleries for Paintings, Sculpture and Decorative Arts, which opens on Jan. 16, the estimable baritone Mr. Hampson continues his multiyear project ''Song of America,'' performing works of Copland, Barber, Ives, Thomson and others in the American Wing, with Craig Rutenberg as pianist. Jan. 22. Metropolitan Museum.
'GOTTERDAMMERUNG' And now that Robert Lepage has constructed his wondrous technological contraption of a Wagner ''Ring'' cycle, it is time for it all to come crashing down. Even in lower-tech productions, the final conflagration has occasionally produced moments of actual physical danger for some on stage. (Hildegard Behrens was decked by a stray beam at the Met in 1990.) Enough has already gone wrong with the current mechanisms, and enough pratfalls have occurred on the monstrous set, that a shiver of real fear may accompany the illusion of Valhalla's collapse. This will also be the time to check in on James Levine's recovery, since he now projects these performances as his return to the podium. Opens Jan. 27. Metropolitan Opera House.
FOCUS! FESTIVAL On one hand, this contemporary-music event's focus is narrower than usual, since it centers on a single composer, John Cage, in honor of his centenary. On the other hand, Cage was in some ways the least focused of composers, ranging restlessly through musical styles and the sounds of silence, and venturing into the worlds of literature, dance and visual art. The festival will touch mostly on the musical manifestations and will touch on other American composers in performances by the New Juilliard Ensemble and the Juilliard Percussion Ensemble. Jan. 27-Feb. 3. Peter Jay Sharp Theater, Paul Hall, Juilliard School; Alice Tully Hall.
KAYHAN KALHOR Here is another concert at the Met Museum inspired by a new display space, in this case the New Galleries for the Art of the Arab Lands, Turkey, Iran, Central Asia and Later South Asia, which opens on Nov. 1. No one familiar with the Iranian Mr. Kalhor's emotionally rich yet superbly nuanced playing of the kamancheh (a Persian spike fiddle) -- and many Westerners are familiar with it, thanks especially to Yo-Yo Ma's Silk Road Project -- will want to miss this evening of traditional Persian music. (Mr. Kalhor's latest recording, ''I Will Not Stand Alone,'' is to be released by World Village in connection with the concert.) Jan. 28. Metropolitan Museum.
'RIENZI' When Eve Queler gave up the music directorship of the Opera Orchestra of New York in the spring, she left some business unfinished. In the 2008-9 season, the company, hit hard by the recession, had to cancel a concert performance of this early Wagner opera, which it had made something of a specialty over the decades. It promised the work for the next season but is only now catching up. Ms. Queler, as music director laureate, conducts the New York Choral Society and a cast including Ian Storey and Elisabete Matos. Jan. 29. Avery Fisher Hall.
AMERICAN COMPOSERS ORCHESTRA With ''Koyaanisqatsi'' and ''Satyagraha'' already out of the way, there continues to be a lot of music by Philip Glass this season, much of it in connection with his 75th birthday. The performance here, the American premiere of his Ninth Symphony, hits the birthday right on the nose. Dennis Russell Davies, a longtime Glass champion, conducts a program that also includes the New York premiere of Arvo Part's ''Lamentate.'' Separate article by Allan Kozinn. Jan. 31. Carnegie Hall.
FEBRUARY
MET + JUILLIARD Two years ago in this space, through a slip of the brain, I attributed the ''Armida'' being presented by the Metropolitan Opera to Gluck rather than Rossini. Now I can properly welcome Gluck's ''Armide,'' which in fact was performed in concert in that 2009-10 season, by Opera Lafayette, and which Anthony Tommasini called ''a seemingly flawless masterpiece'' in The New York Times It will be jointly presented here by the Met and the Juilliard School in a semistaging directed by Fabrizio Melano. Jane Glover conducts the Juilliard Orchestra and singers from the Met's young artist development program and Juilliard's institute for vocal arts. Feb. 8, 11. Peter Jay Sharp Theater, Juilliard School.
IMMORTAL INVESTMENTS The good thing about a festival devoted to, say, Tchaikovsky or Oswald von Wolkenstein, is that you have a pretty good idea what you're going to get. With the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center's high-concept fall festival, Dedications (Mozart dedicated to Haydn, Schumann dedicated to Mendelssohn; Nov. 4, 6), and its higher-concept winter festival here, the title tells you little. ''Immortal investments'' refers to patronage, tributes and commissions. So there are Haydn and Beethoven quartets commissioned by Prince Lobkowitz; works by the mutual admirers Joachim and Brahms; music by Stravinsky, Debussy, Faure and others associated with salons hosted by the Princesse de Polignac; and pieces by Ravel, Bartok, Poulenc and Copland commissioned by Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge. It all fits into a season-long theme of synergy: a tough one for a marketing department to wrap its cliches around. Feb. 10; 12; 24; 26, 28. Alice Tully Hall.
'LA TRAVIATA' The newly nomadic New York City Opera finally opens its season of full productions. On a recent visit to The New York Times, administrators of the Brooklyn Academy of Music made clear that they were happy to provide a home for City Opera performances, but only if the presentations jibe with Brooklyn Academy's own programming philosophy. Verdi's war horse, for example, might not otherwise have qualified, but the director of this new production (with scenery and costumes created for the Glimmerglass Opera and the Vancouver Opera) is Jonathan Miller, whose work has generally played well at the house. Laquita Mitchell sings the title role, David Pomeroy is Alfredo, and Steven White conducts. Opens Feb. 12. BAM Howard Gilman Opera House.
CHICAGO SYMPHONY IN SAN FRANCISCO The two programs, conducted by Riccardo Muti, will be performed in Chicago first, but here they are part of an American Orchestra Series the San Francisco Symphony is presenting to celebrate its centennial. It has invited six major ensembles to perform two concerts each, including works they have commissioned. Chicago presents works by its composers in residence, Mason Bates's ''Alternative Energy'' (with Honegger's ''Pacific 231'' and Franck's Symphony in D minor) and Anna Clynes's ''Night Ferry'' (with Schubert's Ninth Symphony and an entr'acte from his incidental music for ''Rosamunde''). Other orchestras participating are the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Boston Symphony, the Cleveland Orchestra, the New York Philharmonic and the Philadelphia Orchestra, Feb. 14, 15. Davies Symphony Hall, San Francisco, (415) 864-6000, sfsymphony.org.
'PRIMA DONNA' When challenged recently as to why, with only four productions to spare this season, the scaled-down New York City Opera would stake so much on a Rufus Wainwright opera that even some of Mr. Wainwright's staunchest admirers found wanting at its premiere in Manchester, England, in 2009, George Steel, City Opera's general manager and artistic director, rose to a spirited defense. ''It's a beautiful and remarkably accomplished work,'' he said, ''a love letter to French opera. It's never been performed in the United States, and it's precisely the kind of thing City Opera ought to perform.'' The Brooklyn Academy's administrators seem to agree. The rest will be history, of one sort or another. Opens Feb. 19. BAM Howard Gilman Opera House.
ERIK OWENS This bass-baritone turned the seemingly thankless role of Alberich in Wagner's ''Rheingold'' into a star vehicle last season. And now -- in addition to singing Alberich this season in ''Rheingold,'' ''Siegfried'' and ''Gotterdammerung'' -- Mr. Owens does what stars do, taking over the stage for a solo recital. The program includes works by Schubert, Schumann, Wolf, Debussy, Duparc, Ravel and, yes, Wagner; and the pianist, in a bit of glamour casting, is the conductor Robert Spano. Feb. 21. Zankel Hall.
BERLIN PHILHARMONIC When last heard in Carnegie, in 2009, Simon Rattle and this great orchestra had to compete with sounds intruding from a concert of Cape Verdean music in Zankel Hall. Carnegie seems to have ironed out that wrinkle in its programming strategy and made the world safe for pianissimos again. Of those there will be many (often opposite mighty fortissimos), in Debussy's ''Prelude a l'Apres-Midi d'un Faune,'' Schoenberg's ''Verklarte Nacht'' and Elgar's ''Enigma Variations'' on the first night; a completion of Bruckner's Ninth Symphony on the second; and Mahler's ''Resurrection'' Symphony on the third. Feb. 23-25. Carnegie Hall.
TUNE-IN MUSIC FESTIVAL This event, in its second season, is one of many celebrations of Philip Glass's 75th birthday and includes a performance of the huge and seminal Music in 12 Parts. Separate article by Allan Kozinn. Feb. 23-26. Park Avenue Armory, 643 Park Avenue, at 67th Street, (212) 616-3930, armoryonpark.org.
MARCH
THE MODERN BEETHOVEN You don't need much of a pretext to sell a Beethoven festival to your marketing department, especially at the New York Philharmonic. David Zinman conducts the orchestra in all the master's symphonies except the Fifth (say, what?), the Sixth (presented earlier in the season) and the Ninth, interspersed with 20th-century concertos of sorts by Stravinsky, Barber and Karl Amadeus Hartmann. Beethoven's Second and Seventh and Stravinsky's Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra lead off. Expect brisk tempos from Mr. Zinman, one who supports the notion that Beethoven's metronome marks, disputed over the centuries, were probably what he wanted after all. March 1-3, 6 (also March, 8, 10, 13; 15-17, 20). Avery Fisher Hall.
VIENNA PHILHARMONIC As New Yorkers well know, if only from his tenure with their Philharmonic, Lorin Maazel can be an exasperating conductor, given to overcontrolling mannerisms. But he can also be deeply satisfying in certain repertory, and he has often proved so in Sibelius. The first of these three concerts, with Sibelius's First, Fifth and Seventh Symphonies, could well be a knockout. And to whatever extent Mr. Maazel just lets this magnificent band play, the other programs should hold many rewards, too, with Mozart's Symphony No. 40 and Mr. Maazel's own Wagner arrangement, ''The Ring Without Words,'' on Saturday evening and works by Richard Strauss and the Johann Strausses on Sunday afternoon. March 2-4. Carnegie Hall.
KAIJA SAARIAHO Ms. Saariaho, who occupies the composer's chair at Carnegie Hall this season, will be represented in concerts by the Finnish Avanti! Chamber Ensemble (Nov. 30), the St. Louis Symphony (March 10) and the Cleveland Orchestra (May 23). And with the cellist Anssi Kartunen, she will conduct a professional training workshop for composers and solo string players. Here she is featured in Carnegie's Making Music series with a program of her works performed by the French vocal ensemble Solistes XXI. March 5. Zankel Hall.
BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Before three Carnegie concerts by the orchestra in March, there was a last-minute scramble to find replacement conductors for James Levine after his cancellation for health reasons. Around the same time, for the same reasons, Mr. Levine gave up the music directorship of the orchestra, which thus had plenty of time to find replacements for this season. They are Kurt Masur (himself seemingly in parlous health) in Beethoven's ''Missa Solemnis,'' Christoph Eschenbach in a program of Berlioz and Ravel, and Stephane Deneve in works by Ravel, Stravinsky and Shostakovich. March 6-7, 9. Carnegie Hall.
PIATIGORSKY INTERNATIONAL CELLO FESTIVAL The American cellist Ralph Kirshbaum, long resident in London, founded the respected Manchester International Cello Festival at the Royal Northern College of Music in 1988, which ran at two- or three-year intervals, and oversaw it to its end, in 2007. Mr. Kirshbaum has since moved to Los Angeles, where he teaches at the University of Southern California and now unveils a successor event, a partnership involving the university's music school, the Colburn School and the Los Angeles Philharmonic. More than 20 noted cellists are scheduled to appear, and 6 of them will divvy up the Bach solo suites in a single evening (March 11). Three will perform concertos in Philharmonic concerts conducted by Neeme Jarvi in the Walt Disney Concert Hall: Mr. Kirshbaum in the Dvorak Concerto (March 15), Mischa Maisky in the Shostakovich First (March 17) and Alisa Weilerstein in Tchaikovsky's ''Rococo'' Variations and Respighi's ''Adagio con Variazioni'' (March 18). March 9-18. Various locations in Los Angeles, (213) 740-3129, usc.edu/piatigorsky--festival.
L'ARPEGGIATA Carnegie Hall bestows the honor of a Perspectives series on an early-music group for the first time. And it does so to performers who made their North American debut just last fall, in Zankel Hall, and are known in this country almost solely through recordings. But those recordings are impressive, as were reports on the Zankel concert, which The New York Times didn't manage to cover on a typically hectic October evening of performances. March promises to be the other busy month this season, but it will be hard to miss this lineup of four programs, which bring those recordings to life and will undoubtedly add novelties and surprises, for they appear to be rich in the group's trademark quasi-jazz improvisations. The repertory reflects its specialty in early-17th-century French and Italian music. Christina Pluhar, a lutenist and harpist, is the artistic director. March 14-17. Zankel Hall, Weill Recital Hall.
AMSTERDAM BAROQUE ORCHESTRA AND CHOIR You may think you know nothing of Bach's Cantata No. 147 (''Herz und Mund und Tat und Leben''), but if you know the tune ''Jesu Joy of Man's Desiring,'' you're two chorales ahead of the game. And if you don't know Bach's spectacular and wonderfully compact Magnificat, you're in for a second huge treat. All that -- and another cantata, ''Du Hirte Israel, Hore'' (No. 104) -- by expert performers, led by Ton Koopman. Not to be missed. March 15. Alice Tully Hall.
CALLAS ON FILM You saw ''Master Class,'' with Tyne Daly if not before. You've read about charisma, courtesy of Zachary Woolfe in The New York Times. Now see and hear Maria Callas in action (insofar as the technology of the era allowed) in Alain Ferrari's 1978 documentary ''Vissi d'Arte,'' a film of a 1959 Hamburg concert and a selection of clips of the diva in conversation and on stage. March 17-18. Walter Reade Theater.
'COSI FAN TUTTE' Christopher Alden, who directed an acclaimed production of ''Don Giovanni'' at the New York City Opera in 2009, continues his survey of the Mozart operas to librettos by Lorenzo Da Ponte. Separate article by Zachary Woolfe. Opens March 18. Gerald W. Lynch Theater, John Jay College, 899 10th Avenue, at 58th Street, (212) 870-5600, nycopera.com.
'ST. JOHN PASSION' A Bach Passion can rise (or fall) on the strength (or weakness) of the tenor singing the Evangelist. Bernard Labadie's expert performances of Handel's ''Messiah'' and Bach's ''Christmas Oratorio'' at Carnegie Hall with his Violons du Roy and Chapelle de Quebec in 2009 would have raised expectations for another major outing in any case, despite some suspect work by vocal soloists. But here Mr. Labadie and his forces have the inestimable advantage of -- to judge from recordings, at least -- a great Evangelist, the English tenor Ian Bostridge. And if Mr. Bostridge is not the best Bach Evangelist at work today, then it can only be the English-German tenor Rufus Muller. New Yorkers have the remarkable opportunity to hear them both in the ''St. John'' within less than a week. Mr. Muller, who performs the work with the St. Thomas Choir of Men and Boys and the period-instrument Concert Royal, conducted by John Scott, has so internalized the role that he sings it from memory. Unable to choose between them, I choose to hear both. Labadie-Bostridge, March 25. Carnegie Hall. Scott-Muller, March 30. St. Thomas Church, Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street, (212) 757-7013, saintthomaschurch.org.
'MANON' And here is Anna Netrebko in another new production. New to the Met that is. Laurent Pelly's staging of Massenet's opera originated at the Royal Opera in London, where, according to one quaintly mixed metaphor in the British press, it ''triggered'' a ''shower of plaudits.'' The cast also includes Piotr Beczala and Paulo Szot, and Fabio Luisi conducts. Opens March 26. Metropolitan Opera House.
AMERICAN MAVERICKS Michael Tilson Thomas and the San Francisco Symphony return to a concept they developed in 2000, presenting music by strong-willed Americans of the 20th and now 21st centuries, this time transporting it to New York as well. The Carnegie series opens (after a few neighborhood concerts) with a celebration of John Cage, in honor of his centenary, by So Percussion. Then the orchestra chimes in -- in whole (Varese's ''Ameriques'') or in part (Steve Reich's ''Six Marimbas'') -- with four programs of music by American pioneers (Ives, Cowell, Ruggles, Partch) and latter-day settlers (John Adams, David Del Tredici, Mason Bates, Meredith Monk). March 26-30. Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall.
APRIL
'DER RING DES NIBELUNGEN' Unless the climactic conflagration of ''Gotterdammerung'' has by now swallowed up Robert Lepage's mighty machine along with all Valhalla, the Met will stretch the four operas of its new Wagner ''Ring'' cycle end to end for the first time, then a second and a third. Next comes the question of its future. Once you know all the technological tricks, will you want to see the thing again? True, hearing it -- with James Levine's splendid orchestra and a generally fine cast -- is something else, and since the production undoubtedly cost too much even to contemplate scrapping it quickly, seeing it again will undoubtedly be the price operagoers have to pay to hear ''The Ring'' here again anytime soon. Mr. Levine's future should also be clearer by now. He is scheduled to conduct all three cycles, but from this distance the notion that he could muster the necessary strength and stamina seems a forlorn hope. Then again, any hope is better than none. Opens April 7. Metropolitan Opera House.
MITSUKO UCHIDA This superb pianist plays the three great posthumous sonatas of Schubert (D. 958-60), and I can only repeat much of what I said two seasons ago, when she played the three last sonatas of Beethoven: Ms. Uchida, who does so many things well, is typically at her best when plumbing the philosophical depths of late works by composers like Beethoven and Schubert, and I, for one, ache to hear her play an evening of the ineffable late piano works of Brahms, miniature in form but vast in expressive content. That, clearly, remains for another day. Meanwhile, we can only welcome Ms. Uchida's latest thoughts on Schubert; her earlier thoughts, on Philips recordings, were already remarkable. April 11. Carnegie Hall.
ORCHESTRA OF ST LUKE'S The versatile maestro Ivan Fisher scored many points as a Mozartean this summer at Lincoln Center's Mostly Mozart Festival, directing as well as conducting a concert staging of ''Don Giovanni'' and leading a program of the ''Jupiter'' Symphony and sacred works, early and late. Here he offers a variation on that concert, with Mozart's Symphony No. 34 (in C, like the ''Jupiter'') and the unfinished Requiem, with the orchestra joined by Musica Sacra and vocal soloists. April 12. Carnegie Hall.
FASIL SAY Some prominent features of recent Met Museum seasons seem to have gone by the board, at least for this transitional year, like the series of piano recitals in the Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium. The outing here, by a sometimes quirky but compelling pianist, in works by Janacek and Prokofiev and music of his own, should be fascinating. It had better be, since that's pretty much it for the season. April 20. Metropolitan Museum.
'GHOSTS OF VERSAILLES' In an ambitious undertaking, the Manhattan School of Music Opera Theater presents a major opera by John Corigliano, who studied composition at the school as a graduate student and taught composition there from 1971 to 1991. The work was commissioned by the Metropolitan Opera (in days when the Met wasn't doing much of that sort of thing) and given its premiere there in 1991. Jay Lesenger directs, and Steven Osgood conducts. April 25, 27, 29. Borden Auditorium, Manhattan School of Music, 120 Claremont Avenue, (917) 493-4428, msmnyc.edu.
MAY
ANDRAS SCHIFF AT ZANKEL For his second Perspectives recital, Mr. Schiff adds contemporary composers, Gyorgy Kurtag and Jorg Widmann, to his earlier three B's (Bach, Beethoven and Bartok) in a program of miniatures. Separate article by Vivien Schweitzer. May 2. Zankel Hall.
SPRING FOR MUSIC This festival, wisely placed at a time of year when the concert season has started to slow, generated considerable attention in its first outing last May and great excitement for several North American orchestras that had seldom if ever played in Carnegie Hall. In the festival's second season, the Alabama Symphony Orchestra, based in Birmingham and conducted by Justin Brown, and the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra of Alberta, conducted by William Eddins, will make their Carnegie Hall debuts. Also appearing are the Houston Symphony, the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra, the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra and the Nashville Symphony. Since the choices were made on the basis of innovative programming ideas and tickets are priced at $25, the potential rewards far outweigh the risks. May 7-12. Carnegie Hall.
'ORPHEUS' The New York City Opera has played no small part in the Handel opera revival of recent decades. Now, in a season in which the newly nomadic company looks to extend its traditions with any number of twists, it turns its Baroque attentions to Telemann, a composer steeped in a German style less influenced by the Italian than Handel's. Those unfamiliar with the work -- almost everyone, surely -- would do well to bone up with Rene Jacobs's recording of it on Harmonia Mundi. The baritone Daniel Teadt sings the title role in an auditorium said by some who know it to be acoustically and atmospherically ideal for Baroque opera. Opens May 12. Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, (212) 870-5600, nycopera.com.
CHRISTIAN TETZLAFF When a performer sells you on a work that used to seem intractable, you remember. For me, hearing Mr. Tetzlaff play Schoenberg's Violin Concerto with Christoph von Dohnanyi and the Cleveland Orchestra in 1988 was such an experience. Here Mr. Tetzlaff plays the Schoenberg with the Met Orchestra, still scheduled to be conducted by James Levine, and for most violinists, that would be more than enough exertion for a day. But Mr. Tetzlaff also throws in Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto in E minor and Mozart's Adagio in E (K. 261). Truly, what does he do for an encore? May 20. Carnegie Hall.
CLEVELAND ORCHESTRA Franz Welser-Most, who may have won new fans in New York with his performances of Bruckner and John Adams at the Lincoln Center Festival this summer, would like you to know that -- now the general music director of the Vienna State Opera -- he can also be a formidable opera conductor. The second program here is a blockbuster: a concert performance of Strauss's ''Salome,'' with the fast-rising dramatic soprano Nina Stemme in the title role, Eric Owens as Jochanaan and an orchestra starrier than either. The first program is as multifaceted as the second is single-minded, offering Brahms's Second Piano Concerto, with Yefim Bronfman as soloist; Shostakovich's Sixth Symphony; and the New York premiere of Kaija Saariaho's ''Laterna Magica.'' May 23-24. Carnegie Hall.
'THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO THE OTHER MARY' Here, in its premiere, is another in a line of evening-length oratorios that John Adams began with ''El Nino,'' based on the nativity of Jesus, in 2000. This one takes off from Jesus' Passion and incorporates the story of Lazarus. Peter Sellars produced the libretto, using writings of the Mexican poet Rosario Castellanos, Dorothy Day, Louise Erdich and June Jordan. Gustavo Dudamel conducts the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Los Angeles Master Chorale and soloists including three countertenors, who carry the narration. May 31; June 1-3. Walt Disney Concert Hall, Los Angeles, (323) 850-2000, laphil.com.
JUNE
'SINFONIA ESPANSIVA' Alan Gilbert continues to work his way through the symphonies of Carl Nielsen with the New York Philharmonic, here adding the Third. Mr. Gilbert and the orchestra are recording the symphonies and concertos for the Danish label Dacapo. The Third will be released with the Second, performed last January, in the first release, next fall, and the project is to run to 2015. ''I'm sure Nielsen's time has now come,'' Mr. Gilbert has said, and high time, though whatever neglect Nielsen's music may have suffered over the decades has not been for lack of excellent recordings. Here's hoping that Mr. Gilbert has whatever touch or timing is needed to make the difference. June 14-16. Avery Fisher Hall.
PHILHARMONIC AT THE ARMORY Kurt Masur, as music director of the New York Philharmonic in the 1990s, had his eye for a time on the Park Avenue Armory as a site for a series of summer concerts akin to the BBC Proms concerts in the vast Royal Albert Hall in London. Well, there's no series yet, but here is a program that takes his idea and walks with it. Alan Gilbert conducts, joined by two other maestros, Magnus Lindberg and Matthias Pintscher, as needed, since the main attraction is Karlheinz Stockhausen's ''Gruppen'' (''Groups''), which divides the ensemble into three separate orchestras playing simultaneously and at odds with one another. The program also includes works by Ives, Pierre Boulez and Mozart. Mozart? The Act I finale from ''Don Giovanni'' was chosen, presumably, because Mozart uses three little bands playing competing dance tunes at the same time. Now can we expand on this delightful escapade? And invite Mr. Masur back to conduct in the next outing? June 29-30. Park Avenue Armory, 643 Park Avenue, at 67th Street, (212) 875-5656, nyphil.org.

HEADLINE: The Future, Retrenched

BYLINE: By PHILIP NOBEL

 BODY:
WHAT may be the biggest architecture event of the year ahead has not yet been scheduled. But when it happens, it'll be a doozy: MGM Resorts International recently announced its intention to demolish the Harmon, a tower by Norman Foster that is a prominent component of the new CityCenter development in Las Vegas. Construction flaws were found years ago, and the building was never completed or occupied. Still, the spectacle of a boom-time project by one of the world's most celebrated designers razed by a controlled implosion is sure to spark talk about the state of architecture today.
The fate of Mr. Foster's building is a timely metaphor. Institutional work, with its longer project timelines and steadier financial supply, is continuing apace through the recession. Some ambitious commercial plans, like the development of the West Side rail yards in Manhattan, are moving forward. But the days of true extravagance, exemplified by CityCenter and its collection of flashy buildings by big-name architects, is over for now, in Western nations at least. 
The months to come will offer few grand openings of the kind that merit front-page coverage and spotlights on the street. Most major projects that were in the construction pipeline before the 2008 financial crash have either been completed or indefinitely postponed; ambitious new buildings, like the crop of 1,000-foot-plus towers planned for or under construction in Midtown Manhattan, are years away.
Preston Scott Cohen's interesting new building for the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, important as the first major work of a theorist who has garnered a lot of critical attention in recent years, may stand out as something of an exception, even an anachronism, when it opens on Nov. 2. So too may the Military History Museum in Dresden, Germany, designed by Daniel Libeskind as a brutal insertion into an existing structure and set to be unveiled on Oct. 14. Renzo Piano's large but sensitive addition to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston is scheduled to open its doors on Jan. 19, but Mr. Piano's light modernist touch is less likely to invite comparisons to the past decade's architectural excesses in the way Mr. Libeskind's and Mr. Cohen's museums, with their more aggressively convoluted forms, seem ready to.
As they are completed in the months to come the many buildings under construction for next summer's Olympic Games in London may turn the conversation back to formal experimentation in the building arts. Until then there is a reprieve. We are starting to see a natural turn toward substance, an interest in engagement with the world via architecture -- and examinations of architecture's place in the world -- that goes beyond daring structural innovation or crowd-pleasing surface effects.
In April the Museum of Modern Art in New York announced an initiative to research architectural responses to the foreclosure crisis, in partnership with the Temple Hoyne Buell Center for the Study of American Architecture at Columbia University. Five interdisciplinary teams have been imagining better-built futures for the country, and the resulting projects will be shown in an exhibition, ''Foreclosed: Rehousing the American Dream,'' opening on Feb. 14.
The Canadian Center for Architecture in Montreal seems to be moving along similar salutary lines. ''Imperfect Health,'' organized by Giovanna Borasi and Mirko Zardini, is a look at how the architecture of our cities contributes to pollution, anxiety and illness. The show opens on Oct. 25. Those wishing to know more about the state of architecture in our uncertain times should mark the entire month of October on their calendars. Archtober, a program coordinated by the Center for Architecture and the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects, will fill the city next month with exhibitions, film screenings, tours and lectures on our buildings, our cities and where we might go from here.

HEADLINE: Tax Cuts For Business?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''How to Make Business Want to Invest Again'' (Economic View, Sept. 11), N. Gregory Mankiw suggested a cut in corporate taxation as a first step toward encouraging companies to investment in the economy. Other business columnists have made similar recommendations, all despite news reports that some major corporations have paid either minimal or no taxes for years. 
Business organizations clamor for tax cuts as the solution to any problem they face. But when you ask individual business owners about their lack of investment, they often cite a lack of orders and customers. The current tax rates, especially when rarely paid, are no more a hindrance to investment than they were during the boom decade preceding the downturn.
Arthur D. Aptowitz
Forest Hills, Queens, Sept. 12
To the Editor:
As one possible way to encourage the economy's long-term growth, Professor Mankiw suggested ''tax reform that reduced the burden on capital income and shifted it toward consumption.''
But such a view appears antithetical to any theory for responsible government policy during an economic slowdown. Consumer spending, not corporate investment, is the main driver of the economy, and depressing it further with new tax burdens would be counterproductive to any recovery.
Moreover, the cost of capital is not the main impediment to new capital investment today; instead, it is lack of demand for the additional goods that might be produced. Corporate capital costs are already subsidized with historically low interest rates from the government's aggressive monetary policy.

HEADLINE: The Vital Importance of Manufacturing

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Woe is us if the headline on your recent article, ''Is Manufacturing Falling Off the Radar?'' (Sept. 11), is answered in the affirmative. 
If the economic downturn has revealed anything, it is that true, sustainable wealth creation -- and the jobs that come along with it -- will not arise from the gambling casinos of Wall Street. The key to a healthy economy, and the viability of a middle class, can only be found in an innovative manufacturing sector.
While many Americans believe in manufacturing's importance to the economy, many also have an outdated view of manufacturing as a sweaty, grimy business. Nothing, of course, could be further from the truth, as productivity gains in our increasingly high-tech manufacturing sector attest.
This perception problem is at the root of the article's provocative question. Many industry executives and associations have been working hard to change this unfortunate view, but without leadership at the national level, the problem has persisted.
That is why I and others have suggested a cabinet-level Department of Manufacturing. This agency would help put industry on the strategic footing it needs -- in the federal government, in the industry itself and in the hearts and minds of all Americans. It would help drive home the idea that manufacturing is the bedrock of the economy.
David R. Brousell
Manhattan, Sept. 11
The writer is editor in chief of Manufacturing Executive.
To the Editor:
As for the financial sector replacing manufacturing in its effect on the economy, do we really need more derivative products and the like?
Obviously, one benefit of the manufacturing sector, besides jobs, is the income it generates for the middle class. In my experience, the decreasing size of the manufacturing sector is directly responsible for increasing income disparities, which in turn has a direct economic impact in the form of anemic overall growth.

HEADLINE: 'I Won't Entirely Have Forgotten These Writers,But I'll Have Learned to Live Without Them'

BYLINE: By DWIGHT GARNER

 BODY:
''To start with, look at all the books.'' That's the promising first sentence of Jeffrey Eugenides's new novel, ''The Marriage Plot,'' due in bookstores this fall. The book is about three college friends from Brown University, and at first taste -- I've been toting around an advance copy -- it appears to be luscious: humane, recondite and funny. Part of the heavy anticipation for ''The Marriage Plot,'' though, is a simple emotional response: We've missed this man. It has been nine years since Eugenides's last novel, the Pulitzer Prize-winning ''Middlesex.'' It has been a long, lonely vigil. We'd nearly forgotten he was out there. 
Eugenides, it turns out, has always worked on the nine-year plan. ''The Marriage Plot'' is only his third novel in 18 years. His books, like certain comets, are rare events. So much time elapses between them that his image in dust-jacket photographs can change alarmingly. On the flap of his first novel, ''The Virgin Suicides'' (1993), he seemed shy and earnest; he had some baby fat and a bit of hair. By the time ''Middlesex'' appeared, he was thinner, balder and possessed of a wily Van Dyke beard. Suddenly he resembled Ezra Pound or Errol Flynn in a swashbuckling role. I'm a bit afraid to look at his next one.
''To start with, look at all the books.'' That's a terrific first sentence. But at the pace he's publishing -- Eugenides is 51 -- there will never be many of his books at which to look.
Distressingly, this kind of long gestation period is pretty typical for America's corps of young, elite celebrity novelists. Jonathan Franzen took nine years to follow ''The Corrections'' (2001) with his next novel, ''Freedom'' (2010), and ''The Corrections'' itself was nine years in the making. Donna Tartt vanished for a decade between ''The Secret History'' (1992) and ''The Little Friend'' (2002); at this pace we're due for a fat new Tarttlet next fall. Michael Chabon has gone seven years between major novels. David Foster Wallace was still working on his follow-up to ''Infinite Jest'' (1995) when he died in 2008, though in between he published excellent books of nonfiction and stories.
Obviously, some of this is about personal style. There have always been prolific writers as well as slow-moving, blocked, gin-addled or silent ones. It's worth suggesting, though, that something more meaningful may be going on here; these long spans between books may indicate a desalinating tidal change in the place novelists occupy in our culture. Suddenly our important writers seem less like color commentators, sifting through the emotional, sexual and intellectual detritus of how we live today, and more like a mountaintop Moses, handing down the granite tablets every decade or so to a bemused and stooped populace. We roll our eyes at how seldom Time magazine puts writers on its cover -- it once did so quite often -- and sense this is evidence of the public's shrinking appetite for quality literature. Perhaps it has got more to do with our novelists' lagging output, their eroded willingness to be central to the cultural conversation.
Take, as a counterpoint, Saul Bellow, who over 11 industrious years delivered four novels, several of them among the 20th century's best: ''The Adventures of Augie March'' (1953); ''Seize the Day'' (1956); ''Henderson the Rain King'' (1959); and ''Herzog'' (1964). Bellow snatched control, with piratical confidence and a throbbing id, of American literature's hive mind. ''We are always looking,'' he once said, ''for the book it is necessary to read next.'' For this vivifying span, the book to read next was nearly always one of Bellow's own.
Bellow could have spent those 11 years differently. He might have toiled on a ''grander'' book, let's say a slablike ''Augie March.'' This hurts my head to ponder. Philip Roth, who has been on a phosphorescent late-career run, issuing nearly a novel a year from 2000 through 2010, might have instead decided to decant all that strong sinister wine into a single 1,200-page vessel that you would be tempted to title ''Horny Goat Stares Down Death.'' Thank you, Philip Roth, for not afflicting us thus. Among the mesmerizing things about his recent work is that we've felt as if we were reading him in something close to real time; this has given his books heat as well as light.
John Updike kept up a casually herculean pace his entire career. He wrote so much -- 60 books during his lifetime -- that Martin Amis called him, memorably, a ''psychotic Santa of volubility.'' When Updike reviewed a novel by another sadistically productive human being, Joyce Carol Oates, he wondered aloud if she needed ''a lustier audience'' of ''Victorian word eaters.''
Updike and Oates are extreme examples, but there's something to be said for what might be called the Woody Allen Method: Good times, bad times, you keep making art. Many of your productions will hit; some will miss; some will miss by a lot. But there's no time for the flatulent gas of pretension to seep into your construction's sheetrock. This is how Trollope, Balzac and Dickens worked. Each would have agreed with Gore Vidal, who once declared of those who moan about writer's block: ''You're not meant to be doing this. Plenty more where you came from.''
This is not a plea for hasty work or for the death of the big novel. If there's a ''Middlemarch'' or a ''Magic Mountain'' or a ''House for Mr. Biswas'' to be had, yes, please, bring it on. These novels are sustained and sustaining; they are also extreme rarities.
It's not hard to sense what these modern, parsimonious writers are rebelling against. Surely they're in flight from the shackling apparatus of modern publishing: the long press tours (''Hello, Cleveland!''), the much-hated publicity stops. The very economics of being a writer function as a set of speed bumps. Most novelists hold down teaching positions that subsidize their work; these jobs are also work-thwarters.
Some novelists may be in revolt against today's almost militarily mechanized pop writers. Not so long ago a dignified genre writer -- a John Grisham, let's say -- was expected to issue a book a year. Now we confront James Patterson, who publishes as many as nine a year; they pop from the chute like Krispy Kremes. Many of Patterson's books are composed with other writers, as if he had a tree filled with Keebler elves outfitted with laptops and wee kegs of Red Bull.
For some novelists who write long and slow, there may be a subconscious critical strategy at play. As the critic Dwight Macdonald once put it, ''It is difficult for American reviewers to resist a long, ambitious novel: they are betrayed by the American admiration of size and scope, also by the American sense of good fellowship; they find it hard to say to the author, after all his work: 'Sorry, but it's terrible.' ''
Another result of the once-a-decade approach is that you feel obliged to put out novels that appear to have genuinely taken 10 years to write. Franzen's ''Freedom'' (576 pages) could have stood some liposuction, and Tartt's ''Little Friend'' (640 pages) would have benefited from a great deal of it. Few readers wished these books -- or Eugenides's ''Middlesex'' (544 pages) -- longer. The Brits have always been better at not overstaying their welcome. In the 1980s and '90s, Julian Barnes delivered a running master class in the shortish novel, and Ian McEwan, running alongside him, picked up the baton. But here in America, we respect girth. ''Middlesex'' may go down as Eugenides's signal accomplishment. But it's his ethereal and almost novella-length ''Virgin Suicides'' I'll reread first and perhaps even often. I feel about it the way its young protagonists did, watching one of the teenage Lisbon sisters in an intimate moment: ''The zipper opened all the way down our spines.''
Art is supposed to emerge, unless you are Jackson Pollock or Banksy, slowly; it drips rather than flows. We are suspicious of ease. It has always been easy to poke fun at overwriters. Most-prolific lists are packed with regrettable names like Barbara Cartland (700-plus books), Isaac Asimov (400 plus) and the South African Mary Faulkner, no relation to William, who wrote more than 900 books. At minimum, a writer's book should be like his or her serious boyfriends or girlfriends; if there are some you can't remember, you have had too many.
Serious writers are sometimes mocked for logorrhea as well. According to the novelist and biographer Jay Parini, himself no slouch in the production department, there's a story about a graduate student who telephoned the great literary critic Harold Bloom at home. Bloom's wife answered and said, ''I'm sorry, he's writing a book.'' The student replied: ''That's all right. I'll wait.''
A long silence can, on occasion, help a writer. Thomas Pynchon's spectral reputation only rose in the 17 years between ''Gravity's Rainbow'' (1973) and ''Vineland'' (1990). A long silence can wound as well. William Styron's inability to complete a novel in the last 27 years of his life became entangled with the depression chronicled in his memoir, ''Darkness Visible.''
You sense this generation of writers' relative absence in other ways. It's a calamity for our literary culture that so few of them write criticism on anything close to a regular basis. Not so long ago, writing occasionally about your peers was seen as part of being in the guild. It provided a different way for a writer to walk his or her wits, in ways that often reflected back on their own work. Attending to criticism was a way of stumbling upon new and articulate voices. I recall ordering my first Diane Johnson novel after reading her coruscating review of some books about food and entertaining in The New York Review of Books.
I've picked on Franzen and Eugenides, writers I admire, more than enough in this small essay. (And I've ignored many fine writers who publish more frequently.) But let me conclude with this autumnal observation. At their current rate of production, by the next time a novel from either appears, my children, not yet in high school, will have graduated from college. Actuarial tables inform me that my dogs, their muzzles not yet close to gray, will have died and been buried in the backyard. Two presidents may have come and gone.
I won't entirely have forgotten these writers, but I will have learned to live without them. They're like old friends who are never around enough to quite miss. The sign I'll hang in my mental shop window will read: ''I'll be around when you get back. Sort of.''
Flip that sign over, and it will declare: ''If you and your peers wish to regain a prominent place in the culture, one novel a decade isn't going to cut it.''

HEADLINE: The Facts On the Fed

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
David Leonhardt is the Washington bureau chief of The New York Times.
Besides President Obama, the biggest villain in the early Republican debates has been a Republican: Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, who was first appointed by George W. Bush and previously served as a Bush adviser. 
''I'd be looking for someone new,'' said Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts.
''I would not be reappointing Ben Bernanke,'' Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota said.
''I am not a fan of the current chairman,'' added Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, who had even harsher words on the campaign trail.
Just as striking as the intra-party criticism, though, was the content of that criticism. Mr. Perry and Mr. Romney accused Mr. Bernanke of devaluing the dollar through inflation. Newt Gingrich, former House speaker, called Mr. Bernanke ''the most inflationary'' chairman ever.
This chart ranks the six Fed chairmen of the past 60 years on the two issues in its dual mandate: inflation and unemployment. Under Mr. Bernanke, inflation has been lower than under any other Fed chairman in the past 40 years -- and lower than in the five years before he took over. Unemployment has been well above average and has risen sharply.
The candidates would say that Mr. Bernanke's actions have set the stage for future inflation. Maybe so. But there is a long way to go before he sets any records.

HEADLINE: Paul Ryan

BYLINE: By KATE MURPHY

 BODY:
Kate Murphy is a journalist in Houston who writes frequently for The New York Times.
United States Representative Paul Ryan, a Republican from Wisconsin, is chairman of the House Budget Committee and a senior member of the Ways and Means Committee. His plan to end the debt crisis, titled ''The Path to Prosperity,'' proposes to cut government spending by $6.2 trillion over the next decade. We asked him what he finds interesting. 
READING I am reading the ''Read and Learn Bible'' to my 6-year-old son. I've already read it to my daughter and older son. Without the help of my children but with the help of a Kindle, I'm reading John Mauldin's ''Endgame: The End of the Debt Supercycle.''
I find myself confusing the author's name with maudlin -- which pretty much says it all.
What I look forward to reading the most is Quality Whitetails Journal. It's from the Quality Deer Management Association and gives insight on deer biology and habitat stewardship. I was planting clover this past weekend at my mom's place in a rural part of Wisconsin. Yes, deer like to eat clover.
LISTENING In this kind of job you do a lot of driving. I drive around Wisconsin every week in my truck and I always have a book or lecture on tape. Right now I have ''The Wisdom of History'' -- a series of provocative lectures by Professor J. Rufus Fears of the University of Oklahoma. When working out, I usually have my iPod up pretty loud -- Led Zeppelin, AC/DC and Rush. That's Rush the band, not the man.
WATCHING I like to start my mornings with CNBC.
FOLLOWING There are few days in which I don't spend time at RealClearMarkets.com. It's an aggregator Web site that has financial news from a lot of sources: newspapers, magazines, academic journals. On Twitter, I get daily updates from @NationalDebt.
STALKING Hunting season starts in one week and to prepare I've upgraded to two new tree stands that I just installed so my 11-year-old nephew and I can sit side by side. I'm teaching him to bow hunt this fall and we are all set with the gear.
EATING My wife and I were the top bidders on a quarter steer donated by a local farmer at a charity auction, and it's delicious meat. And my smoked venison brats are always a hit. I butcher my own deer, grind the meat, stuff it in casings and then smoke it. Not much to it.

HEADLINE: Rick Perry, Uber Texan

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS. 
Gail Collins's book on Texas will be published next year by W. W. Norton.

 BODY:
YOU think of Rick Perry, you think of Texas. And more Texas. Perry the cowboy coyote-killer, the lord of the Texas job-creation machine, the g-dropping glad-hander with a ''howdy'' for every stranger in the room. He barely exists in the national mind outside of the Texas connection.
A continuation of the TV series ''Dallas'' is due in 2012. How long will it take before we fixate on the fact that James Richard Perry is another J. R.?
Some of this is natural -- the man is the governor, after all. But we didn't obsess about the state this way when Governor Bush was the presidential candidate. (We obsessed about the Bushes.) We didn't talk endlessly about Arkansas when we were evaluating Governor Clinton. (We obsessed about the Clintons.) 
The difference is that Perry obsesses about Texas, too. On the campaign trail, he's the ambassador from the Lone Star State, promoter of the Texas Miracle, filtering almost everything through a Texas prism. On his maiden voyage through the Iowa State Fair, some hecklers were giving him a hard time, the typical hazing for a new face on the national scene, and Perry's response was instinctive.
''That may not be an Aggie over there,'' he yelled, pointing at a heckler.
Aggies are alums of Perry's alma mater, Texas A&M. Not a group you normally see a whole lot of in Des Moines.
Then he was off to talk some more about economic growth in Texas. And lambaste the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, by saying that he would be treated ''pretty ugly'' in Texas. Some aides seemed surprised to find this was not regarded as presidential language, since Perry says that kind of thing in Texas all the time.
Moving on to New Hampshire, Perry dealt with the evolution issue by saying that Texas schools teach both evolution and creationism. Which they don't, but it's the thought that counts.
Perry comes to the race with a remarkable lack of national experience and exposure. The only recent equivalent would probably be Sarah Palin, and it's not surprising that Texas and Alaska would produce the people with little frame of reference outside of their home states. Both places are huge, so it's easy for people who live there to think they're in a self-enclosed world. If Texas or Alaska had the population density of New York City, either one could contain every person on the planet, although of course a lot of them would be very uncomfortable.
We have had several Texas presidents, but none so deeply, intensely Texas as this guy would be. (Walking on the stage with the other debate candidates, Perry is so much broader of chest and squarer of shoulder and straighter of spine than the rest of the pack that he looks as if he might have been stuffed.) Dwight Eisenhower, who was born in Texas, moved out before he was 2. Lyndon Johnson had long since become a man of Washington when he entered the White House, though he worried that Northerners would make fun of his twang -- which they sort of did. George H. W. Bush was basically an Easterner who had moved to Texas for his job. His son was much more of a Texas product, but his parents sent W. off to boarding school to erase some of the evidence.
RICK PERRY has never spent any serious time outside of Texas, except for a five-year stint in the military. Nobody sent him off to boarding school to expand his horizons. He grew up in Paint Creek, where he graduated third in a high school class of 13. He went to the most deeply Texas of all the state's major institutions of higher learning. He was a terrible student, but won the prized post of yell leader, the most deeply Texas of all possible Aggie achievements. Then he joined the Air Force and flew transport planes out of Texas, Germany and the Middle East. ''There was no telling what you were going to haul around on any given day, from high-value cargo like human beings to the colonel's kitty litter,'' he once told a reporter in Texas.
Then it was back to Paint Creek, where Perry worked on his father's ranch and began a stupendously successful political career, during which he ran for the State Legislature, agriculture commissioner, lieutenant governor and governor without ever losing a race. The word his former opponents use most frequently to describe him is ''lucky.'' Really, ''lucky'' comes up all the time. It may be sour grapes, or possibly an attempt to put his career in the context of a state political landscape in which conservative Democrats were rapidly fleeing to the G.O.P. Or possibly, it's just that Perry's lucky.
His career has certainly been marked by strokes of fortune. When Perry was still a Democratic state representative, Karl Rove took him under his wing and set Perry up for a run as a Republican against the liberal icon Jim Hightower. This was in a race for agriculture commissioner, a statewide post without a vast array of issues. Perry ran against a Hightower rule requiring farmers to get their workers out of the fields before they sprayed pesticide on them, and won. When Perry moved up to run in a very tight race for lieutenant governor, his campaign got a critical last-minute infusion of $1.1 million from a very, very conservative doctor/businessman from San Antonio named James Leininger, who is one of a large number of rich Texans who seem to enjoy giving things to Rick Perry. (In Texas, individuals can donate as much as they want to political candidates. The term ''Wild West'' is frequently invoked by campaign finance reformers.) Then Governor Bush went off to the White House, turning over his job to Perry, who went on to win election in his own right three times, once with 39 percent of the vote in a race that featured several third-party candidates.
But in his last race, in 2010, Perry trounced Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, who was certainly a real opponent. Paul Burka of Texas Monthly, who followed the two of them on the campaign trail, noted that Hutchison talked about important state issues, and Perry about the evils of Washington. ''The problem for Hutchison is that the energy in the Republican Party today is not directed at how to make government work better,'' Burka wrote. ''It is directed against government, and no one channels that anger better than Rick Perry.''
IF Perry continues on his early trajectory, we will be hearing quite a lot of debate about how good a governor he's been, but Americans' lack of interest in anything connected with state government is so vast that in the end, it may turn out to be beside the point. Anyway, the real question isn't how Texas is doing but whether Perry's experience there has led him to think about the federal government at all, except as a sinister force that can be identified as the villain when anything goes wrong.
Just one example: health insurance. More than a quarter of all Texans have no health insurance whatsoever. During his first presidential debate Perry blamed that fact -- as he has in the past back home -- on Washington. (''Well, bottom line is that we would not have that many people uninsured in the state of Texas if you didn't have the federal government.'') When Bush was in Washington, Texas proposed a half-baked plan to improve its Medicaid program by reducing benefits and coverage. The application was sent back to the state for reworking -- by the Bush administration -- and the state seems to have expended precious little energy in revising it. But the legend of federal overreaching lives on, a perpetual excuse for why more than six million Texans are uninsured.
Having an interest in national government that's mainly limited to disliking it might work fine if you're the governor of a state that has always regarded itself as ''low-tax, low-service'' anyway. It's a little more problematic if you're the guy in charge of keeping the dollar stable, the food supply safe and the national defense ready.
We could live with a president who named his boots ''Freedom'' and ''Liberty.''
Not sure about one who has contempt for the job he's running for.

HEADLINE: Mistakes Were Made

 BODY:
Jonathan Chait fundamentally misunderstands the left's disapproval of President Obama. Yes, dissatisfaction with his handling of the stimulus and recession factors into it, but more important, the left finds him politically feckless and to have abandoned principles without having won political battles. His desire to create comity is admirable in theory, but compromise for its own sake is neither effective nor politically desirable. Perhaps we on the left misjudged Candidate Obama, but his campaign rhetoric was far more progressive than his presidency has been. We know he's constrained by the Republican House, though there are areas in which he could achieve change, like closing Guantanamo, protecting whistle-blowers or, most important, withdrawing forces from Afghanistan. He could use ye olde Bully Pulpit to advocate progressive ideals vocally. That's what ''the left'' wanted to see from Obama and why we are dissatisfied with him now.
BENJAMIN TAYLOR, Rockford, Ill. 
It's tough to evaluate Chait's final claim, because he doesn't cite any centrists who thought Obama should expend political capital on a bigger stimulus or any liberals who opposed it. But his core claim that ''everyone who mattered'' thought the $787 billion stimulus was ''mind-boggling large'' works only if ''everyone who mattered'' disqualifies liberals.

To sum up this article in one sentence: When you ordered a steak, you should have known we serve only tofu steak.
PAUL, 10:05 a.m., Sept. 4, nytimes.com
This is not an easy, a fun or a simple argument to make, but it's the right one. While I respect Paul Krugman, Robert Reich and Bill McKibben, to name a few, advocacy is not nearly as complex as governance. Cutting to the chase: Abandoning Obama in 2012 will lead to a Perry, Bachmann or Romney presidency. Instead of disappointment in some of Obama's E.P.A. rulings, there may be no E.P.A. And that will be just the beginning of it. I understand disappointment; I hope progressives understand catastrophe.
PETER, Mansfield, Conn., 1:44 p.m., Sept. 4, nytimes.com
The issue is not that Obama -- now supposedly focused squarely on short-term economic recovery -- might have lost some stimulus had he insisted on letting the tax cuts expire; it's that he failed to demand much more in exchange for reneging on a key campaign pledge. A public-jobs program that provides workers with a living wage and secure benefits (and that establishes benchmarks for private-sector employers) is also a form of stimulus -- and one that, unlike what Obama got, might have averted, rather than postponed, the risk of a double-dip recession. At the very least, such a demand would have made some rich people more careful about what they wish for. See, that's the thing about institutional constraints: acknowledging their existence should never mean turning them into a stalking horse for policy outcomes that run counter to your voters' interests. Republicans understand that very well. For the G.O.P., bipartisanship is a tactic, not a program.
JONATHAN STEIN, Sept. 8, coreyrobin.com
Contrary to Chait's appraisal, most liberals I know never expected perfect outcomes from clashes between President Obama and Congress; as Chait says, our political system is set up to produce unsatisfying compromises. Rather, I think liberals are mystified at Obama's insistence on compromising with himself before he even gets to the table with Republicans. Chait notes that the stimulus Obama proposed was huge (though unlike Chait, I recall many voices calling for it to be larger). He fails to note, however, that one-third of it was tax cuts that were seen by most economists as minimally stimulative at best and designed explicitly to attract Republican support. While the president's attempts at bipartisanship were laudable, why not present a stimulus package that would have gotten the job done, and let the G.O.P. add tax cuts and lower the price tag in negotiations? It's not the president's inability to accomplish everything liberals want that frustrates; it's his refusal to ask for it in the first place.
ISAAC-DAVY ARONSON, Chapel Hill, N.C.
Obama's goal is compromise and to be seen as a conciliator. Policy to him does not matter. It's all about holding his finger to the wind to get re-elected, rather than pointing the way forward and leading. The end result is that he is weak and caves to the opposition who won't play his game, and then he celebrates the results as bipartisan compromise. Example: When Democrats lost their 60-vote supermajority in the Senate with the election of Scott Brown, Obama's first reaction was to renegotiate the health care bill in the Senate. It was only Nancy Pelosi who saved the bill. On his own, Obama would have accepted defeat. Example: Before the 2011 budget negotiations, Obama unilaterally froze the pay of federal workers, without getting anything in return. Example: Obama pulls Elizabeth Warren's nomination. Example: Obama pulls Peter Diamond's nomination. The list goes on. . . .

HEADLINE: Obama Tax Plan Would Ask More of Millionaires

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama on Monday will call for a new minimum tax rate for individuals making more than $1 million a year to ensure that they pay at least the same percentage of their earnings as middle-income taxpayers, according to administration officials.
With a special joint Congressional committee starting work to reach a bipartisan budget deal by late November, the proposal adds a new and populist feature to Mr. Obama's effort to raise the political pressure on Republicans to agree to higher revenues from the wealthy in return for Democrats' support of future cuts from Medicare and Medicaid.
Mr. Obama, in a bit of political salesmanship, will call his proposal the ''Buffett Rule,'' in a reference to Warren E. Buffett, the billionaire investor who has complained repeatedly that the richest Americans generally pay a smaller share of their income in federal taxes than do middle-income workers, because investment gains are taxed at a lower rate than wages.
Mr. Obama will not specify a rate or other details, and it is unclear how much revenue his plan would raise. But his idea of a millionaires' minimum tax will be prominent in the broad plan for long-term deficit reduction that he will outline at the White House on Monday. 
Mr. Obama's proposal is certain to draw opposition from Republicans, who have staunchly opposed raising taxes on the affluent because, they say, it would discourage investment. It could also invite scrutiny from some economists who have disputed Mr. Buffett's assertion that the megarich pay a lower tax rate over all. Mr. Buffett's critics say many of the rich actually make more from wages than from investments.
In a speech on Thursday, Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, agreed with Mr. Obama that the deficit-reduction committee ''can tackle tax reform, and it should,'' to get rid of many tax breaks and allow for lower marginal rates.
''Tax increases, however, are not a viable option for the joint committee,'' Mr. Boehner said. Instead, he emphasized that meeting the deficit-reduction target should come largely from overhauling benefit programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.
The Obama proposal has little chance of becoming law unless Republican lawmakers bend. But by focusing on the wealthiest Americans, the president is sharpening the contrast between Republicans and Democrats with a theme he can carry into his bid for re-election in 2012.
It could also reassure Democrats who have feared that Mr. Obama would agree to changes in programs like Medicare without forcing Republicans to compromise on taxes.
The administration wants such a tax to replace the alternative minimum tax, which was created decades ago to make sure the richest taxpayers with plentiful deductions and credits did not avoid income taxes, but which now hits millions of Americans who are considered upper middle class. Mr. Obama has said that many average Americans could see a tax cut if the system is overhauled, since ending many tax breaks would allow for lower rates while raising more revenues from the wealthiest.
The millionaires' tax is among several changes Mr. Obama will propose in urging Congress to overhaul the federal income tax code next year, both to raise revenues for reducing deficits and to make the tax system simpler and fairer, said the administration officials, who agreed to speak in advance of the president's announcement on the condition of anonymity.
The millionaires' rate would affect only 0.3 percent of taxpayers, they said. That would be fewer than 450,000; 144 million returns were filed for 2010.
Mr. Obama's proposal comes a month after Mr. Buffett began reviving his longstanding objection that he and ''my megarich friends'' pay a significantly lower percentage of their income in federal taxes -- income and payroll taxes -- than everyone else, thanks to the tax code's favoritism toward the rich, and especially toward investors like him.
''My friends and I have been coddled long enough by a billionaire-friendly Congress,'' he wrote in an opinion article in The New York Times, a complaint he has repeated in talks and media interviews since. ''It's time for our government to get serious about shared sacrifice.''
Mr. Obama has been citing Mr. Buffett as he promotes his $447 billion job-creation plan. He proposes to offset the cost of that plan and reduce future budget deficits through higher taxes on the wealthy and on corporations after 2013, when the economy will presumably be healthier.
Mr. Obama's proposed Buffett Rule puts a new spin on that pitch, as he tries to put Republicans in Congress and in the presidential race on the defensive for their rigid stand against higher taxes.
Behind the arguments of Mr. Obama, Mr. Buffett and others about the inequity of the tax system is the difference between taxpayers' marginal tax rate, popularly known as their tax bracket, and the effective tax rate they end up paying after subtracting for deductions, credits and other breaks.
The marginal tax rate is the percentage paid on the last dollar a person earns. The current system has six marginal tax rate percentages -- 10, 15, 25, 28, 33 and 35 -- and each applies to a progressively higher amount of income. In theory, a wealthy filer pays the lower rates on income within each bracket, but the bulk of their income is taxed at the top 35 percent rate. Middle-class taxpayers generally pay marginal rates of 15 percent or 25 percent.
But investors like Mr. Buffett pay no more than 15 percent on most of their income because that rate applies to capital gains, dividends and ''carried interest,'' which is the compensation paid to hedge fund partners and investment managers like Mr. Buffett.
Another reason many wealthy Americans pay a smaller share of their income in federal taxes is that the Social Security payroll tax does not apply to income above $106,800; most people do not reach the cutoff and pay the tax on all their income.
Counting income and payroll taxes, Mr. Buffett has said he paid an effective tax rate of 17.4 percent for 2010 compared with an average 36 percent rate for many employees of his company, Berkshire Hathaway.
Under Mr. Obama's proposal, Mr. Buffett and others with taxable income of more than $1 million would pay a minimum tax rate closer to his employees' rates. But Mr. Obama will leave the details of how such a rate would be calculated -- whether to focus on the overall federal tax burden of middle-income individuals generally, or their marginal rates -- to the debate over rewriting the tax code.
Republicans and some conservative economists are certain to oppose him, however.
In 2007, when Mr. Buffett made news with his complaints about tax inequities, N. Gregory Mankiw, an economics professor at Harvard who was an adviser to President George W. Bush, disputed Mr. Buffett.
Mr. Mankiw, who now advises Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate, said that unlike Mr. Buffett and others who live on investment income taxed at 15 percent, millionaires typically pay the 35 percent marginal rate on their salaries, bonuses and business income. Even Mr. Buffett probably paid a higher effective rate than he claimed, Mr. Mankiw added, because much of his income came from corporate income that had been taxed before it was paid out to individuals.
Mr. Obama, in his plan, will call for more than $300 billion in 10-year savings from Medicare and Medicaid but not for changes in Social Security.
Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, one of six Democrats on the 12-member joint committee, said Mr. Obama must make it clear that those reductions from entitlement programs ''are tied to his proposals to raise revenues by cutting special-interest tax breaks and asking the folks at the top to pay more.''
''Otherwise,'' Mr. Van Hollen added, ''there's a risk the Republicans will cherry-pick the pieces they like and leave behind the ones they don't.''

HEADLINE: Leadership Crisis: Americans agree with Mr. Obama on a great deal. Why don't they know it?

 BODY:
As the economy faces the risk of another recession, and the 2012 campaign looms, President Obama has been groping for a response to the biggest crisis of his career. All he has to do is listen to the voters.
The Times and CBS News released a new poll on Friday, and once again we were impressed that Americans are a lot smarter than Republican leaders think, more willing to sacrifice for the national good than Democratic leaders give them credit for, and more eager to see the president get tough than Mr. Obama and his conflict-averse team realize.
So long as the politicians keep reinforcing their misconceptions -- and listening only to themselves -- the country has little chance of getting what the voters want most: jobs and a growing economy. 
Despite what the Republicans loudly proclaim, Americans do not buy into economic theories that were disproved 25 years ago. What the new poll and others show is that most do not see the deficit and ''big government'' as the main problem, and they do not buy the endless calls for slashing spending and reckless deregulation.
A solid majority said creating jobs should be the highest priority for the government now and that payroll taxes should be cut to help with that. A whopping 8 in 10 think building bridges, roads and schools is important, which means -- gasp -- spending money.
Many Democrats are so gun shy that they don't dare even to talk about raising taxes on the rich. But 71 percent of those polled said any plan to reduce the budget deficit should include both spending cuts and tax increases. And Americans understand that there are choices to be made; 56 percent said the wealthier should pay higher taxes to reduce the federal deficit.
It bears repeating that this is all entirely rational, and what the Republicans and some Democrats are proposing is absurd. The country has tried reckless deregulation and overly deep tax and spending cuts before. It brought more than one recession in the last century; caused the near collapse of the financial system and another recession in this one; and helped pile up the current deficit.
Mr. Obama has been making many of those points for months. But he has been doing it with speeches that, while eloquent, are often too long and nuanced, and then lack the kind of relentless repetition that is needed to drown out catchy but false Republican talking points.
He has wasted far too much time trying to puzzle out how he can shave policies down far enough to get the Republicans to cooperate. The answer has long been clear: He can't. Since he was elected, the Republicans have openly said they would not work with him, and a year ago, Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, said explicitly that the Republicans' goal was simply to deny Mr. Obama a second term. The new Times poll showed that Americans do not believe bipartisanship is achievable. Six in 10 Democrats want the president to challenge Republicans more. He should not worry about voters thinking he is being mean. What he should worry about is that he is not showing them that he is fighting all out for their interests.
Mr. Obama has done more for the country than many voters realize. The stimulus program so demonized by Republicans was too small, but it saved the economy from a complete collapse. Mr. Obama's maligned decision to bail out the car companies saved large numbers of jobs. The huge benefits of his health care reform, which Republicans have vowed to repeal, will become clearer to Americans in the years ahead.
That is not enough. The president has done far too little for far too long to help struggling homeowners, and he must do more to put Americans back to work. That is why it is so important and welcome that he has finally begun to take on Congress. His speech to the joint session outlining a significant jobs program was followed by the sound demand that it be paid for with tax revenue increases.
The question is whether he will now fight hard for that program. To get there, he does not need the entire G.O.P. caucus, just a few members, but he also needs to show more strength in leading his own less than courageous caucus. And, win or lose, he needs to stay out of the bargaining backroom and keep making his case to the public.
There is so much noise out there that we are not sure most voters know how much they agree with the president. It is up Mr. Obama to show them.

HEADLINE: Retrofitting The Feminine Mystique

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
BUNNY tails, bustiers and white-glove deference. It almost seems like men have gone mad on ''Mad Men,'' wresting network television backward to the boom-boom, coffee, tea or me 1960s.
Whether it's the come-hither stewardesses of ''Pan Am'' on ABC or the bunnies on the NBC drama ''The Playboy Club,'' or even the rejiggled jiggle TV of ''Charlie's Angels'' on ABC, the new fall season seems intent on reliving the days when men were men, and women were girls who didn't mind getting less pay and having their garters snapped.
It's tempting to brand all this retro programming as wish fulfillment for network executives trying to ride the success of ''Mad Men'' to suit their own tastes and universal male fantasies. But it's not of course. Most of network television nowadays is for women and about women. 
And these nostalgic series may be to female audiences what series like ''Combat!'' and ''Band of Brothers'' have been for so many men -- a chance to relive historic battles in all their glory as well as horror. Many men are fascinated by their predecessors' exploits and sacrifices at Guadalcanal or the Battle of the Bulge. And plenty of women are increasingly curious about their mothers' struggles with illegal abortion, men-only clubs and mandatory girdles -- ''Band of Bunnies.''
The power shift is most obvious in a new wave of sitcoms about young single women. On Fox ''New Girl,'' which stars Zooey Deschanel, was created by Liz Meriwether, a member of a posse of high-powered Hollywood writers known as ''the Fempire.'' The comedian Whitney Cummings not only is the star and executive producer of ''Whitney'' on NBC but also helped write and is an executive producer of ''2 Broke Girls'' on CBS.
Ms. Deschanel plays an adorable nerd who wraps three male roommates around her little finger. Ms. Cummings's series showcase heroines who are less postfeminist than pre-Amazon; they are hard-edged sophisticates who don't expect much from men besides sex, maybe, and who instead find fulfillment in the company of fellow warrior queens, which is to say urban warrior queens who battle cellulite and New York City landlords.
''Apartment 23,'' an ABC comedy that is scheduled for midseason, is even more brazen, featuring a semi-sociopath who sleeps with her roommate's boyfriend and traffics in black market A.D.D. medication. ''Anyone want to study like an Asian teenager?'' she says, holding up her stash.
Not surprisingly, perhaps, new comedies about men, like ''Man Up!'' and ''Last Man Standing'' (both on ABC) and ''How to Be a Gentleman'' (CBS), mine the humor in emasculation.
The comedies depict the battle of the sexes as a victory for women -- a pyrrhic one. The period dramas instead showcase heroines at the dawn of the women's movement.
There is horror in seeing how dismissively many men treated women back then, but also a kind of pleasure in revisiting -- with hindsight -- a noble cause played out in a simpler time. Sexism hasn't been vanquished, obviously, but it has splintered into more subtle, ambiguous channels. Back then it was overt, coarse and overdue for assault.
''Pan Am,'' set in 1963 when the airline was a symbol of progress and cosmopolitan savoir faire, has a ''Mad Men'' gloss: lush cinematography and Buddy Greco singing ''Around the World.''
One of the executive producers is Nancy Hult Ganis, a former Pan Am flight attendant, who relied on her own experiences. One of the earliest scenes shows the airline's mandatory weigh-in and a sour-faced matron slapping the fanny of one of her charges to make sure her girdle is on. She warns a sleek French stewardess not to wear dark stockings, saying, ''This is not a cabaret.'' The stewardesses suffer indignity with accepting smiles, because it's a small price to pay for freedom of the skies. (One is a runaway bride who couldn't face a life of suffocating subservience in a pre-Betty Friedan suburbia.)
The male characters are almost comically weak: the married man who cheats, the deadbeat beatnik who can't tell Marx from Hegel, the insecure co-pilot who demands to be called ''first officer.'' The women, on the other hand, are filmed in a gauzy haze of golden light as idealists who yearn for adventure and battle limitations with sisterly solidarity. In one shot four of them glide in tight blue uniforms and white gloves through a gleaming Pan Am terminal like the astronauts in ''The Right Stuff.'' As they pass, a little girl watches them through a glass window, awestruck. They are, as one pilot puts it, ''a new breed.''
The same is true of the cocktail waitresses in rabbit ears on ''The Playboy Club,'' who endure tight corsets and loose manners because the money is good and the opportunities better than back home. And particularly when compared with the desperate blond bubbleheads who wash up at the doorstep of the senescent Hugh Hefner on the reality show ''The Girls Next Door,'' these fictional bunnies come off as Simone de Beauvoir.
Bunnies supposedly cater to male fantasies, yet on this show the men are almost beside the point. ''The Playboy Club'' is a Rona Jaffe novel tucked inside a Playboy centerfold: beneath the plunging decolletage and pajama parties at the Hefner mansion lies a tale of female survival and camaraderie under fire. Male viewers may be drawn by the title of the show but it's likely that they will quickly tune out and turn to the real Playboy channel.
The pull of injustices past helps explain why NBC remade ''Prime Suspect,'' a British series that dates back to the early 1990s, starring Helen Mirren as Jane Tennison, a London homicide detective fighting discrimination in her department as well as killers on the street. Maria Bello is Detective Jane Timoney and the setting is modern-day New York.
The overt sexism is still there, and it is exhilarating to watch the heroine take on and outwit the Neanderthals in her squad -- a flashback to ''Cagney & Lacey.'' Yet all that male hostility, so openly expressed, feels anachronistic. Perhaps to make her colleagues' rancor more plausible, the new version adds an extra motive, namely that the men know Jane had an affair with her former boss, and assume she used him to gain promotion to their squad. (''The Closer'' on TNT, a series that was also modeled on ''Prime Suspect,'' did the same thing.)
''Boardwalk Empire,'' which begins its second season on HBO this month, wallows in all kinds of Prohibition-era excesses, but especially the brutality to women with the temerity to demand the vote.
These shows traffic in nostalgia for a past that was flawed but fixable, and above all familiar. Particularly when our own epoch seems so uncertain and diminished, it's all the more gratifying to look back at a more navigable time. We can envy earlier generations' confidence and optimism while gawking at their primitive social mores and constrictive clothing.
''Charlie's Angels'' wouldn't seem to fit the pattern, since it's about beautiful women who do martial arts in today's skimpy outfits, yet the series retrofits a cheesy, '70s Aaron Spelling show to modern sensibilities. These private detectives still have preposterous work clothes: picture a tall blonde hunting down sex-slave traffickers while wearing a white chiffon romper and stiletto heels.
But they are much harder and meaner than the ones played by Farrah Fawcett-Majors and the other original angels, more Delta Force than Delta Delta Delta.
In the version that was first shown in 1976, the three private detectives were police officers who were rescued from boring desk jobs by their mysterious boss, Charlie. Here the women are reformed criminals, including a former Marine who was court-martialed for a deadly combat mistake.
And it is telling that the only character to appear in a bathing suit in the pilot is Bosley. In the original he was a chubby father figure. In this incarnation he is a young, chest-baring hunk who is treated by the angels with amusement, like an endearing sex object.
Even ''Scandal,'' coming midseason on ABC, is a present-day series that feels like a period drama. It's about a glamorous, high-priced political fixer whose clients include the president. This White House looks a lot more like Bill Clinton's than that of George W. Bush or Barack Obama, however. That's probably because it's easier to focus on gender wars in a healthy economy; recessions have a way of eclipsing sexual politics and diminishing sex scandals.
It's not entirely a man's world anymore. The new fall shows take women back to a time when they were considered the weaker sex and became all the stronger for it.

HEADLINE: Egghead And Blockheads

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
THERE are two American archetypes that were sometimes played against each other in old Westerns.
The egghead Eastern lawyer who lacks the skills or stomach for a gunfight is contrasted with the tough Western rancher and ace shot who has no patience for book learnin'.
The duality of America's creation story was vividly illustrated in ''The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,'' the 1962 John Ford Western. 
Jimmy Stewart is the young attorney who comes West to Shinbone and ends up as a U.S. senator after gaining fame for killing the sadistic outlaw Liberty Valance, played by Lee Marvin. John Wayne is the rancher, a fast-draw Cyrano who hides behind a building and actually shoots Marvin because he knows Stewart is hopeless in a duel. He does it even though they're in love with the same waitress, who chooses the lawyer because he teaches her to read.
A lifetime later, on the verge of becoming a vice presidential candidate, Stewart confesses the truth to a Shinbone newspaperman, who refuses to print it. ''When the legend becomes fact,'' the editor says, ''print the legend.''
At the cusp of the 2012 race, we have a classic cultural collision between a skinny Eastern egghead lawyer who's inept in Washington gunfights and a pistol-totin', lethal-injectin', square-shouldered cowboy who has no patience for book learnin'.
Rick Perry, from the West Texas town of Paint Creek, is no John Wayne, even though he has a ton of executions notched on his belt. But he wears a pair of cowboy boots with the legend ''Liberty'' stitched on one. (As in freedom, not Valance.) He plays up the effete-versus-mesquite stereotypes in his second-grade textbook of a manifesto, ''Fed Up!''
Trashing Massachusetts, he writes: ''They passed state-run health care, they have sanctioned gay marriage, and they elected Ted Kennedy, John Kerry, and Barney Frank repeatedly -- even after actually knowing about them and what they believe! Texans, on the other hand, elect folks like me. You know the type, the kind of guy who goes jogging in the morning, packing a Ruger .380 with laser sights and loaded with hollow-point bullets, and shoots a coyote that is threatening his daughter's dog.''
At a recent campaign event in South Carolina, Perry grinned, ''I'm actually for gun control -- use both hands.''
Traveling to Lynchburg, Va., to speak to students at Liberty University (as in Falwell, not Valance), Perry made light of his bad grades at Texas A&M.
Studying to be a veterinarian, he stumbled on chemistry and made a D one semester and an F in another. ''Four semesters of organic chemistry made a pilot out of me,'' said Perry, who went on to join the Air Force.
''His other D's,'' Richard Oppel wrote in The Times, ''included courses in the principles of economics, Shakespeare, 'Feeds & Feeding,' veterinary anatomy and what appears to be a course called 'Meats.' ''
He even got a C in gym.
Perry conceded that he ''struggled'' with college, and told the 13,000 young people in Lynchburg that in high school, he had graduated ''in the top 10 of my graduating class -- of 13.''
It's enough to make you long for W.'s Gentleman's C's. At least he was a mediocre student at Yale. Even Newt Gingrich's pseudo-intellectualism is a relief at this point.
Our education system is going to hell. Average SAT scores are falling, and America is slipping down the list of nations for college completion. And Rick Perry stands up with a smirk to talk to students about how you can get C's, D's and F's and still run for president.
The Texas governor did help his former chief of staff who went to lobby for a pharmaceutical company that donated to Perry, so he at least knows the arithmetic of back scratching.
Perry told the students, ''God uses broken people to reach a broken world.'' What does that even mean?
The Republicans are now the ''How great is it to be stupid?'' party. In perpetrating the idea that there's no intellectual requirement for the office of the presidency, the right wing of the party offers a Farrelly Brothers ''Dumb and Dumber'' primary in which evolution is avant-garde.
Having grown up with a crush on William F. Buckley Jr. for his sesquipedalian facility, it's hard for me to watch the right wing of the G.O.P. revel in anti-intellectualism and anti-science cant.
Sarah Palin, who got outraged at a ''gotcha'' question about what newspapers and magazines she read, is the mother of stupid conservatism. Another ''Don't Know Much About History'' Tea Party heroine, Michele Bachmann, seems rather proud of not knowing anything, simply repeating nutty, inflammatory medical claims that somebody in the crowd tells her.
So we're choosing between the overintellectualized professor and blockheads boasting about their vacuity?
The occupational hazard of democracy is know-nothing voters. It shouldn't be know-nothing candidates.

PERSON: Charles H. Percy 

HEADLINE: Charles H. Percy, Illinois Senator Who Clashed With Nixon, Is Dead at 91

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER

 BODY:
Charles H. Percy, a former United States senator from Illinois and a moderate Republican who clashed with President Richard M. Nixon over Watergate and whose own presidential ambitions were stymied by Nixon's resignation, died Saturday in Washington. He was 91.
His death was announced by the office of his son-in-law, Senator John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia. Mr. Percy had been treated for Alzheimer's disease for many years.
A three-term senator, Mr. Percy went to Washington in 1967 after a strikingly successful career as a businessman. In 1949, at the age of 29, he was named president of Bell & Howell and then oversaw its rapid growth.
He also arrived in the capital grief-stricken: one of his daughters had been murdered during his 1966 campaign. 
Mr. Percy was talked about as presidential material almost from the time he entered politics in 1964, when he ran for governor of Illinois; he narrowly lost to Otto Kerner Jr. The notion gained even wider currency in 1966, when, in an upset, he gained a Senate seat by defeating Paul H. Douglas, a respected three-term Democratic incumbent.
For many Republicans, Mr. Percy's business background, Midwestern roots and moderate views in the increasingly liberal political climate of the 1960s made him an attractive alternative to the hard-right conservatism that voters had rejected in 1964 in the landslide defeat of Senator Barry Goldwater.
His good looks and elegant manner enhanced his appeal; Republicans retained fresh memories of their narrow presidential loss to the handsome John F. Kennedy in 1960.
In 1967, only three months into his first Senate term, Chuck Percy, as he was familiarly known, drew attention when he proposed legislation to create a private foundation to finance low-cost housing and foster home ownership among low-income families. Though the measure did not pass, it drew strong support from Republicans in both the House and the Senate.
The New York Times columnist James B. Reston called him ''the hottest political article in the Republican Party.''
By the end of the year, he was considered a possible contender for the 1968 Republican presidential nomination; a Louis Harris poll in late 1967 put him ahead of President Lyndon B. Johnson in a head-to-head contest. But he declined to run and instead endorsed Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York, another moderate.
Mr. Percy became closely identified with the more liberal wing of the party known as Rockefeller Republicans, so much so that his name became attached to them as well -- ''decent Chuck Percy Republicans,'' as the writer Richard Ford described them in ''The Lay of the Land,'' his novel of suburban New Jersey.
Mr. Percy's national stature was underlined when the endorsement of Rockefeller was treated as front-page news nationwide. The Times, making the announcement its lead article on July 26, 1968, described it as ''counterbalancing'' former President Dwight D. Eisenhower's endorsement of Nixon.
Mr. Percy briefly considered a bid for the White House only once. In June 1973, he formed an exploratory committee to look into a 1976 candidacy. But he closed it down after Nixon resigned in August 1974 and Vice President Gerald R. Ford became president. Within a week, Mr. Percy said Ford had gotten off to an excellent start and was likely to be nominated in 1976, as he was.
Mr. Percy's clash with Nixon came in the spring of 1973 as the president was trying to contain the Watergate scandal, set in motion by the break-in at the offices of the Democratic opposition by a White House team of burglars and aggravated by the administration's efforts to cover up the crime.
On May 1, the day after Nixon announced a staff shakeup and authorized a new attorney general to ''make all decisions'' relating to Watergate prosecutions, Mr. Percy proposed a Senate resolution demanding an independent prosecutor ''of the highest character and integrity from outside the executive branch.''
Mr. Percy told the Senate: ''A simple and very basic question is at issue: Should the executive branch investigate itself? I do not think so.''
His resolution was adopted without objection. Soon afterward, Nixon fumed to his cabinet that he would do all he could to make sure that Mr. Percy, who had already voted against two Nixon nominees for the Supreme Court, would never become president.
In 1977, after the election of President Jimmy Carter, Mr. Percy accused the White House budget director, Bert Lance, of backdating checks to gain tax deductions. Mr. Percy was the senior Republican on the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, and he and Senator Abraham A. Ribicoff, Democrat of Connecticut, the chairman, demanded that Mr. Lance resign or be fired because of that and accusations of banking crimes.
Mr. Lance resigned but was acquitted of all charges arising from the Senate inquiry. Mr. Percy later apologized for the backdating accusation.
Mr. Percy was proud of his recommendations for judicial appointments, especially that of John Paul Stevens, a former college classmate. Mr. Percy had persuaded him to take a seat on a federal appeals court in 1970 and then backed his nomination when Ford named him to the Supreme Court in 1975. Mr. Percy consulted bar associations and lawyer friends about appointments and said he never chose a political supporter for the bench.
Over his 18 years in the Senate, Mr. Percy averaged a 52 percent rating from the liberal Americans for Democratic Action and only 30 percent from the American Conservative Union. With the party having moved steadily to the right since then, it was a rating few if any Republicans would receive today.
''Percy's passing reminds us that today's Republican Party is not your mother's Republican Party,'' said Thomas C. Mann, a Congressional scholar at the Brookings Institution in Washington, adding that Mr. Percy had worked ''comfortably'' with Democrats.
''Perhaps the most significant change in American politics,'' Mr. Mann said, ''which has picked up with the most intensity in recent years, is the disappearance of moderate, pragmatic Republicans like Percy.''
Charles Harting Percy was born in Pensacola, Fla., on Sept. 27, 1919, the son of Edward Percy and the former Elizabeth Harting. He grew up in Chicago, where his father was a bank clerk. When the bank failed in the Depression and his father lost his job, the family went on relief, and Mr. Percy took several jobs as a child.
He graduated from the well-regarded New Trier High School in Winnetka, Ill., then received a scholarship to attend the University of Chicago. There he ran a cooperative that purchased services for fraternities and sent money home to help his family. He was also the captain of the water polo team.
Mr. Percy was still a student when he began his association with Bell & Howell, taking summer jobs. The company hired him full time after he graduated in 1941. When war came later that year, he set up schools to teach military personnel how to use Bell & Howell movie cameras. He joined the Navy in 1943, training aviation personnel.
Rising quickly through the company's ranks, he was named president on Jan. 12, 1949, an appointment that drew wide attention not least because of his age. But the company, based near Chicago in Skokie, Ill., prospered under him as it extended its reach in the consumer electronics market and went beyond making home-movie cameras, producing components for space photography as well. Annual sales were $13 million when he took over; when he left in 1963, they were more than $160 million.
Mr. Percy married Jeanne Valerie Dickerson in 1943. She died in 1947, and in 1950 he married Loraine Diane Guyer, who survives him. He is also survived by two children from his first marriage, Sharon Percy Rockefeller of Washington and Charleston, W.Va. (she is married to Senator Rockefeller), and Roger D. Percy of Seattle; two children from his second marriage, Gail Percy of Washington and Mark Percy of Newport Beach, Calif.; nine grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.
Another daughter, Sharon's twin sister, Valerie, was bludgeoned to death in the family home in Kenilworth, Ill., during Mr. Percy's 1966 campaign. She was 21. The police kept the case alive for more than 20 years but never identified a suspect. They did rule out burglary, however, since nothing was stolen, and said the intensity of the attack suggested that the killing had been committed by someone who knew Ms. Percy. Mr. Percy suspended his campaign for a couple of weeks but returned and won a solid victory over Mr. Douglas.
But just as Illinois voters had tired of Mr. Douglas by 1966, Mr. Percy was old goods by 1984. In a strong Republican year, with President Ronald Reagan campaigning for him, Mr. Percy could not overcome his Democratic opponent, Representative Paul M. Simon.
His position as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee seemed remote to Illinois voters, as did his manner. The Chicago Tribune, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal all described him as ''pompous.''
Mr. Percy never persuaded conservatives to trust him, and some actually supported Mr. Simon in the hope that Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, would succeed him in the chairmanship. The Illinois economy was weak, and Mr. Simon won a narrow victory with 50.1 percent of the vote.
After his defeat, Mr. Percy lived in Washington and led a consulting firm that sought to help United States companies export their products.
A Christian Scientist, he read the Christian Science Bible Lessons every day into his 90s.

HEADLINE: How Privatized Social Security Works in Galveston

BYLINE: By BECCA AARONSON. 
baaronson@texastribune.org

 BODY:
GALVESTON -- Gov. Rick Perry has repeatedly called Social Security a ''Ponzi scheme'' and said that people ought to control their own retirement money. But if the social safety net program created in 1935 were eliminated -- something President Eisenhower once said would be a politically stupid move -- what might take its place?
Mr. Perry does not have to look far to see how a privatized Social Security plan might work. Government employees in Galveston, Brazoria and Matagorda Counties have controlled their private retirement plan for 30 years. They opted out of Social Security before Congress changed the law in 1983 to prevent others from withdrawing.
Though the private program has its critics -- and some say it does not provide all of the important benefits many destitute Americans claim through Social Security -- many in these counties consider their system superior. 
''It shouldn't be a pay-as-you-go system, where children and grandchildren are paying for your Social Security,'' said Ray Holbrook, a former Galveston County judge who led the charge to opt out of Social Security during his 28-year tenure. ''That's why it's bankrupt, and that's why Rick Perry says it's a Ponzi scheme, which I agree with.''
Mr. Perry lauded the Texas counties' plans when he was promoting his book ''Fed Up!'' in 2010, and Herman Cain, also a Republican presidential candidate, mentioned the Texas example in the CNN/Tea Party Express debate last week in Tampa, Fla. ''Governor Perry believes we need to look at all options as we discuss how to fix the current system, which as it stands is financially unsustainable,'' said Katherine Cesinger, a campaign spokeswoman.
Almost everyone agrees Social Security will need to be changed in some way to remain solvent. Under the current structure, the Social Security Administration projects that by 2036 the program will be able to meet only 77 percent of scheduled benefits.
In 1981, when Galveston County employees pulled out of the Social Security system, the program was projected to be insolvent by 2010, said Rick Gornto, the designer of the Alternate Plan and president of First Financial Benefits, the company that manages the retirement accounts. ''People in Texas are very independent minded, and they stepped out and challenged the system,'' he said.
In the Alternate Plan, retirement benefits are a direct result of employee contributions. In each paycheck, employees contribute 13.9 percent of the their gross pay (6.1 percent from the employee, 7.8 percent from the county) to a private account.
First Financial Benefits invests the accounts conservatively, Mr. Gornto said. The company guarantees a minimum rate of return of 3.75 percent to 4 percent on the accounts to safeguard employees' benefits against inflation and severe drops in market rates.
Employees can elect to put their portion of the contributions into riskier investments, like mutual funds and stocks, potentially to generate more interest.
At retirement, employees in the Alternate Plan can choose to take the money in a lump sum, take monthly benefits for a given time period or take a lifetime annuity, with slightly reduced benefits. Social Security is subject to whatever rules the federal government makes, Mr. Gornto said, and there is ''not a guaranteed promise to pay any certain amount.''
Critics of the Alternate Plan say it is more like a savings program than a social insurance program for all Americans, which Social Security was created to be -- particularly for low-wage retirees, widowed spouses and children with deceased parents.
''People forget that before Social Security, there really were poorhouses,'' said Eric Kingson, co-director of the coalition Social Security Works.
The General Accounting Office and the Social Security Administration conducted the most current comparative studies of the Alternate Plan and Social Security in 1999. The G.A.O. report noted ''fundamental differences in the purpose and structure of the two approaches.''
Both the G.A.O. and Social Security studies concluded that lower-wage workers, particularly those with many dependents, would fare better under Social Security, while middle- and higher-wage workers were likely to fare better, at least initially, under the Alternate Plan.
Americans should not fear radical cuts to Social Security, Mr. Kingson said, because the program is politically protected. Americans ''contribute to this system; they value it very much,'' Mr. Kingson said, and they expect a return at retirement. ''Any changes that are made have to be made by politicians with that in mind.''
Changing certain rules, like scrapping the cap on Social Security taxation or eliminating Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthy, would help solve the revenue shortfall, he said.
''Less and less money has been subject to Social Security taxation,'' Mr. Kingson said, because most wage growth has been for high-income employees, who are not taxed for Social Security on earnings above $106,800 a year.
But proponents of the Alternate Plan say individual ownership of retirement benefits offers employees more security.
''You have some kind of control of your money, because ultimately it's your money,'' said Dwight Sullivan, the Galveston County Clerk.
Although both programs offer disability insurance, life insurance and retirement benefits, experts agree the methods and benefits provided by the programs are difficult to compare.
In a hypothetical calculation, Mr. Gornto said, an employee who earned $25,000 annually for 40 years could retire with a 20-year payout of $2,297 a month under the Alternate Plan. Under the same circumstances, an employee making $125,000 annually could retire with a payout of $11,490 a month.
Social Security benefits change depending on the yearly adjustment for inflation, the year of retirement, and the age of the worker. But at a maximum, a worker who retires in 2011 at age 66 could receive $2,366 a month in Social Security benefits.
If Congress voted to privatize Social Security, Mr. Gornto and Mr. Holbrook said they would recommend using a banking model similar to the Alternate Plan, but with one important caveat: They would suggest removing the option to withdraw funds in a lump sum. ''Most people can't handle a sizable lump sum when they retire, and they end up spending it on a new house and new cars and everything else,'' Mr. Holbrook said.
The lump-sum option is one of the biggest problems in the Alternate Plan, Mr. Kingson said, because ''people end up unprotected.'' If retirees do not choose the lifetime annuity, they could outlive their benefits and end up wards of the state.
Even Mr. Holbrook has outlived his Alternate Plan benefits. When he retired 15 years ago, he decided to receive $1,500 to $2,000 from his Alternate Plan account every month for 10 years. Now, his Alternate Plan account is empty.
Fortunately, Mr. Holbrook has other savings and, ultimately, $1,300 a month in Social Security benefits from his 27 years of contributions before his county dropped out of the program.
''It was a mistake to only take it for 10 years,'' he said. ''It should be over a lifetime, like Social Security.''

 BODY:
A JOURNEY: My Political Life, by Tony Blair (Vintage, $19.) In this engrossing memoir the former British prime minister traces his political ambitions and principles, and assesses his role in shaping recent historical events: the remaking of the Labour Party, the power-sharing agreement in Northern Ireland and the divisive decision to go to war in Iraq.
SALVATION CITY, by Sigrid Nunez (Riverhead, $16.) Nunez invokes a flu pandemic that leaves the United States on the verge of anarchy in this novel of social decline and religious fervor. We see the disaster through the eyes of an orphaned teenage boy named Cole, who is taken into the home of a Rapture-reveling pastor. 
HOW TO BECOME A SCANDAL: Adventures in Bad Behavior, by Laura Kipnis (Picador, $15.) Kipnis, a professor at Northwestern University and the author of ''Against Love: A Polemic'' (2003), outlines the relationship between those who act out their tangled psychodramas on the national stage and a judgmental society that enjoys watching them. In this empathetic treatment, Eliot Spitzer, Linda Tripp, James Frey and others serve as evidence for the ultimate unknowability of the self.
THE HUNDRED-FOOT JOURNEY, by Richard C. Morais (Scribner, $15.) In Morais's first novel, a story reminiscent of ''Slumdog Millionaire'' and seeded with delightful arcana, a Muslim boy born on the edge of a Bombay slum is catapulted to Paris's temples of haute cuisine.
ALL THE DEVILS ARE HERE: The Hidden History of the Financial Crisis, by Bethany McLean and Joe Nocera (Portfolio/Penguin, $17.) McLean, a co-author of ''The Smartest Guys in the Room: The Amazing Rise and Scandalous Fall of Enron'' (2003), and Nocera, a columnist for The New York Times, offer more than just a backward look. They bring into focus the debate over Federal Reserve monetary policy and explore the motivations of politicians, investment bankers, financial speculators and borrowers in the 2008 crisis.
C, by Tom McCarthy (Vintage, $15.) McCarthy's tour de force novel, a finalist for the Man Booker Prize, encompasses the short life of Serge Carrefax, born at the turn of the 20th century on a rural English estate. From a German spa to the killing fields of France to interwar London and beyond, Serge is driven not by love or friendship but by a fascination with communications technology: the search for an original, unifying signal. Our reviewer, Jennifer Egan, said ''C'' fuses ''a Pynchonesque revelry in signs and codes with the lush psychedelics of William Burroughs to create an intellectually provocative novel.''
PORTRAIT OF AN ADDICT AS A YOUNG MAN: A Memoir, by Bill Clegg (Back Bay/Little, Brown, $14.99.) Clegg, who rose quickly as a young literary agent in New York, describes his disastrous surrender to crack, and drug-induced paranoia, in blunt, brutal strokes.
I THINK I LOVE YOU, by Allison Pearson (Anchor, $14.95.) In her first novel, ''I Don't Know How She Does It'' (2002), Pearson imagined the milieu of a stressed-out working mom in hedge-fund-crazy London. Here she channels Petra, an insecure 13-year-old girl in South Wales in the 1970s with a crush on the pop star David Cassidy.

HEADLINE: Asking Why Employees Of Solar Firm Lost Jobs

BYLINE: By AARON GLANTZ. 
aglantz@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
The Department of Labor has become the latest federal agency to open an inquiry into the bankruptcy of Solyndra, the solar panel manufacturer in Fremont that President Obama once hailed as ''a testament to American ingenuity and dynamism.''
But unlike the inspectors general of the Energy and Treasury Departments and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who are looking into possible wrongdoing in connection with the company's $527 million federal loan, the Labor Department is examining a more prosaic economic question: Did Solyndra's workers lose their jobs because of competition from China? 
At stake is up to $14 million in unemployment, job training and relocation benefits for the 1,100 workers who lost their jobs after the company abruptly shut down on Aug. 31.
The inquiry was set in motion in response to a petition filed by Alameda County under the little-known Trade Adjustment Assistance Program, which provides for additional benefits to American workers when their jobs are lost to foreign trade. In the petition, Patti Castro, the interim director of Alameda County's Workforce Investment Board, said that ''Solyndra and other U.S. solar industry manufacturers have been affected by a worldwide plunge in solar cell prices, based in part on huge subsidies Chinese solar manufacturers receive from their government.''
According to the Department of Energy, solar panel prices have dropped 42 percent since January, largely because of $30 billion in Chinese government subsidies to its solar sector. The United States share of the worldwide solar-panel market has fallen from a peak of 43 percent in 1995 to just 7 percent last year.
Investigations into whether jobs are lost to foreign trade include an examination of company financial documents as well as market research and typically take about two months, Labor Department officials said.
Solyndra is the third solar manufacturer in the United States to go bankrupt this year, and Trade Adjustment Assistance petitions have already been filed on behalf of workers at the other two companies, Evergreen Solar of Massachusetts and SpectraWatt of New York. The Labor Department denied SpectraWatt's petition but granted Evergreen's, although both companies made the same type of photovoltaic panel.
Joshua Lamont, a Labor Department spokesman, said the two situations were different. SpectraWatt's workers lost their jobs because of a decline in export sales, he said, while Evergreen Solar ''acquired from a foreign country articles like or directly competitive with articles produced by the workers.''
Inside the solar industry, many are not convinced that Solyndra faltered because of overseas competition. The company used a novel technology that did not require silicon and took a big competitive hit when the price of silicon tumbled.
A number of Bay Area-based solar manufacturing companies, including San Jose's NanoSolar and Solaria in Fremont, are actively recruiting former Solyndra employees to work in their factories. Daniel Shugar, the chief executive of Solaria, said the importance of low-cost Chinese labor in making United States-built panels less competitive had been greatly exaggerated.
''Labor cost is not a huge part of the cost of making solar panels, because these things are automated to a large degree,'' Mr. Shugar said in an interview. Solaria has opened a factory in Fremont for United States orders and another in India for Asian deliveries.
Even some former Solyndra employees were skeptical that competition from China caused their company's downfall. Danny Nguyen, who worked as a mechanic at Solyndra for five years, said he was waiting for the outcome of the F.B.I. investigation ''to find the real cause'' of his employer's collapse.
Still, the pressures of foreign competition are evident on rooftops across the Bay Area. On Wednesday, Lisa Jackson, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, took a tour of the headquarters of Project Open Hand, a San Francisco charity, where a local solar company, Luminalt, installed 52 panels made by the Chinese company Suntech.
Luminalt has also installed solar hot water panels on the charity building's roof. Those panels were produced by BP Solar, which according to Pete Resler, a spokesman, ''ceased all manufacturing in the United States last spring, primarily because of cost.''
After posing for photos in front of the Chinese panels, Ms. Jackson said that employing local residents to install solar panels had environmental and economic benefits, regardless of where the panels were made.
''What we need is more of what we see here,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Back in the Ol' Hippie Hothouse

BYLINE: By BILL DONAHUE

 BODY:
The long corridors of Antioch Hall are dark. The fluorescent lights, perhaps 50 years old and never updated, do not work. The vinyl floor tiles are loose. There are cobwebs and puddles on the floor, and the whole place smells of mold. You have to squint, almost, to picture this four-story brick building as the birthplace of one of the most vaunted experiments in American higher education.
Antioch College held its first classes here in 1853. There were women among the school's early students, as called for in the charter of the Christian Connexion, the church group that founded Antioch amid the cornfields and forests of Yellow Springs, Ohio. Blacks soon matriculated as well. And the college's first president, Horace Mann, the Massachusetts-born education reformer, instilled a spirit of moral resolve that has lingered ever since. At the 1859 commencement, just weeks before he died, Mann exhorted that year's Antioch graduates: ''I beseech you to treasure up in your hearts these my parting words. Be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity.'' 
In the decades that followed, Antioch flourished as a cradle of social activism and freethinking. It was the most liberal of liberal arts colleges. It never had fraternities, and its long-defunct football team had only one winning season in 40-plus years of existence. In the 1960s, it supplied the civil rights movement with a steady stream of volunteers who traveled South to register black voters. Coretta Scott King went to Antioch, as did the paleontologist and writer Stephen Jay Gould.
Yet Antioch College has been on shaky financial ground for its entire existence. Four times -- in 1863, 1881, 1919 and 2008 -- it has had to close. Next month, it will reopen again. The college has been sending recruiters to college fairs nationwide for a year now, eventually hoping to draw brainy iconoclasts willing to pay $35,000 in annual tuition and room and board. The plan is to have 110 students next year and 1,200 students in a decade or so. But when Antioch kicks off the school year on Oct. 4, it will do so as a sort of nanoschool, having chosen to commence with just 35 freshmen from a pool of 145 applicants. This starter batch of students will enjoy four-year full scholarships, paid for with the interest earned from Antioch's $25 million endowment. They'll begin, according to Antioch's promotional literature, ''with the premise that the way we live now is not sustainable.'' They will be enrolled in a series of ''global seminars'' -- on energy, food, water and health -- as well as more standard liberal arts courses like Drawing I and Existentialism. Following Antioch tradition, they will be expected to spend nine quarters on campus and six off campus engaged in ''co-op'' jobs (on organic farms or in chemistry labs, for instance) meant to reinforce their classroom work. There may be a lapidary society or perhaps a judo club. No one knows yet. Decisions on college life always used to be made by a community government heavily populated by students.
But on a sweltering afternoon in July, the students were still many weeks away from showing up, and only support staff and Antioch's new teachers were present. For this year, there will be just six faculty members, each of them 40 or younger. They sat that day in a classroom, in a small circle of chairs, for a meeting with a few retired Antioch professors, who sought to pass on the college's DNA to their successors. ''When I was a student here,'' Victor Ayoub, who is 88 and taught anthropology, said, ''we had quite staunch Republicans. We had communists, and it never affected their standing in the community.'' Another retired professor added, ''We have to think about Antioch and its exceptionalism.'' A third said: ''And love is important. We cannot forget love.''
The dialogue was exceedingly meta and free-ranging and permeated by the sort of hope that can come only at the beginning of things -- before, say, the first bruising faculty fight. The spirit of reverence was so thick that when the meeting, scheduled for two hours, stretched 40 minutes past that, no one complained. Toward the end, Karen Shirley, who taught art at Antioch for 30 years, leaned toward the new hires and spoke in low tones. ''We have been waiting for you for so long,'' she said. ''You are the future of what is the most important thing in my life.''
Antioch College is almost certainly the first American liberal arts school to start up in the 21st century, and it's a rebirth that comes at an unsettled moment in higher education. Increasingly, critics are asking whether going to college is worthwhile. In their new book, ''Academically Adrift: Limited Learning on College Campuses,'' Richard Arum, of New York University, and Josipa Roksa, of the University of Virginia, argue that many of today's students learn almost nothing. Arum and Roksa updated their work with subsequent studies to weigh the effectiveness of 29 schools by reviewing data from the Collegiate Learning Assessment. The students in their sample took the C.L.A. at the beginning and at the end of their four-year college careers, and 36 percent of them showed no significant improvements. ''Gains in critical thinking, complex reasoning and written communication,'' Arum and Roksa write, ''are either exceedingly small or empirically nonexistent.'' Arum and Roksa attribute this to the fact that college students devote only 16 percent of their time to academics, while 75 percent of their time is spent doing things like sleeping and socializing.
Another set of critics speaks of a ''bubble'' in higher education. Just as people in recent decades poured money into stocks and real estate while assuming that the value of their investments would never fall, the country has been devoting more and more resources to an industry that has, over the past quarter-century, delivered little more than empty promises while the cost of tuition rose 440 percent. One of the biggest proponents of the bubble idea is Peter Thiel, a founder of PayPal, who recently told The National Review that no one is ''measuring the return'' that higher education yields. ''It is, in fact, considered in some ways inappropriate to even ask the question of what the return is,'' Thiel was quoted as saying. ''We are given bromides to the effect of, 'Well, you know college education is good, but it's good precisely because it doesn't teach you anything specific; you become a more well-rounded person, a better citizen; you learn how to learn.' ''
But even as more Americans are entering college than ever before, the percentage of those seeking liberal arts degrees is dwindling. In his new book, ''Liberal Arts at the Brink,'' Victor E. Ferrall Jr., emeritus president of Beloit College in Wisconsin, says that in 1900 ''as many as 70 percent'' of all undergrads were studying the liberal arts. College was an enclave for well-heeled gentlemen, for whom being culturally refined was de rigueur. After World War II, when great numbers of students were able to attend college on the G.I. bill and the academy became democratized, a new practicality took root, and higher education became increasingly vocational.
Today's youngsters start going to career fairs in eighth grade, Ferrall argues, and they are inclined toward very specific academic programs -- casino management, say, or video-game design. A 2010 report by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce ratifies their decisions, saying that higher education needs to focus on occupational training, lest the failure to do so ''damage the nation's economic future.'' The Obama administration is, of course, focused on minting workers for the health and green-energy industries, rather than Latin and Greek scholars.
By Ferrall's estimate, in 2009 there were 225 colleges where ''the majority of students major in the liberals arts and live on campus,'' and their collective population, about 350,000, represented roughly 2 percent of all those enrolled in higher education.
Liberal arts colleges aren't closing in droves these days; the sector has already been through a contraction -- 167 private four-year colleges closed between 1967 and 1990. But liberal arts schools are financially squeezed in an age when prospective students are often seeking deluxe athletic centers and duplex apartments. Many schools, like Bates College, where the comprehensive fee is $55,300, actually incur per-student costs as high as $80,000 and cover the shortfall using interest from their endowments. ''The annual challenge,'' Ferrall writes, ''has become not how to choose which applicants to admit but how to attract enough students to fill their dormitories and provide sufficient tuition income to continue operating at current levels.''
Ferrall predicted to me that Antioch, as a residential liberal arts school, will struggle. ''I'd guess that alumni gifts will keep it going for three or four years,'' he said. ''Then it will either morph into a different kind of school, or close.''
In 1964, in the ethos of the time, Antioch College undertook to bring education to the streets by opening its first expansion campus in Putney, Vt. Soon there were more than 30 campuses. One was in an inflatable vinyl bubble in Maryland; another was in a former perfume factory in Los Angeles. But if the expansion was haphazard at first, the Antioch empire streamlined itself over the years. By the mid-'90s only four campuses of what was now called Antioch University remained. Professors were untenured. Students were older, generally, and they lived off campus, pursuing graduate degrees that were quite vocational -- in counseling, for instance, or sustainable business.
The university became, in short, more in tune with modern exigencies than the college was, and starting in the mid-'80s, it kept the enterprise afloat, allocating around $1.5 million to the college each year. Increasingly, the college became a bit player in the larger Antioch constellation, and as many supporters of the college see it, the muscular university soon began to kick the struggling college around.
''To the university,'' says Scott Sanders, an archivist at Antioch College, ''we were the aging family member who needed to be put in an old folks' home. They didn't want to take care of us. Pipes burst on campus. Roofs didn't get repaired. Downspouts went forever without being cleaned out, and we saw constant budget cuts.''
As the college eroded, alumni contributions plummeted. ''Alumni lost confidence in the university board and its stewardship of the college,'' says Steven Lawry, the president of Antioch College in 2006 and 2007.
Meanwhile, the college's students, who had always leaned to the left, were becoming more radicalized. In 1973, after the school's president announced plans to halt an affirmative-action program, 230 students went on strike one April morning, chaining the doors of administration buildings and later scuffling with police. The protesters refused to go to classes and ended up shutting Antioch down for more than six weeks. Someone set a fire in a dean's office; telephones and typewriters were smashed. One professor was maced. The New York Times published more than a dozen stories about the strike. The following autumn, 200 freshmen who were enrolled did not come to campus. By 1979, the student population was less than 1,000.
In 1991, a group called Womyn of Antioch persuaded the school's trustees to approve a groundbreaking sexual-offense policy. Suitors were required to get verbal consent ''with each new level of physical and/or sexual contact/conduct'' -- in other words, to ask: ''Can I touch your knee? And now can I . . . touch your buttocks?'' ''Saturday Night Live'' parodied Antioch in a skit entitled ''Is It Date Rape?'' The national press corps flocked to the campus. When a photographer from Newsweek prepared to take a picture of Gerry Bello, Antioch '97, he told me: ''I ripped off all my clothes and said, 'Sure, you can take pictures of me, but you're not going to be able to run them!' ''
By 2007, Antioch was in the third of four tiers of the 215 schools that U.S. News & World Report ranked in its ''Best Liberal Arts Colleges'' issue. There were fewer than 300 students. The university's trustees voted to pull the plug, shutting down the college and voiding the tenure of its faculty members.
Few things galvanize a fan base like failure. At a weekend-long reunion in June 2007, Antioch alumni pledged $7 million to establish a new Antioch College Revival Fund.
Bello was so moved that he left Texas, where he was doing construction work, and resettled in Yellow Springs. A handful of other alums likewise decamped to the village, by then a crunchy haven of coffeehouses and organic groceries, and in the summer of 2008 they joined six or so Antioch professors in founding a sort of Antioch College in exile called the Nonstop Liberal Arts Institute. Headquartered in a drafty, concrete-floored Yellow Springs warehouse, Nonstop offered courses that included ''Local Sustainable Agriculture,'' ''Introduction to Poststructural Thought'' and ''Queer Animals,'' a look at wildlife through the lens of queer theory. For the 2008-9 school year, the Revival Fund supplied Nonstop with almost a million dollars in operating expenses. Professors received competitive salaries, and tuition was just $1,500 per year.
But the Revival Fund financed Nonstop for just one year. In 2008, a new entity, the Antioch College Continuation Corporation, made up of former university trustees, major donors and alumni leaders, emerged to take control of the purse strings and stopped backing the operation. Its chairman, Lee Morgan, Antioch '69, is a retired printing magnate who drives a built-to-order British convertible, a Morgan Plus 8, and is the main force behind the Morgan Family Foundation, which has given $2.75 million to the new Antioch. Morgan was not impressed with the direction Nonstop had taken. When he and I dined at TJ Chumps, a sports bar just outside Yellow Springs, he called the college-in-exile a ''monoculture'' and dismissed its most zealous operatives as ''cromagnons.''
Morgan was an activist in his Antioch days -- he was instrumental in a student-led sit-in against a Yellow Springs barber who excluded blacks. In the '70s, he was an advocate for employee ownership, and he granted his employees at Antioch Publishing shares in the company. In 2008 and 2009, he helped Antioch College extricate itself from the university. The sales negotiations were complicated (they lasted 14 months) but friendly. The university didn't really want a derelict campus -- a science building with outdated bunsen burners lying around, for instance -- or a $20 million endowment fund earmarked solely for the college's use. So in the end the university sold 25 buildings, along with a 1,000-acre wooded glen and unfettered use of the endowment, to the Continuation Corporation for just $6.2 million. After the 750-page closing documents were signed, a ceremony was held on the lawn of Antioch College. Morgan was handed the keys to the college. There were 30 or so of them on a ring, and he hoisted them over his head and roared with delight.
Not everyone is thrilled by the new Antioch. Arthur Dole, a 1946 grad who went on to teach professional psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, is currently withholding what he describes as a ''five figure'' gift to the college because he says that it has insulted its tenured professors by not rehiring a single one of them. A small but vocal cadre of recent Antioch alumni share Dole's sentiment. Tenure exists, Bello says, ''so that we have academic freedom, so that the pope can't kill Galileo for saying that the earth goes around the sun. Tenure exists to keep people from being burned at the stake.''
Like many involved with Nonstop, Bello says he still feels betrayed by the corporation's decision in 2008 to abruptly halt financing for the ad hoc school. A computer-science major, he now spends much of his time hunched at the Emporium, a Yellow Springs cafe, poring over Antioch-related documents. He is, for example, studying the personal investments of Antioch's board members, to see if they hold arms-industry stocks, and he is pushing the jettisoned faculty to sue the college. He's fighting an uphill battle, but on a recent morning, as he sipped coffee in a T-shirt emblazoned with the motto ''Kicking Ass for the Working Class,'' he vowed to press on. He said, ''Horace Mann didn't say, 'Try really hard until you're tired.' ''
At the center of the fracas over how the new Antioch will create itself from the ashes of the old is the college's new president, Mark Roosevelt. A great-grandson of Teddy Roosevelt and also a onetime Massachusetts state legislator who later served, from 2005 to 2010, as the superintendent of Pittsburgh public schools, Roosevelt was hired last December. He is 55, and has five framed pictures of Abraham Lincoln in his office, as well as a bottle of cider vinegar that he sips judiciously to sooth a bad liver.
His experience at Antioch has been marked by ''a lovely instability,'' Roosevelt said. ''What we're undertaking is a high-wire act,'' he said. ''This has never been done before. I don't think a college has ever created a university and then seceded from it.''
Roosevelt maintains that his first task is to establish ''civil dialogue'' between warring alumni factions. ''A lot of the alumni got their noses bent out of shape,'' he said. ''I understand that. I appreciate that. But my feeling is that people will come home. Our disagreements are small, and I think we can work them out.'' When I visited Roosevelt's office this summer, he swiveled in his chair toward his computer and Googled Lincoln's quote about appealing to the ''better angels of our nature.''
Roosevelt isn't sure how, exactly, he will guide campus discourse. Will he halt the old Antioch's practice of letting students spray-paint political graffiti on designated walls? He doesn't know. And how will the curriculum handle conservative ideas? The faculty he put together, largely for its ability to teach a broad range of topics, doesn't include any outspoken right-wingers, he concedes, and he is leery of relying on guest speakers. ''We have to do it in class,'' he said. ''We have to teach students to be dexterous at presenting -- and understanding -- the political views of people who disagree with them. They'll need to if they want to win some victory for humanity.''
In 1989, Roosevelt was the lead sponsor on a bill that, when it passed, made Massachusetts the nation's second state, after Wisconsin, to protect gay rights. But his experience in Pittsburgh may be more apropos. There, when he arrived, the city's cash-starved, voter-elected school board was so besieged that Pittsburgh's mayor was poised to appoint a replacement board. ''It was stressful,'' Roosevelt said. ''I rarely slept through the night.'' Roosevelt secured a $100 million pledge from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and used it to establish a scholarship fund, the Pittsburgh Promise, that now sends roughly 750 high-school seniors to college each year. He closed 23 of Pittsburgh's 88 public schools. He may need to restructure Antioch as well.
With Lee Morgan, the Antioch corporation chairman, Roosevelt is working to establish community housing on campus for faculty and older adults -- and then integrate its residents into the curriculum. (''You could send a kid overseas for three months and have him start an elderhostel for his co-op,'' Morgan told me.) Roosevelt is also hoping to partner with neighboring colleges so that they share, say, a visiting poet. Antioch's wellness center will be open to Yellow Springs residents, and the college will do some language teaching online.
''We're not going to spend like an Amherst or a Williams,'' Roosevelt said. ''We can't do that. And we're going to have to say no to some things. Do we really need a course on Rousseau? Not necessarily. The core of what we need to deliver, I'd argue, is intimacy: quality teaching from quality teachers you get to form a deep relationship with.
''Our teachers need to tell students, 'Trying and failing is O.K.' What Antioch's always been good at is letting student growth be unpredictable -- and at not silencing voices outside of the mainstream. I've spent most of my life in the mainstream -- in the legislature and as a superintendent. But look at history.'' Roosevelt spoke of the stationmasters on the Underground Railroad, and of conscientious objectors during World War I. ''Those people were dissenters,'' he said. ''But they were important, and I think that, when it comes to the issues ahead of us -- like food and sustainability -- we're going to need the voices of people outside the mainstream.''
When the six new professors -- there are plans to hire another 10 over the next four school years -- were dispatched to the second floor of McGregor Hall for their first-ever visit to the faculty office suite, Roosevelt characterized the field trip as a ''sociology experiment.'' The offices weren't assigned, and in keeping with Antioch mores, the teachers were obliged to reach a consensus as to who would look out onto Antioch Hall and who would gaze down at the cracked concrete steps of the library.
The literature professor, Geneva Gano, began moving in 12 boxes of books, even though, officially speaking, the offices couldn't be occupied, on account of a problem with the fire alarm. The chemistry professor, David Kammler, got serious, putting on a back brace before he started heaving file cabinets around. But little was revealed about hierarchies or power dynamics, save for the fact that Lewis Trelawny-Cassity, a lanky philosophy professor from Georgia, ended up with the largest office of all by exercising Southern gentility, not saying a word until the others had all chosen their places. It was essentially a bunch of careful professionals, still not quite at ease with one another, being polite.
A while later the new faculty members went out for drinks at the Gulch, an old-school Yellow Springs dive. It was around 8:30 on a Thursday. A gentle breeze wafted into the bar from the sidewalk, and the faculty sat together at a long table, loosening up a bit. Their first inside joke evolved: They would turn to me just as they were on the verge of saying anything remotely juicy and declare, ''This is off the record.''
Mostly, though, the professors talked about how they planned to guide students -- which was what had really been missing that first week at Antioch. Even when the students arrived, there would be so few of them -- just 35, compared with 53 staff members, including the secretaries, deans and maintenance crews -- that the school's staff threatened to smother them with an earnest attention approximating baby lust.
But soon, as luck would have it, the faculty met the first freshman. Eva Erickson strolled into the Gulch, wearing fatigue shorts and a T-shirt that said: ''Antioch College. No Football Team Since 1929.'' Erickson, who is 22, was a freshman at the old Antioch before it closed; she stayed on in Yellow Springs, studying at Nonstop and working a dozen odd jobs, raking leaves and selling shoes as her parents fretted over her devotion to a college that didn't exist. Now she recognized the professors from photos she'd seen and rushed toward the table. ''Oh, my God,'' she said, her hands fluttering up toward her face. ''This is going to sound creepy, but I know all about you guys.'' Erickson sat down and said she was from Salt Lake City. ''And when you say that,'' she said, ''everyone thinks you're a Mormon.''
''It's an interesting place, though, with an alternative community,'' said Gano, the literature teacher.
''But what are you interested in studying?'' another professor asked.
Erickson started to speak, and everyone at the table leaned in, eager to hear.

AMERICAN DREAMERS
How the Left Changed a Nation
By Michael Kazin
Illustrated. 329 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $27.95.
We might as well call it: The American left is dead. Faced with the greatest crisis of capitalism in almost a century, the left has mounted no effective mass protests, inspired no significant uprisings, spawned no major institutions or policy revolutions. In Wisconsin, labor unions lost their greatest public battle since Ronald Reagan's showdown with air traffic controllers. In the midterm elections, the Tea Party, not the left, took advantage of economic discontent to upend the status quo. Today, the dream of socialism exists mostly as a far-right phantom, to be conjured up when Democrats dare to imply that Medicare or Social Security might serve the public good. 
The historian Michael Kazin acknowledges that Americans have reached what may be ''a nadir of the historical left.'' But he urges sympathizers not to despair. According to Kazin, the American left has never been much good at building institutions, or getting people elected or seeing its economic programs realized. But it has been enormously effective at shifting the nation's moral compass and expanding its sense of political possibility. The real problem for today's left, Kazin writes, is that its members have forgotten how to think big -- how to look beyond the uninspiring present to a more dazzling and egalitarian future. Defending Medicare and Social Security may be all well and good, but what ever happened to utopia?
''American Dreamers'' is Kazin's bid to reclaim the left's utopian spirit for an age of diminished expectations. An editor at Dissent magazine and one of the left's most eloquent spokesmen, Kazin presents his book as an unapologetic attempt to give the left a history it can celebrate. For more than two centuries, he writes, American radicals have sounded the alarm about crucial injustices -- slavery, industrial exploitation, women's oppression -- that the rest of society refused to see. It is time for the left to stand up and take credit for these efforts.
Who is -- or was -- ''the left''? Today, many Americans use the word interchangeably with ''liberal.'' As Kazin points out, this would have been anathema to earlier generations, when leftists and liberals often viewed each other as ideological foes. For most of the 20th century, liberalism meant tinkering, finding a kinder and gentler way to preserve the status quo. Leftists, by contrast, put their faith in structural change. Kazin's left includes all those who fought for a ''radically egalitarian transformation of society,'' from abolitionists to Communists to the modern feminist and gay rights movements.
By far the most important of the early movements was abolition, and abolitionists linger throughout the book as Kazin's archetypal leftists, prophets and dreamers who saw an injustice and fought to correct it despite the blindness and hostility of the larger society. The best among them practiced what they preached, forming interracial cooperatives and marrying across color lines. They also suffered for their ideals, enduring violence, social ostracism and, in some cases, death. In the end, they were vindicated by history, the ideals that they championed finally inscribed as the nation's conventional wisdom.
Things did not turn out so well for other radical movements (if one can describe a bloody civil war, followed by a century of racial struggle, as ''things turning out well''). In many cases, leftists dreamed big, suffered for their causes and died utterly unsuccessful. The Socialist Party leader Eugene Debs, who went to prison for his opposition to World War I, won release in 1921 only to be cast aside by the movement he had created. Stokely Carmichael (a k a Kwame Ture), the onetime firebrand of black power, died in obscurity in Guinea, still trying to forge a Pan-African movement. Kazin's portraits are often inspiring, but they also highlight why the revolutionary path has long been reserved for the dedicated few. Dreaming big is usually a lonely occupation, especially when the currents of history seem to be flowing in the opposite direction.
Kazin is frank about the flaws and outright evils of certain leftist movements -- most notably, the midcentury Communist Party. Its sins have been well documented, from loyalty to Stalin up through espionage. Still, Kazin finds much to admire in the Communists' early commitments to civil rights, as well as their hard work on behalf of American labor. Communists were ready to knock on doors when everyone else wanted to sit back and listen to the radio.
Kazin offers a similar, if more benign, analysis of the New Left, the movement in which he came of age. Young radicals made plenty of mistakes in the 1960s (not least in trying to build a movement around something as fleeting as ''youth''). But their accomplishments, he writes, have stood the test of time. In less than two decades, radicals helped to realize the promise of civil rights, end the war in Vietnam and create a new world of possibility for both women and homosexuals.
''American Dreamers'' is not a prescriptive book, offering instructions based on the past. Lessons nonetheless have a way of creeping into its text. The left generally failed, according to Kazin, when it emphasized atheism, collectivism and ideological purity. It has been more successful when taking the form of broad, heterogeneous movements struggling for individual rights. Witness the rise of gay marriage, arguably today's most effective left-leaning social campaign. Viewed as a utopian dream, it promises to transform the institution of marriage. But viewed as a civil rights matter, it simply aims to include more people in an existing institution.
In the final equation, Kazin argues, the left was most successful not in politics but in culture. In the 1930s, Popular Front artists produced a run of modern classics, including Woody Guthrie's ''This Land Is Your Land'' and John Steinbeck's ''Grapes of Wrath,'' work that defined the Great Depression for millions of Americans. During the 1960s, music changed the consciousness of an entire generation. (Even now, it seems, the left tends to attract better rock stars, writers and actors than the Tea Party.) And these powerful cultural voices, Kazin suggests, continue to shift how Americans think about the world.
This is a hopeful message. All the same, one can't help wondering if it is truly possible at this late date to recapture the utopian visions of radicals past. The left has lost its fire not simply because ''nothing so big or important'' as slavery or Vietnam has come along to stoke the embers. The left is in crisis because its animating vision -- of a world transformed through socialism -- has all but collapsed. Kazin is right to note that not all leftists identified as Socialists or Communists, and not all have considered economics the central site of contest. But socialism was always the big idea that explained how issues like racial inequality, gender oppression and factory wages all fit together.
What will replace it -- if it does, in fact, need replacing? Kazin isn't sure. But he argues that nobody will answer that question effectively until leftists dream big once again.

HEADLINE: Hysteresis Begins

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Losing the future, as we speak.

 BODY:
The slump in the United States and other advanced economies is the result of a failure of demand -- period, end of story. All attempts to claim that it is somehow structural, or maybe the result of reduced incentives to produce, have collapsed at first contact with the evidence. 
But there is a real concern that if the slump goes on long enough, it can turn into a supply-side problem, because investment will be depressed, reducing future capacity, and because workers who have been unemployed for a long time become unemployable. This is the issue of hysteria "hysteresis". 
And if you look at manufacturing capacity, in particular, you can already see that starting to happen.
The WSJ Real Time Economics blog -- about the only part of the Journal I find worth reading these days -- noted this the other day. Here's a longer-term perspective (I divided the FRED manufacturing production series by the capacity utilization series to back out capacity, rather than using the inconveniently formatted data from the Board of Governors):
You can see that there was a mini-version of the current decline in manufacturing capacity after the 2001 recession: capacity basically stopped growing in the face of a protracted weak economy. But this time around, with manufacturers operating way below capacity with little prospect of needing more capacity any time soon, they're both scrapping equipment and failing to expand. The result is that when we finally do have a real recovery, we'll run up against capacity constraints much sooner than we would have if there had been no Lesser Depression.
Arguably the same thing is happening in other sectors of the economy,
as the long-term unemployed begin to become unemployable, as the long shortfall in residential construction leads to rising rents (and a small uptick in core inflation) even though demand remains deeply depressed.
Hysteresis can mean that the costs of failing to pursue expansionary policies are much greater than even the direct effects on employment. And it can also mean, especially in the face of very low interest rates, that austerity policies are actually self-destructive even in purely fiscal terms: by reducing the economy's future potential, they reduce future revenues, and can make the debt position worse in the long run.
Still more evidence, then, of the awesome folly of the current direction of policy in Europe and America.

HEADLINE: TV Nostalgia Fans to Convene

BYLINE: PRADNYA JOSHI


HIGHLIGHT: A meeting of period pop culture fans is in its sixth year, growing from fewer than 1,000 in 2006 to an expected crowd of 7,000 to 9,000 this year.

 BODY:
Maybe it's the battered economy that is driving the public's longing for a different era. Or maybe it's Hollywood's own obsession with the 1950s and '60s, as witnessed by the lineup of fall television offerings like "Pan Am" and "The Playboy Club" that are following on the success of "Mad Men."
Whatever the cause, fans of old-time television, film, radio and pop culture can't get enough of the period. So from Thursday through Saturday they will visit Hunt Valley, Md., for the Mid-Atlantic Nostalgia Convention to relive their memories of shows and movies like "Peyton Place" and "The Miracle Worker."
The convention, which is in its sixth year, has grown steadily in attendance, from fewer than 1,000 in 2006 to almost 5,000 last year. Martin Grams, who organizes the show with his wife, Michelle, is projecting a crowd of 7,000 to 9,000 this year.
Mr. Grams said there would be guest appearances byPatty Duke, Tony Dow (Wally Cleaver in "Leave It to Beaver") and Davy Jones from "The Monkees."
"I always thought 'Leave It to Beaver' was one of the nicest shows on the air," said Mr. Grams, 34, who is an author of books on the history of old television shows, including "The Green Hornet" and "Have Gun Will Travel."
Activities include panels featuring celebrities and autograph sessions, workshops with screenings of old films and shows and recreations of old-time radio dramas. There will also be exhibits with thousands of collectible items from vendors for sale.
Other conventions tend to focus on science fiction, comic books or cult horror movies - all of which have found a resurgence among younger audiences and new fans. Mr. Grams said he used to be a regular attendee of such shows.
But as ticket prices for those shows soared, some features he liked were squeezed out, he said.
Though pulp fiction, cult horror and "The Twilight Zone" can be found at Mr. Grams's convention, the offerings cover a much broader range of entertainment.
Mr. Grams says that he runs his show mostly with volunteers and that he uses whatever profit he makes to buy new projectors or other items for future conventions.
There is one challenge that the convention has been facing, though: many of the stars of these old series are passing away.
"That's the one thing we're combating," Mr. Grams said.

HEADLINE: Republican Voices Express Disapproval of Obama

BYLINE: MARINA STEFAN


HIGHLIGHT: Follow-up interviews from the latest New York Times/CBS News poll offer some detail about respondents' feelings about Obama's stewardship of the economy.

 BODY:
The latest New York Times/CBS News poll offers an in-depth look at the public's view of the president's stewardship of the economy and how his jobs plan is being received. 
The poll also found that though Republicans appear more energized than Democrats at the outset of the 2012 presidential campaign, many have reservations about the candidates.
The nationwide telephone poll was conducted Sept. 10-15 with 1,452 adults. The following quotes were obtained in follow-up interviews after the poll was completed. (Support for Obama Slips; Unease on 2012 Candidates, Sept. 17, 2011) 
Republican Attitudes Toward President Obama
Allen Hulshizer, 77, Republican, a retired structural engineer from Glenside, Pa. 
"Any Republican who gets the nomination, whether it's my first choice or not, is going to be better than what we've got now. By the time you get down to the final selections, any one of the top contenders will certainly be better than Obama. Right now the top contenders are Perry and Romney and either would be fine."
Ruth Koehler, 93, Republican, a homemaker from Aiken, S.C. 
"I do think any Republican candidate would be better than Obama. I didn't dislike him before he was elected but now I think he has not come up to expectations. All I can do is hope that a Republican gets in. Any Republican running for president would be good. I consider any Republican in the running for president would have to be good to get to that position. And any Republican good enough to be in the position to run would be a good president." 
Gary Quandt, 55, Republican, a bricklayer and county supervisor from Grand Island, Neb. 
"I think Obama has taken us in the wrong direction with the idea of stimulus packages. The first two haven't worked and now he wants to do a third one. I think any of the Republican nominees would take us in a better direction because they are more in touch with the taxpayers and have a conservative approach." 
Frank MacDonell, 58, Republican, a consultant from Bloomfield Hills, Mich.

"There is a huge abyss that exists between Obama's administration and the Republicans. I think the ultimate issue is a question of leadership and being able to unite the different viewpoints and that didn't happen. If you refer to what Reagan asked years ago: 'Are you better off than you were four years ago,' the answer is no, the country is not better off. I think Obama had a lot of momentum and attributes that allowed him to get elected, but the administration has just not panned out the way everybody had hoped. 
Gary Dorumsgaard, 52, Republican, a technical adviser from St. Michael, Minn.

"I don't have anything against the man, I just think we need a change and we need someone more conservative. I'm really worried about the continual amount of money we are piling into the debt. It seems like we're just printing more money. Our poor children are going to pay the price for our out-of-control spending. We have to stop giving the money away and live within a budget rather than expanding our budget. We can't continue with the attitude that we can always print more money. Sooner or later there will be a collapse." 
Lydia Hasekamp, 73, Republican who worked in insurance and investments sales, now retired; lives in Maryland Heights, Mo. 
"We have gotten into such a hole with so much spending and more to come and we can't afford it. We need a Republican to get in there and quit spending and get rid of some of the big government. We need to keep our heads above water and salvage the economy for our grandchildren. So many people being out of work is terrible. I don't know about the job bill, I don't even know what's in it. I think it's like Obamacare, we don't know what's in it, really." 
Mark Laramee, 31, Republican who works in financial services; lives in Rockland, Mass. 
"I don't think our current president is a liberal, I don't think he is a Democrat, I think he is a socialist. He is trying to force feed government on us. The government has grown too much in the past three years. Fifty-two percent of all income is generated by the government and 48 percent from the private sector. It's way off balance." 
Views of President Obama's 2008 Supporters 
Ann Sheets, 69, Democrat, a retired magazine administrator from Chattanooga, Tenn.

"I disapprove much more of Congress. And it's not just the Republicans, because I feel there are no courageous people on either side. I don't disapprove of Barack Obama as a person, but as a president he has disappointed me greatly. It seemed to me that he bought into going into Afghanistan much too easily. I'm not sure he ever devised a real strategy on the economy, which is his weakest point. I am disappointed that the fire, the passion that caused me to support him did not carry over into his presidency. I'm realistic enough to know how difficult it is and I am not against compromise, but I voted for a backbone. You have to draw some lines in the sand and I don't think he has done that. I think it's too soon to tell whether I'd vote for him again because who knows who he'll run against. Of course if it were Rick Perry, I'd have to vote for Obama. But I don't see anybody out there who is courageous enough to deal with the problems at hand and go purely on their record." 
Barbara Cornell, 56, Democrat, a hospital chaplain in Shoreline, Wash.

"This is really complicated because I have incredible empathy for the spot he's in. I can't imagine the pressure he has to deal with and he walked into the huge mess left behind by George Bush. I also think he's being bullied by Congress and as someone said that's not how you act with a bully. But I wish he would deal more with the Democratic things that matter to me, like standing up for the workers in Wisconsin. That was a moment where he could have stood up for our Democratic way and he didn't. I wish he would use his power to guide our attention more to the big picture. We need a conversation about this huge disparity between workers and corporate executives. I wish he would give more speeches like the one he gave in Philadelphia during the campaign about racism. He misses opportunities to call people to our higher selves and focus on the bigger picture. But none of the Republicans are a viable option. They are going off into unreality. At least Obama keeps trying to deal with reality and I admire that. I believe he is a good person, but there are all these issues and problems that aren't being dealt with." 
Brian Mitchell, 59, independent, an electrical contractor from Carlinville, Ill.

"I didn't like the billions in bailout of a few years ago and I'm not sure the economic issues are being dealt with the way they should be. I don't think his plan for using tax money to create new jobs is the way to go. I also do not care about the health plan he's put together. I think long term that's going to be a problem. As for whether I'd vote for him again, if the election was tomorrow I'd say no. Though from what little I've gotten from the candidates out there now, I have not picked any favorite." 
Opinions About the Bad Condition of the Economy 
Bev Hall, 55, independent, a medical technician from Shelbyville, Ind.

"Things went off on the wrong track because the Democrats and Republicans kept going back and forth and couldn't decide on a budget. The worsening economy is not something that happened just recently, but it's coming to a head. I think the war had a lot to do with the economy getting worse." 
Jim Olson, 66, Republican, retired from working at a publishing company in the sales department; lives in Sebeka, Minn.

"The wrong direction of the economy is something that has been going on for quite a while, probably ever since the Clinton administration, through Obama's administration is probably the worst. A lot of it goes back to the debt and I don't see anybody on either side of the government taking that seriously. The Obama strategy is trying to buy jobs but these people don't really understand how business operates. There are so many regulations that get in the way of hiring. I think politicians don't understand that hiring people is really expensive for business. So much expense is involved in hiring someone that telling me you're going to give me a one-year tax break is a gimmick that really has no effect on whether a business can hire someone. There are too many federal, state and local controls that following all the guidelines makes it really difficult. Government should get out of the way and repealing regulations would help a lot."

HEADLINE: Campaign Redux as Obama Pushes for Taxes on Rich

BYLINE: JOHN HARWOOD


HIGHLIGHT: The president's message about income inequality played better with voters in 2008 than it has with Republican lawmakers.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - Four years ago this month, the candidate Barack Obama paused after a rally to reflect on his aspirations for economic change. His words still explain President Obama's policies.
"We're seeing greater inequality than at any time since before the Great Depression," Mr. Obama said in that 2007 interview in Storm Lake, Iowa. "Our tax policy has been skewed toward the top 1 percent and away from the middle class, working class in this country.
"Reversing that would make a significant difference," he argued. "That's not trivial. That's not around the edges."
He was talking about the growing gap over the past generation between the incomes of the most affluent Americans and everyone else. That fact - acknowledged by liberal and conservative economists alike - drove his campaign platform on taxes and still drives his policy in the White House.
In recommendations to be presented to a special Congressional deficit reduction committee on Monday, Mr. Obama will propose an array of tax increases on the highest earners: limiting deductions for families earning more than $250,000, levying minimum taxes on those earning more than $1 million, and taxing the "carried interest" at some investment partnerships as personal income rather than at lower capital gains rates. Mr. Obama said he would use the extra revenue to finance a short-term economic stimulus and long-term deficit reduction.
That message fared better with voters in the 2008 campaign than it has with Congress. Some Democratic lawmakers have joined their Republican opponents in complaining that he had hit their upper-income constituents. 
Yet in one way, Mr. Obama's opportunity to draw a politically profitable contrast, as he seeks legislation now and a second term in November 2012, may be greater than four years ago. Some of his Republican challengers, citing a different conception of fairness, want new taxes on those who have been falling behind.
Rich and Richer
In 1979, when Mr. Obama began his freshman year at Occidental College, the highest-earning 20 percent of American households received 45.5 percent of all income before taxes. The middle "quintile," according to Congressional Budget Office figures, received 15.8 percent. The poorest 20 percent took in just 5.8 percent.
By 2007, as Mr. Obama sought the presidency, the share of pretax income received by the top 20 percent had risen to 55.9 percent - while Congress had chopped their maximum income tax rate in half, to 35 percent. The share of income for every other group went down.
The shift in inequality was even more drastic when it came to the richest Americans. The top 1 percent (average 2007 income: $1.8 million) reaped 19.4 percent of the nation's total - double their 1979 share and more than the bottom 40 percent combined.
Scholars call it "the economics of superstars" and generally agree on the causes. The decline of mass-production manufacturing jobs and the rise of technology brought increasing rewards to well-educated workers who were best able to adapt and use information. The bipartisan push for trade expansion in a globalized economy worsened those trends.
"We sold it as a net positive for society, but there was a little asterisk there," said Larry Lindsey, who was a top economic adviser to President George W. Bush. Expanded trade helped owners of capital find less expensive workers and greater returns abroad, and immigration placed more downward pressure on wages.
"There's been a big change in the last 30 years," said Glenn Hubbard, dean of the business school at Columbia University and also a former Bush adviser. "It's a problem. For an economic system to be successful, everybody's got to have trust."
Competing Remedies
As a candidate, Mr. Obama made the same argument for his tax proposals. Restoring "some fairness and some equality," he said in that 2007 interview, could "make sure people feel they've got a stake in this economy so that they continue to support free markets and trade as opposed to reacting against it."
Yet Republicans insist that Mr. Obama keeps seeking the wrong remedies. Instead of higher rates on the rich, Mr. Hubbard advocates education improvements, better job training and comprehensive tax reform.
"We shouldn't expect it to turn on a dime," he said.
Other Republicans say higher taxes on the rich undermine the very idea of fairness that Mr. Obama champions. That is because nearly half of Americans, lacking enough income to owe federal income taxes, do not pay any.
"It's a peculiar notion of fairness," said the Republican economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin, to tell affluent Americans, "You fund all of the government, and we're going to hit you harder." One of the leading Republican presidential candidates, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, has pledged to remedy that "injustice."
Polls show that most Americans side with Mr. Obama on higher taxes for the wealthy. But voters are dispirited about economic conditions and with Mr. Obama's leadership in general, and he has been ineffective in pressuring Congress to go along.
Administration aides insist that two factors provide a new opening: rising anxiety about jobs and deficits, and lawmakers' own rock-bottom ratings. Mr. Obama has begun trying to replicate his 2008 success by abandoning closed-door negotiations for feisty, campaign-style language.
But so far his aspirations for big shifts in tax policy share something in common with the income gap that underlies them: evidence of a breakthrough remains elusive.

HEADLINE: Greeks Consider Draconian Cuts In Appeal for Aid

BYLINE: By JACK EWING and NIKI KITSANTONIS; Jack Ewing reported from Frankfurt, and Niki Kitsantonis from Athens. Stephen Castle contributed from Wroclaw, Poland.

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- Greek leaders struggled through the weekend to agree to a set of radical budget reductions that would satisfy foreign lenders' demands even as they tried to stave off mounting resistance to those cuts at home.
Reflecting the urgency of the situation, the prime minister of Greece, George A. Papandreou, canceled a planned trip to Washington this week and held talks with his cabinet on Sunday.
But European stock markets on Monday morning registered their pessimism, with the main indexes of the German and French exchanges down more than 2 percent. The Greek stock market index slid 2.7 percent.
The Greeks face an October deadline to qualify for 8 billion euros, or $11 billion, in aid, without which Greece will certainly default on its growing debt. Over the weekend, European finance ministers issued stern warnings at a meeting in Poland that failure to meet financial targets would imperil the release of the payment. 
The payment is just one installment in a larger package of 110 billion euros, or $152.6 billion, in aid agreed to by euro zone members in spring 2010; a second bailout fund, for 109 billion euros, or $150.2 billion, was agreed to in July, though that has yet to be ratified.
To reach the financial targets, Greek leaders discussed a range of draconian layoffs and pay reductions among public sector workers. While these measures have long been planned, but never carried out, to the frustration of foreign lenders, the discussion of these cuts represented a marked change in approach for the Greek government, with the emphasis on reductions over revenue increases.
''Everyone wants a smaller state,'' the finance minister, Evangelos Venizelos, said on Sunday.
After the meeting, the Greek government reaffirmed its commitment to hit budget targets for 2011 and 2012, to avoid generating new debt and to revamp the dysfunctional economy. The measures are ''in order to avoid bankruptcy and remain in the euro zone but also to stop the country being blackmailed and humiliated,'' Mr. Venizelos said.
Mr. Venizelos also appealed to Greeks to take responsibility for the challenges they face.
''What is being disputed on a global level is not the ability of the government but the ability of the country to do what is necessary,'' he said, in an apparent reference to strong labor union resistance to reforms and persistent tax evasion.
More specifically, Greece officials are being pressed to put thousands of civil servants deemed to be ''surplus'' on a standby status at a reduced wage. The government has not yet pushed ahead with this measure, which is very unpopular in a country where nearly one million people out of a population of 11 million work for the government.
Several Greek news media outlets, including the influential center-left newspaper To Vima, on Sunday cited an internal government e-mail that set out priorities by Greece's foreign creditors aimed at raising much-needed revenue quickly. These include cuts in the pensions of Greek sailors and employees of the state telecommunication company OTE, the immediate merger or abolition of 65 state agencies and the freezing of state workers' pensions through 2015.
Adding to the Greeks' dilemma is that the proposed cuts come as the Greek economy is contracting faster than expected. Last week, Mr. Venizelos warned that the economy would shrink much more sharply this year than anticipated -- by 5.3 percent instead of the 3.8 percent originally forecast in May. The budget deficit is on track to reach 8.2 percent of gross domestic product this year, well ahead of the original estimate of 7.4 percent.
The original aid package requires Greece to reduce its deficit to 7.5 percent of gross domestic product this year, and below 3 percent by 2014, according to the International Monetary Fund.
The reduced number of workers employed in the public sector would make it easier to meet these targets as payroll tax collections shrink.
Despite the dire circumstances, Mr. Venizelos denied rampant speculation that the country was on the brink of default.
Acknowledging that the mood in both Greece and the euro zone is ''fluid and nervous,'' he said the country was committed to taming its widening budget deficit and carrying out reforms, one of which is a new levy intended to ensure that property owners pay taxes.
Mr. Venizelos also lashed out at ''those intent on speculating against the euro and carrying out organized attacks on the heart of the euro zone.''
Greece, he said, risks ''becoming a scapegoat and an easy alibi for institutions that are unable to curb the crisis and to respond to attacks on the euro.''
On Monday, Mr. Venizelos will have a chance to make his country's case in a conference call with representatives of the foreign lenders known as the troika: the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
Public sector workers in Greece have shown little appetite for the cuts that have already been made, let alone those being proposed. Over the summer, protests have turned violent as workers have bristled at the new austerity measures.
In Germany, the mood seemed to be turning increasingly in favor of letting Greece fail rather than to bear the growing cost.
Wolfgang Schauble, the German finance minister, repeated warnings that Greece would not receive any more aid unless it kept promises it had made to the I.M.F., the European Commission and the European Central Bank to cut government spending and improve the economy.
''The payments on Greece are contingent on clear conditions,'' Mr. Schauble told the newspaper Bild am Sonntag.
As the largest country in the euro area, which has 17 European Union members, Germany is the biggest contributor to a bailout fund meant to help Greece as well as Portugal and Ireland continue to pay their debts while their economies recover.
Voters in Berlin, at least, did not punish Chancellor Angela Merkel for her handling of the debt crisis. Her Christian Democratic Union gained two percentage points in regional elections on Sunday compared with the last election five years ago, winning 23.4 percent of the vote. The Social Democrats, who have generally been supportive of aid to Greece, remained in power with 28.3 percent.
Support for the Free Democrats, whose leaders have been among the most vocal critics of Greek aid, plunged to 1.8 percent from 7.6 percent in 2006. That is below the 5 percent needed to seat representatives in the state Parliament.
In the end, when political leaders do the math, they may find it cheaper to save Greece than engineer a bank rescue, analysts said.
''There is no political advocacy for such a prospect in Greece or in Europe as it would signal the beginning of the unraveling of the euro zone,'' said George Pagoulatos, a professor at the Athens University of Economics and Business. ''The markets would start attacking Portugal and Ireland, and the domino would stop somewhere around France.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article on Monday about Greece's consideration of radical budget cuts to meet international lenders' conditions for financial assistance misstated the effect of public sector layoffs on meeting deficit reduction targets. Reducing the number of civil servants would make it easier to meet such targets, not ''add to the difficulty.''

Esurance, San Francisco, chose Leo Burnett, Chicago, part of the Publicis Groupe, as its new advertising agency of record. Burnett is also the longtime creative agency for Allstate, which is buying Esurance from the White Mountains Insurance Group. The Esurance assignment, with spending estimated at $100 million, had been handled by Duncan/Channon, San Francisco, which took part in a review for the account along with Burnett; Deutsch L.A., also known as the Marina del Rey, Calif., office of Deutsch, part of the Lowe & Partners Worldwide division of the Interpublic Group of Companies; Goodby, Silverstein & Partners, San Francisco, part of the Omnicom Group; and Venables Bell & Partners, San Francisco.

Ramona is part of the Kirshenbaum Bond Senecal & Partners unit of MDC Partners; Kirshenbaum Bond Senecal was chosen last month to create campaigns for BMW to run in the general market. Sanders/Wingo Advertising, Austin, Tex., was named to create campaigns for Mini Cooper aimed at multicultural consumers, an assignment that had previously been handled by Matlock.
Mars and its Wm. Wrigley Jr. unit consolidated their media accounts in Southeast Asia and awarded the assignment, with spending estimated at $60 million, to the Starcom division of the Starcom MediaVest Group, part of the Publicis Groupe. The consolidated account covers Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. The assignment had previously been divided between MEC, part of the GroupM unit of WPP, for Wrigley, and agencies owned by the Omnicom Media Group unit of the Omnicom Group, for Mars.
Ancestry.com, Provo, Utah, selected Duncan/Channon, San Francisco, to develop a campaign that will run in television, print and digital media. Spending was estimated at almost $40 million. Ancestry.com previously worked with Penabrand, San Francisco.

Miscellany
Michael Bense, a freelance copywriter, was named the winner of the 14th annual Dead Radio contest sponsored by Oink Ink Radio, New York and Santa Monica, Calif. Mr. Bense's 60-second script promoted the power of radio advertising by invoking names of make-believe businesses like Ecoli's Bar and Grill. The contest is intended to give a second chance to scripts for radio commercials that were deemed too risky, too silly or wrong for the client. Among Mr. Bense's prizes is the production of his script by Oink Ink.
Erwin Penland, Greenville, S.C., part of the Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, is expanding into New York and will be based in the Hill, Holliday office there.

HEADLINE: A Channel Woos the Man With Spare Cash for Toys

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
When Discovery Communications set out to reformat HD Theater, the nine-year-old home of high-definition documentaries, its executives assessed the crowded cable programming landscape and asked what was missing -- where there was ''white space,'' as one later put it.
What was missing, they decided, was a channel for the Rich Man -- the successful, college-educated man who earns $150,000 or more a year and who wants to know how to spend his time and money. 
That's how Velocity was hatched. Replacing the low-rated HD Theater on Oct. 4, Velocity is being billed as a high-end men's lifestyle channel about fast cars, fancy auctions and football stars. On Monday, the channel will announce that its first three months will feature 140 hours of programming premieres, a high number that reflects the channel's need to be sampled by its chosen demographic.
''The biggest challenge,'' said Robert S. Scanlon, the executive in charge of Velocity, ''is to get the word out -- to explain what we are in 30 seconds or less.'' To get attention, the channel has collaborated with NFL Films to create two football-themed series and has conceived several nights' worth of car programming.
In interviews a few weeks before the channel transition, Discovery executives said they weren't worried about the state of the broader economy, noting that the luxury sector has held up quite well in recent years. As Mr. Scanlon said: ''If you're selling something in a recession, who's more likely to buy, a guy with money or a guy without?''
Velocity is the latest example of the splintering of television into ever-narrower demographic and psychographic segments. Of the 118 million men ages 15 and older in the United States, about four million are identified by the government as having incomes above $150,000 each year, according to data collected last year by the Census Bureau.
It is unknown how many of those four million men will have access to Velocity; HD Theater is available in about 40 million of the 100 million homes that have cable.
''It's not going to have a huge audience,'' said David Zaslav, the chief executive of Discovery Communications. But, he asserted, it doesn't necessarily need to; if Velocity can attract the relatively elusive Rich Man, it can charge a premium to advertisers in much the same way that CNBC does.
Independent market research indicates that well-heeled men gravitate toward business news channels like CNBC, premium cable channels like HBO and sports hubs like ESPN, Golf Channel and the Tennis Channel.
Mr. Scanlon asserted that Velocity's target demographic samples those channels, but doesn't stick with any of them. ''I think our brand is much more clearly defined,'' he said.
Bob Shullman, the president of the market research company Ipsos Mendelsohn, said his most recent survey of media habits found that adults with high incomes consumed more content this year than in years past, consistent with surveys of the broader population that have found increased time being spent with media. He said of Velocity, ''Obviously, it will take a large investment, great product and great marketing, but the targets are there.''
Velocity is the latest instance of channel retooling by Discovery, which has already turned Discovery Health into the Oprah Winfrey Network, or OWN for short; Discovery Kids into the Hub; and fitTV into Discovery Fit and Health.
The company started HD Theater in 2002 as a place for high-definition versions of its other channels' shows; now it is largely obsolete because most of the other channels are available in high definition. Mr. Zaslav said that the channel ''reaches a wealthier demographic, because by definition you need to have an HD set and an HD receiver.''
That's one of the reasons why rich men are being pursued by the rebranded Velocity. Mr. Scanlon is importing several car-themed programs from HD Theater, including ''Inside West Coast Customs,'' ''Chasing Classic Cars'' and ''Mecum Auto Auction,'' and he is adding shows like ''Epic Poker League,'' ''Extreme Fishing'' and ''Tech Toys.''
Velocity's advertising deals do not include income guarantees of the audience. ''The Velocity target list is a much broader base of clients than just those that are considered upscale,'' a spokesman for the channel said in an e-mail message.
In part that's because the channel knows that many of Velocity's viewers will be aspirational -- the men who, in Mr. Scanlon's words, ''drive a Pontiac, but are going to drive a Porsche.''
''If we hit the target'' demographic, he added, ''there's an entire population right below them that we'll attract.''
According to the Census Bureau data, almost six million men have incomes of $100,000 to $150,000.
Velocity may learn from WealthTV, a independent cable channel that started seven years ago. ''We have found that people really like to watch programs about high-end toys and lifestyle,'' said Robert Herring, the channel's chief executive. It's vicarious living, he said: ''Even if you own a yacht, you probably won't be invited to just take a tour of someone else's yacht. We give everyone that chance.''

HEADLINE: Partnership With Egypt Is Predicted By Turkey

BYLINE: By ANTHONY SHADID

 BODY:
ANKARA, Turkey -- A newly assertive Turkey offered on Sunday a vision of a starkly realigned Middle East, where the country's former allies in Syria and Israel fall into deeper isolation, and a burgeoning alliance with Egypt underpins a new order in a region roiled by revolt and revolution.
The portrait was described by Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu of Turkey in an hourlong interview before he was to leave for the United Nations, where a contentious debate was expected this week over a Palestinian bid for recognition as a state. Viewed by many as the architect of a foreign policy that has made Turkey one of the most relevant players in the Muslim world, Mr. Davutoglu pointed to that issue and others to describe a region in the midst of a transformation. Turkey, he said, was ''right at the center of everything.''
He declared that Israel was solely responsible for the near collapse in relations with Turkey, once an ally, and he accused Syria's president of lying to him after Turkish officials offered the government there a ''last chance'' to salvage power by halting its brutal crackdown on dissent. 
Strikingly, he predicted a partnership between Turkey and Egypt, two of the region's militarily strongest and most populous and influential countries, which he said could create a new axis of power at a time when American influence in the Middle East seems to be diminishing.
''This is what we want,'' Mr. Davutoglu said.
''This will not be an axis against any other country -- not Israel, not Iran, not any other country, but this will be an axis of democracy, real democracy,'' he added. ''That will be an axis of democracy of the two biggest nations in our region, from the north to the south, from the Black Sea down to the Nile Valley in Sudan.''
His comments came after a tour last week by Turkish leaders -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Mr. Davutoglu among them -- of Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, the three Arab countries that have undergone revolutions this year. His criticism of old allies and embrace of new ones underscored the confidence of Turkey these days, as it tries to position itself on the winning side in a region unrecognizable from a year ago.
Unlike an anxious Israel, a skeptical Iran and a United States whose regional policy has been criticized as seeming muddled and even contradictory at times, Turkey has recovered from early missteps to offer itself as a model for democratic transition and economic growth at a time when the Middle East and northern Africa have been seized by radical change. The remarkably warm reception of Turkey in the Arab world -- a region Turks once viewed with disdain -- is a development almost as seismic as the Arab revolts and revolutions themselves.
Mr. Davutoglu credited a ''psychological affinity'' between Turkey and much of the Arab world, which was ruled by the Ottoman Empire for four centuries from Istanbul.
The foreign minister, 52, remains more scholar than politician, though he has a diplomat's knack for bridging divides. Cerebral and soft-spoken, he offered a speech this summer to Libyan rebels in Benghazi -- in Arabic. Soon after the revolution in Tunisia, he hailed the people there as the ''sons of Ibn Khaldoun,'' one of the Arab world's greatest philosophers, born in Tunis in the 14th century. ''We're not here to teach you,'' he said. ''You know what to do. Ibn Khaldoun's grandsons deserve the best political system.''
That sense of cultural affinity has facilitated Turkey's entry into the region, as has the successful model of Mr. Davutoglu's Justice and Development Party, whose deeply pious leaders have won three consecutive elections, presided over a booming economy and inaugurated reform that has made Turkey a more liberal, modern and confident place. Mr. Erdogan's defense of Palestinian rights and criticism of Israel -- relations between Turkey and Israel collapsed after Israeli troops killed nine people on board a Turkish flotilla trying to break the blockade of Gaza in 2010 -- has bolstered his popularity.
Last week, Mr. Erdogan was afforded a rapturous welcome in Egypt, where thoroughfares were adorned with his billboard-size portraits. (''Lend us Erdogan for a month!'' wrote a columnist in Al Wafd, an Egyptian newspaper.)
Mr. Davutolglu, who accompanied him there, said Egypt would become the focus of Turkish efforts, as an older American-backed order, buttressed by Israel, Saudi Arabia and, to a lesser extent, prerevolutionary Egypt, begins to crumble. On the vote over a Palestinian state, the United States, in particular, finds itself almost completely isolated.
He also predicted that Turkey's $1.5 billion investment in Egypt would grow to $5 billion within two years and that total trade would increase to $5 billion, from $3.5 billion now, by the end of 2012, then $10 billion by 2015. As if to underscore the importance Turkey saw in economic cooperation, 280 businessmen accompanied the Turkish delegation, and Mr. Davutoglu said they signed about $1 billion in contracts in a single day.
''For democracy, we need a strong economy,'' he said.
Other countries -- Iran, Saudi Arabia and Israel -- would undoubtedly look upon an Egyptian-Turkish axis with alarm. Just a year ago, Egypt's own president, Hosni Mubarak, viewed Turkey, and Mr. Erdogan in particular, with skepticism and suspicion. But in the view of Mr. Davutoglu, such an alliance was a force for stability.
''For the regional balance of power, we want to have a strong, very strong Egypt,'' said Mr. Davutoglu, who has visited the Egyptian capital five times since Mr. Mubarak was overthrown in February. ''Some people may think Egypt and Turkey are competing. No. This is our strategic decision. We want a strong Egypt now.''
The phrase ''zero problems'' is a famous dictum written by Mr. Davutoglu, who served as Mr. Erdogan's chief foreign policy adviser before becoming foreign minister. By it, he meant that Turkey would strive to end conflicts with its neighbors. Successes have been few. Problems remain with Armenia, and Turkey was unable to resolve the conflict in Cyprus, still divided into Greek and Turkish zones. Turkey's agreement to host a radar installation as part of a NATO missile defense system has rankled neighboring Iran.
Most spectacularly, its relations with Israel collapsed after the Israeli government refused a series of Turkish demands that followed the attack on the boat: an apology, compensation for the victims and a lifting of Israel's blockade on the Gaza Strip.
''Nobody can blame Turkey or any other country in the region for its isolation,'' he said of Israel. ''It was Israel and the government's decision to isolate themselves. And they will be isolated even more if they continue this policy of rejecting any proposal.''
Caught by surprise by the Arab revolts -- as pretty much everyone was -- Turkey staggered. At least $15 billion in investments were lost in the civil war in Libya, and Turkish diplomats initially opposed NATO's intervention. For years, Turkey cultivated ties with Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad, seeing Syria as its fulcrum for integrating the region's economies. Mr. Erdogan and Mr. Assad counted themselves as friends.
Syria's failure to -- as Mr. Davutoglu put it -- heed Turkey's advice has wrecked relations, and Turkey is now hosting Syrian opposition conferences and groups.
Last month, in meetings that lasted more than six hours, Mr. Davutoglu said Mr. Assad agreed on a Turkish road map -- announcing a specific date for parliamentary elections by year's end, repealing a constitutional provision that enshrined power in the ruling Baath Party, drafting a constitution by the newly elected Parliament and then holding another election once the constitution decided between a presidential or a parliamentary system. Despite face-to-face assurances, Mr. Assad did not follow through.
''For us, that was the last chance,'' Mr. Davutoglu said.
Asked if he felt betrayed, he replied, ''Yes, of course.''
Mr. Davutoglu accused Mr. Assad of ''not fulfilling promises and not telling the truth.''
''This is the illusion of autocratic regimes,'' he said. ''They think that in a few days they will control the situation. Not today, but tomorrow, next week, next month. They don't see. And this is a vicious circle.''

HEADLINE: Ex-Giant's Case Is a Window On N.F.L. Aid

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN. 
E-mail: wcr@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Ron Johnson's private room is large but sparse: a couch, two chairs, a flat-screen television and a computer that has been programmed to accommodate Johnson's favorite games: chess, backgammon, poker.
There are no pictures on the wall. No photographs of his family or his former Giants teammates, no reminders of his glory days at the University of Michigan.
''Right now, he wouldn't receive that well,'' Karen Johnson, his wife of 37 years, explained. ''He would feel like: 'Why are you bringing my things over here? I'm out of here tomorrow.' ''
But Ron Johnson is not going home; for the foreseeable future, this facility in New Jersey is home. 
It has been home for Johnson, a former Giants running back, since May, after it became apparent to his wife and their two children that Johnson needed to be placed in a full-time care facility.
Johnson, 63, was found to have Alzheimer's disease in 2008, even though he was still driving and going into the headquarters of Rackson, the food-services business he started 28 years ago.
By 2009, his son Chris had steadily assumed more responsibility after it became evident that Johnson needed around-the-clock attention.
''He was not able to do for himself,'' his wife said.
Johnson's diagnosis struck a personal note with me, because I regarded him as a friend outside of football circles. His professional football career ended years before I arrived in New York, but we met on the common ground of a charity, nonprofits and Johnson's penchant for mentoring.
My visit to Johnson late last week was the first time anyone outside of Johnson's family had been allowed in to see him.
''Ron is not adjusted well enough that he can handle people coming in and out,'' Karen Johnson said. ''Because he still feels that he is getting out of here.''
They had confirmed his condition to close friends, but for reasons personal and business-related had decided not to go public until now. The disclosure is certain to add to the growing concern about the violence of football at every level, and its possible connection to long-term disabilities for those who play it.
''We're not embarrassed anymore, we're not afraid anymore,'' Chris Johnson said. ''We have a much better idea of what is going to happen.''
Johnson, whose mother and brother were previously found to have Alzheimer's, looked robust. His hair is gray, and he has gained a few pounds. Still, wearing a T-shirt, shorts and sneakers, he looked as if he might have just come back from a run.
The reality is that he is not allowed to walk by himself, out of concern that he could wander off.
''The whole key to this is forgetting,'' his wife said. ''It's not a matter of mechanics. Ron physically is able to do things. People forget that they wore that shirt, that it's time to put on a clean shirt, time to take a shower. You have to be on top of everything, because they cannot remember to function for themselves at that level.''
Karen Johnson said she settled on the facility where her husband now lives after looking at seven others. The bulk of the expense for Johnson's care is paid by the 88 Plan, a program jointly run by the N.F.L. and the players union that was created as an outgrowth of the publicity surrounding the battles with dementia of the Hall of Fame tight end John Mackey, among others.
The plan was designed to assist players who are vested under the league's retirement plan and who have been found to have dementia. Eligible players who are institutionalized are entitled to a maximum annual benefit of $88,000. For eligible players who are not institutionalized, the maximum annual benefit is $50,000.
Johnson's case provides a look into how the 88 Plan is working.
The plan provides his family $7,333 a month. But the monthly cost of keeping Johnson at his current facility is $7,900, and that does not include $400 a month for medication.
''It's a start, it's not the end-all -- it can't stop there,'' Karen Johnson said. ''In 2006, $7,300 was adequate. They definitely have to build in an inflationary cost. I'm not being ungrateful; I want to be pragmatic, practical and realistic.''
Ron Johnson is considerably younger and physically more robust than the other residents, and as his wife searched for a facility to care for him, she said she saw a pattern: most were set up to care for aging women. ''There are not as many males out there,'' she said.
She said she would like to see a facility in the next five years that caters to what she believes will be a wave of former players in their 60s with Alzheimer's diagnoses.
''I'd love for them to have a workout place, a computer lab, a big flat-screen TV in a rec room where they all can watch the game,'' she said.
Karen Johnson went over and sat on the arm of Johnson's black leather recliner. She took out his electric shaver, began shaving a portion of his beard and then let him do the rest.
I asked Ron if he remembered when they met. ''No,'' he said.
She remembered the exact date: March 20, 1967. She was a high school senior visiting the Michigan campus with a group of National Merit Scholars, and Johnson was a 19-year-old sophomore still waiting for his chance to shine on the football team. They began dating the next fall.
Karen Johnson would see every game, every touchdown. She was there for Johnson's first touchdown in the Big House, and for the standing ovation he received at the end of his all-American senior season.
Johnson was drafted in the first round by the Cleveland Browns in 1969, then traded to the Giants for Homer Jones after his rookie season. Between 1970 and 1975, Johnson was one of the few bright spots on a string of dismal Giants teams.
Though he never received a concussion diagnosis during his playing career, Johnson carries the marks of a brutal sport: the two ugly scars on his knees, the other one on his thigh from a hematoma that became calcified; the neck operation in 1988 -- more than a dozen years after he retired -- that resulted in the removal of two vertebrae.
Karen Johnson said she always thought those injuries would be Ron's nemesis as he got older.
''I was always worried about the appendages,'' she said. ''I always thought it would be something physical, something with the knees, arthritis.
''This came out of the dark.''
The N.F.L. has agreed that there are hazards associated with playing football, but has not conceded that dementia is among them. In fact, science has not explained what causes the condition, or why studies have found Alzheimer's and other memory-related diseases in much higher numbers among former N.F.L. players than in similar subsets of the general population. But that has not stopped speculation that football can play a role.
Karen Johnson says she wants the league and the players union to take greater ownership of the well-being of former players. She is not alone. Last week, 28 former N.F.L. players filed a class-action suit against the N.F.L. Players Association, seeking at least $5 million in damages. The suit contends that current players left representatives of former players out of negotiations on retiree benefits when completing a new collective bargaining agreement. The result, they said, kept money from the retirees.
All Karen Johnson hopes to accomplish by going public with her husband's condition, she says, is to raise awareness of the plight of former players.
''Here's a person who people knew and loved and thought a lot of and here's the story,'' she said. ''It could be anybody. The disease is nondiscriminatory; it strikes every economic group, it knows no boundary, it is literally across the board.''
Karen Johnson looked at her watch: five o'clock. Dinnertime.
Ron Johnson lifted himself out of his chair gingerly and headed to the door, toward the dining room where he would sit in his usual spot by the window.
As we walked through the front door, Johnson flashed a smile and waved goodbye. He looked comfortable.
This is his new reality. This is home.

HEADLINE: Campaign Redux As Obama Pushes For Taxes on Rich

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - Four years ago this month, the candidate Barack Obama paused after a rally to reflect on his aspirations for economic change. His words still explain President Obama's policies.
''We're seeing greater inequality than at any time since before the Great Depression,'' Mr. Obama said in that 2007 interview in Storm Lake, Iowa. ''Our tax policy has been skewed toward the top 1 percent and away from the middle class, working class in this country.
''Reversing that would make a significant difference,'' he argued. ''That's not trivial. That's not around the edges.'' 
He was talking about the growing gap over the past generation between the incomes of the most affluent Americans and everyone else. That fact - acknowledged by liberal and conservative economists alike - drove his campaign platform on taxes and still drives his policy in the White House.
In recommendations to be presented to a special Congressional deficit reduction committee on Monday, Mr. Obama will propose an array of tax increases on the highest earners: limiting deductions for families earning more than $250,000, levying minimum taxes on those earning more than $1 million, and taxing the ''carried interest'' at some investment partnerships as personal income rather than at lower capital gains rates. Mr. Obama said he would use the extra revenue to finance a short-term economic stimulus and long-term deficit reduction.
That message fared better with voters in the 2008 campaign than it has with Congress. Some Democratic lawmakers have joined their Republican opponents in complaining that he had hit their upper-income constituents.
Yet in one way, Mr. Obama's opportunity to draw a politically profitable contrast, as he seeks legislation now and a second term in November 2012, may be greater than four years ago. Some of his Republican challengers, citing a different conception of fairness, want new taxes on those who have been falling behind.
Rich and Richer
In 1979, when Mr. Obama began his freshman year at Occidental College, the highest-earning 20 percent of American households received 45.5 percent of all income before taxes. The middle ''quintile,'' according to Congressional Budget Office figures, received 15.8 percent. The poorest 20 percent took in just 5.8 percent.
By 2007, as Mr. Obama sought the presidency, the share of pretax income received by the top 20 percent had risen to 55.9 percent - while Congress had chopped their maximum income tax rate in half, to 35 percent. The share of income for every other group went down.
The shift in inequality was even more drastic when it came to the richest Americans. The top 1 percent (average 2007 income: $1.8 million) reaped 19.4 percent of the nation's total - double their 1979 share and more than the bottom 40 percent combined.
Scholars call it ''the economics of superstars'' and generally agree on the causes. The decline of mass-production manufacturing jobs and the rise of technology brought increasing rewards to well-educated workers who were best able to adapt and use information. The bipartisan push for trade expansion in a globalized economy worsened those trends.
''We sold it as a net positive for society, but there was a little asterisk there,'' said Larry Lindsey, who was a top economic adviser to President George W. Bush. Expanded trade helped owners of capital find less expensive workers and greater returns abroad, and immigration placed more downward pressure on wages.
''There's been a big change in the last 30 years,'' said Glenn Hubbard, dean of the business school at Columbia University and also a former Bush adviser. ''It's a problem. For an economic system to be successful, everybody's got to have trust.''
Competing Remedies
As a candidate, Mr. Obama made the same argument for his tax proposals. Restoring ''some fairness and some equality,'' he said in that 2007 interview, could ''make sure people feel they've got a stake in this economy so that they continue to support free markets and trade as opposed to reacting against it.''
Yet Republicans insist that Mr. Obama keeps seeking the wrong remedies. Instead of higher rates on the rich, Mr. Hubbard advocates education improvements, better job training and comprehensive tax reform.
''We shouldn't expect it to turn on a dime,'' he said.
Other Republicans say higher taxes on the rich undermine the very idea of fairness that Mr. Obama champions. That is because nearly half of Americans, lacking enough income to owe federal income taxes, do not pay any.
''It's a peculiar notion of fairness,'' said the Republican economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin, to tell affluent Americans, ''You fund all of the government, and we're going to hit you harder.'' One of the leading Republican presidential candidates, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, has pledged to remedy that ''injustice.''
Polls show that most Americans side with Mr. Obama on higher taxes for the wealthy. But voters are dispirited about economic conditions and with Mr. Obama's leadership in general, and he has been ineffective in pressuring Congress to go along.
Administration aides insist that two factors provide a new opening: rising anxiety about jobs and deficits, and lawmakers' own rock-bottom ratings. Mr. Obama has begun trying to replicate his 2008 success by abandoning closed-door negotiations for feisty, campaign-style language.
But so far his aspirations for big shifts in tax policy share something in common with the income gap that underlies them: evidence of a breakthrough remains elusive.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: TV Nostalgia Fans to Convene

BYLINE: By PRADNYA JOSHI

 BODY:
Maybe it's the battered economy that is driving the public's longing for a different era. Or maybe it's Hollywood's own obsession with the 1950s and '60s, as witnessed by the lineup of fall television offerings like ''Pan Am'' and ''The Playboy Club'' that are following on the success of ''Mad Men.'' 
Whatever the cause, fans of old-time television, film, radio and pop culture can't get enough of the period. So from Thursday through Saturday they will visit Hunt Valley, Md., for the Mid-Atlantic Nostalgia Convention to relive their memories of shows and movies like ''Peyton Place'' and ''The Miracle Worker.''
The convention, which is in its sixth year, has grown steadily in attendance, from fewer than 1,000 in 2006 to almost 5,000 last year. Martin Grams, who organizes the show with his wife, Michelle, is projecting a crowd of 7,000 to 9,000 this year.
Mr. Grams said there would be guest appearances byPatty Duke, Tony Dow (Wally Cleaver in ''Leave It to Beaver'') and Davy Jones from ''The Monkees.''
''I always thought 'Leave It to Beaver' was one of the nicest shows on the air,'' said Mr. Grams, 34, who is an author of books on the history of old television shows, including ''The Green Hornet'' and ''Have Gun Will Travel.''
Activities include panels featuring celebrities and autograph sessions, workshops with screenings of old films and shows and recreations of old-time radio dramas. There will also be exhibits with thousands of collectible items from vendors for sale.
Other conventions tend to focus on science fiction, comic books or cult horror movies - all of which have found a resurgence among younger audiences and new fans. Mr. Grams said he used to be a regular attendee of such shows.
But as ticket prices for those shows soared, some features he liked were squeezed out, he said.
Though pulp fiction, cult horror and ''The Twilight Zone'' can be found at Mr. Grams's convention, the offerings cover a much broader range of entertainment.
Mr. Grams says that he runs his show mostly with volunteers and that he uses whatever profit he makes to buy new projectors or other items for future conventions.
There is one challenge that the convention has been facing, though: many of the stars of these old series are passing away.
''That's the one thing we're combating,'' Mr. Grams said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Pennsylvania G.O.P. Weighs Electoral Vote Changes for 2012

BYLINE: By NATE SILVER

 BODY:
Republicans in Pennsylvania are considering a proposal that would award 18 of the state's 20 electoral votes to the winner of each of its congressional districts, leaving the remaining 2 to the winner of the state at large.
Had the proposal been in place in 2008, when Pennsylvania had one more electoral vote prior to reapportionment, Barack Obama would have carried only 11 of the state's 21 electoral votes despite winning Pennsylvania by a 10-point margin.
The plan would create the possibility, in fact, that the winner of the popular vote in Pennsylvania could come away with fewer electoral votes from the state. Pennsylvania's congressional districts are heavily gerrymandered and the Democratic vote is concentrated in the dense urban areas of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. Republicans have a 12-7 edge now in the state's congressional delegation, and are in charge of its redistricting process. With Pennsylvania needing to lose one seat because of slow population growth, they will try to consolidate Democratic voters into six districts while reinforcing their own. 
A couple of the Republican-held districts might still be in play. The one occupied by Representative Charles Dent, for instance, now designated as Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional District, has been slightly Democratic-leaning in its presidential voting and was carried by Mr. Obama in 2008. But if Mr. Obama were to carry Pennsylvania narrowly, its electoral votes could plausibly split 9-11 or even 8-12 against him.
The Constitution provides broad latitude to states to determine how to allocate their electoral votes. In fact, Democrats have little recourse in Pennsylvania at all: Republicans control both branches of the state legislature as well as the governorship. And Pennsylvania has neither ballot initiatives nor recall elections. Democrats simply have to hope that Republicans will decide that the proposal is not in their overall best interest.
Fortunately for Democrats, the proposal is already drawing objections from some Republicans. And it's easy enough to see why: there are all sorts of downsides to this plan for Pennsylvania Republicans.
Problem #1. The Electoral College split could work against Republicans and cost their candidate the election.
It's easy to draw maps where the Pennsylvania plan could cost Mr. Obama an election he otherwise would have won. One case is if Mr. Obama were to lose Ohio, Florida, Nevada, Indiana and North Carolina from among the states he carried in 2008, holding the rest including Pennsylvania.
That would result in a 279-259 win for Mr. Obama in the Electoral College under the current rules. But, since he would probably lose between 10 and 12 of Pennsylvania's electoral votes because of the congressional district split, that would put him below the 270 votes required to win the Electoral College.
But one can also come up with plausible maps that would work the other way. Take the map we just drew and make two small alterations: Mr. Obama holds onto Nevada, but loses Pennsylvania. (Seem unlikely? It isn't: Mr. Obama carried Nevada by a wider margin than Pennsylvania in 2008.)
Under the old rules, this would be enough for the Republican candidate to become the next president, winning the Electoral College 273-265. If Pennsylvania's votes were split, however, Mr. Obama would be very likely to carry at least five of them in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. That would be enough for him to win the Electoral College 270-268.
Over all, somewhat more of these scenarios are likely to work for rather than against Republicans. That's because of the way Pennsylvania's congressional districts are drawn, and because Pennsylvania has historically been slightly Democratic-leaning relative to the rest of the country.
Still, the relative order of states shifts a little bit from election to election, and Pennsylvania is close enough to the razor's edge that it could flip from Democratic-leaning to Republican-leaning.
As recently as 1996, Pennsylvania was what I call the ''tipping-point state.'' Bill Clinton carried 21 states and the District of Columbia by wider margins than he did Pennsylvania, giving him 256 electoral votes. There were 28 states, meanwhile, totaling 259 electoral votes, that Bob Dole either won outright or lost by a smaller margin than Pennsylvania.
Neither figure is sufficient for a majority of the Electoral College -- so had the 1996 election been closer over all, Pennsylvania would have been the decisive state. Mr. Clinton could have won Pennsylvania but lost the Electoral College under the proposed rules. But the same is true for Mr. Dole.
Problem #2. The plan could undermine the integrity of the Electoral College, which is probably not in Republicans' long-term best interest.
Two states, Maine and Nebraska, already award some of their electoral votes by congressional district, although their votes had never actually been split before 2008, when Mr. Obama won Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District in Omaha to take 1 of the state's 5 electoral votes. This quirk hasn't led to the collapse of the Republic, or the Electoral College.
But there are some important differences between these states and Pennsylvania. First and most obviously, they are much smaller, having 9 electoral votes between them, versus the 20 that could be affected by Pennsylvania's plan. And Maine and Nebraska are not usually swing states whereas Pennsylvania very much is, so their rules are exceedingly unlikely to change the winner of the election.
Second, the candidate winning the popular vote in Maine and Nebraska is guaranteed to also win a majority of its electors. Nebraska awards 2 electoral votes to the overall winner of the state, as well as 1 in each of its 3 congressional districts. But since it is mathematically impossible to win a state without winning at least one of its congressional districts, the worst that the statewide winner could do is 3 out of 5 votes total. In Maine, meanwhile, the winner of the state is guaranteed 3 of 4 electoral votes.
As we mentioned, that isn't the case in Pennsylvania. It's quite plausible that a candidate could win the popular vote there but lose most of its electoral votes.
Finally, the Pennsylvania plan is much more explicitly partisan. And because of the geography of the state, it would give redistricting and gerrymandering a much larger role in the outcome of presidential elections. (There isn't much worth gerrymandering in Maine or Nebraska.)
So for all practical purposes, this would represent a paradigm shift in the way that presidential elections are decided.
There's no reason that Republicans couldn't adopt a similar proposal in Wisconsin or Michigan, where they also have control of the state government.
There aren't any particularly good places for Democrats to retaliate this year. They control the state governments in places like Arkansas and West Virginia, but they are small states and might not allocate many electoral votes to Democrats no matter how they were split.
But if they swept the statehouse in Texas one year, or in Georgia, or Missouri, what would stop them from adopting the Pennsylvania plan if this were the new normal?
It would be one thing if all states adopted the same method, some of which could have advantages to the current approach, and which are sometimes favored by political scientists and good-government advocates.
But what you'd probably wind up with instead is a patchwork of procedures for awarding electoral votes: some states would retain the current winner-take-all method, but some would use the congressional district split. Some might divide their votes proportionately, or use other hybrid approaches. And the method could change each time that the state government changed hands.
It's perfectly Constitutional, for that matter, for states to award their electoral votes through the state legislature, as many states did in the early years of the Republic, without taking a popular vote at all. If Republicans want to all but guarantee that they win the presidency next year, there is nothing stopping them. They control the state governments in 21 states totaling 242 electoral votes. All they need to do is have their state legislatures pick Republican electors in those states, and then for their candidate to win by popular vote in Alaska, Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi and West Virginia, which would get him to 270 electoral votes.
That, of course, is an extreme and unlikely example. But the Pennsylvania play would undermine the integrity the Electoral College, which is already fairly unpopular.
Eight states and the District of Columbia, totaling 132 electoral votes, have signed on to a plan called the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, a proposal that would use a workaround to guarantee that the winner of the national popular vote would win the Electoral College once states totaling a majority of 270 electoral votes had committed to the plan. Such efforts would presumably gain steam if the Pennsylvania plan were adopted, as would proposals for changes to the Constitution.
And that's probably not in Republicans' best interest: the Electoral College will generally favor them.
Take the 50 states and the District and Columbia and divide them into three roughly-equal sized piles:
In the red pile go all of the states that John McCain carried, which currently have a total of 170 electoral votes.
Into the purple pile go states with 182 electoral votes: all states that voted for both parties at least once between 2000 and 2008, plus Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota, where the results are usually close.
The remaining 186 votes are in Democratic base states and go into the blue pile.
The blue states award a total of 4.1 electoral votes per million voters, based on turnout in 2008. The red states, by contrast, award 4.9 electors per million votes.
So Republicans get about 20 percent more Electoral College mileage out of their base states than Democrats do, relative to the number of votes cast. This reflects the fact that Republican states tend to have smaller populations, and the Electoral College slightly favors low-population states. (California has 66 times as many people as Wyoming, but awards ''only'' 18 times as many electoral votes.)
In any particular election, this advantage may flip. Our simulations in 2008 suggested that Barack Obama was more likely to lose the popular vote but win the Electoral College rather than the other way around, a reflection of the fact that his campaign over-performed in swing states because of its superior turnout operations.
Over the medium-to-long term, though, the Electoral College should increase the number of Republican presidents -- an advantage they would presumably want to keep rather than undermining the system.
Problem #3. The plan could motivate Democrats and lead to higher Democratic turnout both in Pennsylvania and nationally.
I don't entirely buy that President Obama has problems with his base -- his numbers are still pretty decent with most Democratic core voters. But they have eroded some, even among African-Americans. And even if these voters still support Mr. Obama, they may not turn out, or they may turn out but decline to devote their time and money to his campaign.
I can't think of many better ways to motivate these voters than to convince them that Republicans are trying to steal the election, and remind them of what happened in 2000, themes that will become prominent should the Pennsylvania plan come to pass.
Is the possibility of winning 10 or 12 extra electoral votes a good trade if the price, say, is motivating $100 million in additional donations to Mr. Obama and the D.N.C.? Or boosting Democratic turnout by 5 percent?
These effects are tricky to quantify. But considering that the Pennsylvania plan will help Republicans only under a relatively specific set of circumstances -- if the election is close over all, if Pennsylvania is close to the electoral tipping point, and if Mr. Obama rather than their candidate wins the state -- it's hard to know who gets the better of the deal.
Problem #4. The plan would significantly reduce Pennsylvania's influence in the election campaign.
The first three problems concerned the Republicans' broad self-interest in electing Republicans to the White House both in 2012 and in future years. But Republicans in Pennsylvania also have narrower and more parochial things to worry about.
If the Republican plan were adopted, its two statewide votes would still be worth going after, as might the electoral votes three or four of its congressional districts. The others would be foregone conclusions, heavily advantaging one or the other party, which would lose them only in the event of a national landslide.
Thus, Pennsylvania would effectively demote itself to something like New Mexico in the electoral pecking order -- a state with five or six swing votes rather than 20. That means fewer favors from Washington, fewer visits from the candidates, less of a windfall for the state's economy, and less face-time for its politicians.
Problem #5. The plan would probably become unpopular in the state over time, potentially costing some Republican office-holders their jobs.
That reduction in influence could also make Pennsylvania voters unhappy. Consider what happened in Colorado in 2004, when there was an initiative on the ballot to allocate the state's electoral votes proportionately.
Initially, the initiative had plurality support in the polls. Once opponents began to point out that it would vastly reduce Colorado's influence, however -- essentially, only 1 of its 9 electoral votes would be in play -- its support collapsed to the point that it was resoundingly defeated, 66-34, on Election Day.
The Pennsylvania and Colorado cases are not identical: Colorado's plan would have split its votes proportionately according to the popular vote rather than by congressional district.
The experience suggests, however, that opponents of the bill are likely to have the stronger case in the court of public opinion: the argument that Pennsylvania has been made less influential in determining the next president will tend to carry the day.
Since there is no ballot initiative to vote on in this case, voters might instead take their frustrations out on Republican politicians throughout the state.
Republicans control 112 of the 203 seats in the Pennsylvania State Assembly, with 102 votes being required to pass the bill. Republicans hold a 30-20 majority in the Pennsylvania State Senate, meanwhile, so would need to hold 26 of their members to pass it there.
My guess is that they will not be able to keep their coalition together: it's not clear if this plan is in their best interests. There are reasons why states have been loathe to tinker with the Electoral College despite having the latitude to do so.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Republican Calls for a More Honest Debate

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Four months after he decided against jumping into the Republican presidential race, Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana says that he has occasionally been frustrated by the discourse in the campaign and that the field could benefit from at least one more contender whose candidacy was rooted in a message of fiscal discipline.
Mr. Daniels said his party's candidates had a responsibility to conduct a ''more candid and honest'' conversation about the nation's financial burdens, particularly Social Security and Medicare. 
''Somebody else could still enter and have a competitive chance,'' Mr. Daniels said in a weekend interview. ''The candidate I could get instantly excited about is someone who is willing to level with the American people and assume they are prepared to listen to the mathematical facts and agree that whatever other disagreements we have aren't as important.''
Mr. Daniels, who is among the country's most respected Republican governors, has not chosen a favorite candidate in the party's nominating contest. He said the recent contentious exchanges over Social Security between the party's leading candidates, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas and former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, had not advanced the debate.
Mr. Perry has questioned the constitutionality of the program, which he has referred to as a ''Ponzi scheme'' and a ''monstrous lie.'' Mr. Romney has seized on those remarks as a main distinction between the two men, but he has devoted more time to criticizing Mr. Perry's statements than to outlining his own ideas for the program.
''I don't think any of this is very helpful,'' Mr. Daniels said. ''If there's a problem with 'Ponzi scheme,' it is that it's too frank, not that it's wrong. But by stopping there, he might be unnecessarily scaring people.''
The observations from Mr. Daniels come as he prepares this week to release a book, ''Keeping the Republic: Saving America by Trusting Americans.'' In the book, to be released Tuesday, he calls for a new Reconstruction period in the United States and proposes major changes to entitlement programs to help control the deficit and avert ''the most predictable crisis we'll ever face.''
He outlines in stark terms what he views as the nation's precarious economic condition, suggesting that Democrats and Republicans alike have failed to adequately prepare for a new ''Red menace'' facing the United States.
''It's quite possible that some Republican could win next year by just being not the president, but then what?'' Mr. Daniels said. ''They should campaign to govern, not just win an election.''
Mr. Daniels, a two-term governor who served as the budget director for President George W. Bush, was heavily recruited by many Republicans to run for president. He openly pondered a candidacy for months, but announced in May that he had decided against running because his four daughters and wife were not in favor of the idea.
''It was a collision of the two priorities that I had in life, and one had to prevail,'' Mr. Daniels said. ''There's one statement I know of that a father has no reply: 'Daddy, please don't.' ''
He added, ''The only thing I probably could have done differently is simply seeing the writing on the wall and said no sooner.''
His decision to stay out of the race played a role in Mr. Perry's decision to announce his intentions last month. Mr. Daniels said the rise of Mr. Perry's candidacy suggested that it remained possible for another Republican candidate -- he declined to say who -- to still consider running for the party's nomination.
''He proved it wasn't too late -- I don't think it's too late yet,'' Mr. Daniels said, noting that he had ''tried to recruit three or four people.''
He added, ''In the wired world we're in, somebody new could get in.''

HEADLINE: Strauss-Kahn Concedes 'Error' in Sexual Encounter With Maid

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER and MAIA de la BAUME

 BODY:
PARIS -- Dominique Strauss-Kahn said Sunday that his sexual encounter with a New York City hotel chambermaid was ''an error'' and ''a moral failure'' he would regret his whole life, but not a criminal act.
In his first interview since his May 14 arrest on charges of attempted rape, Mr. Strauss-Kahn was uncomfortable, intermittently angry and sounded bitter, saying that he had wanted to run for the French presidency and had missed his ''appointment with the French people'' because of his own actions.
''I wanted to be a candidate. I thought I could be useful. All that is behind me,'' he said.
He accused the maid, Nafissatou Diallo, of lying about what happened between them, and accused a Paris novelist, Tristane Banon, of lying about what she said happened between them in 2003, which she has described as an attempted rape -- a case still being investigated by the Paris prosecutor. 
He called Ms. Banon's allegations ''imaginary and slanderous,'' although according to press reports in L'Express of his testimony to the police, he did admit to having made a pass at her and trying to kiss her. But he insisted Sunday that he did not, as she claimed, throw her to the ground, try to undress her and put his hand in her underwear.
''In this encounter, there was no act of aggression or violence,'' he said.
The interview on Sunday evening was carefully orchestrated and felt as if it had been almost rehearsed. Mr. Strauss-Kahn said what he wished, arranging to speak live to his wife's close friend, the anchor Claire Chazal on TF1, the most popular French channel. Ms. Chazal also looked uncomfortable, her arms crossed, and was not aggressive in her questioning.
Mr. Strauss-Kahn, 62, did not describe what happened with Ms. Diallo, except to insist that the encounter did not involve violence, constraint or aggression. But he appeared to have been shaken by what happened afterward, saying that he was ''afraid, very afraid'' in the days after his arrest, in which the New York police hauled him off an airplane just minutes before it was to take off for Paris on May 14. ''When you are caught in the jaws of this machine, you have the impression that it can crush you. I was humiliated before I could even say a word in my defense.''
In the end, the New York prosecutors decided not to bring a case against him, saying Ms. Diallo lacked credibility and had a history of fabrication.
Even as Mr. Strauss-Kahn admitted to his bad behavior, he did so with gritted teeth. The words were regretful but the tone was combative. The liaison with Ms. Diallo, who is suing him in a civil court in New York, ''was not only an inappropriate relationship, but more than that, it was an error,'' he said.
''I think it was a moral failing, and I'm not proud of it,'' he continued. ''It was a failing, a failing vis-a-vis my wife, my children and my friends, but also a failing vis-a-vis the French people, who had vested their hopes for change in me.''
He said: ''I am not proud of it. I regret it infinitely. I have regretted it every day for the past four months, and I think I'm not done regretting it.''
But he did not discuss, nor was he asked, about the presumably consensual sexual relationship the police have said he had the night before with another woman, caught on the hotel's video recorders.
And he gave vent to his anger with Ms. Diallo and his own theory that he might have been the victim of some plot to take advantage of his own moral failings. He said that he had not ruled out that the sexual act with Ms. Diallo and what followed ''could be a trap,'' he said. ''A plot? We'll see.'' He spoke angrily about Ms. Diallo, suggesting that she was after money and saying, without much explanation, that the role of money in the American judicial system was ''shocking.''
Mr. Strauss-Kahn, the former managing director of the International Monetary Fund, also commented on the continuing Greek financial crisis, for which emergency meetings were taking place on Sunday. He said that Greece's large debt, which has been the initial cause of the long-running euro crisis, should be sharply reduced. The problem is that European actions, he said, are ''too little, too late.'' As for Greece, he said, ''It's necessary to recognize that it's necessary to take the loss.'' The debt had to be reduced ''at any cost,'' he said, ''except at the cost of stagnation and recession.'' He said he did not think the euro was in peril, but the situation was very serious.
Now, he said, he would take time to reflect on his own future.
Mr. Strauss-Kahn's own love for luxury, including an expensive townhouse in Manhattan and a truffled pasta meal on his first night out of house arrest, had shocked many French, who do not like their Socialists to have too great a taste, at least in public, for lavish living. Mr. Strauss-Kahn's third wife, Anne Sinclair, is extremely rich and bankrolled her husband's bail and defense.
There was also criticism of the television station's agreement to do the interview with Ms. Chazal, who did not recuse herself. The station rejected the criticism and said it was simply interested in the news value of the interview.
''It was an extremely well-achieved communication exercise, with carefully chosen moments of repentance and emotions,'' said Christophe Barbier, a commentator and chief editor of the weekly magazine L'Express, after the interview.
Mr. Strauss-Kahn was not pushed very hard, he suggested, saying, ''We will never know now what happened in that hotel room.''
Ms. Diallo's French lawyer, Thibault de Montbrial, branded the interview ''a public relations exercise, without any spontaneity, neither in the questions nor the replies -- scripted down to each gesture.'' A columnist at the left-leaning newspaper Liberation, Jean Quatremer, spoke sarcastically of Mr. Strauss-Kahn's carefully modulated admissions. ''He has been perfect,'' Mr. Quatremer said. ''He sounded like someone who had committed a nine-minute, small adultery.''
There were demonstrators outside the TF1 building who shouted ''Shame on you!'' at Mr. Strauss-Kahn. Most of them were women, and some carried signs saying, ''When a woman says no, it's no!'' Another read: ''What's seduction for you?'' A feminist group called ''Le Barbe,'' or the beard, known for ironic protests and wearing false beards at demonstrations, had called for protests ''in support of the Great White Men and their virile traditions.''

HEADLINE: President's Plan on Deficit Mixes Cuts and Taxes

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER; Brian Knowlton contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama will unveil a deficit-reduction plan on Monday that uses entitlement cuts, tax increases and war savings to reduce government spending by more than $3 trillion over the next 10 years, administration officials said.
The plan, which Mr. Obama will lay out Monday morning at the White House, is the administration's opening move in sweeping negotiations on deficit reduction to be taken up by a joint House-Senate committee over the next two months. If a deal is not struck by Dec. 23, cuts could take effect automatically across government agencies. 
Mr. Obama will call for $1.5 trillion in tax increases, primarily on the wealthy, through a combination of closing loopholes and limiting the amount that high earners can deduct. The proposal also includes $580 billion in adjustments to health and entitlement programs, including $248 billion to Medicare and $72 billion to Medicaid. Administration officials said that the Medicare cuts would not come from an increase in the Medicare eligibility age.
Senior administration officials who briefed reporters on some of the details of Mr. Obama's proposal said that the plan also counts a savings of $1.1 trillion from the ending of the American combat mission in Iraq and the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan.
In laying out his proposal, aides said, Mr. Obama will expressly promise to veto any legislation that seeks to cut the deficit through spending cuts alone and does not include revenue increases in the form of tax increases on the wealthy.
That veto threat will put the president on a direct collision course with the House speaker, John A. Boehner, who said last week that he would not support any legislation that included revenue increases in the form of higher taxes.
Mr. Obama's proposal is certain to receive sharp criticism from Congressional Republicans, who on Sunday were already taking apart one element of the proposal that the administration let out early: the so-called Buffett Rule. The rule -- named for the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett, who has complained that he is taxed at a lower rate than his employees -- calls for a new minimum tax rate for individuals making more than $1 million a year to ensure that they pay at least the same percentage of their earnings as middle-income taxpayers.
That proposal, which was disclosed on Saturday, was met with derision Sunday by Republican lawmakers, who said it amounted to ''class warfare'' and a political tactic intended to portray his opponents as indifferent to the hardships facing middle-class Americans.
Representative Paul D. Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee and a leading proponent of cutting spending on benefit programs like Medicare, said the proposal would weigh heavily on a stagnating economy.
On ''Fox News Sunday,'' Mr. Ryan said it would add ''further instability to our system, more uncertainty, and it punishes job creation.''
''Class warfare,'' he said, ''may make for really good politics, but it makes for rotten economics.''
Administration officials said Sunday night that they were not including any revenue from the Buffett Rule in Mr. Obama's overall $3 trillion proposal, adding that it was more of a guiding principle the president will adopt as budget negotiations with Congress advance.
Mr. Obama has been citing Mr. Buffett as he promotes his separate $447 billion jobs-creation plan. He proposes to offset the cost of that plan and to reduce future budget deficits through higher taxes on the wealthy and on corporations after 2013, when the economy will presumably be healthier.
Nonetheless, Republicans made clear on Sunday that higher taxes on the wealthy were not acceptable to them. Appearing on the NBC program ''Meet the Press,'' Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said ''it's a bad thing to do in the middle of an economic downturn. And of course the economy, some would argue, is even worse now than it was when the president signed the extension of the current tax rates back in December.''
Under Mr. Obama's proposal, $800 billion of the $1.5 trillion in tax increases would come from allowing the Bush-era tax cuts to expire. The other $700 billion, aides said, would come from a combination of closing loopholes and limiting deductions among individuals making more than $200,000 a year and families making more than $250,000.
Mr. Obama's plan will hover over Congressional budget-cutting negotiations that are under way over the next two months. A bipartisan Congressional committee is charged with coming up with its own cuts by Dec. 23; otherwise $1.2 trillion in cuts to defense and entitlement programs will go into effect automatically in 2013.
Mr. Obama, however, is challenging the Congressional committee to go well beyond its mandate. ''He's showing them where they could find the savings,'' one administration official said.
Liberal-leaning organizations were rallying behind Mr. Obama's proposals on Sunday.
''The report that the president is planning to ask millionaires and billionaires to pay taxes at a higher rate than their secretaries pay is welcome news that will be wildly popular with voters,'' said Roger Hickey, co-director of the Campaign for America's Future, a progressive center, in a statement. ''We applaud the president for heeding the advice from progressives that he go big on his jobs plan.''
The Obama proposal has little chance of becoming law unless Republican lawmakers bend. But by focusing on the wealthiest Americans, the president is sharpening the contrast between Republicans and Democrats with a theme he can carry into his bid for re-election in 2012.
Mr. Obama's proposal is also an effort to reassure Democrats who had feared that he would agree to changes in programs like Medicare without forcing Republicans to compromise on taxes. Indeed, Mr. Hickey warned in his statement that the president should not raise the Medicare eligibility age, advice that Mr. Obama, so far, seems to have heeded.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 20, 2011

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Monday misstated the central fiscal goal of President Obama's newly proposed budget plan. The plan calls for reducing the budget deficit by $3 trillion over 10 years, half of it from tax increases and half from spending cuts. It would not cut spending by $3 trillion. The article also misstated the deadline by which a bipartisan Congressional committee must come up with its own cuts. It is Nov. 23, not Dec. 23.

HEADLINE: Glimpses Of Obama Among 'Friends'

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
CONFIDENCE MEN
Wall Street, Washington, and the Education of a President
By Ron Suskind
Illustrated. 515 pages. Harper. $29.99.
The portrait of the Obama White House that the veteran journalist Ron Suskind draws in his searing new book, ''Confidence Men,'' is that of a young, inexperienced president lacking the leadership and managerial skills to deal effectively with the cascading economic problems he inherited; a brainy but detached executive with a tendency to frame policy matters intellectually ''like a journalist, or narrator, or skilled observer''; an oddly passive C.E.O. whose directive on restructuring the banks in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis was, the author says, ignored or slow-walked by his own economic team. 
''Confidence Men,'' Mr. Suskind says, was based on interviews with more than 200 people, including former and current members of the Obama administration, as well as the president himself. Because the book essentially begins with Mr. Obama's crash course in economics as a candidate and ends in early 2011, Mr. Suskind does not place the mismanagement and indecisiveness he describes in these pages in perspective with the tough-minded decision by Mr. Obama to sign off on the high-risk mission that led to the killing of Osama bin Laden in May. Given the country's continuing economic woes, high unemployment and worries among Democrats about Mr. Obama's re-election prospects, the book makes for timely reading, though its truncated scope means that it does not deal with the debt ceiling fight or Mr. Obama's more recent efforts to address the jobs crisis.
The most withering assessments of Mr. Obama in this volume come from bickering former members of his economic team, a team that Richard Wolffe, the author of two books about Mr. Obama, has described as ''the most dysfunctional group of the president's advisers.'' Mr. Suskind quotes a former chairman of the National Economic Council under Mr. Obama, Lawrence H. Summers -- who is himself characterized by colleagues in these pages as a bullying know-it-all who acted as a kind of gatekeeper to the Oval Office on things economic -- as saying to the budget director, Peter Orszag: ''We're home alone. There's no adult in charge. Clinton would never have made these mistakes.''
Mr. Summers told The Washington Post in an e-mail on Friday that ''the hearsay attributed to me'' in the Suskind book ''is a combination of fiction, distortion, and words taken out of context.''
Also quoted in ''Confidence Men'' is Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman who headed the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board, who describes the president as both ''too self-confident'' and too reliant on Mr. Summers: ''Obama is smart, but smart is not enough. Leadership is another thing entirely, about knowing your mind enough to make real decisions, ones that last.''
As for how women fared within the White House, Christina D. Romer, the former chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, is quoted saying she ''felt like a piece of meat'' after being boxed out of a meeting by Mr. Summers. And the former communications director Anita Dunn is quoted saying the Obama White House ''fit all of the classic legal requirements for a genuinely hostile workplace to women.'' Questioned by reporters last week about these remarks, both women have said they were misquoted or that their comments had been misconstrued.
Given these denials, how is the reader to evaluate the accuracy of the accounts here? Why have so many people in the Obama administration vented to Mr. Suskind in the first place, when the president was only partway through his first term? Like many of Bob Woodward's sources a lot of them are motivated by spin, score settling and second-guessing. Given the stalled economy and the president's sliding poll numbers, some former staff members are playing the blame game early, while others seem to be hoping to goad the president into a reboot and a more aggressive stance before the 2012 election.
Mr. Suskind -- a Pulitzer Prize winner and former reporter at The Wall Street Journal -- has a flair for taking material he's harvested to create narratives with a novelistic sense of drama. With Mr. Obama, who is depicted here as having lost the thread of his own story line, Mr. Suskind supplies a story line of his own: that of ''a brilliant amateur'' whose early tenure in office was marked by drift, hesitancy and an inability ''to translate his will into policy on the occasions when he could decide on a coherent path.''
Mr. Obama emerges in this volume as an oddly passive chief executive whose modus operandi was to sketch out overarching principles, ''wait until others had painted in those outlines with hard proposals'' and then ''step down from his above-the-fray perch to close the deal.'' In ''Confidence Men'' Mr. Suskind suggests that this approach ceded oversight of the hard details of policy to others (Congress in the case of health care; the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, and his deputies in the case of fiscal reform), leading to a loss of control and momentum.
Mr. Suskind also questions the president's ''growing inclination to seek consensus'' in contentious policy debates among his advisers (much like his inclination to seek consensus with hostile Republicans in Congress). ''The administration's domestic policy was fast becoming a debate society run by Larry Summers,'' Ms. Suskind writes. ''Obama would sit on high, trying to judge if there was any shared ground between the competing debate teams that might coalesce into a policy.'' Mr. Suskind asks whether this was ''a model for sound decision making, a crutch to delay, or avoid, the decisions only a president can make, or a recipe for producing half-measures -- a pinch of this matched with a scoop of that -- masquerading as solutions.''
Some of the points Mr. Suskind makes in this book about internal White House dynamics will be familiar to readers of Jonathan Alter's 2010 book, ''The Promise: President Obama, Year One.'' Many of his negative assessments of the administration's handling of the economy and fiscal reform also echo arguments set forth by the economist Joseph E. Stiglitz in ''Freefall: America, Free Markets, and the Sinking of the World Economy,'' and by the journalist Michael Hirsh in ''Capital Offense: How Washington's Wise Men Turned America's Future Over to Wall Street.''
Like these authors Mr. Suskind suggests that the administration's problems in dealing with the fiscal crisis began with the president's choice of his economic team. He wonders why Mr. Obama turned away from the advisers who had seen him through the campaign (including more progressive thinkers like Mr. Stiglitz, Robert Reich and Austan Goolsbee), and relied instead on two men associated with the deregulatory policies of the past, Mr. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, and Mr. Summers, the chief economic adviser. Both men had served in the Clinton administration (with Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, who would later join Citigroup as a senior adviser and board member); their actions, Mr. Suskind contends, ''had contributed to the very financial disaster they were hired to solve.''
As Mr. Suskind tells it, Mr. Obama's bold promises as a candidate to implement a broad swath of new regulations to monitor Wall Street gave way to Mr. Geithner's philosophy, described here as ''first, do no harm,'' a philosophy, Mr. Volcker says, that ''always sounds reasonable'' in that it calls for delay until matters worsen to the point ''where there'll be consensus that we need to act in a forceful way.'' But, Mr. Volcker says, ''you never get that consensus, because so many of the actors, the institutions and so forth, will follow their own self-interest right off a cliff.''
In what will be one of the more talked-about passages in this book -- already disputed in the news -- Mr. Suskind contends that Mr. Obama did decide in early 2009 that a plan should be pulled together ''to restructure many of the large, troubled banks starting with Citigroup,'' but that he discovered nearly a month later that this directive ''had been ignored by the Treasury.''
Mr. Suskind characterizes this incident as indicative of the president's authority ''being systematically undermined or hedged by his seasoned advisers,'' ''a matter perilously close to insubordination.'' He writes that when he asked Mr. Obama about the bank incident, the president replied that while the bureaucracy's speed in executing his decisions was ''slower than I wanted,'' it's ''not clear to me that that was necessarily because of a management problem, as it was that this is really hard stuff.''
Mr. Geithner -- whom one top banker quoted in these pages refers to as ''our man in Washington'' for helping avert more systemic changes affecting Wall Street -- denies that he obstructed or slow-walked any presidential directive; the White House pressed him to stay on as Treasury secretary and he agreed this summer.
Regarding Mr. Obama's determination to make health care reform one of his first priorities, Mr. Suskind says that many of the president's aides worried that it would overextend an administration that was already facing two other huge tasks: steadying an economy still shaky from the catastrophic 2008 Wall Street meltdown and instituting financial regulatory reform (to ensure that a similar meltdown would not occur again). Mr. Suskind argues that the health care package that eventually passed -- after months of bitter wrangling that further polarized the country -- would be a watered-down version that did not really reform the medical delivery system or rein in costs through government-forced efficiencies as much as its proponents had hoped.
The former chief of staff Rahm Emanuel once observed, ''You never want a serious crisis to go to waste.'' In Mr. Suskind's opinion Mr. Obama failed to use the sense of urgency that surrounded the economy when he took office in early 2009 (not to mention his leverage as a popular new president) to extract concessions from bankers and health care providers, thereby squandering two huge opportunities: substantially to drive down the ever-ballooning costs of health care and to grapple with the systemic problems that afflicted Wall Street and fueled the fiscal meltdown, including too much leverage, ''too big to fail'' institutions, sky-high executive compensation, and dangerous and poorly understood derivatives.
By summer, Mr. Suskind writes, ''fear had gone from both groups'': when members of ''these two largest and most powerful interest groups, each at the center of the two great tests of the Obama presidency,'' saw the president ''up close, and poked at him a bit, they found he exhibited certain human frailties that might be easily exploited. What they also saw -- many of them managers in banking and health care with long experience -- were that his words were not being translated into action.''
The president's own assessment of his first two years in office? Mr. Suskind says Mr. Obama told him that he, along with Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, shared ''the disease of being policy wonks,'' that he had been ''very comfortable with a technocratic approach to government,'' and that he needed to focus on the bigger picture. ''Going forward as president,'' he said in the February 2011 interview, ''the symbols and gestures -- what people are seeing coming out of this office -- are at least as important as the policies we put forward.''

HEADLINE: The Bleeding Cure

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Doctors used to believe that by draining a patient's blood they could purge the evil ''humors'' that were thought to cause disease. In reality, of course, all their bloodletting did was make the patient weaker, and more likely to succumb.
Fortunately, physicians no longer believe that bleeding the sick will make them healthy. Unfortunately, many of the makers of economic policy still do. And economic bloodletting isn't just inflicting vast pain; it's starting to undermine our long-run growth prospects. 
Some background: For the past year and a half, policy discourse in both Europe and the United States has been dominated by calls for fiscal austerity. By slashing spending and reducing deficits, we were told, nations could restore confidence and drive economic revival.
And the austerity has been real. In Europe, troubled nations like Greece and Ireland have imposed savage cuts, even as stronger nations have imposed milder austerity programs of their own. In the United States, the modest federal stimulus of 2009 has faded out, while state and local governments have slashed their budgets, so that over all we've had a de facto move toward austerity not so different from Europe's.
Strange to say, however, confidence hasn't surged. Somehow, businesses and consumers seem much more concerned about the lack of customers and jobs, respectively, than they are reassured by the fiscal righteousness of their governments. And growth seems to be stalling, while unemployment remains disastrously high on both sides of the Atlantic.
But, say apologists for the bad results so far, shouldn't we be focused on the long run rather than short-run pain? Actually, no: the economy needs real help now, not hypothetical payoffs a decade from now. In any case, evidence is starting to emerge that the economy's ''short run'' troubles -- now in their fourth year, and being made worse by the focus on austerity -- are taking a toll on its long-run prospects as well.
Consider, in particular, what is happening to America's manufacturing base. In normal times manufacturing capacity rises 2 or 3 percent every year. But faced with a persistently weak economy, industry has been reducing, not increasing, its productive capacity. At this point, according to Federal Reserve estimates, manufacturing capacity is almost 5 percent lower than it was in December 2007.
What this means is that if and when a real recovery finally gets going, the economy will run into capacity constraints and production bottlenecks much sooner than it should. That is, the weak economy, which is partly the result of budget-cutting, is hurting the future as well as the present.
Furthermore, the decline in manufacturing capacity is probably only the beginning of the bad news. Similar cuts in capacity will probably take place in the service sector -- indeed, they may already be taking place. And with long-term unemployment at its highest level since the Great Depression, there is a real risk that many of the unemployed will come to be seen as unemployable.
Oh, and the brunt of those cuts in public spending is falling on education. Somehow, laying off hundreds of thousands of schoolteachers doesn't seem like a good way to win the future.
In fact, when you combine the growing evidence that fiscal austerity is reducing our future prospects with the very low interest rates on U.S. government debt, it's hard to avoid a startling conclusion: budget austerity may well be counterproductive even from a purely fiscal point of view, because lower future growth means lower tax receipts.
What should be happening? The answer is that we need a major push to get the economy moving, not at some future date, but right now. For the time being we need more, not less, government spending, supported by aggressively expansionary policies from the Federal Reserve and its counterparts abroad. And it's not just pointy-headed economists saying this; business leaders like Google's Eric Schmidt are saying the same thing, and the bond market, by buying U.S. debt at such low interest rates, is in effect pleading for a more expansionary policy.
And to be fair, some policy players seem to get it. President Obama's new jobs plan is a step in the right direction, while some board members of the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England -- though not, sad to say, the European Central Bank -- have been calling for much more growth-oriented policies.
What we really need, however, is to convince a substantial number of people with political power or influence that they've spent the last year and a half going in exactly the wrong direction, and that they need to make a U-turn.
It's not going to be easy. But until that U-turn happens, the bleeding -- which is making our economy weaker now, and undermining its future at the same time -- will continue.
