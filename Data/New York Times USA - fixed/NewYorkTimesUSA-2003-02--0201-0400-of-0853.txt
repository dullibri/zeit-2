Powell's Performance Earns Mixed Reviews

 BODY:
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's speech to the Security Council on Iraq was well received abroad, but did it change any minds? Following is a sampling of opinions from selected European newspapers.

Le Monde
France
 We were waiting for the "day of evidence," but it ended up being the "day of reiterated suspicions." On the arguments that he chose -- arms, the link with Al Qaeda -- Mr. Powell expressed possibilities, not factual reality. We remain in doubt. Are suspicions enough to go to war? To that question, a majority of the Council answered "no," and suggested giving the inspectors time to confirm or debunk those suspicions. 

Suddeutsche Zeitung
Germany
Powell's speech should come as a wake-up call for the European members of the Security Council, for the nonpermanent members Germany and Spain as well as the veto powers France and Great Britain. Their differences of opinion have, in recent weeks, only helped the hawks at the Pentagon.

Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung
Germany
The performance was undeniably brilliant. In doing so, the American secretary of state turned the Security Council into a kind of world court; he himself played the role of the prosecution. What was so impressive in the evidence was not its multimedia effects, but its breadth.

The Independent
Britain
In closing, General Powell asked the international community to understand that, in the light of all that we know about Saddam and all the intelligence that the secretary of state shared with the U.N., the United States government could not "run the risk" of allowing Saddam to remain in power. In turn, General Powell and the Bush administration must understand that much of the rest of the world is not ready to countenance the even more terrible risks involved in a war. 
The policy of containment and sanctions, pursued for 12 years, has been frustrating and messy; but it has constrained Saddam. General Powell did not tell us why we must abandon it.

The Times
Britain
Colin Powell's 75-minute speech to the Security Council yesterday was a withering riposte to Iraq's taunt that the U.S. has no proof that it has hidden, and continues to hide, illicit weapons of enormous destructive power. 
Containment has failed to prevent him building and hiding weapons that, he must be assumed to believe, would make him ultimately impossible to restrain. Even if it ultimately takes war, he must be stopped.

La Repubblica
Italy
In the temple of the United Nations, enclosed in the same tension that shrouded Adlai Stevenson with his photos of Cuba and an imminent nuclear war on the world, Colin Powell had in front of him the most important speech of his life, and maybe ours. He had to respond to three challenges.
The first was a personal challenge, the last test for the son of a Jamaican immigrant, in front of the cynical doctors of the world. The second was political, against internal enemies who accuse him of being too reasonable. The third challenge, and the most urgent, was to persuade an always more skeptical world of the necessity to combat Iraq.
After an hourlong speech broadcast live around the world, and after listening to the response of the French, Russians, Germans and Chinese, it's permissible to say that that he magnificently passed the personal test, shook every suspicion of a double game between hawks and doves, but his evidence convinced those who already were convinced, without really converting the skeptics.

Vremya Novostei
Russia
Powell was eloquent but not entirely convincing. Even the presence of the C.I.A. director, George J. Tenet, sitting nearby, did not help. U.S. intelligence might have been reluctant to make all information it had available to the U.N. Security Council and therefore to the rest of the world, for fear of "exposing methods and sources." But arguments for the military operation code-named Shock and Quiver seem weak at first sight.

El Mundo
Spain
If Powell and Bush are serious in their search for international support, they must set aside their threats to act alone and accept an extension to the inspectors' mandate. And also to try to seek consensus for a second U.N. resolution that would further tighten the screws on Saddam, but which could not be a blank check for an invasion.
But the crucial point of yesterday's Security Council meeting is the confirmation that there are good reasons for keeping up the international pressure on the Iraqi dictator, and even approve new economic and diplomatic sanctions against him, but that there is still no clear justification for war. There are many more reasons to intervene urgently against North Korea, which yesterday announced it was reopening a nuclear plant where it could make material for an atomic bomb.

HEADLINE: McGreevey Mingles and Asks, 'Too Much Pain?' 

BYLINE:  By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: HAMILTON, N.J., Feb. 6 

 BODY:
Gov. James E. McGreevey took his new $23.7 billion austerity budget on the road today, listening to the concerns of hand-picked citizens and deflecting complaints by saying that dire economic times left no room for generosity.
 In visits to two diners, it was doubtful that the governor would hear any arguments against the proposed spending cuts and tax and fee increases that he had not heard over the last few weeks in Trenton as he carefully prepared various interest groups for his tight budget. 
 But the day did give him a chance to do what he likes most: mingle with ordinary people, away from the State House but not from the television cameras, and deploying facts and figures to blame the national economy, the government in Washington and his Republican predecessors in Trenton for the state's budget problems. 
Some critics have suggested that the governor is making pain the main point of his budget message in order to create public pressure for broad new taxes he has promised not to impose.
At the Golden Dawn Diner here, he certainly seemed to want to hear about the bad news.
"Just your sense, your thoughts, your ideas," he urged a group of 16 residents invited for lunch. "Too much pain?"
Jackie Taylor, who works with the elderly in Hamilton, said she hoped there would be no layoffs. Hamilton is a mostly blue-collar suburb that is home to many government workers, and The Trentonian, the capital region's tabloid daily, summed up its budget coverage for them under the giant headline, "You're Fired!"
The governor told Ms. Taylor that reductions in income taxes and capital gains revenues would force the state to shed workers, although he has said the needed 1,000 positions may be cut through attrition.
The governor's guests were picked from among community leaders -- sports coaches, union officials, small-business people and those who had written in to the governor on various topics. They were generally receptive to Mr. McGreevey's smiling intensity as he remembered first names, ate Ms. Taylor's French fries, said "bless you" to sneezers, directed waitresses to wrap up unfinished portions and displayed his grasp of the minutiae of state government.
Andy Hauman, a retired state trooper, did not seem to be in a mood to be charmed when he warned that the governor's proposed 40-cents-a-pack cigarette-tax increase would create so much smuggling that the forecast revenues would not appear.
The governor interrupted. Was Mr. Hauman a smoker? Yes, Mr. Hauman growled.
"Then maybe you'll stop!" the governor shot back brightly, looking around the table for approval.
Mr. Hauman frowned. "No, that's not my interest. On the revenues ----" 
"No, seriously," the governor interrupted again, "the revenue will go up. As a matter of convenience, the people will still purchase locally."
Mr. McGreevey's first stop was for breakfast in Cherry Hill. When he arrived at the Golden Dawn for his second stop, two dozen doctors were waiting to pounce on him over the high costs of malpractice insurance. He said a bill to help doctors pay unusually high jury awards would be ready in 10 days, but the doctors want limits on those awards.
After about an hour, when the governor had used the term "tough decisions" nine times and likened state budgets to family budgets four times, the Rev. Derrell Armstrong, the young new pastor at Shiloh Baptist Church in Trenton, warned him against spending too much time blaming others for the state's budget problems.
"As a pastor of this state, I would say don't get dragged down into a blame game," Mr. Armstrong said. "We all know how we got here. You just push us to where we have to go."
Mr. McGreevey nodded gravely and said, "Thank you for sharing."

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
Beyond Stilettos, Bringing a Harsher Reality to Life

BYLINE:  By ROBIN FINN 

 BODY:
YOGA prowess aside, there is not much common ground between the glossy life experience enjoyed by Kristin Davis, instantly recognizable as Charlotte York, the ingenuous component of that gals-on-the-prowl quartet in HBO's "Sex and the City," and the egregious life experience endured by Sunny Jacobs, the death-row inmate Ms. Davis now portrays nightly downtown in the play "The Exonerated."
 Ms. Davis, whose disposition, coincidentally, is darned sunny, lives solo in an elegant Central Park West apartment when not at home with her golden retriever, Callie, in the hills above Los Angeles. Her closet contains designer everything. Her hallway displays a gigantic, signed Hirschfeld caricature of the "Sex and the City" cast and a commissioned portrait of Callie. At 6 p.m., a chauffeur drives her to work. Her food comes in little black boxes, custom made for the Zone diet. She does yoga to unwind. 
 Sunny went to prison in Florida in 1976 for 16 years, 7 of them spent in solitary confinement, after being falsely convicted, with her husband, of shooting two police officers. He was electrocuted for the crime. Wrenched away from her two young children, she was exonerated in 1992, more than a decade after another man confessed to the killings. She taught herself yoga in prison and now teaches it to others. 
"The Exonerated," a slice-of-life wallop of documentary theater presented by the Culture Project at the 45 Bleecker Theater, uses a revolving cast of celebrity actors to dramatize the incarceration of six victims of an American justice system gone awry. Ms. Davis's turn at a role previously inhabited by Jill Clayburgh and Mia Farrow came this week. 
"Terrifying -- I was afraid I'd bring the whole play down," chirps Ms. Davis, more vivacious than va-voom. But she's already plotting another Sunny stint after this one concludes on Feb. 9. "The Exonerated," she says, hooks you in. More mind-boggling than those orgasms the "Sex and the City" girls are forever chattering about? Much.
"It's so intimidating to read people's real words, and you kind of want to try to live up to it and do justice to them, if that's even possible for an actor to do," she says, her brown eyes gone wide from the effort of communicating the connection she has come to feel to Ms. Jacobs after reading a rash of court transcripts. 
"The message of the play, and I hope I don't cry as I say this, is that it takes a lot to be alive, and to be open," says Ms. Davis, 37, striking a sober pose on her living room sofa. "It's not a downer about capital punishment. Really, it's about a joyous kind of overcoming of the odds; the people in the play went through an unthinkable experience and have grown from it." 
After Sunny, Ms. Davis becomes Charlotte again for the sixth, and final, season of "Sex and the City," the female empowerment phenomenon that landed its cast on the cover of Time. Quite the validation for the girl from Columbia, S.C., who set off for Los Angeles behind the wheel of her granddad's tacky Chrysler K-car in 1991 with $5,000 in seed money and only a bunch of commercials, plus a role on the soap opera "Ryan's Hope," on her resume.
MILDLY unsettling for Ms. Davis is that there are just 20 episodes of "Sex and the City" between her and unemployment, the netherworld where she spent seven months after her breakthrough role on "Melrose Place" ended in 1996 when the conniver she played was killed off. Ms. Davis was not terribly sorry. Though she found an exemplar in Heather Locklear, she felt uncomfortable playing such a hateful character.
"Heather was the first really famous person I'd ever been around -- she didn't take her fame that seriously, but took the job seriously: always on time, never left early, gracious to her fans," says Ms. Davis. "A good professional influence." 
After "Melrose," her agent told her to hold out for something different; it arrived in a two-episode appearance on "Seinfeld." The comedic skills her Rutgers University drama mentor, Bill Esper, spent years convincing her she possessed attracted notice. She was invited to audition for the Carrie Bradshaw role in "Sex and the City" by the show's creator, Darren Star, who hired her for "Melrose." She said no: Carrie did too much smoking, drinking, cursing and breast-baring.
"I knew it wasn't me, and that even if I did get the part, I would be bad at it," she says. She asked Mr. Star for the Charlotte role, and after a daunting audition, got it, with a twist. The producers sprang a little surprise -- they had decided to downsize Charlotte to a recurring guest spot. Ms. Davis took it on anyway, and quietly turned Charlotte back to a full-time player. 
She says her L.A. management team was concerned about her playing her actual age. "But I thought it was a miracle! I was happy to finally be on a show where you don't have to pretend to be younger than you are, or stupider."
Born in Boulder, Colo., she was 9 when her family moved to Columbia, where both parents work at the University of South Carolina. Her father, a psychology professor, occasionally uses clips from "Sex and the City" in a human sexuality class. The clips tend to feature Samantha, the sexpot played by Kim Cattrall. Ms. Davis's mother avoids the racier episodes, and while her grandmother, who died at 93 a few years back, was living with her parents, they didn't subscribe to HBO at all: too hot for grandma to handle.
Ms. Davis didn't quibble.

Steady Hand Steers I.O.C.'s Sometimes Rocky Course

BYLINE:  By GEORGE VECSEY 

DATELINE: LAUSANNE, Switzerland, Feb. 6 

 BODY:
Dr. Jacques Rogge finished his previous career on July 7, 2001.
 "The patient is doing quite well, thank you," said Rogge, who used to be an orthopedic surgeon in Belgium and is now the president of the International Olympic Committee. 
 He now gets to deal with the United States Olympic Committee, which has revived sheer amateurism -- in corporate management, unfortunately. 
Rogge cautioned today that ongoing instability could hurt New York City's bid for the 2012 Summer Games, but that the picture could change in the two years before that decision will be made.
Rogge also has to worry about impending war. And he has to lop budgets and maybe even a few counterproductive sports. He does not pretend that they compare to knee surgery.
"I felt far more responsibility performing surgery than I would with the I.O.C.," he said in an interview in his office at I.O.C. headquarters overlooking Lake Leman. "You are dealing with people's ambitions, dreams, happiness, but not with their lives." 
Besides, he put in his time in his 27 years as a physician -- "seven days a week, 15 hours a day, 49 or 50 weeks a year," said Rogge, a young-looking 60 who is a former Olympic sailor and rugby player.
"If you are a violinist or a pianist, maybe you keep going, you are not hurting anyone," he said. "I could have continued, but I am not missing it. This is a fantastic job."
He made his remarks almost exactly a year after the Winter Games in Salt Lake City, the first Games on his watch. His job is going to be quite different from that of his predecessor, Juan Antonio Samaranch, who served from 1980 through 2001. 
"Samaranch was able to bottom-feed," said David D'Alessandro, the president of John Hancock Financial Services, a major sponsor of the I.O.C. D'Alessandro meant that television and sponsor money was so low that better offers practically jumped into the I.O.C. boat two decades ago. 
Now the world economy is sluggish and there are fears of an American incursion into Iraq.
"The looming war has an impact that we see in the world of sport," Rogge said pensively. "Companies do not invest. They don't know what the future will hold. The I.O.C. does have long-term agreements," he added, but national and sporting federations are directly affected. 
"Thank God, there are no problems between countries" that affect the I.O.C. at this time, he said.
Any outbreak of war could delay a new television contract, said Rogge, who had talked of negotiating later this year. NBC's contract is up after 2008, and American sponsorship and television money are vital to the Olympic movement.
"The U.S. has held the most Games, it has won the most medals in the summer and is second in medals in the winter," Rogge said. "It generates the most money, but it also receives the most money. The U.S. has received over $1 billion in the last 20 years."
Rogge could very well ask why Lausanne is shipping all that money to Colorado Springs, just to watch paid executives and volunteer executives perform Olympian pratfalls and back stabbings.
In the latest episode, Marty Mankamyer resigned as president of the U.S.O.C. on Tuesday after being savaged by board members. The paid chief executive, Lloyd Ward, who committed a flagrant conflict of interest by trying to insert his brother's business into Olympic business, was only mildly rebuked and is hanging on to his job. Things happen fast in the U.S.O.C., however.
"It is worrying," Rogge said. "There are so many good people, but the system does not work as it should. I can express my wish for more stability."
Asked to offer a concrete proposal for change at the U.S.O.C., Rogge declined, but he did show a sense of how things work in the United States.
"You don't have a minister of sport," he said. "There is no subsidy policy. You are based on free enterprise. This will not lead to government controls. Bureaucracy does not belong to your country. That is absolutely un-American, if I may say so."
The aging Samaranch was hauled to Washington late in his regime to testify (however vaguely) before Congress. Rogge does not seem worried about Senator John McCain, the Republican from Arizona, who was born to hound the U.S.O.C. bunglers. 
Rogge praised many cities that may bid for the 2012 Summer Games, noting that Paris, London, Moscow, Madrid, four cities in Germany, Rio de Janeiro or Sao Paolo and New York "do not have to be put on the map."
His visitor, a lifelong New Yorker, expressed the fervent hope that the Games would be assigned to some other burg, rather than test the eccentric geography, politics and economics of New York. 
Rogge said politely that the Summer Games generally left behind long-term improvements, citing Barcelona from 1992. He also predicted that Athens, the 2004 host, would profit from the modernizations.
In the meantime, Rogge said his first year went well, particularly when seven athletes were busted at Salt Lake City for performance-enhancing drugs, which stemmed from upgraded testing. 
But he did express one regret from his first Games: rushing to award duplicate gold medals to the Canadian skaters after hearing charges of pressure from the woman known forever as the French Judge.
"I wanted to make it right for the athletes, but I should have been more proactive," Rogge said, meaning that he should have consulted Russian officials first, to insist his action did not cheapen the gold medals awarded to the Russian pair. 
"I admit my errors," Rogge said.
His forthright attitude seemed to match D'Alessandro's assessment of Rogge: "He's a quick study -- deceptively smart about numbers and people. Sometimes when I'm talking to him, I think he's looking right at my forehead to see what's in there. He works on three, four tracks at the same time."
Rogge said he was pleased with new ethics codes instituted to avoid embarrassments like the bribery scandal that helped Salt Lake City win its bid. He is working on making the I.O.C. more active as a franchiser of the Games and less dependent on organizing committees that start from scratch every two years.
He is also trying to control the growth of the Games. At a meeting in Mexico City last fall, the I.O.C. did not act on trimming sports like baseball, women's softball or the modern pentathlon.
He noted that television ratings in the United States for Olympic baseball were abysmal in 2000 because minor leaguers represented the United States. He said he was sure that Bud Selig, the commissioner of Major League Baseball, and Donald Fehr, the head of the players association, would agree on providing major league stars in the future.
It is early in Rogge's second career. Let it be noted that getting Selig and Fehr to work together on anything could be worth the Nobel Peace Prize that Samaranch never quite achieved.

HEADLINE: Different Man, Different Moment 

BYLINE:  By Adlai E. Stevenson III; Adlai E. Stevenson III is a former United States senator from Illinois.

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
Pundits and officials in Washington have dubbed Secretary of State Colin Powell's attempt to make a case for war against Iraq in the United Nations Security Council an "Adlai Stevenson moment." 
 I couldn't disagree more. My father was Adlai Stevenson, who in 1962, as President Kennedy's representative to the United Nations, presented the Security Council with incontrovertible proof that the Soviet Union, a nuclear superpower, was installing missiles in Cuba and threatening to upset the world's "balance of terror." 
 That "moment" had an obvious purpose: containing the Soviet Union and maintaining peace. It worked, and eventually the Soviet Union collapsed under its own weight. This moment has a different purpose: war. The Bush administration clearly rejects the idea of containing Iraq through committed monitoring by the United Nations, even though this course is the better option. 
With so much comparison between Secretary Powell and my father, I've been trying to think back to the days leading up to my father's famous moment. While his appearance became the stuff of historical legend, he rarely talked about it with his family. One weekend, he merely announced that he had to go to Washington because something important had come up. (President Kennedy, we learned later, was giving him his marching orders.) There was no visible worry or excitement. Maybe he was saving up for his moment. 
After all, his entire adult life had been defined by seeing to it that the Soviet threat was contained -- preventing it from erupting into war. My father, President Kennedy and others remembered the lessons learned from the assassination of the Austro-Hungarian archduke and his wife in 1914. Serbian nationalists behind the killings expected a reaction. But they did not expect to bring down the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Politically motivated terrorists are fanatics, not fools. Yet the empire delivered an ultimatum to Serbia, bringing on World War I and its own demise.
My father visited the military cemeteries in Europe as a young man. France lost a quarter of its men between the ages of 18 and 30 during World War I. He remembered Woodrow Wilson's efforts to create a world order that preserved the peace, and the hopes destroyed by the old guard in the Senate, which defeated that League of Nations.
Veterans of World War II, men like my father and Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy, went on to pick up where Wilson had failed. The old guard was defeated. The United Nations was established. A new world order contained the Soviet Union, controlled the strategic arms race and preserved peace. America was a real superpower then, its embassies the outposts of hope and security. 
Clearly, we live in a different world now. But would going to war truly make it a safer one? A contained Saddam Hussein would remain a pariah in the Middle East. A Saddam Hussein under attack would win sympathy on behalf of his long-suffering people and perhaps the support of terrorists inflamed by the mighty reach of the United States. A war could also set back Iraq's oil production and destabilize other oil-producing states. The economic consequences of war and reconstruction are incalculable; the federal budget is already plunging into deficit from surplus at the fastest rate in history, without even provision for war.
Why, then, the enthusiasm for war? Even top officials at the Central Intelligence Agency have acknowledged that Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction are only a threat if Iraq is attacked. And Iraq's government, after all, is the same Baathist regime aided by the Reagan administration when Baghdad used chemical weapons in its bloody war against Iran. If anything, Iraq was stronger and more dangerous then. (I first became acquainted with this regime in 1976 when its minions tore toenails from the feet of my driver, a Kurd, in Baghdad -- apparently for having been insufficiently forthcoming during a periodic interrogation). 
Many curious explanations are circulating for suddenly making this infamous regime a unilateral casus belli of the United States while North Korea -- which may take advantage of the administration's preoccupation with Iraq to develop more nuclear weapons -- is an object of relative indifference. Maybe the most plausible is Iraq's purported link to terrorism.
In 1978, I led the first in-depth Congressional study into the growing threat of terrorism and how to combat it. Such a threat reaches far back into history, beyond the label of terrorism. In 1962, President Kennedy read Barbara Tuchman's book "The Guns of August," a history of the unintended chain of consequences that led to the devastation of World War I. He wanted to avoid similar missteps. 
The Bush administration would benefit by the same lesson. Sept. 11 was not all that different from Sarajevo at the turn of the century. The 19 men armed with box cutters did not expect to bring down all of America. Only America can do that. They expected a reaction. The one they should get is to be treated as criminals, hunted down and brought to justice. Bringing war only confirms complaints that the United States is waging a war against Islam. It can also give terrorists the reaction they seek. 
Whether made by Al Qaeda or Saddam Hussein, today's threats require a multidimensional response, including efforts to address the widening gap between the haves and the have nots, the horrible conditions in which most people around the world struggle to survive. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a good place to begin. The United States loses credibility when perceived as supporting terror in one part of the Mideast, while professing to fight it elsewhere.
I like to think that if my father were in Secretary Powell's shoes, he would have presented proof of an aggressive deployment of weapons of mass destruction and evidence that Iraq was closer to obtaining nuclear arms -- a claim the administration made not so long ago. The Bush administration would have supported the United Nations, its inspectors and international containment of Iraq under Saddam Hussein. Members of the Security Council and other nations would not have to be cajoled into going along. The international community, for which this administration still presumes to speak, would support the United States, as it did in October, 1962, when America waged peace.

HEADLINE: Is the Maestro A Hack? 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
It's probably wishful thinking, but some people hope that the old Alan Greenspan -- the man we used to respect -- will make a return appearance next week. 
 During the Clinton years Mr. Greenspan became an icon of fiscal probity, constantly lecturing politicians on the importance of eliminating deficits and paying off debt. Then George W. Bush took office, and Mr. Greenspan became -- or was revealed as -- a different man. 
 First the Fed chairman lent decisive support to the Bush tax cut, urging Congress to reduce taxes lest the country run too large a budget surplus and pay off its debt too quickly. No, really.
Then when the budget plunged into deficit, Mr. Greenspan not only refused to reconsider, he supported plans to make the tax cut permanent. The stern headmaster had become an indulgent uncle.
But now the fiscal deterioration has reached catastrophic proportions. In its first budget, the Bush administration projected a 2004 surplus of $262 billion. In its second budget, released a year ago, it projected a $14 billion deficit for the same year. Now it projects a deficit of $307 billion. That's a deterioration of $570 billion, just for next year -- matched by comparable deterioration in each following year. You know, $570 billion here and $570 billion there, and pretty soon you're talking real money.
Not my fault, says Mr. Bush. "A recession and a war we did not choose have led to a return of deficits," he declared. Really? Will the recession and war cost $570 billion per year, every year? Besides, Mr. Bush knew all about the recession and Osama bin Laden (remember him?) a year ago, when his projections showed a return to surpluses by 2005. Now they show deficits forever -- even though they don't include the costs of an Iraq war.
Anyway, isn't a leader supposed to solve problems, not look for excuses? But Mr. Bush proposes to make the problem worse. Contrary to all previous practice, he wants to cut taxes even further in the face of "wartime" deficits. 
Although financial reporters have started to realize that Mr. Bush is out of control -- he has "lost his marbles," says CBS Market Watch -- the sheer banana-republic irresponsibility of his plans hasn't been widely appreciated. That $674 billion tax cut you've heard about literally isn't the half of it. Even according to its own lowball estimates, the administration wants $1.5 trillion in tax cuts over the next decade -- more than it pushed through in 2001. Another $575 billion or so will be needed to fix the alternative minimum tax -- something officials have said they'll do, but haven't put in the budget. 
The administration has used gimmicks to postpone most of the cost of these tax cuts until after 2008 -- and whaddya know, the Office of Management and Budget has suddenly stopped talking about 10-year projections and now officially looks only five years ahead. But there are long-term projections tucked away in the back of the budget; they're overoptimistic, but even so they suggest a fiscal disaster once the baby boomers start collecting benefits from Social Security and Medicare. ("We will not pass along our problems to other Congresses, other presidents, other generations," declared Mr. Bush in the State of the Union. And with a straight face, too.)
So where does Mr. Greenspan come in? Next week he will testify before the Senate Banking Committee. Will he, at long last, acknowledge the administration's fecklessness?
Mr. Greenspan must know that many people, whatever they say in public, now regard him as a partisan hack. That very much includes Republicans, who assume that he will support anything Mr. Bush proposes. What he does next week will determine whether that perception sticks.
He has certainly run out of excuses. As a famous fiscal scold, he can't adopt the administration's "deficits, schmeficits" approach. And he can't make the supply-side claim that tax cuts actually increase revenues, when just two years ago he argued for a tax cut to reduce the surplus. 
If Mr. Greenspan nonetheless finds ways to rationalize Mr. Bush's irresponsibility, or if he takes refuge in Delphic utterances that could mean anything or nothing, history will remember him as a man who urged hard choices on others, but refused to make hard choices himself. 
This may be Alan Greenspan's last chance to save his reputation -- and the country's solvency.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: NUCLEAR STANDOFF; 
Bush Administration Defends Its Approach on North Korea

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6 

 BODY:
The Bush administration warned North Korea today against trying to take advantage of the United States' focus on Iraq, saying it would maintain a robust military deterrent in the region even as it seeks a diplomatic solution to the impasse.
 On a day when North Korea said that a pre-emptive strike by the United States against its nuclear weapons facilities would lead to "total war," an array of senior administration officials argued that the standoff could be resolved peacefully and had not reached a state of crisis. 
 Democrats, sensing what they considered disarray in the administration's policy, sharply criticized the White House for spending too much time on Iraq, calling its strategy toward North Korea "fuzzy," "passive" and one of "designed neglect."
But in appearances on Capitol Hill and at the White House, senior administration officials asserted that they were fully engaged in resolving the Korean standoff. 
On Wednesday, in its latest step toward restarting nuclear weapons production, North Korea announced that it was resuming operations at a nuclear reactor that could produce weapons-grade plutonium. The North Koreans contend that the plant will provide only electricity, but the White House says it consumes as much power as it produces.
"No options have been taken off the table," Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said in testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this morning. "The options of sanctions, the option of additional political moves, no military option's been taken off the table, although we have no intention of attacking North Korea as a nation."
Responding to the North Korean threats of "total war," the White House spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said, "Obviously, the United States is very prepared with robust plans for any contingencies." 
But Mr. Fleischer insisted that President Bush remained convinced that diplomatic action in conjunction with China, Russia, Japan and South Korea could resolve the matter. Next week, the administration will urge the International Atomic Energy Agency to refer the issue to the United Nations Security Council.
North Korea's latest provocative actions seemed to be a response to the announcement earlier this week that the Pentagon had placed 24 long-range bombers on alert, to be available in the Pacific to deter "opportunism" by the North Koreans.
Officials in North Korea also appeared angry with a statement by Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld on Wednesday describing North Korea as a "terrorist regime" that is a threat to sell nuclear weapons technology or materials to terrorists and so-called rogue nations. 
Several senior administration officials said today that they considered Mr. Rumsfeld's remarks too harsh. But they said the administration wanted to send a clear message to North Korea not to make trouble while the United States is preparing for a possible war against Iraq.
At a forum on the crisis at The Washington Post, the deputy secretary of defense, Paul D. Wolfowitz, said: "We are dealing with an unpredictable regime and a regime that seems to be moving along a ladder of escalation in terms of its actions. It is a matter of some concern.
"But what Secretary Rumsfeld has done, in putting those bombers on alert, is simply to reinforce our deterrent posture, to make sure that North Korea doesn't do anything adventurous or dangerous of a military kind." 
Since late last year, North Korea has been taking increasingly provocative steps toward restarting a nuclear weapons program that it had pledged to freeze in a 1994 deal with the Clinton administration. In addition to expelling international atomic weapons inspectors it has moved spent nuclear fuel rods out of storage, American officials say. 
American officials believe that North Korea will next try to begin reprocessing those fuel rods into fissile material for bombs -- potentially enough to build half a dozen weapons within months.
A senior administration official said the United States had communicated to North Korea through other countries and through the North Korean mission at the United Nations that restarting plutonium reprocessing would be "a particularly bad step."
Asked how the United States might respond, the official said, "That's for us to know and them to find out."
Two Democratic presidential candidates, Senators John Kerry of Massachusetts and Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, both asserted that the administration should be more forceful in discouraging North Korea from reopening its plutonium reprocessing plant. They also called on the White House to begin direct talks with North Korea.
Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, scolded Mr. Bush for playing down the threat from North Korea and urged him to "immediately engage the North Koreans in direct talks." 
But administration officials stuck to their position that they would only talk to North Korea about dismantling its nuclear weapons programs, and would not discuss economic aid or security agreements until the dismantling had begun. 
"We're prepared to talk to them," Mr. Powell said. "But what we can't find ourselves in the position of doing is essentially panicking at their activities and their demands."

HEADLINE: Some Union Leaders Call Layoffs Bearable 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Creating a split among New York City's municipal unions, the leaders of three unions said yesterday that they would rather see city workers laid off than agree to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's demand for $600 million in givebacks.
 The leaders of the unions, representing 8,000 supervisors, 7,000 police detectives and 730 police captains, said layoffs would do less harm than granting concessions that they said would erode benefits won over four decades of collective bargaining. 
 Mayor Bloomberg has warned that he will lay off 12,000 city workers unless the unions agree to $600 million in concessions in areas including health benefits and vacation time. He has said he will not begin bargaining over any raises, which he said must be tied to productivity gains, until the unions agree to a $600 million concession package. 
Arthur Cheliotes, president of Local 1180 of the Communications Workers of America, which represents 8,000 supervisors and middle managers in many departments, said that faced with two undesirable options, he would choose layoffs over concessions. 
"The mayor may want to put it in terms of what are we willing to do to ransom our colleagues so they keep their jobs," Mr. Cheliotes said. "I don't like layoffs, but we can't afford to ask our members to give up anything more."
Tom Scotto, president of the Detectives' Endowment Association, agreed. "If as a very, very last resort the city says, 'We did everything else we could and have no other choice and you got to come up with additional hundreds of millions in benefit concessions or face the risk of layoffs,' " he said, "I'd say basic Labor 101, you take layoffs rather than give up benefits."
Labor experts said many union leaders, eager to stay in office, prefer some of their members laid off to enraging all of them by accepting concessions. Labor leaders also know the maxim of municipal bargaining: when layoffs occur, mayors usually get the blame, but when unions agree to concessions, union presidents get the blame.
Nonetheless, the leaders of several powerful municipal unions insisted that it would be fairer to accept concessions than to allow layoffs. They said concessions spread the pain, while layoffs throw needy workers overboard.
"We think every single person that has a job should maintain their job," said Lillian Roberts, executive director of District Council 37, the largest municipal union. "It's going to be hard for our people to support their families if they're laid off."
Al O'Leary, a spokesman for the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, which represents rank-and-file police officers, said the union disagreed with the captains' and lieutenants' unions. "Police services are so inextricably tied to the city's safety and economic recovery that there should be no discussion about reducing police resources or laying off police," Mr. O'Leary said.
It is unclear how this split within labor will affect the Bloomberg administration's negotiating stance and its ability to secure $600 million in concessions. For previous mayors, layoffs were generally unpopular because they cut into city services, while the public applauded mayors who secured concessions from labor, seeing it as strong leadership. Administration officials declined to discuss how the city's bargaining posture might be affected.
Jordan Barowitz, a City Hall spokesman, said: "We're pleased labor understands the dimensions of the city's fiscal problems. Everyone agrees the choices are difficult, and this is the beginning of a discussion."
Among the concessions proposed by the mayor are increasing employee co-payments for doctor visits, introducing a payroll deduction for basic health insurance and reducing the number of vacation days and holidays. Since the city has nearly 300,000 municipal workers, including teachers, the proposed $600 million in concessions would come to $2,000 per worker.
Randi Weingarten, chairwoman of the Municipal Labor Committee, which coordinates bargaining strategy for the city's unions, criticized the mayor's demand for concessions. "We feel they're asking for draconian givebacks," she said. "The things the city is asking will affect people in their pockets in a drastic way."
Ms. Weingarten, who is also president of the teachers' union, said it was too early to decide between layoffs and concessions. But she did not hide her dislike of layoffs.
"Economic security and job security are an important concern for my members," she said, "and layoffs also mean service cuts, so that should be an important concern for the public." 
Ms. Weingarten said most unions were willing to work with the city to generate savings through measures like productivity gains, retirement incentives and cutting back on highly paid consultants.
Many union leaders complained that it was unfair for the mayor to demand $600 million in concessions because city workers accepted a major concession -- a two-year wage freeze -- in the mid-1990's. Having pushed through an 18 percent property tax increase, Mr. Bloomberg has argued that city workers need to share in the sacrifices to eliminate the city's $3.4 billion budget deficit.
But John Driscoll, president of the Captains Endowment Association, warned that further benefit cuts could backfire. Noting that about 4,000 members of the police force retired or resigned last year, he said reducing police benefits would only accelerate this exodus.
"You're going to take a demoralized work force that doesn't think it makes enough now and then impose further cuts upon them," Mr. Driscoll said. "I don't want people to lose their jobs. But the bottom line is, you've got to make sure your people are making a salary they can live on."

HEADLINE: Deal to Give New York Flexibility In Using Aid 

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6 

 BODY:
The Bush administration has tentatively agreed to provide up to $980 million that New York City and state officials had counted on to help close multibillion dollar budget deficits, according to New York and federal officials involved in the negotiations.
 The agreement taking shape would give about $350 million to the state and about $630 million to the city, with fewer restrictions than normally govern such emergency aid. The money would be drawn from the federal funds that had been allocated in the aftermath of Sept. 11, 2001. 
 The proposal is highly unusual because it would break a federal precedent that had earmarked all the disaster relief allocated since the terrorist attacks for specific projects. 
Officials moved closer to an agreement in the last few days, after intense negotiations involving the White House's Office of Management and Budget; Representative James Walsh, a New York Republican on the House Appropriations Committee; Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York and aides to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki.
For months, city and state officials had been urging the Bush administration to loosen the rules governing the use of disaster aid, arguing that New York's economic slump stemmed in large part from the attack on Lower Manhattan.
But the White House balked at that request. Administration officials were wary of establishing a precedent that other localities could invoke in the future to demand emergency aid for other purposes, like offsetting revenue losses arising from disasters, according to New York lawmakers and one administration official.
In the end, the Bush administration relented, partly because the disaster in New York was unprecedented and partly because the scope of the damage to New York's economy has only recently come into sharper focus, officials involved in the discussions said.
"This is a situation where the city, the state and the Congressional delegation should have the flexibility to respond to 9/11 in the best way for their citizens," said a senior administration official. "We support it."
The city has identified $650 million in lost tax revenue that it directly attributes to the terrorist attack.
"The real kicker here is that the city and state can use this money to deal with their severe budget deficit problems," Mr. Schumer said. "This is truly a first. But so was 9/11."
"This will mean either fewer layoffs or smaller tax increases, depending on what the mayor and governor decide," he continued.
Edward Skyler, a spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg, declined to comment beyond saying: "We've been working very hard with our state and federal counterparts on securing this type of flexibility. If it comes through, it will be another example of President Bush being there for New York City."
Lisa Stoll, a spokeswoman for Mr. Pataki, said the governor was "confident" that the Bush administration would grant the city and state the flexibility they are seeking.
The aid package, once finalized, will still need the approval of Congress. However, lawmakers said, Republican leaders of the House and the Senate are likely to follow the White House's lead.
The money would come out of $8.8 billion that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has set aside to assist New York in its recovery effort. The roughly $1 billion package cobbles together about $360 million in FEMA aid that had never been earmarked for any projects, with nearly $700 million that city and state officials squeezed out of existing disaster recovery projects.
A deal would help Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Pataki close multibillion dollar budget gaps that have forced them to make difficult choices. 
Last week, Mr. Pataki, in consultation with Mr. Bloomberg, for the first time formally proposed the request for aid -- one that city and state officials had been talking about for several months. In a press release, the governor requested that FEMA allow them to use roughly $1 billion for "unreimbursable expenses," a proposal intended to allow the financially strapped city and state to use the money as they saw fit.
Besides the economic losses resulting from the terrorist attack, the city and state suffered because they were forced to incur additional expenses that were not covered in other ways by federal disaster relief, officials have argued. The expenses include paying police officers, firefighters and other emergency personnel who were deployed in the aftermath of the attack. The state and the city also plan to use about $350 million to cover Medicaid expenses incurred in providing emergency medical care.

Bush Proposal for Savings Could Hurt Financial Firms
Many small businesses are expected to cancel retirement plans for their employees if the administration's proposal for savings programs become law, financial experts said. Companies that manage the retirement plans could lose millions.
 A Treasury official said the expectation was that the plan would lead to more retirement plans at small businesses. But many experts argued that the incentives for business owners to do so would be reduced. Page C3.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: IRAN FRONTIER; 
Across Iraq's Border, A Land Haunted by War

BYLINE:  By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: SHALEMCHEH, Iran, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
The feeling of death lingers on this parched desert plain two miles from the Iraqi border, many years after the fighting ended.
 The bodies were buried long ago, but the twisted remains of Iraqi tanks and armored personnel carriers dug deep in the cracked earth stand as reminders of an eight-year war between Iran and Iraq that left the border unchanged but cost between 600,000 and a million lives. 
 It was in this southwest corner of Iran that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq used chemical weapons against Iranian soldiers and Iran sent human waves of teenage martyrs to die in the name of Islam.
The Islamic Republic is building a marble-floored war memorial and museum here to replace the makeshift museum of corrugated metal where photos of the dead Iranian soldiers hang. One photo shows a bloody, severed head. 
A sign at the entrance reads, "Dear pilgrims, have a good pilgrimage," but there are more construction workers than visitors these days.
People in this region have a unique perspective on the war that the United States seems determined to fight.
While the official line in Tehran is to oppose an American-led war against Iraq, here the argument is different: only when Mr. Hussein is overthrown will Khuzistan Province be secure enough to persuade businesses and individuals to invest in an economically depressed area that wants to be made whole again.
"Of course war brings misery," said a heavyset merchant in the Indian Spice Shop as he blended curries for stews, soups and kabobs. "But it would be wonderful if there's a war and Saddam disappears."
His partner agreed, "Yes, it would be good to get rid of that regime no matter what." 
An old man chimed in: "What are you talking about? This whole thing is about Iran, not Iraq. The Americans want to surround Iran. They are already doing it. Even the son of the shah wants to come back and claim the monarchy."
But still, he added, war would be a "positive development."
An engineer from nearby Ahwaz said afterward that Mr. Hussein was a useful scapegoat for the problems of the Islamic Republic.
"If we don't want to be too pessimistic about our own government, we say the problem is Saddam," he said as he gave a foreign guest a drive around the area. Then he refined his argument, adding that the problem is indeed Mr. Hussein. 
"Saddam is like a wild animal," he continued. "We lost everything when Saddam came. No one can predict what he will do when he's disturbed in his lair."
Khuzistan Province had oil and a large Arabic-speaking population. Mr. Hussein believed that the area was rightfully his, just as he believed that Kuwait belonged to him when he invaded that country a decade later.
It was in this part of Iran that Mr. Hussein mounted a huge air and ground assault on the first day of his invasion in 1980, attacking Abadan's huge oil-refining center, the nearby port city of Khorramshahr, the provincial capital, Ahwaz, and the military installations in the area. The second day he sent his divisions deep into Iran.
Much of the area has never been rebuilt, and many of the inhabitants who did not flee have never recovered economically or psychologically. So the feelings toward the Iraqi leader are a blend of hatred and fear.
Yet a kind of normalcy prevails. The shops in Abadan, Ahwaz and Khorramshahr are filled with people buying and selling. Families stroll along the fetid Karun River, and boys fish for small white fish in the salt marshes that once were filled with bloated corpses.
The posters and paintings glorifying the martyrs of the Iran-Iraq war are more numerous here than in other areas of Iran. But people here have little confidence that the government in faraway Tehran will come to their rescue if Mr. Hussein decides to avenge an American invasion by turning against Iran. Clerics are less visible than in many other parts of Iran.
An estimated 200,000 Iraqi refugees live in camps along the border or in poverty outside the refugee system. The United Nations high commissioner for refugees, Ruud Lubbers, said about 300,000 refugees would be expected to flee to Iran in case of a new war.
"We are afraid that he may open the borders and overrun us with refugees or may gas us again with chemical gases," a businessman said of Mr. Hussein. "But we will not go to war again."
The desire to see the Iraqi leader fall coincides with a strong distrust of the the United States and its allies. Much of the West took Iraq's side after it invaded Iran, and during the war armed it with the sophisticated arms and chemicals that kept Iran at bay. In the beginning the main reason was Iran's seizure of the American Embassy in Tehran in 1979.
After the invasion, the United States merely cautioned that it "could not condone" Iraq's seizure of Khuzistan. It took the United Nations more than a week to pass a weak resolution that urged the combatants to refrain from the use of force and accept appropriate mediation.
After the Iranians retook Khorramshahr in one of the fiercest battles since World War II, it was another six years before Iran abandoned its effort to overthrow Mr. Hussein. Much of the landscape that surrounds Khorramshahr -- renamed Khuninshahr or city of blood, during the war -- looks the way it did during the war. Deep trenches, gun pits and earthen walls reminiscent of World War I have permanently reshaped the landscape.
A war museum boasts exhibits designed to prove Iran's conviction that this was a holy war against blasphemy. Among the possessions of the dead Iranians are copies of the Koran and handwritten poems about the glories of sacrifice. The Iraqis, by contrast, took playing cards, cigarettes and whiskey to war.
Some of the hatred of Mr. Hussein here stems from a racist-tinged animosity between ethnic Arabs and ethnic Iranians inside Iran, and between Iraqis and Iranians in general. 
The war not only attracted Iraqi refugees to the cities, but also ethnic Arabs and other tribesman from their villages, and Iranians of all classes blame the newcomers for a rise in crime.
The primary reason that Iranians here are unlikely to welcome their Iraqi brothers if there is a war is economic.
"The economy is dead," said an electrical technician in Khorramshahr who works for the government and earns the equivalent of $200 a month. "People are not afraid of war. They're afraid of poverty. Even though the Iraqis are Muslims and we are Muslims, refugees will make things even worse."
But the businessman explained: "There's a historic animosity that goes back between the Arabs and the Persians. Saddam has always despised the Persians, and we were always afraid what he would do to us."

Re "Ah, Those Principled Europeans" (column, Feb. 2): 
 Regarding war with Iraq, Thomas L. Friedman belittles the fears and weaknesses of Europeans facing conflagration in their neighborhood. But having been at the center of two world wars, Europe now faces mounting political, environmental and economic uncertainty. 
 Moral superiority is hardly the point. With little sign that this administration supports the collaborative development necessary for a lasting peace, the Europeans may be right.

HEADLINE: Agencies Jockey to Control Future Of Any Design for Ground Zero 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
With the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation only weeks away from adopting a long-sought plan for the World Trade Center site, a struggle is taking place over just how much of the grand designs will ever be built, a struggle that is connected to the future of the agency.
 The development corporation has culled two design concepts for the 16-acre trade center site from nine proposals and expects to select a single plan by Feb. 28, in the culmination of a sometimes noisy and painful process that began more than a year ago. 
 Beyond that the future is hazy. Two views of what comes next are now contending, pitting Roland W. Betts, a director of the development corporation with strong personal ties to the White House, against Charles A. Gargano, the state's top economic development official, some Port Authority of New York and and New Jersey executives, developers and others. 
Mr. Betts, who oversaw the task force that selected the two competing designs, sees a strong ongoing role for the development corporation in ensuring that the designs are put into effect and built. But Mr. Gargano envisions a diminishing role for the corporation, with the designs being mere site plans for future development. According to this view, the fancy models are largely window dressing.
Both men agree that the competition to design a soaring memorial to the 2,800 people who died should begin immediately, as well as work on transit and other improvements.
"Now the real power struggle begins," said Craig Whitaker, a professor of urban planning at New York University. "The real issue is: How do you square these schemes with reality?"
The future of the site has long been complicated by a sticky web of competing interests, including the Port Authority, which owns the land; Larry A. Silverstein, the leaseholder for the trade center site; the victims' families; residents; the governor; and the mayor.
The Port Authority wants to continue receiving the $120 million a year in rent it gets under its lease with Mr. Silverstein, though the buildings are gone. But Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg wants to take control of the site from the Port Authority in exchange for the land beneath the city's airports. The Bloomberg administration also favors a strong role for the development corporation because, city officials say, it could allow the city to avoid a long public review process of any development plans.
Mr. Gargano and Mr. Betts appear right now to have a great deal of power over what will be built. 
Mr. Gargano is vice chairman of the Port Authority and chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, the parent agency of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. But Mr. Gargano has little control over the Lower Manhattan agency, which has taken on a relatively independent political life with $2.7 billion in federal aid.
Mr. Betts, a stocky man who favors rumpled corduroy and loafers, is the owner of the Chelsea Piers sports complex in Manhattan. Until recently, he has not been a public figure, but he has proven to be a formidable actor in the rebuilding effort.
"Roland is the only person that neither the city nor the state, for different reasons, wants to mess with," said one person involved in the rebuilding process. "Roland is really a power right now."
Gov. George E. Pataki appointed him to the board of the development corporation because of his friendship with President Bush, a Yale classmate. He has also helped Mayor Bloomberg bring the Republican convention to New York and, as a member of the United States Olympic Committee, is supporting the mayor's effort to bring the Summer Games to New York in 2012.
Friends and critics say he is a smart tactician in developing a consensus among disparate factions and moving the design process forward. He views himself as the keeper of the design flame, but says he fears that the designs might be compromised by commercial interests.
"I'm extremely invested in this process and I'm determined to see it through to a conclusion," Mr. Betts said. "I'm determined to be fatherly about protecting that conclusion."
Mr. Betts says that once the corporation selects a final design, the agency should fine-tune the plans and create construction drawings for the parks, public buildings, transit hub and office buildings destined for the site. But Mr. Gargano and others say that it would be a mistake to create specific plans for office buildings that will not be built for at least five years by some future builder for an as-yet unspecified tenant. 
"The creation of an appropriate memorial comes first," Mr. Gargano said. "Then, the transportation and infrastructure improvements that will attract development to the site and to Lower Manhattan."
According to people in the rebuilding process, Mr. Gargano believes that the corporation's role will diminish and its staff shrink, except for overseeing the memorial.
Despite the renderings and models of glamorous buildings, the designs, in this view, are nothing more than site plans for the location of the memorial, the transit center and various commercial, retail and other buildings.
Meanwhile, Mr. Silverstein maintains that he has the obligation and the right to rebuild the 10-million-square-foot trade center complex. He is battling with his insurers over his claim for a double insurance payment of nearly $7 billion for the rebuilding effort. But he has complained that he has been shut out of the planning process.
On Wednesday, Mr. Silverstein said he was asked by the "highest levels of L.M.D.C." to work with the architectural teams to produce site plans "that respect their program and our obligations and rights under the lease."
But in contrast with the current plans, which call for no more than 7.6 million square feet of office space, Mr. Silverstein said he had no doubt "they're going to have to tweak it to 10 million square feet." While public opinion has argued strongly for less office space, if the agency takes a position in support of less office space, it could affect Mr. Silverstein's court case with his insurers.
Speaking of the debate over what is to be built, Louis R. Tomson, president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, said he welcomed the discussion.
"If you polled the board, they'd feel they have a mission to fulfill, but that it hasn't been defined corporately," Mr. Tomson said. "Government institutions have to serve a useful purpose. It's best to have this discussion in public."

Re "Rumsfeld Warns He Will Ask Congress for More Billions" (news article, Feb. 6):
 Here we are with a federal deficit of more than $200 billion, 33 million people living in poverty (at least 11 million of them children), 41 million people without health insurance and an unemployment rate that is almost 6 percent, but Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld finds that the $380 billion proposed military budget (by far the world's largest) simply won't do. 
 Meanwhile, the Pentagon is requesting an exemption from environmental rules (news article, Feb. 6) so it can conduct maneuvers without any regard for habitats or endangered species on federal land.
Isn't there some irony in consuming the country you've vowed to protect?

HEADLINE: The Tiresome Tuition Game at SUNY 

BYLINE:  By Clifton R. Wharton Jr.; Clifton R. Wharton Jr. was chancellor of the State University of New York from 1978 to 1987.

 BODY:
January proved to be a painful month for the State University of New York. First, its trustees called for an increase of $1,400 in undergraduate tuition, the first in seven years. Then, Gov. George E. Pataki called for huge cuts in higher education spending in his budget plan. Taken together, the developments are a sad admission that the budget process for New York's public higher education system remains seriously flawed. 
 The result is not only a financial blow to thousands of students, but also a continuation of the feast-or-famine pattern of financing that is causing turmoil on campuses. I have no doubt that a major tuition increase -- the governor suggests $1,200 -- is badly needed. The fact that tuition has remained the same for the last seven years is not something to be proud of. Rather, it is evidence that campuses have been starved for money. 
 So while the result -- undergraduate tuition for state residents of up to $4,800 -- would be in line with national tuition levels for public universities, it is unpalatable as a onetime jump. Increasing SUNY tuition gradually over the years, in concert with state financing, would have prevented such pain. The future is further clouded by the nearly $12 billion budget gap in Albany, and by the likelihood that the state's Tuition Assistance Program will be unable to meet the increased need for the thousands of students requiring financial aid. The governor's proposal to withhold one-third of a student's T.A.P. grant until the student graduates would only add further financial strain on students and their families.
New York has a long history of playing games with SUNY's budget and tuition, as I know from my nine years as chancellor under two governors. Back then, in the late 1970's through the mid-80's, SUNY trustees had the nominal authority to raise tuition on their own. The reality was far more complex. The tuition process resembled a Japanese Noh performance where the actors play their parts in a well-orchestrated dance.
The script read like this: I would submit a proposed budget to the governor's Division of the Budget and begin discussions with that agency and key legislators. The agency would then overstate the income expected to be generated by the university in an amount equal to a tuition increase that we had all tacitly agreed upon.
The governor's budget then went to the Legislature with no mention of a rise in tuition, though the leaders were fully aware there would be one. When the approved appropriation was received by SUNY, the trustees, mirabile dictu, then raised tuition by the amount necessary to fill the gap. The trustees took the blame; the Legislature's and governor's fingerprints were nowhere to be seen.
The system, for all its scripted nuances, worked fairly well until 1985, when Assembly Speaker Stanley Fink secured an amendment requiring the Legislature's approval of any tuition increase by SUNY and the City University of New York. Seeming legislative powerlessness in the face of repeated student complaints over tuition may have been a motive. Curiously, the amendment was passed at the same time as a flexibility package I had engineered to enable SUNY to attend to its own affairs more efficiently.
I departed in January 1987, and Mr. Fink's amendment has resulted in years of the governor, the State Legislature and the trustees avoiding politically unpopular tuition increases. The result has been no tuition changes for six years, three years of increases totaling $1,300, two years without change followed by a $750 jump, culminating in the most recent seven-year drought.
Students now face the largest tuition increase in the university's history. The pattern has meant significant reductions and distortions in academic programs, campus budgets and financial aid. It has also led campuses to impose an ever-increasing number of special fees on students in lieu of higher tuition. Fees for student activities, intercollegiate athletics and laboratory courses, among others, have become an adjustable source of revenue. The New York Public Interest Research Group, a nonpartisan consumer group, estimates that adjusting for inflation, fees at SUNY increased almost 100 percent from 1990 to 2000.
The most significant impact of the tuition increase and tuition assistance limitations is likely to be on college attendance by students from low- and middle-income families. The prospect of higher costs leading to higher debt from loan burdens could prove too powerful a barrier. It is regrettable that at a time when the state needs to invest more than ever in human capital, it seems willing to shortchange the generation that can determine future economic growth. It does not have to be that way. The state should stabilize the manner in which needs are addressed, like setting tuition as a specified percentage of what it costs the university to educate a student. 
The public higher education systems should be the jewels in New York's crown. Unless the state ends the woeful neglect of the system and develops a better formula for financing and setting tuition, the jewels will change to paste.

HEADLINE: CONNECTIONS; 
In Any Test of Human Limits, Death Is Among the Judges

BYLINE:  By Edward Rothstein 

 BODY:
Too much money, too much risk, too much death. In the week since the shuttle disaster, these have been some of the judgments offered as the space program has come under scrutiny. But when have such verdicts not been plausible for journeys of exploration?
 In 1848 the British admiral John Franklin sailed with two ships and 129 men to discover a Northwest Passage through the Arctic and disappeared; in 1859, after 30 rescue missions had failed with further loss of life, the wrecks of his ominously named ships, the Erebus and the Terror, were finally found crushed by ice, the skeletons of the crew testifying to untold horrors and suffering. 
 But similar suffering was readily told by others. Henry Morton Stanley described his 1874 voyage to seek the source of the Nile as an "unrelieved horror" in which only 114 men out of 356 survived, victims of drowning, disease and battles with cannibalistic tribes. In 1879 the Arctic explorer George Wallace Melville lasted through a Siberian winter, often crawling on his knees, feeding on deer scraps and raw fish. Reading a new anthology, "Dead Reckoning: Great Adventure Writing from the Golden Age of Exploration, 1800-1900" (Norton), edited by Helen Whybrow, means hearing about what might as well have been space travel:accounts of inhospitable worlds in which even the human is alien.
And when, as in Sir Ernest Shackleton's famous 1914 Antarctic journey, he and his crew survive shipwreck, starvation, ice storms, amputations and despair, the effect is almost miraculous, as if the very laws of nature were being overturned.
But something is clearly different about contemporary explorations and expectations. Differences may become even more apparent as the bicentennial commemorations of the Lewis and Clark expedition accumulate in coming months. The space program evolved not by creating otherworldly heroes but by creating an almost democratic culture of space exploration. The audience watches from below; its chosen representatives perform from above. The space station, with its international cast and experiments, expands this notion on a world scale. There is little place there for an explorer like Fridtjof Nansen of Norway, who purposely sailed into the pack ice of the North Pole, which routinely crushed the ships of rivals.
Some of this shift in explorer culture was explained by Tom Wolfe in "The Right Stuff." In the days of the Russian Sputnik, the astronaut was packaged as a "cold warrior of the heavens," a pioneer staking an American claim. But as Mr. Wolfe showed, test pilots already saw astronauts not as heroes but as passive participants in someone else's plan, helpless, capsule-sitting observers, surviving not because of skill and daring and ego but because of precautions and planning. Today NASA doesn't cultivate tales of endurance and trauma; it abhors them. Ordinary routine is not a distraction, it is a triumph.
The effort, quite sensibly, is to remove danger as much as possible from exploration. And not just in space. Risk and danger may be sought on occasion, but they are also cushioned in artifice, packaged for the contestants of "Survivor" on television or cultivated by practitioners of extreme sports outfitted in the best available gear.
It may also be that there is now some disillusionment with the very idea of exploration, which once had an almost mythic status. Many early journeys of exploration, of course, had strong economic justification; they were often quests for resources and trade routes. But by Shackleton's 1914 journey, there was little such motivation. He financed his expedition by arranging for private donations, obtaining a book advance and optimistically planning a postsurvival international lecture tour. But his plan, to cross the Antarctic continent on foot, can seem the dream of a madman (which helps make survival seem the accomplishment of a hero). His voyage was intended to tap into the mythology of the explorer.
This mythology also had a darker side. In a provocative new book, "Exploring Lewis and Clark" (Knopf), a historian, Thomas P. Slaughter, argues that this mythology was even pursued by Lewis and Clark, neither of whom was what he seemed. Exploration, Mr. Slaughter proposes, is really a competition: "Exploring is a race with no second place." Explorers are collectors, chroniclers, owners and often killers.
Mr. Slaughter, who teaches history at the University of Notre Dame, argues that the 13 volumes of journals from the Lewis and Clark expedition are full of distortions, claiming firsts when there were few, describing exaggerated dangers, misunderstanding encounters with Indians, and ruthlessly constructing future reputations. Mr. Slaughter writes of Lewis and Clark, "They already feared that they were lesser men than the great explorers whom they emulated."
But while Mr. Slaughter's close readings reveal elaborately mythological machinery, he also inadvertently reveals a countermyth. In his readings, explorers almost uniformly resemble competitive imperialists, randomly killing animal life, blind to the visionary harmony of American Indian life, missionaries for a misguided culture. This is the familiar, postmodern vision of the Western explorer, a distorted inversion of its predecessor.
Some of that suspicion may also be woven into contemporary wariness about space exploration, perhaps even discouraging more daring imaginings than those now offered. But what emerges again and again in the writings Ms. Whybrow has compiled are not the ways in which an explorer destroys or inflates or distorts but the ways an explorer comes to see.
The human is diminished in the face of immensity, vulnerable in the face of danger. The world, even in its horrific threats, can seem, as Nansen writes, "shining and white, possessed of all the purity we lack." This frailty, though, can also accompany an elevated vision of human possibility. Explorers survive to tell of their voyages. They test limits, at once submitting to them and defying them. It would be a mistake to retreat from such confrontations with limits. And as the disaster last week showed, it is impossible to avoid those limits completely. One of them has always been death.

HEADLINE: The Desperate Refugees of North Korea 

 BODY:
More than 200,000 North Koreans have fled into northeastern China in recent years trying to save themselves and their families from famine. Now they are trapped there, hunted down by Chinese police and blocked from traveling to South Korea, which says it would willingly receive them. Though less threatening than nuclear weapons programs, this is a dimension of the Korean crisis Washington cannot afford to ignore. 
 Today's refugee emergency is a foretaste of what might happen if the North Korean regime collapsed. Fearing the consequences of such an implosion, China and South Korea have been reluctant to pressure Pyongyang over its nuclear moves. 
 No one can be sure exactly how many of North Korea's 22 million people have starved to death over the past decade, but some estimates are as high as one million. Even more would have died without the generous food provided by America, Japan and South Korea. Washington has been by far the largest donor. Even with these contributions, many North Koreans have gone hungry -- victims of economic mismanagement and the priority that North Korean rulers assign to military projects.
In recent months Beijing has begun deporting groups of North Koreans back home, where they face almost certain imprisonment. These deportations violate international refugee law. Beijing insists the North Koreans aren't genuine refugees, but refuses to allow United Nations representatives to interview them. In scenes reminiscent of Havana or Eastern Europe in the late 1980's, North Koreans in China have repeatedly tried to get to foreign embassies where they might be granted safe conduct to South Korea, but most have been forcibly repelled by Chinese police. 
This year American food donations have plunged, reflecting deteriorating relations with North Korea. Pressuring the North's leaders and military programs is sound policy. But withholding food from starving people is shameful and likely to make the refugee problem still worse.
China's behavior toward the North Koreans is inexcusable. A more humane and orderly approach to absorbing current and future refugees from North Korea must be found without delay.

HEADLINE: Five Inches of Snow Seems More of a Burden Beyond the City Line 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BARRON 

 BODY:
His fenders were filled with it, his brakes covered in it: snow. But Francois Bureau just kept going. Not at the wheel of a four-wheel-drive monster that could bulldoze its way through any kind of weather. Mr. Bureau was whizzing down Varick Street toward the Holland Tunnel on a 21-speed racing bike.
 Yes, whizzing through the snow as if the 5.3 inches that the National Weather Service measured in Central Park had not happened. As if yesterday had not given February 2003 its own small place in the record books, with more snow than in five of the last six Februaries. 
 "This is nothing," Mr. Bureau, a bicycle messenger, said when he stopped for a pickup between Spring and Vandam Streets. "If it would be colder, that would be a problem. The gears would freeze. If there would be a lot of salt or sand on the streets, that would damage the bike, but there's not. This is nothing."
But nothing to Mr. Bureau was not nothing to everyone caught in a storm that had churned north from the Carolinas during the night. For yesterday was a study in contrasts, in how the rhythms of the city do not change much with snow -- and how the routines in the suburbs do.
"In the city, you just go on because somebody else is doing the shoveling and everybody's happy to go to work, especially in this economy," said James Murphy, a real estate executive who moved from the Upper West Side to Garden City, on Long Island, a couple of years ago. "People out here pretend that they're grumpy. They're grumpy when they call into the office and say, 'I've been snowed in.' "
Which is what Mr. Murphy said he did yesterday, before he took his two sons sledding -- an expedition that was followed by more grumpiness.
"The kids get grumpy when they come back from the sledding and they're all wet," he said. "I'll be grumpy Saturday when my back is out and I can't walk."
For other people in snowbound suburbs, yesterday was the kind of day that brought back memories -- memories of when snow was something to appreciate instead of regret. Barnet Silver, a creative director who lives in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., recalled, "When we first moved up here 16 years ago from the city, our reaction to the snowfalls was: 'Ahhh, isn't that nice?' "
As with so many love affairs gone sour, that initial infatuation gave way to something else -- snow removal, in this case. Now Mr. Silver says he has a love-hate relationship with wintry weather. He has brushed the snow off his car once too often.
There was more snow to brush off in the suburbs than in the city. The National Weather Service measured 8 inches in New Canaan, Conn., and New City, N.Y.; 9 inches in West Milford, N.J.; 8.1 inches in Rutherford, N.J.; and 7 inches in Bridgeport, Conn.; Ridgewood, N.J.; and Montauk, N.Y.
But as the snow waned and the temperature rose toward its high for the day (33 degrees at 3:59 p.m.), even meteorologists echoed Mr. Bureau, the bicycle messenger. "It's nothing extraordinary; a typical winter storm," said Chris Johannesson, a meteorologist with Pennsylvania State University. "Once people shovel out, it's really something that a couple of days from now won't be remembered."
So yesterday's Currier and Ives moments did not last long. Neither did the midday snowball fights in SoHo Square, the triangle of a park along Avenue of the Americas between Spring and Dominick Streets.
Ellen McCourt put on a white straw hat with a blue feather to walk her beagle five blocks to a friend's apartment. "There's no bad weather; only bad clothing," she said.
The dog-walkers were out. So were apartment- and job-hunters like Irene Fondreist, a lawyer who just moved to New York from San Francisco and was looking for a place to live and a place to work.
"I grew up in the Dolomites," she said, adding that when she lived in San Francisco, "I missed the snow." She has been staying with an aunt here who told her, as aunts do, to take an umbrella when she went out yesterday. "I argued, 'No, I want the snow,' " Ms. Fondreist said.
So the city kept going, battery-bunnylike, but some heard different drums. A peace protest was held as scheduled in Central Park -- 30 women ditched their clothes near the Bethesda Fountain and lay in the snow, spelling out words like "War."
"I tried to do this twice before in the last three weeks," said Wendy Tremayne, an artist who organized the event. "Every date I selected, it rained. This time, I said: 'You know what? It's just got to happen."
She said that the protest involved "about five minutes of laying in the snow and rearranging ourselves to get the word to be legible."
Here is the obvious question: What was it like to lie in the snow?
"It burned," she said. No, she was not worried about frostbite. "I didn't think five minutes in the snow would kill anybody. I was thinking about the Polar Bear Club" -- the group that celebrates New Year's Day with a dip in the Atlantic off Coney Island. "If they can go swimming in January," she said, "we can handle five minutes in February."

HEADLINE: DeLay Denies Role in Letter Riling Unions 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Representative Tom DeLay, the House majority leader, yesterday disavowed an anti-union fund-raising letter that bears his signature after several union leaders condemned the letter because it accuses "big labor bosses" of seeking to expand their power at the expense of national security.
 The letter, which raised money for the National Right to Work Legal Defense and Education Foundation, criticized "the union bosses' drive to use the national emergencies we face today to grab more power." It said this drive "presents a clear and present danger to the security of the United States."
 Last night Mr. DeLay's spokesman, Stuart Roy, said that Mr. DeLay disavowed the letter, dated Jan. 8, and had never seen it until Thursday. Mr. Roy said one of Mr. DeLay's assistants had made a mistake in approving the letter. 
 Stefan Gleason, the foundation's vice president for public affairs, said he was surprised by the disavowal. "I know that we deal with the people who have the authority," Mr. Gleason said. "Its up to the them. Presumably, it's his view because he signed the letter."
Before Mr. DeLay distanced himself from the letter, James P. Hoffa, the president of the Teamsters, the union most vigorously courted by Republicans, wrote him a letter saying, "This anti-union screed not only insults the 1.4 million members of this union, it offends me personally."
 Mr. Hoffa added, "While I take umbrage to any statement that questions the patriotism of myself and the members of this union, I consider such an accusation a particular affront to our Teamster Brothers and Sisters who are called to active duty."
 Mr. Hoffa said the letter undercut the Teamsters' efforts to work with both Republicans and Democrats. He called on Mr. DeLay to retract the statements and to apologize to union members "for suggesting that their efforts to defend basic labor rights are tantamount to aiding and abetting the enemy."
 After being asked to respond to Mr. Hoffa's letter, Mr. Roy said, "Tom DeLay doesn't believe the words that were ascribed to him." He added that Mr. DeLay did not approve the contents of the letter, "nor, since he doesn't believe it, would he approve the overheated fund-raising hyperbole in the letter."
 The letter on behalf of the Right to Work group, which opposes compulsory payment of union dues, gives several examples, including strikes, that it said demonstrated that union leaders have used national emergencies to increase their power.
 The letter said that the longshoremen had "exploited America's urgent economic and national security needs" by forcing a shutdown of West Coast ports. It added that the machinists' union had "shamefully exploited the nation's critical war needs" when workers went on strike for two months last year at a Lockheed Martin plant in Georgia that assembled F-22 fighter jets and C130-J military transports.
 Said the letter: "As the World Trade Center and Pentagon still smoldered, high-paid union lobbyists convinced Democratic Senators Ted Kennedy and Hillary Rodham Clinton to try ramming through legislation to force the nation's firefighters and policemen to accept union bosses as their exclusive workplace spokesmen."
 Harold A. Schaitberger, president of the International Association of Fire Fighters, wrote an angry letter to Mr. DeLay yesterday, noting that 343 firefighters died in the attacks on the World Trade Center.
 "How dare you question the patriotism of the nation's firefighters and their elected union leaders," Mr. Schaitberger wrote, "all of whom have crawled down a burning hallway, faced uncontrolled flames and risked their lives countless times for the citizens of our great nation?"
 The bill the letter attacked would have given the right to unionize to firefighters and police officers in the 19 states that do not allow public employees to form unions.
 "I have never felt more outrage, astonishment and utter disgust than I feel today over the actions of an elected official," Mr. Schaitberger wrote.
 The fund-raising letter said that labor's effort to expand its power during a national emergency was "not surprising, given the history of how Big Labor notoriously exploited the Second World War" to "expand dramatically its power at the expense of the war effort."

HEADLINE: Pension Costs May Widen Budget Gap In New York 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 7 

 BODY:
Because of sharply rising pension costs, next year's state budget gap could be $700 million larger than the Pataki administration had expected, according to figures released today by the state comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi.
 Mr. Hevesi has estimated that the state will have to pay $1.1 billion to the public employee pension system next year. That compares with the $400 million that Gov. George E. Pataki had planned to spend on the system in his budget for that fiscal year, which begins on April 1. 
 Mr. Hevesi said his prediction was based on the value of the pension fund through the end of last month. The actual cost will be determined by the value of the fund on March 31. 
Prolonged sluggishness on Wall Street has reduced the total value of the fund, known as the New York State and Local Retirement systems, to about $97 billion on Jan. 31, from a high of about $127 billion in March 2000, state officials said. That decline is forcing the state to increase its contributions to cover the employees' pension costs.
If the stock market's poor performance continues, and Mr. Hevesi's estimate holds relatively steady, increased pension costs will further strain a state that is facing a combined $11.5 billion deficit in the current and coming fiscal years.
"Obviously, this is regrettable news for state and local taxpayers and is another reason why it is so critical that the state has policies that restore economic growth and create more jobs," Kevin C. Quinn, a spokesman for the state Division of the Budget, said today. 
He said the Pataki administration would encourage Mr. Hevesi to examine every option to reduce the impact on the state and local governments. "And we would be willing to work with him to do that," he said.
Mr. Hevesi notified the Pataki administration of his estimate today. He said that local governments around New York, already grappling with budget gaps of their own, would face higher-than-predicted pension costs as well.
Though dollar amounts for those local costs have not yet been determined, Mr. Hevesi said that local governments would have to contribute about 11 percent of payroll costs to the pension fund for a majority of public employees, rather than the current 1 percent.
"For police and fire employees, rates would increase from zero to 15 percent of payroll," Mr. Hevesi said in a statement. "Actual costs for any individual local government are often higher because they include local options such as retirement incentives and other options."
He added that retirees' pension benefits were secure and that the fund had enough money to cover the cost of benefits.
The value of the state pension fund, which is the second largest in the nation and which serves about 945,000 participants (including about 300,000 retirees), had experienced robust growth during the recent record periods of prosperity on Wall Street. During that market boom, governments did not have to pay into the fund at all. But now, those contribution rates have begun to edge up.
The state decided to pay the added pension costs over two years, although with a roughly 8 percent interest rate on the second year's payments, officials said. Because Mr. Hevesi's notification is merely an estimate, the state has not made a final determination on how it will address any potential shortfall.

HEADLINE: JOB MARKET SHOWS A RISE IN JANUARY 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
The job market showed unexpected signs of improvement last month, relieving worries that the country could be slipping into a new recession. The unemployment rate fell to 5.7 percent in January, from 6 percent.
 But the stock market, after an initial rise, dropped yesterday as Wall Street absorbed the report's details, and analysts said they were not convinced that the economy was recovering as strongly as the numbers might suggest. The Standard & Poor 500-stock index lost 8.46 points, or 1 percent, to close at 829.69, the lowest level since October. 
 Employment in January grew by 143,000 jobs, the biggest monthly gain since 2000, the Labor Department said yesterday. The gain nearly erased December's decline. 
"Although the headline number is better than expected, I don't think this changes the basic employment picture," said Richard D. Rippe, the chief economist at Prudential Securities. "We've had rough job stability over the last eight or nine months."
Economists cautioned that a statistical quirk made retail employment appear to fall sharply in December and surge last month, accounting for much of the seesawing of the last two months.
Even if it did not offer a clear signal that the job market had reached a turning point, the employment report suggested that the job market may at least have bottomed in recent weeks. Few industries are adding many jobs, but layoffs have begun to ebb. Over all, the economy has been growing weakly since the end of 2001.
The New York Times reported earlier this week, before the new data became available, that the loss of jobs since the last recession, which began in March 2001, was the worst in almost 20 years. Even with the latest job figures factored in, that remains true.
The report is unlikely to change the policy of the Federal Reserve, which has cut its benchmark interest rate 12 times since the start of 2001 to lower borrowing costs and stimulate the limping economy, forecasters said. Most expect the Fed to keep the rate at 1.25 percent through the spring.
The jobs data "was well inside the range that the Fed would have expected," said Chris Varvares, president of Macroeconomic Advisers, a research firm in St. Louis. "It's a reason for cautious optimism, but I wouldn't make too much of the gain."
President Bush, speaking yesterday at the swearing-in ceremony for Treasury Secretary John W. Snow, called once again on Congress to pass a 10-year, $670 billion tax cut to help revive growth. "The economy is not strong enough," he said. "We will not be satisfied until this economy grows fast enough to employ every man and woman who seeks a job."
Democrats oppose the tax cut plan, and some Republicans have criticized the size of the package, making revisions to it likely.
The new jobs data did offer reasons for optimism, though. Construction companies added 21,000 jobs in January, their largest gain since August, as the housing boom continued. Hotels added workers for the fourth consecutive month, their longest growth streak since 2000. Manufacturing, which has been hit harder than any other industry during the downturn, cut 16,000 jobs, its smallest reduction since last summer.
Joblessness declined most last month among groups that typically suffer the worst effects of recessions. The unemployment rate for blacks fell to 10.3 percent, from 11.2 percent in December, while the rate for whites remained at 5.1 percent. For workers without a high school diploma, the jobless rate last month fell to 8.5 percent from 9 percent, while it rose slightly for those who graduated from college, to 3 percent from 2.9 percent.
"The worst fears from November and December were washed away," said Steven Wieting, a senior economist at Salomon Smith Barney. "A better outlook awaits some relief over these concerns about war."
Many analysts noted that much of last month's jobs surge stemmed from quirks in the seasonal factors the government uses to adjust its data. A lack of hiring by retailers expecting weak holiday sales made December's numbers look worse than they were, and the absence of the normal retail layoffs in recent weeks made January appear better. According to the government's seasonally adjusted numbers, retailers cut 99,000 jobs in December and added 101,000 last month.
Economists also said that revisions associated with the 2000 Census made them wary of giving too much significance to the decline in the jobless rate, which was the largest since 1998.
"We remain skeptical," said Ian Shepherdson, chief domestic economist at High Frequency Economics, a forecasting firm. "For now, though, it looks good."
In addition, the percentage of people who are not in the labor force, neither working nor looking for work, continued to rise in January, contributing to the drop in the jobless rate, which counts only people who are seeking work. 
While the job increase in January was greater than most forecasters had expected, the government also revised the figures from late last year to show a larger loss than it had originally reported. The economy has lost 94,000 jobs over the last three months.
Executives in many industries have remained reluctant to hire. Employment at staffing agencies, which is often a leading indicator of the economy's direction, fell slightly last month and is almost 20 percent lower than its peak in 2000. The number of people who said they were working part time because they could not find full-time work rose in January. 
In the 22 months since the recession began in March 2001, the economy has lost almost two million jobs, or 1.5 percent of total employment. At the same point in the so-called jobless recovery of the early 90's, 1.1 percent of jobs disappeared.
A surge of business investment in new factories, equipment and software during the late 90's has left many companies with more capacity than they can profitably use. It has also made many more efficient, enabling them to produce more goods while cutting workers. The potential for war in Iraq and a spike in energy prices has cooled hiring, too. 
The jobs slump has nearly halted wage growth, once inflation is taken into account. Hourly wages for production and nonsupervisory workers -- about four-fifths of the work force -- were flat last month and from October to January rose at an annual rate of 2.2 percent, roughly the same pace as inflation.
Workers received a solid increase in their weekly pay last month because the number of hours they worked rose to 34.2, from 34.1, on average.
Another report released yesterday, this one from the Federal Reserve, showed that consumers lowered their debt in December for only the second time in nearly five years and at the sharpest rate since 1992. The newfound frugality surprised analysts.
The Labor Department report listed restaurants and airlines among the industries that added workers, erasing declines of about the same size in December. Financial service companies, hospitals and federal and local government agencies also increased employment. 
Car dealers, manufacturers of clothing and computers, and state governments, which are trying to close budget deficits, all cut jobs. 
The report included the Labor Department's first jobless rate for Asians, and it showed them less likely to be unemployed than any other race or ethnic group.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Americas: Canada: Job Market Turns Flat 

BYLINE:  By Bernard Simon (NYT) 

 BODY:
 After a year of buoyant growth, Canada's job market turned flat in January, with 34,400 new full-time jobs offset by the loss of 36,500 part-time positions, Statistics Canada said. The unemployment rate fell to 7.4 percent from 7.5 percent in December. Less dependent on technology industries, Canda's economy has been more robust than that of the United States recently. But with the United States accounting for 85 percent of Canada's exports, recent data has pointed to a slowdown in Canada. Bernard Simon (NYT)

Re "Hiring in Nation Hits Worst Slump in Nearly 20 Years" (front page, Feb. 6):
 One wonders how long it will take for a public that generally approves of the way President Bush is handling his job to wake up to the disaster that is occurring to the nation under the administration's economic and tax policies. 
 In addition to the critical unemployment problem, businesses are closing, the states are undergoing desperate financial crises not seen since World War II, and the federal surpluses are gone and deficits loom for the foreseeable future. While the public's attention is being diverted by the prospect of war with Iraq and the Columbia catastrophe, the economic disaster grows.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: NUCLEAR DIPLOMACY; 
Bush Urges Chinese President To Press North Korea on Arms

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7 

 BODY:
President Bush urged President Jiang Zemin of China today to help resolve the crisis with North Korea, telling him in a phone conversation that Beijing had a responsibility to prevent the North from developing nuclear weapons that could threaten much of Asia.
 But even as he insisted that the crisis could be resolved peacefully, Mr. Bush told reporters that "all options are on the table," including military action, if diplomacy failed to prevent North Korea from resuming its efforts to build nuclear weapons. 
 "I will continue working diplomatically to convince Kim Jong Il that he will be further isolated if he continues to develop a nuclear program," Mr. Bush said of North Korea's leader.
Shortly after Mr. Bush conferred with Mr. Jiang, Pentagon officials said that Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld had ordered the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson from the West Coast to Japan, to replace the Kitty Hawk carrier battle group, which is heading to the Persian Gulf.
The swap ensures that America's military presence around the Korean peninsula will not shrink even if the United States attacks Iraq, allowing for what White House officials have called a "robust deterrent" against North Korea. The latest deployment comes on top of a decision to place 24 long-range bombers on alert to move toward the area on short notice.
North Korea issued a new round of threats today, saying that a buildup of American "aggression troops" could lead to nuclear war that would reduce both Koreas "to ashes." The statement called on South Koreans to join the north in a "struggle to check and frustrate the U.S. arms buildup."
Concerns about North Korea's nuclear program intensified this week when the North announced that it was restarting a mothballed nuclear reactor at Yongbyon that can produce plutonium for nuclear weapons. The move came after evidence that the north had begun removing spent nuclear fuel rods from storage, possibly in preparation for reprocessing them for weapons.
Many American officials believe that China could play a lead role in pressuring North Korea, particularly now that America's relations with South Korea have been strained.
China is one of North Korea's largest trading partners and, since the collapse of the Soviet Union, has emerged as the largest provider of economic, food and fuel aid to the north, American officials said. By some estimates, half of China's foreign aid budget goes to North Korea.
American officials say the Chinese have been a conduit for American messages to North Korea and have worked with Washington to set up a multinational meeting at which American and North Korean officials could meet privately. But some officials have complained privately that Beijing could do more to pressure concessions from the North.
Speaking at the Foreign Press Center in Washington, John Wolf, the assistant secretary of state for nonproliferation, said a nuclear North Korea "would pose an enormous threat to its neighbors and would create an unstable situation in Northeast Asia, which would be a threat not only in the region but, given the importance of the countries in that region, it would be a threat that would worry us all."
He called North Korea "Missiles-R-Us," because of its history of selling ballistic missile technology.

HEADLINE: White House Floats Idea Of Dropping Income Tax 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7 

 BODY:
President Bush, having already set off a firestorm over his proposals to cut taxes and revamp retirement accounts, suggested today that the time might be near to drop the income tax as a whole and replace it with some form of consumption tax.
 The idea was outlined in the White House's annual economic report to Congress. The report, prepared by the White House Council of Economic Advisers and signed by Mr. Bush, offers a scathing critique of the current system and an exuberant description of radical alternatives. 
 The report does not make formal recommendations, and White House officials emphasized that sweeping tax overhaul was not an immediate policy goal.
But many administration officials have made no secret of their fondness for fundamental tax overhaul, and the report today lays out a detailed rationale for a system that taxes spending rather than income.
By eliminating the complexity and the thousands of arcane preferences in today's tax code, the report says, a consumption tax would not only increase efficiency but promote investment and growth.
"Most estimates suggest that a shift to a consumption tax base would generally increase the size of the capital stock in the long run," the report said. Economic output could increase as much as 6 percent, it added.
Michael Graetz, a professor of tax policy at Yale Law School and a longtime advocate of a tax on consumption, said the report was a clear signal about the administration's long-term thinking.
"It's unusual for something like that to be in the economic report of the president," Mr. Graetz said. "I don't believe the president has made a decision about what he would like to do. On the other hand, this shows they are serious about fundamental tax reform."
The idea of overhauling the system is not new. Paul H. O'Neill, President Bush's first Treasury secretary, was a passionate believer in at least simplifying the current system.
Republican lawmakers have periodically campaigned for a consumption tax in recent years. R. Glenn Hubbard, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, wrote numerous papers while at Columbia University about the merits of a consumption tax.
At its simplest, a consumption tax would eliminate traditional income taxes for most if not all taxpayers and replace those taxes with some kind of tax on spending. Corporations might still pay taxes, but they would abandon most of the rules for depreciating investment in new equipment or buildings and simply write off those costs as expenses in the year they occur.
The allure of such systems is their simplicity. Fans of the consumption tax said it would save ordinary taxpayers billions of dollars, eliminate the wasteful gaming of current rules and ultimately be more fair.
Critics of such proposals contend that the political challenges are too daunting, because attacking countless special preferences means challenging innumerable powerful lobbying groups -- from oil companies that want their tax credits for drilling to home builders wanting to save the tax deduction for mortgage interest.
Politically, the most damaging criticism is that a consumption tax could obliterate the idea of a progressive tax system and shift much of the tax burden from the rich to middle-income people and the poor.
A consumption tax would leave investment income tax-free; investment income flows most heavily to wealthy taxpayers. Beyond that, opponents argue, a consumption tax is "regressive" in that the same rates apply to rich and poor people alike.
The president's report tries to refute those arguments. In a lengthy section called "Distributional Consequences of Tax Reform," it contends that people move very fluidly between lower- and higher-income brackets through the normal course of their careers. 
Using a "lifetime" approach to income distribution, an idea embraced by Mr. Hubbard at the Council of Economic Advisers, the report cites studies showing that more than half of people followed over 10 years had moved into a different income bracket at the end of a decade.
"Consumption taxes are generally less regressive when viewed from a lifetime perspective," the report declared. "A one-year snapshot of the distributional effects of many tax changes can be misleading."
Republican lawmakers and policy analysts generally doubt Mr. Bush will push for a radical tax overhaul anytime soon, given his already sprawling agenda of a likely war with Iraq and the huge tax bills he wants to push through this year.
But if Mr. Bush succeeds in pushing through his current agenda, and wins re-election in 2004, the report could turn out to be a blueprint for his goals in a second presidential term.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
Performinga Free Trade Juggling Act, Offstage

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER and EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7 

 BODY:
Over the next few months, Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, will play the central role in deciding whether people in sub-Saharan Africa have access to inexpensive drugs to fight a host of diseases.
 He may well be attacked by European consumers if genetically modified food shows up on their supermarket shelves without labels and against their will. 
 And he will be the chief referee in the global fight between heavily subsidized American farmers and their much poorer rivals in Africa and Asia, who say the subsidies are ruining their livelihoods.
That is just a portion of Mr. Zoellick's ambitious agenda to reconfigure American economic relations. It also includes a free trade zone that covers the Western Hemisphere and a network of other free trade deals with southern Africa, Southeast Asia, Australia and others. 
But with the president and most of the administration preoccupied by Iraq and the war on terrorism, Mr. Zoellick has pursued his agenda with little fanfare from the White House and sometimes with little attention.
Mr. Zoellick, considered a top-notch strategist by friend and foe alike, says that trade should not be forgotten in the war planning.
"The long-term war against terrorism has to include trade, openness and development," he said in a recent interview.
Implicit in the international rules, he said, is an even bigger goal: persuading other countries to accept American ideas about internal reforms that could eventually affect nearly every aspect of daily life.
"Trade is more than economic efficiency," Mr. Zoellick said. "It's about America's role in the world."
Being ambitious is one thing, but delivering the goods is quite another. Mr. Zoellick wins praise for his ability to think big and for his tireless efforts to build friendships with foreign leaders. But he has also found himself blocked by vested interests at home and abroad.
His attempt to help poor countries circumvent patents on drugs for AIDS and other epidemics has been thwarted by the pharmaceutical industry. His goal of opening agricultural trade has been undermined by America's own array of subsidies and tariff barriers.
Many experts say the administration paid far too high a price to win passage in Congress of "trade promotion authority," which allows the president to negotiate trade agreements and gives Congress the right to vote on it without any changes.
Besides capitulating to the powerful farm lobby in Congress, going along with an 80 percent increase in subsidies and a 10-year, $180 billion farm bill, the administration also agreed to protect steel makers with higher tariffs and promised to consult with Congress on a long list of industries -- orange juice, tomatoes, sugar and textiles -- before making any trade deals.
"Bush would have to have a real transformation in his agenda to deliver on his promises," said Gary Hufbauer, an analyst at the Institute for International Economics, a research group that supports free trade.
"The most important trade negotiator is Karl Rove," he said, referring to President Bush's top political adviser. "He really made the call on steel and on farm. He counts the votes."
A consummate Washington insider, Mr. Zoellick has deep roots in the Republican Party but is always careful to cultivate friendships with influential Democrats.
He became a trusted aide of James A. Baker III, both at the Treasury and State Departments during the administrations of President Ronald Reagan and the first President Bush. 
During the 2000 presidential campaign, he advised Gov. George W. Bush and joined his old mentor Mr. Baker in Florida during the post-election battle over vote counting.
White House officials say the president has nicknamed Mr. Zoellick "Z man," but he is not part of the innermost circle. Instead, he is respected and encouraged to roam widely. 
"Zoellick is undoubtedly one of the three or four smartest people I've ever encountered in my professional life," one senior White House official said.
When he is given a free hand, Mr. Zoellick has proved to be relatively adept at winning over his foreign colleagues.
Diplomats who watched Mr. Zoellick lead the revival of global trade talks in Doha, Qatar, immediately after the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001 gush over his talent to define an issue, come up with a solution and then a strategy to achieve it.
"If it were not for Zoellick, I don't know where we'd be," said Sergio Marchi, the Canadian ambassador to the World Trade Organization.
But when the administration weighed in on those talks in December, insisting that Mr. Zoellick block a proposal to allow poor countries to buy inexpensive generic drugs for all major epidemics, it brought the negotiations to a standstill.
The United States stood alone against the proposal. The other countries at the World Trade Organization meeting, as well as religious leaders and health advocates, had argued that out of a sense of compassion and responsibility for poor countries, the United States must agree to extend the privilege of buying low-cost drugs for diseases other than H.I.V. and AIDS; malaria; and tuberculosis.
"I am sort of amused by his approach -- shaking hands, patting shoulders, making nice words," said Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch and an adamant critic of free trade deals. "In the end, though, it's still the same demand -- hand over the money."
A prolific writer and a man driven to make his mark on the world stage, Mr. Zoellick has been plagued throughout his career with assertions that he lacks the kind of bonhomie and people skills that would help him widen his influence inside the administration and build broad-based coalitions outside it.
"I am a big fan and friend of Bob's, but I have to say it is amazing he's gotten as far as he has, given the number of enemies he's made," said a former official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
Brains are not in doubt; disposition is.
His fans say Mr. Zoellick, who is 49, is a visionary who combines diplomacy with the art of deal making. His detractors say he is also an arrogant man who is both abrasive and dismissive of those he considers inept.
Mickey Kantor, the first trade representative for President Clinton, said that sort of criticism came with the territory. 
"If you're aggressive and bright with a clear trade agenda, you're always going to get tagged with that kind of label," he said. "I'd be worried if you didn't have such a strong and ambitious man in the job."
How Mr. Zoellick handles himself and his multiple constituencies will affect the nation's widening trade deficit -- which in November reached a record of $40.1 billion, or 5 percent of the gross domestic product -- and his ability to convince wavering countries that tradewith the United States is better than conflict.
That fits with Mr. Zoellick's preoccupation with history. In his rare hours of relaxation, he says he is either running or studying history. He considers his greatest achievement to be his role in the first Bush administration as a senior negotiator who helped bring about the reunification of Germany.
In a speech at the Reichstag in Berlin last summer, he said he considered himself fortunate "to be among the final cohort of America's cold war diplomats, to have been one of the last of a long line of my countrymen who kept a promise to the German people: a pledge of Freiheit und Einheit" -- freedom and unity.
A Midwesterner with German ancestors, Mr. Zoellick received the Knight Commanders Cross from the unified German government.
His current preoccupation with Europe is far less benign. He is convinced that the United States has fallen behind Europe in signing free trade agreements. He has begun negotiations or signed new treaties almost weekly, saying that the United States cannot wait for the World Trade Organization to complete a new round of trade rules. 
"If some countries aren't ready to move, then we'll go ahead with those who are," he said.
But trade experts say that Mr. Zoellick is unlikely to complete any of the biggest deals before the end of Mr. Bush's first term.
Negotiations to lower farm barriers, a crucial component of the global talks, are already being resisted by the sugar, tomato and orange-juice industries -- each of which has enormous political power in Florida and with the state's governor, Jeb Bush.
Equally explosive is the issue of textiles, one of the most protected industries in America. The United States and most other countries pledged to abandon textile quotas by 2005, the same year that countries are supposed to reach a new global trade deal, but textile supporters in Congress and the next Democratic presidential candidate will oppose that with every means they have.
For now, Mr. Zoellick says his top priorities are to keep negotiations on track for a new global trade agreement, push ahead with a free trade agreement for the Western Hemisphere and complete more free trade agreements with individual nations to catch up with the European Union.
"I came in with the trade debate being dominated by the antiglobalization crowd and a bunch of defeatists who were saying globalization is bad," he said. "The debate is no longer about whether to support global free trade. It's about how."

HEADLINE: Education Reform Left Behind 

 BODY:
George W. Bush's promise to end "the soft bigotry of low expectations" that allows poor children to fall permanently behind at school was one of his most popular campaign themes. Americans who view education as the country's top priority were further encouraged when Congress passed President Bush's "No Child Left Behind" act one year ago, promising to erase the achievement gap between rich and poor students. But the presidential budget unveiled last week drops the ball. The money earmarked for aid to the country's poorest students is about 30 percent, or $6 billion, less than Congress called for last year. 
 So many education reform plans have started out with high ideals and strict standards, then fallen apart after a year or two of oratory and good intentions. This is the time when the public will begin to see if No Child Left Behind follows that sad pattern. 
 The states have filed their plans for boosting student achievement. But the real test comes when those states submit blueprints showing how they plan to get a "highly qualified teacher" in every class by the year 2006. Mr. Bush's budget doesn't provide the boost in funding that would be needed to dramatically increase the number of qualified teachers. In addition, the Department of Education has been sending mixed messages on this crucial issue, leaving questions about whether it intends to vigorously enforce this provision.
The teacher qualification statute in No Child Left Behind is very clear. It specifies degrees, competencies and training requirements for both established teachers and those who come through alternative certification programs. It specifically discusses rigorous tests for knowledge of content. This is both the most crucial part of the law and the most politically difficult for the states. Some might have to close down or reform colleges of education that are currently little more than degree mills. They would have to decline hiring unqualified teachers who would once have gotten jobs as a matter of course.
Many states also seem to be ignoring a provision of the law that requires schools to publish information on teacher qualifications and notify parents in writing when children are taught for any period of time by a teacher who doesn't meet those standards. Instead of bird-dogging the issue of teacher competence, the Department of Education is spending precious time and money on peripheral issues, like explaining to religious groups how they can tap into federal money through this program. This pleases the right-wing religious establishment no end, but is somewhat off the point. 
The department's behavior and Mr. Bush's skinflint budget send the wrong message to recession-ravaged states that are already looking for excuses to walk away from these expensive and politically sensitive reforms.

HEADLINE: Among California's S.U.V. Owners, Only a Bit of Guilt in a New 'Anti' Effort 

BYLINE:  By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN 

DATELINE: GREENBRAE, Calif., Feb. 6 

 BODY:
Encased in a massive black Toyota Land Cruiser, Shirley Collenette admits feeling a little guilty about her gas-guzzling, smog-inducing, planet-warming, road-hogging "armor," as she calls her sport utility vehicle.
 But need is stronger than guilt. 
 "The world is becoming a harder and more violent place to live, so we wrap ourselves with these big vehicles," said Ms. Collenette, a 46-year-old mother of two. "It's like riding a horse. You have more power." 
Like many other S.U.V. owners in Marin County, this corner of Northern California where wealth and liberal politics converge, Ms. Collenette has found herself stuck up the on ramp of a politically and culturally risky freeway. A fledgling anti-S.U.V. crusade has joined the list of trendy "anti" causes -- antismoking, antifur, antimeat -- and this has some members of the upper-middle class bristling in their bucket seats.
Hostility seems to be everywhere, with attacks from all directions.
Here comes the columnist Arianna Huffington and her nonprofit Detroit Project, with its soul-wrenching TV commercials linking S.U.V.'s to support of terrorism. The Evangelical Environmental Network, a coalition of Christian groups, declares Jesus "lord over transportation choices" and runs TV advertisements asking, "What would Jesus drive?" (Answer: not an S.U.V.) 
Earth on Empty, a group of Boston artists, plasters fake parking tickets on S.U.V. windshields that instruct drivers to "try to get honest with yourself." The Earth Liberation Front claims to have set fire to S.U.V.'s recently at a dealership in Pennsylvania. The posters at a recent antiwar rally in San Francisco said "Draft S.U.V. drivers first."
To the backlashers against the backlash, the Marin soccer moms with children, groceries and ski equipment for weekends in Tahoe, it can feel like a personal affront.
"How else am I going to get four children from A to B?" said Zoe Daffern, 41, of Kentfield. "I don't think we're going to solve the world's problems by getting rid of S.U.V.'s."
She certainly is not getting rid of her black Chevy Suburban. "It gives you a barrier, makes you feel less threatened," she said.
For all their bulk, S.U.V.'s are not as safe as many owners imagine them to be, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has said it might propose new standards that would force substantial design changes. These include adding side curtain air bags, to reduce the risk in rollovers, and possibly lowering the profile of the biggest models, to cut the risk to cars hit by S.U.V.'s.
And in response to tax laws that let businesses deduct $30,000 or more for supersized vehicles like the Hummer, Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, recently introduced a bill called the S.U.V. Business Tax Loophole Closure Act.
Other gas-guzzling vehicles are out there, like pickup trucks, but none as popular and as profitable. One of every four new vehicles sold last year was an S.U.V., said Jeff Schuster, director of North American forecasting for J. D. Power and Associates. 3,977,864 in all. Even with the economy slumping, he said, that number is expected to rise to about 4.15 million this year.
Government standards call for S.U.V.'s sold in the country to average 20.7 miles a gallon, while passenger cars must average 27.5 miles. The H2, the new Hummer model, weighs more than three tons and gets 11 miles to the gallon.
Sarah Jain, an assistant professor of cultural anthropology at Stanford University, said that the S.U.V. -- a vehicle marketed for the independence it is supposed to provide even while posing serious social costs, like smog and rollovers -- embodies many incongruities in the culture.
"It represents the inability of Americans to make a connection between consumption decisions and their social impact," she said. "The war -- and the Huffington ads -- are giving voice to that frustration."
To Todd Gitlin, a professor of journalism and sociology at Columbia University, the biggest surprise about the S.U.V. backlash is that "it took so long."
Ms. Huffington "pressed a button that was ready to be detonated," he said, on a topic made acute by the threat of war. "It is the transmutation of a big issue into a neighborhood issue. The S.U.V. is the place where foreign policy meets the road."
The Huffington commercials were financed by a $200,000 war chest. Critics have noted that the sponsors themselves have conspicuously consumed: Ms. Huffington, for instance, lives in a costly home in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles and owned a Lincoln Navigator S.U.V. before buying a Toyota Prius, a hybrid gas-and-electric subcompact. 
Csaba Csere, the editor of Car and Driver magazine, said the vilification of S.U.V.'s seemed somewhat arbitrary. The gas mileage of the pickup truck is just as horrendous as any S.U.V.'s, he said.
"I don't see how commuting to work in a 5,000-pound pickup is any less sinful than a 5,000-pound S.U.V.," he added. "I hope Arianna Huffington never gets into a limousine. It's a very fuel-inefficient vehicle."
The image of the S.U.V. taps into deep-seated yearnings in the American psyche, said Dr. Clotaire Rapaille, a medical and cultural anthropologist in Boca Raton, Fla.
With their image of strength, power and size, the S.U.V. connects to "reptilian" instincts that are important for reproduction and survival, Dr. Rapaille said, "disregarding the 'intellectual cortex' information that says rollovers are dangerous."
"My theory," he added, "is the reptilian always wins." 
The issue has made for dissimilar political bedfellows, Hollywood liberals and evangelical Christians. "They might not be part of a religious organization, but many are concerned about transportation choices for spiritual reasons," said the Rev. Jim Ball, executive director of the Evangelical Environmental Network.
"We've all seen the same evidence. First it was human health, global warming and oil dependence," Mr. Ball said. "With the Middle East troubles, another cause has sprung up. It's a moral issue."
People who love or hate S.U.V.'s will probably not be affected by the advertisements, said Dan Becker, director of the Sierra Club's global warming and energy program.
But "the people in the middle, who may have bought an S.U.V. and are now saying 'Gee' are beginning to think," he said. "Some of them will come to the right conclusion."
It is doubtful their ranks will include Kelly Kriston, 39, who was lusting over an orange Hummer H2 the other day in Marin County. It weighed 6,400 pounds and cost around $50,000.
As Mr. Kriston considered buying it, did he feel guilt? "Not one iota," he said. "I like having all that metal around me. It's got that massive feel-good factor."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: WASHINGTON; 
France and China Rebuff Bush On Support for Early Iraq War

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7 

 BODY:
The leaders of France and China rebuffed efforts by President Bush today to line up support for the use of force against Iraq within the next month or two. Their continuing resistance made clear the difficulty the White House faces in its attempt to win explicit new authorization from the United Nations Security Council for military action. 
 A day after he said he was open to pursuing a new Council resolution, Mr. Bush said that the 15-member Security Council would have to decide soon and that he was confident it would uphold "to the fullest" its previous demands that Saddam Hussein's government disarm. 
 But after phone conversations with Mr. Bush today, President Jacques Chirac of France and President Jiang Zemin of China both signaled that they wanted United Nations weapons inspections to continue for some time before they would support war. The French ambassador to the United States, Jean-David Levitte, told reporters here that by his nation's count, there were 10 or 11 Security Council members in favor of giving the inspectors more time. 
The administration showed no signs of deviating from its timetable of forcing a showdown within "weeks, not months," as Mr. Bush put it last week. But British and American diplomats began considering language and options for a new United Nations resolution, while the military buildup in the region continued, with the Pentagon sending a fifth aircraft carrier, the Kitty Hawk, to the Persian Gulf.
During a visit to American forces based at Aviano Air Force Base in Italy, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said the length of any war was unknowable, but then went on to estimate that it could be "six days, six weeks, I doubt six months."
On a day when the administration put the United States on high alert for terrorist attacks, the State Department issued further travel warnings for Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Israel. It also authorized the voluntary departure of dependents and nonemergency personnel at the United States embassies in those countries at government expense.
Administration officials said their efforts to line up international support for Mr. Bush's hard line against Mr. Hussein were benefiting from Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's presentation to the Security Council on Wednesday of previously classified evidence against Iraq. 
But Iraqi officials, continuing a counteroffensive against the American claims, showed reporters a ballistic missile site 50 miles west of Baghdad that had been singled out by Mr. Powell. They sought to prove that features of the site Mr. Powell had presented as ominous had more benign explanations.
In Britain, Prime Minister Tony Blair's government was forced to acknowledge that it had lifted parts of its most recent Iraq report from magazines and academic journals.
In Moscow, the Russian foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, said the crisis had entered a "very crucial phase," and urged Iraq to cooperate more actively with the weapons inspectors. But he said his government continued to believe that the matter could be resolved with "political tools" rather than military action.
At the White House, officials said Mr. Bush and his aides intended to spend the next two weeks focusing on diplomacy to bring together as broad and united an international front as possible for moving militarily against Iraq. But mindful of the potential political costs to the president of appearing wholly focused on foreign policy at a time of domestic economic weakness, they said Mr. Bush and his top aides would simultaneously undertake a public relations campaign in favor of the president's tax cut proposals.
Speaking to reporters outside the Treasury Department, Mr. Bush challenged the Security Council to follow up on the resolution it adopted unanimously in November, No. 1441, with another resolution calling for the use of force if Iraq continues to obstruct the inspections.
"This is a defining moment for the U.N. Security Council," he said. "If the Security Council were to allow a dictator to lie and deceive, the Security Council will be weakened."
Mr. Bush went on to say that "the U.N. Security Council's got to make up its mind, soon, as to whether or not its words mean anything." But he then restated his position that Resolution 1441 provided him with all the authorization he needed to take military action in any case.
"I have said that if Saddam Hussein does not disarm, we will lead a coalition to disarm him," he said. "And I mean it."
Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, said the diplomatic process of seeking support for a new resolution and trying to reach agreement on the specific language "is now just beginning," and he suggested that there was flexibility in the administration's position about how the resolution might read.
"What you are seeing here is a serious diplomatic effort under way, and it's going to continue," Mr. Fleischer said. He said the opinions of other world leaders would matter to Mr. Bush. "But make no mistake," he said. "He will also lead."
If his efforts at diplomacy today were any indication, Mr. Bush faces a difficult selling job with France and China, both of which can veto Security Council resolutions. 
After Mr. Jiang's 20-minute phone call with Mr. Bush this morning, the official Chinese news agency said Mr. Jiang had pointed out "that the two U.N. weapons inspections organizations in Iraq had made some progress" and that "support should be given to the two U.N. organizations in the strengthening of the weapons inspections."
Mr. Jiang had spoken earlier in the day to Mr. Chirac, pledging support for continued weapons inspections and telling the French leader that all efforts should be made to avoid a war, Chinese news agencies said.
Even before Mr. Bush spoke to Mr. Chirac, French officials made clear that they would resist Mr. Bush's pressure. A day after Mr. Bush said, "the game is over," Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin told reporters during a trip to New Delhi: "It's not a game. It's not over."
Speaking in Paris today, Mr. Chirac said, "France considers that in between the inspection arrangements as they exist now and war, there are many, many ways to disarm Iraq. We have still not gone to the end -- far from it."
After the call between Mr. Bush and Mr. Chirac, a French official said it was an "excellent conversation" that nonetheless did not produce a meeting of minds. Both leaders said they would agree to disagree, this official said, adding that Mr. Chirac said, "We respect the American position."
According to the official, Mr. Chirac spent part of the call simply explaining the French position to Mr. Bush, saying it was best that each side understood the other's position.
France's position continued today to be that it would not rule out backing a resolution authorizing force against Iraq, but only when it became clear that the inspections process would no longer work.
"Let's wait for the report of the inspectors," Ambassador Levitte said, referring to the report next Friday. He said that if they said they were at a "dead end," a decision on using force would be discussed.
Mr. Levitte said the French view on this was supported by 10 or 11 members of the Security Council, enough to block a resolution. But American diplomats said they thought that they had a good chance of getting the nine votes necessary to adopt a resolution, with the possibility that France, Russia and China might go along or at least not exercise their veto.
Mr. Fleischer said the administration's goal was not necessarily another unanimous Council vote. "Nobody has said that that is a standard that must be set," he said, noting that Germany, a Council member, is strongly opposed to a war.

 INVENTING JAPAN
1853-1964.
By Ian Buruma.
194 pp. New York:
A Modern Library Chronicles Book/
The Modern Library. $19.95.
 After Pearl Harbor, the Emperor Hirohito, according to Ian Buruma in this masterly short history of modern Japan, was in a "splendid mood." The well-traveled poet-sculptor Kotaro Takamura, who had visited New York and London, and lived for a time in Paris, the city of his idols Baudelaire and Rodin, wept with joy. The distinguished literary critic Takao Okuna, a witness to the devastating dive bombers and torpedoes in Hawaii, described the "sense of euphoria that we'd done it at last. . . . All the feelings of inferiority of a colored people from a backward country toward white people from the developed world disappeared in that one blow." A hundred years of fitful Westernizing, following Commodore Matthew Perry's famous "opening" of Japan to the West in 1853, had come to this, a suicidal attack in more ways than one. 
But even as its military propaganda trumpeted themes of Asian greatness and a rejection of Western values, Japan, as Buruma slyly notes, was still cribbing from the West -- though not from the liberal political traditions of England or the United States. Much of the "new Japanese order," he writes in "Inventing Japan," "was borrowed from European fascism and grafted onto more East Asian habits of thought." Such analysis is in keeping with the title and overarching argument of Buruma's concise and penetrating book: namely, that nations like Japan are made -- they are the result of certain political choices at certain times -- rather than born. Buruma, the versatile author of earlier books on Asia like "Behind the Mask," "The Missionary and the Libertine" and a recent and well-received study of Chinese dissidents, "Bad Elements," is deeply suspicious of any appeal to ancient traditions or ancestral practices, dismissing the code of the samurai as a "sign of idleness" in the inert feudal society that Perry helped bring down, and pointing out that emperor worship is a late "invention." He notes repeatedly how such claims, in a proud and nationalistic country like Japan, have been used to justify authoritarian clampdowns on human rights and political freedom.
Modern Japan, like modern Germany (to which Buruma often compares it), has shown a depressing affinity for authoritarian politics. The story Buruma tells is largely one of missed opportunities for the "sickly child" of Japanese democracy. Hisheroes, hardly household names in the West, are liberal-minded figures like Ryoma Sakamoto and Yukichi Fukuzawa. The low-ranking samurai Sakamoto, depicted in Japanese films as "a wild-haired protohippie with a sword," decided, faced with the gunboat diplomacy of Perry's black ships, that "the best way to fight the barbarians . . . was to learn all their tricks first." This became the official strategy of the Meiji period (1868-1912) and its "astonishing race for modernity." Sakamoto studied European constitutions and drafted a blueprint for a parliamentary democracy in 1867. Fukuzawa, another adherent of "learning their tricks first," founded a school, a magazine and a debating society in Tokyo to introduce Western learning and encourage bold and speculative thought. According to Buruma, Fukuzawa "was one of the first -- and still uncommon -- examples of an independent Japanese intellectual." But when the government sought to restrict freedoms of speech and the press during the 1870's, Fukuzawa relented. "Something died in the 1870's," Buruma concludes, "and with some notable exceptions, it never fully revived until 1945."
The Americans, to be sure, did little to nourish that "something." Convinced that the Japanese were a "childlike people who would run amok without imperial guidance," first Commodore Perry and then Gen. Douglas MacArthur, during the American occupation following World War II, adopted highhanded ways more appropriate to an emperor than a representative of democracy. MacArthur's decision to exonerate Hirohito of war crimes -- consistent with the view that the Japanese required a patriarch at the helm of the state -- muddied responsibility for the ruthless war waged by the Japanese in the Pacific and in Asia. "If the man who had been formally responsible for everything was innocent," Buruma writes, "it was hard to see how those who thought they were following his sacred orders could be found guilty."
Buruma's primary focus is on political history, and the chances and mischances of Japanese democracy. His treatment of Japanese cultural achievement, so fascinating to Westerners since the great world's fairs of the turn of the century, is surprisingly cursory. He may feel that the Meiji-era revivals of haiku, the tea ceremony and the martial arts are sufficiently known in the West, and besides, they hark back to an "aristocratic" Japan he dislikes. He mentions in passing that the early 1950's were "a golden age for Japanese cinema" while devoting a full paragraph to the ways in which film "was also a perfect vehicle for right- and left-wing anti-Americanism." Here again he may feel that Kurosawa and Ozu, who surely deserve as much credit for "inventing Japan" as the propaganda operatives of the 1950's, are familiar enough. The relatively obscure Taisho period of the 1920's, by contrast, is accorded a full and fascinating chapter; Buruma persuasively compares this brief flowering of cosmopolitan hybridity and democratic politics to Weimar Germany -- a moment of "hope for those who promoted freedom." 
Ian Buruma belongs to a generation of cultural critics -- including Michael Ignatieff, Tony Judt, Paul Berman and the French thinker Alain Finkielkraut -- who have come to prominence during the past decade or so. Inspired by cleareyed defenders of human freedom like Isaiah Berlin and Raymond Aron, they are as distrustful of enemies of democracy on the left as on the right. Buruma twice mentions that there was a Soviet judge, "one of Stalin's henchmen," on the international military tribunal that tried Japanese war criminals -- a warning against complacent distinctions between good guys and bad. In an epilogue, he holds out hope for a democratic Japan, a nation sufficiently mature neither to demonize nor to worship the great powers. His eloquent closing wish is that the Japanese, in their present economic crisis, might outgrow their "infantile dependency on the United States" and "finally bid the black ships farewell, because they no longer need them."

 FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT
The Story of a
Scientific Speculation.
By Jo-o Magueijo.
Illustrated. 279 pp.
Cambridge, Mass.:
Perseus Publishing. $26.
 ONE of the curiosities of life on earth is the obsession to lay down grids of rigid constraints -- the rules of chess or baseball, the form of a sonnet, or the Internal Revenue Service code -- and then try to stretch them to the limit. Those who excel at pushing the envelope -- chess masters, Olympic athletes, Washington tax lawyers, everyone it seems but contemporary poets -- are generously rewarded with riches and sometimes even public esteem. 
The most sophisticated of these sports is theoretical physics, and Jo-o Magueijo, a young Portuguese professor at Imperial College in London, has the markings of a champ. Judging from his new book, "Faster Than the Speed of Light: The Story of a Scientific Speculation," this is an opinion with which he would readily agree. 
In fact, if your reading list is already overpopulated, skip the book and cruise over to his Web page (theory.ic.ac.uk/magueijo) for a taste of the persona he presents to the world. As the page loads, a Java cartoon of a beer glass appears on the screen, emptying itself over and over as if the suds were being sucked up by a pulsating black hole. A photo of Magueijo "in action" shows him getting sloshed with some friends; there is a primer on cosmology, the study of the universe, and included on the site is a link to an Internet guide to the London rave scene. 
This kind of thing is fairly commonplace. Theoretical physics is populated by some of the smartest people outside Wall Street, and it is de rigueur to show that you are fiercely independent and definitely not a nerd. Where Magueijo hopes to distinguish himself from his pack is by showing that the speed of light, long held as an inviolable entry in the cosmological rule book, is not sacrosanct after all. It has slowed as the universe has grown older. If this can be proved, Magueijo argues, then some of science's most vexing puzzles can be solved. 
Consider the horizon problem, a staple of popular science books. Look out (with a suitably powerful telescope) at a galaxy 10 billion light-years away. According to the logic of the Big Bang theory, the light was emitted 10 billion years ago and is just now reaching this part of the universe. 
Now turn around and look 10 billion light-years in the opposite direction. You have successfully observed two regions of the universe that themselves are 20 billion light-years apart. Since the whole universe is only 15 billion years old, they will never be able to see each other or (since nothing travels faster than light) interact in any way. 
The weird implications of this become clearer if you imagine the earliest moments of the Big Bang. When the universe was a second old, and hence a light-second in radius, about 186,000 miles, opposite points on the circumference were twice that far apart, unbridgeable even by light. No matter how far back you go -- a millisecond, a microsecond -- the regions can never have been in contact. It is as if they exist as two separate universes. 
The reason this bothers cosmologists is that, so far as they can tell, the universe in front of us and the universe behind us are pretty much the same. They differ in detail, of course -- this galaxy here, that constellation there -- but in the most general sense, creation appears to be homogeneous. Galaxies are distributed in a more or less uniform manner, and in whatever direction you point a thermometer, space is the same temperature. But if certain parts of the universe never interacted, then why is there so smooth a blend? 
The favored explanation is a theory called cosmological inflation: suddenly for a few moments early in its history, the tiny universe began wildly expanding, far more rapidly than it does now. Those now isolated regions were originally close enough to touch. 
Some theorists find this a bit contrived, and Magueijo is one of a handful proposing a different solution: if the speed of light used to be faster, then neighborhoods that now seem hopelessly far apart were originally together. 
Those are the bare bones of the idea, which Magueijo elaborates throughout the book. Whether that notion is any less ad hoc than inflation is a matter of taste. Depending on how future experiments come out, his theory will one day be recorded as a stunning breakthrough or a forgettable detour down a cul-de-sac. 
THERE is nothing wrong with writing about a work in progress. What better way to give readers a taste for the messiness of real science, before the story has been sanitized in the retelling? But whatever his gifts as a theorist, as an author Magueijo is only partly successful. 
The curse of popular science writing is that almost nothing can be assumed. Here Magueijo rises to the task, using the first half of his book to lay out a nice refresher course. (A story about cows and electric fences makes the essence of special relativity about as clear as can be.) It's in Part 2, when he gets into the meat of the story, that the account becomes wearing. 
With a bit of patience one can keep up with the gist of his idea, called V.S.L. for "varying speed of light." But what is apparently meant to be an enlightening account of a theory-in-the-making is blackened again and again by a bristly protagonist who, at least as he depicts himself, is very difficult to like. 
Everywhere he turns, Magueijo tells us, he finds himself surrounded by stupidity. He refuses to submit papers to the journal Nature (the staff there is surely heartbroken) until the cosmology editor is castrated. (Jo-o the Iconoclast puts this in cruder terms.) The timid souls who fail to appreciate the daring of his speculations are likewise reviled. "Clearly something as wild as V.S.L. is an affront to their self-respect; so they need to see it fail." Or maybe they just think he's wrong. 
Even his sympathizers come in for ridicule if their support is not avid enough. When an older colleague decides that, on second thought, he doesn't want to collaborate on a paper about V.S.L., this can only be because he is suffering from a midlife crisis (he just turned 40). 
Magueijo is so openly contemptuous of the people who finance his intellectual recreations that he seems to be daring them to ground him for a week -- or cut off his allowance. "Personally, I would fire them all and give them a long prison sentence," he writes, "but you already know my thoughts on the matter." Yes, we know. This statement is near the end of the book, and we have been told many times. 
This kind of material is probably meant to be described in a review or jacket blurb as "irreverent." But at least since James Watson's "Double Helix," the fact that scientists have rivalries, opinions and even personal lives is hardly surprising. Though we get some glimpses here of theorists grappling with an elusive idea, too much of the story comes off as puerile. 
In the end, Magueijo assures us that, win or lose, it is he who will get the last laugh. If the theory is right his doubters will rush to claim credit, for "they are bandwagon passengers, those who play safe and lead an easy life." And if the theory is wrong? He'll burn that bridge when he comes to it.

 COUSIN FELIX MEETS
THE BUDDHA
And Other Encounters in China and Tibet.
By Lincoln Kaye.
Illustrated by Mei-lang Hsu.

 ONCE upon a time, in an impoverished lakeside village named Wolf Fang in central China, a boy dazzled the neighbors with his intellect. He was so brilliant that he was sent off to the regional high school; after graduation, he was chosen village chief. Unfortunately, Wolf Fang's grain supplies soon began to disappear. So did the village account books. When some of the peasants asked questions, they disappeared too -- into the county jail. Finally, two villagers fled to Beijing, found a lawyer, sat down with him at a noodle stall and knocked back a bottle of erh guo tou, a "resinous, 80-proof rice wine ideal for low-budget male-bonding rites." The three conspirators decided to sue the government to hold free elections in Wolf Fang.
The lawyer brought a crew from Chinese Central Television to Wolf Fang, and they began interviewing everyone in sight. This flummoxed the local thugs, who knew better than to beat people up on camera. Village officials ordered the cameramen to stop filming, but they refused, and it made for great TV. Of course, the show was too sensitive to be broadcast, but a Chinese friend showed a samizdat copy to Lincoln Kaye, an American who has been a longtime correspondent in Asia for The Far Eastern Economic Review. Kaye tracked down the lawyer and visited Wolf Fang for himself.
That story is one of several that animate his beautifully written and often amusing new book, "Cousin Felix Meets the Buddha." More a travelogue than a stock journalistic examination of China, it doesn't purport to tell us where that country is going. And yet this isn't a conventional traveler's account either: it doesn't describe an epic journey, and much of it recounts the author's adventures in Beijing, where he was based with his Taiwanese wife. Abandoning any pretense of laying bare the "real" China, "Cousin Felix" instead offers a series of engaging slices of Chinese life that are finely drawn and populated by fully formed characters. In other words, it meanders through several "real" Chinas.
Of the handful of unconnected stories that make up the book, the most engrossing is that of Wolf Fang, a village that is enjoying new freedoms but is far from living happily ever after. Kaye was drawn to Wolf Fang because it exemplified the trend toward village elections in China, a development that's presented as the cutting edge of Chinese democracy. He had seen some of these elections but didn't know what to make of them: "One after another, the villagers, androgynously lumpy in greatcoats, got up to proclaim their earnest concern for town welfare. Nobody delved much into programmatic particulars. In their (lack of) substance and their halting, rough-hewn cadences, the speeches sounded much alike to my untutored ear. Yet some drew rousing ovations, others loud guffaws, while a few evoked stony silence."
Many foreigners who have lived in China are similarly perplexed by these developments. While they seem to be taking local government in the right direction, ousting a tyrant who favors his own cousins as he allocates irrigation water is still a long way from participating in a sophisticated modern democracy. Indeed, the outcome in Wolf Fang seemed to confirm that conclusion.
In the end, the authorities held new elections and a dissident leader emerged as the village chief. But it wasn't exactly a thrilling democratic achievement. The stolen goods were never returned, the ousted leader was never punished and the higher-ups brought a previous leader out of retirement to be the village's Communist Party secretary -- leaving Wolf Fang with two leaders, the dissident trusted by the villagers and the party secretary trusted by the higher officials. "For the first time since liberation, we've got a village administrator in Wolf Fang who's not part of the local party hierarchy," frets Red Ox, the party secretary. "Not an ideal arrangement, but what can you expect from this new style of voting, all isolated and secret, like going to the toilet?"
In another chapter, Kaye presents us with a similarly ambiguous story, about the manager of a hospice in Beijing who was fiercely dedicated and magnificently generous. In fact, he so impressed Kaye's wife and her friends that they raised funds for his enterprise -- until the money vanished and the manager was discovered to be spending a fair amount of his time philandering with the nurses, a half-step ahead of his enraged wife.
The final section of the book -- and the one that provides its title -- concerns an expedition to a Tibetan area of Qinghai Province that Kaye took with an ethnic Chinese in-law and a Tibetan "living Buddha." Americans often think of Tibet in melodramatic terms because its people have been brutally persecuted by the Chinese, so Kaye makes a useful and neutral guide to the area. He writes frankly about the destruction of Buddhist sites and about Chinese who have lived in the region for decades without bothering to learn the local language. But he also writes of monks who go to the video store for tapes promising "Red Hot Russian Girls" and of Tibetan hostility to a Chinese-run primary school that teaches children basic arithmetic. As Kaye hints, some Tibetans are so antagonistic to anything Chinese that they cling to traditions that will simply leave them further behind.
One Tibetan monk is portrayed particularly vividly. "The soldiers beat me and left me for dead," he tells Kaye, recalling the Cultural Revolution. "I'd wake up praying. They'd beat me all over again, kill me once more. I'd wake up with mantras on my lips. Every time they'd see your lips move, they'd say, 'You're praying,' and beat you." The monk survived, and years later one of his former tormentors needed prayers for his dying mother. When the monk obliged, his erstwhile persecutor came to him in tears, asking, "How can I repay you?" As the monk relates it: "I said, 'Repay me for what? It's I who must repay you.' Because, you see, he'd been my teacher, although he never meant to be. And to any teacher, devotion is due."
The portraits in "Cousin Felix Meets the Buddha" don't present any grand theories about China and its people. But they offer a poignant and elegant suggestion of what life is like for some Chinese, told as if over a bottle of erh guo tou in a Beijing bar.

 ABANDON
A Romance.
By Pico Iyer.
354 pp. New York:
Alfred A. Knopf. $24.
 IN Pico Iyer's new novel, "Abandon," John Macmillan, an English graduate student of Islamic mystical poetry, is determined to "see the world in a Sufi light." It is why he has escaped from England: "Anything," Macmillan feels, "can be forgiven there except the longing to be better." He tells an English friend over dinner that he wants desperately to show "that what we have inside us are not just repressed demons and all that, but something radiant. Exalted." The difficulty of his task is made clear when his dinner companion appears "suddenly fascinated" by the lettuce on her plate. "Wherever," she asks, "did you get this dressing?"
It isn't just the English with their antispiritual irony who stand in Macmillan's way. Even in Santa Barbara, that sleekest of Californian idylls, said to be the original home of the hot tub, he finds himself struggling to make sense of the more obscure works of the prolific Sufi poet Rumi while fighting off his attraction to an elusive young woman named Camilla. He lets himself be further distracted by a futile search for a rare manuscript in the centers of the old Islamic world: Syria, Iran, Spain, India.
In much contemporary European and American fiction, the Westerner looking for consolation in the religions of the East usually invites a sententious kind of irony: wisdom can't be had, or so the message goes, for the price of an airline ticket to India or a weekend at a meditation retreat in the Catskills. But Iyer treats Macmillan's spiritual confusion and hunger with sympathy, even tenderness. This may partly reflect his own weariness with an aggressively secular Western modernity whose encounter with the traditional societies of Asia he first described in his 1988 travel book, "Video Night in Kathmandu."
Iyer, who was born to Indian parents, educated in England and now lives in California and Japan, wrote about how the vulgar energy of mass tourism and Western consumer culture had transformed such remote and antique parts of Asia as Bali: "I ran across a pizzeria, a sushi bar, a steak house, a Swiss restaurant and a slew of stylish Mexican cafes. Eventually, however, I wound up at T.J.'s, a hyper-chic fern bar, where long-legged young blondes in tropical T-shirts were sitting on wicker chairs and sipping tall cocktails."
Occasionally, however, Iyer's tone of wry worldliness gave way to ambivalence. In Bali, he found a paradise overrun by tourists. He couldn't help noticing the three kinds of evil defined in a pamphlet handed out to foreigners: "too much money from tourism, or the imbalance number between locals and visitors, or the local people who think about moneymaking work." He also went beyond the cliche of an Eden despoiled by tourism to wonder whether Bali, which struck him as "too lazy, too easy," could be a "real paradise." According to Iyer, a real paradise, "like a god or lover, must have an element of mystery about it; only the presence of the unknown and the unseen -- the possibility of surprise -- could awaken true faith or devotion."
This was the incongruously mystical side of the stylishly homeless and multicultural observer -- someone fascinated with newness and generally optimistic about peoples and cultures getting mixed up under the auspices of an American-led globalization. Iyer's feeling for old religions and spiritual traditions was more visible in "The Lady and the Monk," a 1991 memoir about Japan and Zen Buddhism. And in "The Global Soul: Jet Lag, Shopping Malls, and the Search for Home," published in 2000, Iyer seemed to be moving toward a melancholy skepticism about globalization and multiculturalism. "Everywhere," he wrote about Hong Kong, "I felt a crush of multicultural props offering one goodies that answered every need except for the ancient, ancestral ones that convenience and speed could not wish away."
Iyer included himself among the "entirely new breed of people, a transcontinental tribe of wanderers" or "transit loungers" who "pass through countries as through revolving doors." He worried about the "new kind of soul that is being born out of a new kind of life," asking: "What are the issues that we would die for? What are the passions that we would live for?"
It would be too easy to dismiss these anxieties of the global soul because they exist at a high level of frequent-flier mileage. But they are nevertheless acute for those who have them -- those like John Macmillan in "Abandon," as he sits in California in sight of the "bodies stretched out on the beach like pagan offerings" and "the Frisbees winging through the bright, blue day."
In an interview that Iyer's publisher included with the review copy of "Abandon," he speaks of California as symbolizing "the postmodern swirl (where everyday life can seem eerily like a movie script -- in development, rewrite or turnaround)." Clearly, California lacks the austerity Iyer found in Japan in the concluding chapter of "The Global Soul": the "ability to draw a strict line around itself -- to sustain an unbending sense of within and without." Not surprisingly, Macmillan can't figure out the poems of Rumi. Nor can he commit himself to the mysterious Camilla, who seems to know quite a bit about Sufism and who disappears from -- and reappears in -- his life with unsettling frequency.
Iyer charts Macmillan's dilemmas and his slow journey to mystical insight with a sensitivity to mood and landscape reminiscent of that other book by a religiously inclined writer about a lonely Englishman in California: Christopher Isherwood's novel "A Single Man." But it is apparent that Iyer wishes to do more than gently usher Macmillan and Camilla toward a Sufi-style redemption: the letting go of fears and certainties and the embracing of passionate love and ambiguity. In the aforementioned interview, he presents his new novel as enacting a central "conflict" of values between postmodern California and Islam, which Iyer thinks "has become a kind of shorthand for referring to those with a strong religious commitment."
Iyer's knowledge of Sufism equips him well to unsettle commonplace prejudices about Islam. With admirable tact and subtlety, and through some intriguing Iranian characters, he discloses the original meaning of "jihad" and reveals Ayatollah Khomeini as the author of delirious love poetry. But the clash of values that Iyer invokes is really a clash of unexamined abstractions; it has become an intellectually glamorous way of not talking about messier and deeper conflicts of a political and economic nature.
In any case, broad generalizations about the complex cultures and societies that exist within California and Islam may be the stock in trade of television pundits and realpolitik experts, but the novelist disregards social and historical specificity at the risk of undermining belief in his delicate illusion. Iyer rarely considered history or politics in his travel writings; he himself appeared in them as the perpetual outsider who had, in Salman Rushdie's words, "floated upwards from history" and now found himself at home nowhere and everywhere. In "Abandon," Iyer's main characters appear similarly weightless, defined as they are mainly through their emotional and spiritual concerns.
Iyer does not spend much time exploring their affiliations of class, race and nationality, or how they came to be so free of them -- things that feel essential in a novel aiming to say something important about the contemporary world. So it is that "Abandon," although a wise and graceful novel in many ways, can begin to seem, when striving for geopolitical significance, the work of a gifted travel writer who knows the surfaces of many societies and cultures but the depths of none.
It may be that like Macmillan, Iyer is interested only in the radiant and the exalted, and has little use for the murky past, for childhood traumas and repressed demons -- all the tangled private and social histories that constitute an individual self and tie it down to a particular place and time. "Abandon" ends with Macmillan and Camilla traveling through Iran, arriving at a new understanding of both Rumi's poems and their own selves. They are finally beginning, or so it seems, to see the world in a Sufi light.
There remains, however, something abrupt and unexplained about these breakthroughs. This is probably because the private, imprecise language of mysticism fits uneasily in the secular form of the realist novel. The last sentence of "Abandon" reads, "Poems are what we make of them." At least some fastidious readers outside California might think this sounds too much like "Well, whatever."

 RANDOM FAMILY
Love, Drugs, Trouble,
and Coming of Age in the Bronx.
By Adrian Nicole LeBlanc.
408 pp. New York:
Scribner. $25.
 Most often when the lives of the urban poor are chronicled, it's within the confines of a few familiar genres: policy reports, sociological studies, newspaper stories about the impact of welfare reform or drug laws. It is rare to read about those lives as, for instance, family sagas, in which character and temperament and circumstance all jostle for our attention, and detail accretes into textured portraits of individuals. So it is partly, but only partly, the novelty of Adrian Nicole LeBlanc's approach to the subject -- she spent 10 years hanging out with one hard-pressed, loosely defined family in the Bronx while she tracked its fate -- that makes this such an extraordinary book. 
The conventional compliment to pay a work of narrative nonfiction is to say that it's "novelistic" or that it "reads like fiction." You could certainly say that of "Random Family," and yet there are tasks a writer like LeBlanc must accomplish that are different, and in some ways more difficult, than a novelist's. For one thing, she must remain cleareyed about people to whom she owes a tremendous debt of gratitude for admitting her into the intimacies of their lives. And for another, she must hew to a plotline that is often stuttering and circular and decidedly lacking in resolution. None of the people she writes about veer definitively toward a newer or better life -- they tend toward the same tired grooves -- yet she makes their stories riveting.
When we first meet Jessica, one of two Puerto Rican girls the book pivots around, she's a gorgeous 16-year-old whose "appearance on the streets in her neighborhood usually caused a stir." Jessica was spectacularly skilled at her main pursuit: drawing boys and men to her. ("You could be talking to her in the middle of the bustle of Tremont and feel as if lovers' confidences were being exchanged beneath a tent of sheets," LeBlanc writes.) But she was much less adept at winning recognition as an aboveboard girlfriend -- the kind that guys in her neighborhood called their "wives." By the time she was 19, Jessica had a baby with one guy and a set of twins with the guy's brother -- though like her own mother, a hard partyer named Lourdes, she had little interest in child-rearing and almost no patience for children. 
Still, for a couple of years in the late 80's, Jessica enjoyed a kind of luck with a local Mr. Big called Boy George, who was a heroin dealer with his own brand of the stuff, Obsession -- the little glassines even sported their own red-stamped logo -- and rich, in a doomed, flash sort of way. While still in his early 20's he had a fleet of BMW's and Mercedeses, some of them said to be custom-rigged with Bondian gadgets like strobe lights that could blind a pursuer or devices that spewed out tacks with the flip of a hidden switch. At a party for his employees, on which LeBlanc reports with her usual density of detail, guests dined aboard a rented yacht on steak tartare, prime rib and skewered lamb. George dispatched employees to Jessica's roach-ridden apartment to fill her family's refrigerator with food, took her on getaways to the Poconos, and gave her a job first as a mill girl -- crushing bricks of heroin into powder -- then as a gal Friday, catering to his exacting tastes in clothes. He also beat her for disobeying him, and kept her locked in the apartment he rented for her. And when he went to prison for life, Jessica went to prison not long after, having refused to cooperate with the police in exchange for immunity. 
Coco comes into the story when, at 14, she starts dating Jessica's half brother, Cesar, a thug-in-training, who nonetheless shows sparks of sweetness and regret. Coco is compact, upbeat and tough in her own way -- she sticks razor blades in her ponytail and coats her face with Vaseline to prepare herself for street fights. But as it turns out, she also has heart -- as LeBlanc writes of her at one point, she had "survived extreme hardship without becoming hard" -- and her essential likability is what makes this book less depressing than it otherwise could have been. Coco limps into her 20's with five children -- two by Cesar, who is by then serving a nine-year prison sentence, one each by three other men -- and shuttling between bleak housing projects in the Bronx and in Troy, N.Y. Yet she is devoted to her children (one of whom is born severely premature, with attendant health problems) and cares for them decently under circumstances that ought to give pause to anyone who thinks "I Don't Know How She Does It" is the last word on the stresses of motherhood. "Just taking the bus was risky," LeBlanc writes at one point, "because Nautica was prone to tantrums and Coco's hands were full with Pearl and her portable oxygen tank. Sometimes Mercedes would fall asleep so deeply that she couldn't be politely roused." It seems close to amazing when Coco defies the local conventional wisdom about not entrusting your children to strangers and gets it together to send the two older girls to an upstate camp for underprivileged kids. They turn out to love it -- the earnest young counselors, the goofy sing-alongs, the Learning Center with its shelves of books and child-size tables -- though, carefully, they try not to bruise their mother's feelings with their enthusiasm for a way of life so different from the one she's been able to make for them. 
LeBlanc is economical in her general observations -- the book is overwhelmingly descriptive, not analytical -- but those she ventures feel earned and fresh. She's particularly sharp on the culture of prison wives and prison visits: the preoccupation with dressing your children just so for an audience with Daddy at the correctional facility, the awkwardness of long visits where there's nothing to do but talk, the kids who think their dads are teasing them when they won't take off their manacles or emerge from behind the glass, the men who legally marry one of their "stand-up girls" so they can have "trailers" -- conjugal visits, named after the RV's on the prison grounds where they take place. 
She's good, too, at pinning down certain elusive cultural attitudes. "Since there were few real options for mobility," LeBlanc writes, "people in Coco's world measured improvement in microscopic increments of better-than-whatever-was-worse. These tangible gradations mattered more than the cliched language of success that floated blandly out of everyone's mouth, like fugitive sentiments from a Hallmark card. . . . Thick and fed was better than thin and hungry. Family fights indoors -- even if everyone could hear them -- were better than taking private business to the street. Heroin was bad, but crack was worse. A girl who had four kids by two boys was better than a girl who had four by three. A boy who dealt drugs and helped his mom and kids was better than a boy who was greedy and spent the income on himself; the same went for girls and their welfare checks. Mothers who went clubbing and didn't yell at their kids the next tired day were better than mothers who did." 
Certain questions go unasked and unanswered in a book like this. Why does somebody like Coco keep having children, against all evidence that another child will not win her what she wants -- a stable partner, a decent house for her kids, some kind of security? LeBlanc doesn't step far enough back from her subjects to pose a question like that quite so baldly. She sees her subjects' faults, but she takes their explanations pretty much straight. So she tells us how babies, like the tattoos of boyfriends' names that Jessica and Coco and their friends are forever getting, are reckless pledges of love and loyalty in a culture that doesn't embrace the conventional ones -- marriage, for instance. She describes the way newborns, blameless and unblaming, can seem like a new start -- can for a short while actually do what they are supposed to do, which is rope men in, tether wispy families together. But then, in so many cases in this book, they don't. The men drift away or go to prison. The babies turn into toddlers, who are admired for a while when they are "bad"- when they act like pint-sized adults in ways that amuse the grown-ups -- but develop into kids with outsize problems, still looking for love and attention but now taking up too much space. 
LeBlanc has almost nothing to say about the larger world, its laws or politics or demographic shifts. None of the women in her book in any way illustrate the marked decline in teenage pregnancies over the last decade. Welfare reform -- the massive social transformation that has removed three million people from government rolls, and that journalists like Katharine Boo have reported on, brilliantly, for several years -- appears only as a brief mention: "In the meantime, national changes in welfare policy had finally caught up with her, and Coco either had to return to school or go to work." LeBlanc does evoke the obstacles even a drug-free mother as energetic as Coco faces in holding a job. At one point, she gets one she likes and is good at -- serving meals at an old-age home, where she manages to memorize each resident's name by the second day. But when Pearl, the baby born prematurely, starts suffering terrible bouts of vomiting, Coco quits to take care of her. Once she goes back to school, but quits after coming home unexpectedly one afternoon to find her boyfriend, who is supposed to be watching the kids, bagging crack in the kitchen.
In truth, you wouldn't want every book about poverty to be like LeBlanc's. As good as it is at foiling simple-minded or overly optimistic social reform schemes, there's a kind of Dreiserian fatalism about it. Its very dedication to portraying the multiplicity of hurdles, the bewildering entanglement of personal failure and structural inequality that marks lives like Coco's, allows a kind of exhaustion to creep in, not so much in the reader as in the would-be policy maker. Some books have to be fueled by a kind of willed optimism, even if that means turning your eyes away from some of the details.
Still, this is a painstaking feat of reporting and of empathy, and in a way its tight focus and scant context seem true to the insularity of the culture LeBlanc brings to light here. One evening, after Jessica has gotten out of prison and her daughter Serena is turning 16, Jessica splurges on a rented limousine to ferry the girl and her friends wherever they want in the vast city. But as LeBlanc describes the scene, they tool around aimlessly, sheepishly asking the limo driver where he thinks they should go, and end up, finally, just a few blocks from home. "They wanted to leave the familiar world behind," Leblanc writes, "but no one knew the direction out."

 BODY:
When Sheila Wessenberg's breast cancer was diagnosed and she needed a lumpectomy and then a mastectomy, her husband Bob's insurance covered her care. Then Bob lost his job in December 2001, and they and their two children went from living comfortably on his $102,000-a-year salary to facing bankruptcy. They managed to pay for health insurance out of pocket for six months, until the premiums jumped to $832 a month. After being rejected for Medicaid because they had too many assets, the Wessenbergs joined the ranks of the 41 million uninsured Americans. Sheila, who was forced to quit chemotherapy midtreatment, is tempting the odds. 
 "We used to have a little left over for nicer things and enough to start saving for a rainy day," says Bob, a 51-year-old former Lotus programmer who recently found an $11-an-hour job. "Then we got a rainy month and now we got a rainy year." Things remain dire, so his wife has turned to panhandling. 
 On this day, Sheila, 44, collected $150, thanks to one $90 donation. "I dressed myself up nicely today, and I wrote on the can: 'I am not a bum. I'm a mom. Please help,' " she says. Her husband's new salary and the $50 a week she earns doing clerical work aren't enough to make ends meet.
If they lose their house in Coppell, Tex., the family will have to split up, going to stay with different relatives who have offered to help. "Our 6-year-old, Amy, doesn't understand," Sheila says. "She was raised in a 'Let's go out to eat' kind of world, and every trip to Wal-Mart warranted a toy." 
With $2,800 in outstanding medical bills, Sheila (with 3-year-old Alex) has gone seven months without follow-up care. "I might die as a result of my poverty," she says. "Health care has to be changed. There is no reason that anybody should be shoved into homelessness and helplessness just to survive."

BYLINE:  By Jack Hitt; Jack Hitt is a contributing writer for the magazine. His last article was a profile of the Christopher Columbus revisionist Gavin Menzies.

 BODY:
'There's going to be a comedic section here," Bart Sibrel says. "Some man-on-the-street kind of interviews that I did." He hits the fast-forward control to race through a rough cut of his new documentary. Sibrel's studio, located along a strip of storefront recording joints and one-room editing suites known as Nashville's Music Row, is actually his tiny two-room apartment, crammed with mixers and Apple computers. On a Sony Trinitron, the video screeches to a halt and then rolls on some average folks exercising their First Amendment right to express heartfelt opinions on both sides of a debate. 
 One American says, "Yes, I think we walked on the moon." 
 Another American offers balance: "Jury's still out in my opinion." 
Sibrel cranks up the background music he has selected, and the familiar voice of R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe brings it on home: If you believed they put a man on the moon, man on the moon. If you believe there's nothing up my sleeve, then nothing is cool.
Sibrel is part of a new generation of conspiracy mega-theorists. They don't toy with the small stuff. Ever since the passing of that sweet, simpler time -- when the Trilateral Commission ordered the hit on John Kennedy and the Queen of England managed the drug cartels -- the narratives of big suspicion have been distorted by the same force that has reshaped our partisan politics, action movies and morning TV talk shows: outrage inflation. To be noticed now, a theory must be of a scope only Stephen Hawking could measure, and it must be promulgated by an amiable spokesman who can deftly juggle often absurd contradictions. Sibrel is not your father's conspiracy theorist -- some grumpy autodidact with a self-published book raging at the gates of the establishment. Sibrel came of age in the post-Watergate era. He has absorbed the real lesson of the last two decades: push for belief in ever bolder and more unlikely ideas. Plus, he knows how to make decent television.
Sibrel's first documentary, "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon," is a 47-minute feature contending that what people saw on their television screens that famous July night in 1969 was in fact filmed on a back lot. (Sibrel says he believes that it was probably directed by Stanley Kubrick and shot at Area 51 in Nevada.) 
Sibrel introduces his thesis with a lighthearted visual montage of real rockets, entertainingly blowing up. As Dinah Washington performs her 1962 hit "Destination Moon" ("Come and take a trip on my rocket ship, we'll have a lovely afternoon"), one rocket after another fires off, then hooks right back around to plunge nose first into the launching pad and explode in a spectacular ball of fire. ("Kiss the world goodbye, and away we'll fly, destination Moon.")
Statistics are vague, but somewhere between 6 and 10 percent of Americans say they don't believe astronauts ever landed on the moon. That percentage is growing, in part because conspiracy theorists now have easy access to media tools -- jump cuts, dissolves, special effects, studio-quality voice-over, zippy credits -- that bolster their theories with something they've never had before: the elegant formatting of television truth. 
The megatheories provide huge umbrella explanations of the world around us. The black-helicopter/New World Order videos that began popping up after the collapse of Communism still sell well. "The Bible Code," which argues that events in the past and the future were encrypted 3,000 years ago in Holy Scripture, is again a best seller in its sequel edition. Sibrel is a smaller-scale challenger, but his sales are growing; so far he has moved 20,000 copies of his first film, all through the Internet.
To the generations raised after the moon shot, Sibrel's questions do tease one's curiosity: Why is there no crater beneath the lunar landing module, even through it could allegedly fire 10,000 pounds of thrust? Since the only light source on the moon was the sun, why do the astronauts' shadows tilt in toward each other in some photographs, instead of running parallel? Why is the flag waving in the breeze on an airless moon, and why are there no stars in the dark space sky?
NASA has been confounded by these questions, though not because the agency is unable to answer them. Rather, the old science geeks believe it is beneath their SAT scores to respond at all. As James Oberg, a noted space writer, recalls: "NASA put out this press release in 2001 that said something like: 'There's a debate about whether we went to the moon. We did.' End of press release. They are hampered by their own conceit." While NASA may have the facts on their side, in terms of understanding how the contemporary media work, the space agency is light years behind Bart Sibrel. 
The nasa.gov Web site, for example, refuses to debunk hoaxers directly. Rather the tone is often one of child's play, including suggested classroom exercises to demonstrate rumor-mongering and truth demolition: "Hoax Cuisine! The Proof is in the Pudding! -- Students can make a delicious hoax right in the classroom! Chocolate pudding, chocolate crumbs, gummy worms . . . is it something from the fishing-supply storeor the kitchen?"
Such countertactics were shown to be especially outmatched when Fox Television first ran its own moon-hoax documentary in February 2001, based in large measure on Sibrel's work. By last summer, people at NASA finally decided to meet the propaganda head on and hired Oberg to develop a counterconspiracy media strategy. Ultimately his task was to publish his work in order to reassert control over the story and to prove once again that, yes, Virginia, there is a Neil Armstrong. 
But not long after Oberg was hired, NASA was embarrassed by press reports of the assignment and panicked at the thought of being seen as surrendering intellectual equivalence to the hoaxers. "We canceled the program," a spokesman, Bob Jacobs, told me. "There is no book deal. We are not taking on the hoaxers." Oberg was fired, and NASA returned to its old posture of benign neglect. 
"I'm writing the book anyway, and now commercial publishers are interested," Oberg said from his home. "We live in a time teeming with conspiracy theories, and people, especially teachers, have little to help train students in critical thinking." Oberg is driven, in part, by the achievement of Sibrel's documentary. With its British-accented narrator, winking Letterman sensibility and occasionally ominous tone, the documentary is technically masterly at undoing the truth of the past. "It's the best piece of propaganda since Leni Riefenstahl's 'Triumph of the Will,"' Oberg says.
Over a lunch of fried chicken and gator tails, Sibrel explained to me that his interest in the moon dates to his childhood, when his father received Apollo photographs courtesy of the Air Force. "I had those pictures all over my bedroom walls," Sibrel said. "My father was an electronic warfare officer. He programmed the nuclear bomb on board a B-52, like in the movie 'Dr. Strangelove."'
When he was 14, Sibrel said, he first saw the moon-hoax idea mentioned on TV, and his faith in NASA developed its first cracks. "I went into my bedroom and looked at the pictures again and wondered," he recalled.
His doubt remained on low boil for a decade, until his mid-20's, when, Sibrel said, "I found out Neil Armstrong had never given a single one-on-one interview." He grew more suspicious. 
At that point, Sibrel said: "I believed there was a 25-percent chance we didn't go to the moon. It was a gradual thing." Sibrel's got his credibility chops down. No flash-of-light epiphany for him; his change of heart was slow, in the way of science, occurring after the labored accretion of evidence. As he fit the pieces together, Sibrel began to tell and retell himself this new version of history enough times that he came to seriously doubt that men had landed on the moon. 
His new understanding emerged against the backdrop of an era of perpetual scandal in Washington. Each administration seemed destined to have one. Watergate, Billygate, Iran-contra, B.C.C.I., Monica -- each usually attended by failed cover-ups. By the time of the frenetic scandal- and rumor-mongering of Clinton's second term (sex, perjury, job-fixing, land deals, missing records, murder, mayhem, drug dealing -- have I left anything out?), Sibrel had broken on through to the other side. He'd embraced the paradox that beats at the heart of all government conspiracy theories: in order to cover up their incompetence, the feds had to be extraordinarily competent. There is only one achievement more technically complex than a real moon landing: a fake one.
What drove him to this new level of understanding, Sibrel said, was not simply the mounting evidence. It was Jesus. Just before his lunar revelation, Sibrel explained, he had been carrying on a chaotic life of wenching and drugging. He gave up his party days, broke off a relationship devoted to "fornication" and became friends with the Lord. It made perfect sense that the new clarity with which he saw his own life might also be good for the nation. Then and there, all the pieces of the hoax finally added up. The greatest achievement of a great nation was a debauched lie. America was what Sibrel had once been: a wretched sinner.
"I remember that I cried and cried," Sibrel said of his new faith (moon-hoax, that is). "And I thought, Oh, the wickedness of humanity."
The standard moon-hoax theory goes something like this: Unable to get to the moon and desperate to win the cold war, President Nixon approved a fake moon landing to frighten the Russians. Sibrel's version borrows a great deal from his predecessors, "lay scientists" like Ralph Rene, a garage inventor who taught himself physics. Rene's book, "NASA Mooned America," collected the disparate evidence in a single place. He himself leaned on the work of Bill Kaysing, whose book is punlessly titled "We Never Went to the Moon."
Although many contemporary moon-hoax theorists simply repackage the old evidence, Sibrel has made what he considers one great contribution to the gathering file. After soliciting boxes of old film images from NASA, he found that the agency had accidentally sent one in which the opening frame warned: "not for general public distribution."
"It was like finding the Zapruder film," Sibrel said with a smile. His entire documentary is built around a couple of moments in this tape, framed with eerie music and a narrator's voice dripping with Bill O'Reilly incredulity. In one scene, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins, the Apollo 11 crew that first went to the moon, practice a midflight talk with the public while voices from Houston offer pointers. Seeing it might remind most of us of NASA's obsession in those days with practicing everything, every action from boarding the capsule to getting out after splashdown. But if you're inclined, here's what you see: actors being coached through their lines. 
And there's more. On this tape there is a short scene in which the astronauts have turned out all the lights in the cabin and put the camera up against a porthole to shoot the famous image of our blue-green spheroid floating serenely in black space. At one point, an arm moves in front of the camera.
"What is that?" Sibrel asked. "The arm of God?" Others might simply conclude that the camera was just not snug against the window and an astronaut's arm passed in front of it, but Sibrel says he believes the explanation is more complex -- that because the rocket never left low earth orbit, the astronauts must have placed in the porthole a transparency of a floating earth. If you're confused, don't worry. I never understood what he was saying, and I think that's the point.
Just as the magic bullet in the Kennedy assassination relies upon the vagaries of trajectory ballistics, there's just enough fuzziness and talk of "perspective theory" that after a day of crunching evidence you can find yourself stumbling out into the bright sunshine of Nashville, thinking, "Maybe the jury is still out."
There are now several Internet sites unaffiliated with NASA that struggle to answer the questions raised by the new conspiracy theorists. One, called badastronomy.com, is run by Phil Plait, an astronomer with Sonoma State University in California. If you get him on the telephone and ask him to run through the paces of the evidence, the weariness in his voice is audible. 
No landing crater? "The module came in slow and sideways to touch down with not much more pressure per square inch than you create jumping up in the air and landing in your shoes. Sure, it can fire 10,000 pounds of thrust. And your car can go 75 miles per hour, but not in the driveway."
Nonparallel shadows: "Ever seen parallel railroad tracks out to the horizon?"
Waving flag: "No, a flag wrinkled from three days of being packed tight, hanging from a horizontal rod like a bunched-up curtain."
No stars: "Go out tonight and take a picture of a friend beneath a bright streetlight. Then look for the stars."
Obviously, the process of chipping away at something as iconic as the moon shot can't be done alone. It requires the assistance of other news media. Just as Matt Drudge published every possible rumor about Bill Clinton, permitting the half-baked ones to seep upward by a kind of capillary effect into, say, the pages of Newsweek, the Fox documentary "Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon?" borrowed heavily from Sibrel's work, smoothing away the uglier, more libelous stuff and leaving only the fancy edits and the questions about fluttering flags. "The Fox show did incredible damage," Plait said. "After it aired, a new kind of doubt was created. I had a geology major at my college tell me she was no longer sure that all the pictures were real."
In Sibrel's second documentary, he expands on his previous work by borrowing a mainstream tactic: the ambush interview. With cameras rolling, he has confronted nine astronauts, shoved a Bible at each one and challenged them to swear to God that they had been to the moon. Although some of the astronauts in fact did take the oath, Sibrel doesn't like to talk about them. Like any good TV producer, he knows where the action is. 
Wheeling around in his editing chair, Sibrel asked, "Do you want to see Buzz Aldrin punching me in the nose, Ed Mitchell kicking me in the butt or John Young threatening to hit me in the face?"
Aldrin's right hook to the nose is particularly impressive. Outside a hotel, Sibrel suddenly appears in front of the second man to walk on the moon and badgers him with the Bible. Aldrin recognizes him, and it's no surprise: earlier in the year, Sibrel had conned Aldrin into a regular interview. On that first occasion, when Aldrin figured out the documentary's angle, he ripped off his microphone and provided Sibrel with a quick overview of his theories: "I think you're full of astronaut jargon deleted ," Aldrin explained. 
On this second encounter, Aldrin tried to brush Sibrel aside several times. When that failed, the astronaut launched his fist in a graceful parabola that landed, without any guidance from Houston, right between Sibrel's eyes. 
Sibrel's efforts to embarrass Neil Armstrong, on the other hand, are revealing in a different way. When Sibrel confronts him on camera at a corporate board meeting, Armstrong is visibly shaken and awkwardly nervous.
"Notice Neil Armstrong is shaking like a leaf?" Sibrel said, then added: "Isn't it curious that in the 30-plus years since Apollo 11, Neil Armstrong hasn't given a single one-on-one on-camera interview? Not one. Not to Barbara Walters, Walter Cronkite. Not one interview."
Makes you kind of wonder, doesn't it? 
Later on, I saw another clip of Armstrong. It was from a 1999 appearance at the White House, on the 30th anniversary of the moon shot. He is speaking while a room full of children listen. He was just as nervous as he was in the other clip. But it's not a furtive awkwardness; rather, it's something far more rare. Watching him, among schoolchildren, I recognized something you no longer see on television. Neil Armstrong is shy. 
Seeing that familiar face again transported me back to that July night when he walked on the moon. Todd Poore and I, both 12 years old, got to stay up late, and my family's snowy black-and-white Motorola was wheeled into my bedroom for the occasion. We were all young then, television included. 
But we're all grown up now, and we all know what judicious editing, special effects and a smart selection of music will do to that Armstrong clip. We will see what Sibrel sees: a feeble man quaking in the face of an unholy truth.
All religious conversion is about coming to believe what once seemed impossible, and the greater the distance between the old degraded story and born-again revision, the more credible the teller of tales. Now this mode of revelation has visited our politics. It's no coincidence that the on-camera purveyors of an evangotainment tape insinuating that Clinton slaughtered eight people were Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell. Sibrel's story is just another variation of this, another story of our national wretchedness. 
To NASA, Sibrel is a media leech, gaining attention by faking the fakery. But to others, he's making reality TV exposing the greatest lie since Eve explained her new diet plan to Yahweh. As public policy, the conversion format may never take hold in Washington. But beneath the mainstream radar, it's fueling a new kind of acceptable anti-Americanism. It is a secular faith that believes the country's true self has been bloated by taking pride in lies. Its credo holds that America must be humbled by the facts of its weakness before its actual greatness can be revealed. Only once we confess that we never went to the moon will we truly be able to get there.

HEADLINE: Tangled Up in Spam 

BYLINE:  By James Gleick; Copyright 2003 James Gleick; James Gleick often writes for the magazine about technology. His next book, "Isaac Newton," will be published in May.

 BODY:
I know what your in-box looks like, and it isn't pretty. It looks like mine: a babble of come-ons and lies from hucksters and con artists. To find your real e-mail, you must wade through the torrent of fraud and obscenity known politely as "unsolicited bulk e-mail" and colloquially as spam. In a perverse tribute to the power of the online revolution, we are all suddenly getting the same mail.
 The spam epidemic has just a few themes and variations: phone cards, cable descramblers, vacation prizes. Easy credit, easy weight loss, free vacations, free Girlz. Inkjet cartridges and black-market Viagra, get-rich-quick schemes and every possible form of pornography. The crush of these messages on the world's networks is now numbered in billions per day. One anti-spam service measured more than five million unique spam attacks in December, almost three times as many as a year earlier. The well is poisoned. 
 Spam is not just a nuisance. It absorbs bandwidth and overwhelms Internet service providers. Corporate tech staffs labor to deploy filtering technology to protect their networks. The cost is now widely estimated (though all such estimates are largely guesswork) at billions of dollars a year. The social costs are immeasurable: people fear participating in the collective life of the Internet, they withdraw or they learn to conceal their e-mail addresses, identifying themselves as user@domain.invalid or someone@nospam.com. The signal-to-noise ratio nears zero, and trust is destroyed.
"Spam has become the organized crime of the Internet," said Barry Shein, president of the World, one of the original Internet service providers. "Most people see it as a private mailbox problem. But more and more it's becoming a systems and engineering and networking problem." He told the 2003 Spam Conference in Cambridge, Mass., last month that his service is sometimes pounded by the same spam from 200 computer systems simultaneously. "It's depressing. It's more depressing than you think. Spammers are gaining control of the Internet."
If your own experience doesn't seem this bad, just wait. You may be a recent convert to e-mail; your address may not yet have percolated through the deep swamp of spammer databases (truly a land of no return). Quantity matters, psychologically. If five daily spams seem merely annoying, 20 or 30 will be maddening, creepy -- and chilling. Some avid Internet users report a hundred or more a day.
The harvesting of e-mail addresses by spammers is relentless and swift. Investigators for the Federal Trade Commission recently posted some freshly minted e-mail addresses in chat rooms and news groups to see what would happen; in one case, the first spam came in nine minutes. Addresses are sold and resold on CD-ROM's in batches of millions. If you have ever revealed your e-mail address in a public forum, or allowed it to appear on a Web page, or used it in buying merchandise online, your experience of the online world is sure to sound like this: "Looking for love?" "$900 weekly at home." "Fwd: Your winning lottery ticket." "Biggee your penis 3 inches in 22 days." "Have you received your cash?" "Hard core so intense it's sinful." "Advanced degree = advanced career." "Natural enlargement where you need it." "Live chat room with real women!!"
Your correspondents claim to care about your health. Unfortunately, they care mainly about the length of your penis and the size of your breasts. They do not discriminate by sex; either way, you are assumed to feel inadequate. They offer implants and human growth hormone therapy. They are pharmaceutical enthusiasts, but we're not talking about penicillin; it's "Viagra-Phentermine-Xenical-Propecia and MORE!" They care about your finances. Here come the guaranteed paths to mortgage deals of a lifetime, cheap insurance, million-dollar prizes, hot stock tips and secrets of commodities trading.
Parents panic when they discover that their teenagers have mail from "Mellisa" at SexAffair.org: "Hi there! I got your e-mail from Jennifer and I just wanted to tell you strait up, I really like -! She told me u're into -- too. Lets hookup for a juicy weekend." Does this mean the kids are checking out porn sites? (No, it does not.)
Another major spam category is "fast cash -- work at home." More often than not this is a do-it-yourself kit -- you pay up front, and they send you everything you need to be a spammer from your own PC. 
How this bane came to sully the greatest revolution in personal communication since the telephone makes for a complex and troubling story, with no promise of a happy ending. From the beginning, the Internet has tried to fight spam with grass-roots vigilantism. Software companies now routinely build spam-filtering technology into their e-mail programs, and independent programmers are struggling to devise more creative methods for separating wheat from chaff. Millions of individual e-mail users are trying to devise coping strategies of their own. Consumer advocates are working mostly in vain to persuade lawmakers to take action in what should, after all, be a popular cause. 
Each in its own way, for different reasons, these efforts are failing.
Long, long ago, in a previous century, when the Internet was young, people discovered both the power and danger of mass e-mail. One online pioneer, Brad Templeton, says he believes he has pinpointed the first e-mail spam: in 1978, a Digital Equipment Corporation salesperson typed several hundred addresses by hand -- those of scientists and researchers on the Arpanet, the predecessor of the Internet -- and sent them an announcement of a product presentation. A small furor erupted. "Where is the line to be drawn between this sort of thing (if it is to be allowed at all) and advertising?" a recipient at Stanford University asked plaintively. The Net was a scientific and military enterprise -- most emphatically noncommercial.
The modern epidemic began 15 years later, coinciding with the explosive popularization of e-mail in 1993 and 1994. A chain letter began to spread, titled "MAKE MONEY FAST." And a pair of Arizona immigration lawyers, Laurence Canter and Martha Siegel, bombarded the Internet with a notorious advertisement about the "Green Card Lottery." Angry recipients counterattacked, overwhelming the lawyers' service provider with complaints. But these proto-spammers were unrepentant. Eventually they tried marketing a book, "How to Make a Fortune on the Information Superhighway: Everyone's Guerrilla Guide to Marketing on the Internet and Other On-Line Services."
Frauds and cons from the horse-and-buggy world quickly adapted to the new technologies. One of the most shameless is the so-called Nigerian spam. The subject is "Urgent/Confidential" or "Assistance Required." The sender confides that he is a bank manager or political exile or son of the late commander in chief of the armed forces in Lagos. He explains that he needs your help in transferring $21.5 million in cash out of the country. "I will like you as an foreigner to stand in as the next of kin. If only you will send your bank-account information, you can have a 40 percent cut." It's always the same letter, more or less. "Should you not be in a position to assist, this deal has to remain a secret till the end of time." Sure. Some secret.
Few Internet users realize that this particular con began with handwritten letters and only recently grew into a mass-market business, in the category of World Gone Mad. Perhaps there's a reason for one con artist to "solicit for your assistance in this mutually benefiting business transaction"; surely it defeats the purpose when they all send this same e-mail several times a day, week in and week out. Today it's from Dominic Tutu and Dominic Egbu, separately. Before that it was Dr. Lawrence Adu and Dr. Francis Oputa and Dr. Williams Ossai and Dr. Shuaibu Hamza. There can hardly be any unsuspecting victims left, so you have to wonder -- what's the point? 
Early Internet users reacted so angrily to commercial mass mailings that fake return addresses became a necessity. America Online and other large service providers began closing accounts used for spam. The next big step -- indispensable to the spam epidemic -- was the rise of free mail services: Hotmail, now owned by Microsoft, and Yahoo. Two features of the modern Internet (both more or less accidental) make spamming easy: service providers desperate for market share at all costs; and an architecture of relatively open and insecure mail gateways. Together these enable hit-and-run e-mailers to create quick, disposable, false identities. It's why so many of your correspondents have addresses like "buffy0412xxxmeb13mxy@hotmail.com" -- though that one, offering me "eBay insider secrets," day after day, turns out to be not just a pseudonym but also a forgery, not a real Hotmail account at all.
For that matter, anyone named Buffy who sends me e-mail is a spammer, judging from my experience. A suspicious number of my correspondents now seem to be called James. It seems safe to assume that a sender named NoMoreConstipation68487 is a spammer. Likewise for Persondude1 -- but no, that turns out to be my 11-year-old nephew. Sorting the good from the bad looks easy, but it's a real problem, both for humans trying to manage their in-boxes and for artificial intelligence.
A human being, looking at a sender called "Ug56miZ5w@msn.com," can guess it's not a real person. Looking at subjects like "Do your butt, hips and thighs embarrass you" and "My husband's not home, come and have me!" and "Make money fast" (yes, this ancient artifact still makes the rounds), a human being knows enough to press the delete key. Why can't a computer be that smart? 
Many programmers are working to automate the filtering of spam. The spammers, of course, are working to stay ahead. They forge identifying headers; some of your spam now appears to have been sent to you by you. They continually change the content, even adding random text. They make their subject lines sound real, or at least plausible:
* How are you?
* Thanks for requesting more information.
* Error in your favor.
* It is critical that your Internet connection is fixed.
* Someone is waiting for you.
* Listen to what people are saying about you.
* Pentagon readies war plans. (This one was an attempt 
to sell heating-oil options: "$5,000.00 minimum investment.")
Another gambit is to have their computers insert your name:
* James, is this still your e-mail?
* James, your paycheck has just increased!
* Hello, Gleick, darling.
All this in the name of tricking you into opening the message. "Baby you're so strange" -- can you resist? "Do you remember me?"
Every major e-mail program now comes with filters meant to spare you the trouble. The idea is for the computer to detect spam and delete it, or at least move it into a separate folder where you can while away your time examining it later. Microsoft's e-mail clients use simple rules. If the first eight characters of the sender's name are digits, they guess the mail is spam. Likewise if the subject contains dollar signs and exclamation points, or if the message contains "money back" or "check or money order" or "over 21" or "Dear friend."
This approach catches less and less spam as time goes on, because the spammers buy the same software and test their mail in advance. If you're an enthusiastic computer user, you can add filters of your own. You can even download interesting filters from sites organized by other spam victims. You can't expect perfection. There will always be false negatives -- junk mail that manages to sneak through.
More troublesome, however, is the problem of false positives -- legitimate mail that is blocked. If your filter deletes what it thinks is spam, you may never see the message from your long-lost high-school sweetheart, who finally wants to make contact but uses too many exclamation points, or calls you a dear friend, or mentions sex. 
Most corporate networks use spam filters, and many Internet service providers are also installing them, in response to pressure from their customers. The effectiveness varies widely. People use whitelists (friends) and blacklists (known spammers). People get frustrated and overcompensate, putting all of hotmail.com and yahoo.com and aol.com on their blacklists. "Am I likely to miss important e-mail?" writes Michael Fraase, a Minnesota Web consultant who goes to these extremes. "Probably, but I have no way of knowing. Unfortunately the spam problem has become so bad that it's on the verge of rendering e-mail useless."
One of the best tools for network administrators is an ever-evolving program called SpamAssassin, which uses a range of tests and a point system to identify spam. This is subtler than simple yes-no filtering. Messages get points for capitalized words like AMAZING and GUARANTEE and PROFITS. They get points for mentioning Viagra -- especially "natural" or "herbal" -- or penises or breasts. They get points for requesting a credit-card number, for including a toll-free number and for offering a full refund. They get points for odd-looking dates: much spam appears to have been sent in 1941; much appears to have been sent from the future. They get points for lively font colors and embedded scripts or links. 
In a delightful SpamAssassin irony, a message gets extra points for declaring that it is not spam. After all, such statements are invariably lies. So are the following:
* This is a one-time mailing.
* There is no catch.
* This message is sent in compliance with spam regulations.
* You're getting this message because you registered with one of our marketing partners.
Like so much of the online world, spam becomes circular and self-referential and tail-chasing. Mail titled "Clear your in-box of spam" and "Say goodbye to junk e-mail" has to be spam.
SpamAssassin deploys hundreds of rules, adding more all the time and readjusting the weighting scheme. If a message has enough points, it's probably spam. But false negatives and false positives cannot be ruled out.
The newest approach to a technological solution is a different kind of filtering, based on statistics. A computer scientist, Paul Graham, caused a stir in the online world last summer with a proposal for adaptive, probabilistic filtering. The idea is to give up trying to list specific features of spam, to quit trying to get inside the mind of the spammers. "Over the past six months, I've read literally thousands of spams, and it is really kind of demoralizing," Graham declared. "Norbert Wiener said if you compete with slaves you become a slave, and there is something similarly degrading about competing with spammers."
Instead, the new software keeps track of all the words in every e-mail, calculates their statistical probabilities as spam-indicators and adjusts these with experience. With his new method, he claims to be catching more than 99 percent of spams, with no false positives.
Graham's screed inspired many independent programmers to work on statistical filters. You train the software with a few hundred examples of good and bad mail, and the software starts to get smart. If you're curious, you can study the details. In my case, for example, the word "Viagra" appears almost exclusively in spam. The word "vanilla" appears almost exclusively in real mail. "Awesome" is bad; "awful" is good. "Fraction" is bad; "fragment" is good. I don't know why, and it doesn't matter. 
"I was skeptical of filters, too, but in my case there wasn't much of a choice," says Michael Tsai, the author of SpamSieve, one of the more effective statistical filters. "I don't have time to categorize my mail by hand, and if I did I'd probably get trigger-happy with the delete key."
If you wonder why words like "Viag.a" and "pen-s" have started appearing in your spam, this is why. It's the spammers trying to outwit the filters. They have also begun appending random chunks of innocent text.
After weeks of training, my spam filter didn't see a problem with a letter titled "See what hot girlz do behind closed doors!" To a wary human, just the word "girlz" would be a giveaway. The filter didn't suspect anything unwelcome about a letter from Ivanna Come titled Obscene Facial Pictures. You can't say these spammers are brilliantly concealing their intentions. A human being gets the point. Yet none of these words, singly or in combination, triggered the alarm in my filtering software. The filter still thought this might be legitimate e-mail: 
Looking for a good time?

Deep inside the majestic Pennsylvania Avenue headquarters of the Federal Trade Commission lies the control center for the government's battle against spam, such as it is. This is the grandly named Internet Lab. It turns out to be eight PC's on desks.
"It's a great resource," says Brian Huseman, the F.T.C. lawyer assigned to tell me about the commission's spam-fighting. "I don't know how we would do our spam investigations without it." While I watch, three young staff members surf the Web. 
During the Clinton administration, the commission set up an e-mail address, uce@ftc.gov, for consumers to forward samples of their spam. The database now contains 27.5 million of these, and 85,000 more arrive daily. Every month or so, the commission files an enforcement action against someone, leading to a warning letter, or a promise by the spammer to cease and desist, or even, occasionally, a "disgorgement of ill-gotten gains." No one really imagines any of this makes a dent.
The agency can't help noticing that, by and large, spam is not illegal. Its enforcers can go after only the most obvious forms of fraud, of which there is, after all, no shortage. The fact that you may not want to get this stuff is not their problem. "From the F.T.C.'s point of view, whether it's wanted or unwanted, what we're concerned about is whether it's deceptive," Huseman says.
In reality almost all spam qualifies as deceptive. Junk messages typically come with false return addresses. The Internet headers are typically forged to falsify the mail servers, relays and other data that could help trace the source. Instructions for removing your name from their lists are typically false; your name won't be removed, and the spammer will know you're alive and reading the mail. In theory, any of these lies could justify action by the commission. "Maybe there's a deceptive statement about how your name was acquired," Huseman says. Why, yes! 
Here's a typical disclaimer: "Best Net Offers never sends unsolicited e-mail. Best Net Offers has been given the right to market to you through our Web site partners and their privacy policies." That's a lie. Here's another: "P.S. We never ever send spam we only send to people we think would enjoy this invitation! Psychic powers don't fail us now!"
In practice, it's hopeless. You can't prove that you never clicked a button marked "O.K." after failing to read the fine print of a privacy agreement, thus unwittingly giving someone a sort of authorization to sell your e-mail address. The F.T.C. is a strong believer in these lawyerly privacy statements, but how many people read them? 
You don't want to test the Click Here to Be Removed link, because you suspect it will just lead to more spam. This is just another in the series of spam Catch-22's.
The spammers are elusive and hidden -- one reason Barry Shein compares their operations to organized crime. "These are not legitimate businesspeople," he said. "These are people who are acting in a way that society does not accept." Yet it is often possible for a determined victim to track them down. Although headers will be forged, inspecting the HTML source of junk mail usually reveals a genuine domain name, because, after all, you are meant to visit some Web site. Domain names are required to list publicly a technical contact and an administrative contact. For example, SexAffair.org, which sends a torrent of spam from supposedly willing maidens called "Erica" and "Jen" and "Katie," turns out to be Sobonito Investments Ltd., at 10800 Biscayne Boulevard in Miami. They handle Sex2go.com, too. I'd like to talk to them about this, but they don't return my calls. Anyway, until Congress sees fit to make their activities illegal, tracking down spammers provides little satisfaction.
Yet the perpetrators are not just misfits and pornographers. Real companies send spam, too -- because they don't know any better, or because they don't care, or just in rote obeisance to the gods of marketing.
E-mail marketers, from the sleazy to the near-legitimate, defend their behavior by citing postal junk mail and unsolicited telemarketing. These irritate consumers but are tolerated, up to a point. Spam is different. It is intrusive because, in the nature of e-mail, it arrives round the clock, demanding attention. It lacks even the modest checks and balances of traditional marketing: to print letters and send them through the post costs money; likewise to make telephone calls. A direct mailer can't afford a pitch so shabby and fruitless that it will produce a one-in-a-thousand rate of return. A spammer can, because sending a million more copies is practically free.
We citizens and consumers have more points of contact with the world than ever before; more points of exposure. Our front doors and mailboxes are one kind of interface; our telephones and fax machines another; our televisions and radios still another. Because networked computers open a pathway wider and faster and more fluid than all these combined, the spam epidemic will prove a need for new kinds of locks and new kinds of rules.
From an economic perspective, if the purpose of advertising is to get directly in my face, for the least cost, then spam is almost perfectly effective. It's in my face, all right. As a magazine reader, you might feel that advertisements are an intrusion, but you also know that the advertisers had to pay thousands of dollars and that this money supports whatever it is you like about the magazine. You've made a voluntary economic bargain -- as you do when you watch free broadcast television.
By contrast, advertising by e-mail is the ultimate free ride. The cost is borne by the recipients. This is a historical accident; no planners designed the economics of cyberspace to work this way. But the capitalists who laid the world's fiber-optic cable across continents and oceans get no return on their investment from the spammers; the Internet service providers whose computers send and receive these billions of messages get no compensation. Nor, of course, do we, the targets of spam -- we don't get the television program or magazine article or football game or service that other advertising dollars support.
Of course, if the purpose of advertising is to get me to buy the product, as opposed to turning me into a livid bundle of hatred and resentment, then spam is not perfectly effective. Yet the tide keeps rising.
Many people who hate spam believe, honorably enough, that it's protected as free speech. It is not. The Supreme Court has made clear that individuals may preserve a threshold of privacy. "Nothing in the Constitution compels us to listen to or view any unwanted communication, whatever its merit," wrote Chief Justice Warren Burger in a 1970 decision. "We therefore categorically reject the argument that a vendor has a right under the Constitution or otherwise to send unwanted material into the home of another." 
Odd forces have conspired to create paralysis in the government on the matter of spam. Corporate marketers and Internet traditionalists have found themselves in an accidental alliance. The marketers, particularly the powerful Direct Marketing Association, have lobbied hard to preserve their ability to send cheap messages to potential customers; "self-regulation" has been the industry's watchword. And the Internet's culture, too, lines up against government intervention. The word "clueless" might have been invented to describe legislators with an urge to meddle in the high-tech arena. In cyberspace, policy and rulemaking have come from the bottom up, and the benefits have been spectacular. Time and again, the online world has behaved like a self-healing organism, outwitting authorities who tried to impose structure from above. 
But cyberspace belongs to the world of human beings, who rely on laws to discourage the worst behavior and to protect the powerless. The grass roots have not solved the problem -- indeed anti-spam posses have often caused trouble of their own, with blacklists that block mail from legitimate sources. And even the Direct Marketing Association has come to believe that spam hurts its members. "I've got caught in the vicious cycle," says Regina Brady, an e-mail marketing consultant who works with the association. "All of a sudden your e-mail address is spun out into cyberspace. This is a real problem for legitimate marketers trying to do the right thing." This fall, after fighting it for years, the association came out in favor of federal anti-spam legislation in some form.
Arguments about such legislation tend to focus on the issue of "opt in" versus "opt out." In opt-out schemes, which the marketers favor, consumers have to take action to declare their unwillingness to receive unsolicited bulk mail. If the system is opt-in, then marketers have to be able to show that consumers have given their consent to receive solicitations. The European Parliament recently voted to adopt opt-in requirements, putting Europe far ahead of the United States in acting against spam. 
"The reason it happens with impunity right now is that in fact it's not against the law," says James Love, director of the Consumer Project on Technology, a Washington-based advocacy group. He says he believes that making it possible to collect fines from spammers would change the balance of power significantly. He also says that the international nature of the problem need not be a barrier to effective action. "Spam should be a good test case for cross-border consumer protection, because everybody thinks a spammer is lower than a sniper. Go into a treaty-type mode, where you try to get everybody to agree, from Korea to China to Turkey to Russia. You could build enormous pressure to comply with this."
As remote as an effective solution seems, the spam problem might not be so intractable after all. The Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 made it illegal to send unsolicited faxes; that law passed with strong backing from manufacturers of fax machines. It should be extended to include unsolicited bulk e-mail.
For free-speech reasons, any legislation should avoid considering e-mail's content; trying to define key words like "commercial" and "pornographic" only leads to trouble. And it isn't necessary. For that matter, even short of outlawing spam, two simple measures might be enough to stem the tide:
1) Forging Internet headers should be made illegal. The system depends on accurate information about senders and servers and relays; no one needs a right to falsify this information. 
2) Unsolicited bulk mail should carry a mandatory tag. That alone would put consumers back in control; all the complex technological challenge of identifying the spam would vanish.
We need to be able to say no. No, I'm not looking for a good time. No, I don't want to "e-mail millions of PayPal members." No, I don't want an anatomy-enlargement kit. No, I don't want my share of the Nigerian $25 million. I just want my in-box. It belongs to me, and I want it back.

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 2-9-03; 
Destined For Failure

BYLINE:  By A.O. Scott; A.O. Scott is a movie critic for The Times.

 BODY:
On weekday mornings, after a hurried breakfast of frozen waffles and scrambled eggs and a two-block dash through the neighborhood crush of strollers and briefcases, my 6-year-old son slips his backpack over his shoulders, grants me a desultory hug and passes through the double doors of the school bus into the care of the New York City public school system. He is the apple of my eye, my hostage to fortune, every sentimental paternal cliche you can think of and also, like every other child on the bus, a pawn in an endless political chess game. Along with the peanut butter and jelly sandwich and last night's homework, that blue nylon school bag is weighted down with a century's worth of ideological baggage. And my own parochial parental anxieties -- Is he happy? Is he learning? Is he making friends? -- are, whether I like it or not, shrill notes in a cacophony of political contention, along with the thundering of officeholders, the rumbling of bureaucrats and the horn bleats of think-tank intellectuals. 
 One evening last month, my son's backpack carried home a letter from Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Chancellor Joel I. Klein, announcing an ambitious plan to reconfigure the city's educational system. The mayor, having attained the direct control of the system that the state government had withheld from his predecessors, was now explicitly staking his political future on the abolition of the central Board of Education, the drastic redrawing of local school districts and the imposition of a uniform curriculum for all but the very top schools. These measures, he promised, would bring transparency, accountability and -- that most enduring and elusive education goal -- success. 
 Like much else that this mayor has done, his education proposals manifest a certain ideological eclecticism, which is both welcome and a little confusing. In the weeks following the unveiling of the reforms, the parents and teachers I know tried to figure out whether to be appalled or delighted, skeptical or hopeful. A measure of the plan's radicalism may be that wherever you place yourself on the ideological spectrum -- or even if you don't know where to place yourself -- it could produce all of these responses in turn. To take just one example: people who lean toward progressive education, or who envision individual classrooms as laboratories of learning, might look askance at a common citywide curriculum, especially one that includes phonics in the early grades. But alongside phonics are techniques associated with its supposed antagonist, the "whole language" approach to literacy, which emphasizes reading and creative writing and a more or less progressive program called Everyday Math, both of which might alarm those who believe that children are best educated by traditional methods.
The systemic failure of American education is, by now, a very old story. (There is an equally old, but less frequently told, story about the amazingly various local ways our schools have succeeded.) Twenty years ago, when I was finishing high school, we were "A Nation at Risk" menaced by "a rising tide of mediocrity." A generation before that, there was "Why Johnny Can't Read." And every crisis has provoked grand and global solutions, which in turn engender the next crisis. Every self-evident problem in the New York schools today -- from the gerrymandered districts to the hulking buildings -- was once an equally self-evident cure.
The endless crisis has been driven, to some extent, by adult self-interest, and there is no shortage of scapegoats: stubborn unions, greedy corporations, crackpot theorists, pandering politicos. But while those responsible for the failure of American education -- a list that surely includes parents like me -- are divided by interests and ideologies, they (we) are united by sincere good intentions. We want what's best for our children.
Which is the root of the problem. Our schools are political battlefields to an extent that those in other countries are not because they operate under such diverse and contradictory demands -- most deeply, the desire to nurture each child's talent and potential with the imperative to reproduce a competitive, and often unfair, social order. We expect the schools to resolve social problems, the existence of which we otherwise barely acknowledge. Education is imagined to be the great equalizer, the engine of social mobility and the solvent of class division -- even as the schools, public as well as private, maintain and engineer enormous inequities. Schools are meant to bind local communities and foster a vibrant national economy. Even in microcosm, when we think about what we want them to do for our children (and what do we mean, exactly, by "our children"?), the schools are mired in paradox. Debates over the structure and content of schooling present a series of choices: should children learn important information, useful skills or ennobling values? Should they be given the tools of liberation or the habits of obedience to authority? Should schools foster individual growth or responsible membership in society?
But these are not choices at all. We want -- we expect -- all of these things. Never mind that, for these myriad results, we depend on overworked parents and underfinanced institutions. It never seems to occur to us that the demands are fundamentally at cross-purposes -- are, in a word, utopian. The urge to reform the schools goes beyond the necessary, difficult desire to improve the way they function. It is, rather, the last, strongest redoubt of an American tradition of moral perfectionism: the schools are miniature, prototype cities on a hill, models of the enlightened, egalitarian, excellent society we have not yet managed to create. The buzzword among reformers of whatever coloration is success; but with such a goal, failure is guaranteed, as are the future waves of reform. But we wouldn't have it any other way. Our children deserve no less.

GRAPHIC: Photo (Reuben Cox) Chart: "EASY AS A, B, C""The teaching of reading -- all over the United States, in all the schools, in all the textbooks -- is totally wrong and flies in the face of all logic and common sense. . . . We too could have perfect readers in all schools at the end of second grade if we taught our children by the system used in Germany. Now, what is this system? It's very simple. Reading means getting meaning from certain combinations of letters. Teach the child what each letter stands for and he can read. Ah no, you say, it can't be that simple. But it is." From "Why Johnny Can't Read," by Rudolf Flesch, 1955

HEADLINE: MUSIC; 
Today Disney, Tomorrow The Met

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW GUREWITSCH; Matthew Gurewitsch is a journalist, essayist and novelist based in New York.

 BODY:
SOME of the governmental accolades sound intimidating. There's the medal for service to culture from Russia (for a production of Puccini's "Turandot"). There's the title Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres from France. But the American stage director Francesca Zambello takes no very esoteric view of what she does.
 "I'm a populist, an opera evangelist," she says. "I believe in making shows that speak to a broad audience. I'm not afraid of the word 'entertainment.' " 
 So unafraid, in fact, that she recently went to work "for Mickey Mouse," as she phrased it to friends, staging a live adaptation of Disney's animated hit "Aladdin" for Disney's California Adventure, in Anaheim. Running 45 minutes, double cast and playing several shows a day, "Aladdin: A Musical Spectacular" opened last month, and its puppets and magic-carpet ride reportedly have young audiences and those who escort them in raptures. 
But tomorrow night Ms. Zambello, 46, will be taking bows in her more usual environment: that of grand opera for grown-ups, in this case "Les Troyens" ("The Trojans") by Hector Berlioz, at the Metropolitan Opera.
A five-hour extravaganza derived from the "Aeneid," Virgil's tear-streaked Latin epic of Roman empire, "Les Troyens" stands as grand opera's K2, a peak second only to the Everest of Wagner's "Ring" cycle. The decor is by Maria Bjornson, whose proscenium of gilded angels, candle-lit grotto and plummeting chandelier for "Phantom of the Opera" have drawn gasps from Broadway audiences since 1988, and whose sudden death at 53 in December has the theater world in shock.
No matter what Ms. Zambello and her collaborators put on stage, some fierce catcalls may be expected. Certain factions will be waging a vendetta that dates to 1992, when Ms. Zambello, then a rising international star, came before the Met audience for the first time, directing Donizetti's bel canto evergreen "Lucia di Lammermoor." That's the one in which the heroine -- June Anderson back then -- warms up for the most celebrated mad scene in the literature by slaughtering her groom offstage in their bedroom on their wedding night. Ms. Zambello's program note put a perhaps gratuitous feminist spin on the action, but worse from the reactionaries' point of view, the picturesque traditional trappings of Highland Gothic had been jettisoned in favor of a bleak, symbol-heavy heap of rubble. The stage was strewn with coffins, and as far as most of musical New York was concerned, the funeral was Ms. Zambello's.
In the grand trajectory of her career, the "Lucia" fiasco was actually little more than a blip. From her debut in 1984, putting students at the San Francisco Opera through their paces in "La Traviata," to the new "Aladdin" (undisclosed budget reliably put at $8 million), Ms. Zambello has left few corners of the repertory untouched. Since that dark hour at the Met, her productions have been cheered on leading stages across Europe and the United States. With the notable exceptions of Wagner's "Ring" and most standard Mozart, she has practically done it all: a gargantuan "Tosca" at the Earl's Court Arena in London, capacity 12,000; "The Mikado" at the 505-seat Icelandic Opera in Reykjavik. The list continues to grow at a clip of about a half dozen new shows a year.
But so far the sort of mainstream hit scored by other "serious" directors of opera and drama like Trevor Nunn (with "Cats"), Nicholas Hytner ("Miss Saigon") and Julie Taymor ("The Lion King") has eluded Ms. Zambello, and not for lack of trying. Andrew Sabiston and Tim Williams's "Napoleon," mounted in the West End of London in 2000 for the "Les Miz" demographic, ran a respectable but hardly record-breaking six months despite Ms. Zambello's best efforts. No one in the opera world holds this excursion against her. A commercial smash, in fact, could only improve her stock on the global opera exchange.
As for "Aladdin," which sets out to rival Broadway performance and production standards at their best, Ms. Zambello hopes that it will hook tens of thousands of youngsters a week on the matchless thrill of live theater. (On a smaller scale but in the same missionary spirit, she is preparing a children's opera, "The Little Prince," for the Houston Grand Opera. Aptly enough, the new piece, drawn from Antoine de Saint-Exupery's wistful primer in existentialism, has a score by a composer, Rachel Portman, who has won an Oscar, for the score of "Emma.")
To acknowledge Ms. Zambello's healthy respect for the old razzle-dazzle is not to deny either her voracious intellectual appetite or her appreciation of ordinary domesticity. "You have to feed yourself," she said backstage at the Met in mid-January, "and not just with more opera. I need art. I need books. I need the movies. I need nature. My dogs, my friends, my makeshift family."
A big-boned junior Susan Sontag type, known familiarly as Cesca, Ms. Zambello totes a heavy bag, which was just then bulging with fodder like Edward Tripp's "Meridian Handbook of Classical Mythology," the "Aeneid" and a DVD of "Triumph of the Will," Leni Riefenstahl's infamous record of the 1934 Nazi rally at Nuremberg. Ms. Zambello's French, German, Italian and Russian are fluent, thanks largely to an adolescence spent in cities around Europe, and she dresses and talks like the eternal student she is, with frequent smatterings of foreign tongues.
Oh, to have been a fly on the wall last year (or to have tapped the wire) when she picked up the phone of her London apartment and heard the gritty baritone of Joseph Volpe, the Met's street-tough general manager.
"I've got a little piece I'd like you to put together for us," Mr. Volpe said.
"Well," said Ms. Zambello when the other shoe dropped, "let me open a nice bottle of wine, and call me back. That's not such a little piece."
No, indeed, as she well knew, having directed it in Los Angeles in 1991. In fact, "Les Troyens" is so vast that the composer's contemporaries chopped it into two separate operas (and then butchered those). The first deals with the fall of ancient Troy, Trojan horse and all, culminating in a mass suicide led by the prophet Cassandra (at the Met, Deborah Voigt). Part 2 covers the tragic love affair of Dido, queen of Carthage (Lorraine Hunt Lieberson), and Aeneas, leader of Troy's survivors (Ben Heppner), whose destiny is to found Rome, a second Troy, in far-off Italy. This section, too, ends in suicide: that of the abandoned Dido.
Having drained her glass and taken up the gauntlet, Ms. Zambello reported to work at the Met to find the hate mail already waiting. What did her correspondents say? "Oh, you can imagine," she said with a philosopher's detachment. "Strangely scribbled threats about what to expect on opening night because I ruined 'their' 'Lucia' 10 years ago. Ten years!"
Once she might have been amused and flattered, but these days such letters are turned over to security. At the same time, she loves knowing that her work has ignited the passions of opera lovers, both pro and con. "Art doesn't exist without opinions," she said. "One has to grow the skin of a crocodile and the heart of a friendly lion. In this business, a lot of people want you to fail. Critics, because they think it's more fun to write about a fiasco. Reactionaries, who want a real tree onstage, and not the essence of a tree, if the libretto says there's a tree. Some of one's colleagues." Like any other theatrical professional, Ms. Zambello has obliged with the occasional flop. But not often.
Under the fluorescent light of the subterranean bunker known to the Met staff as C-level, the hours were passing quickly, and there was much to do. The call one morning was for soloists only. A visitor's jaw dropped to hear Ms. Zambello address Mr. Heppner, with his lumberjack's physique, as Honey Bunny, but it is an endearment her casts soon grow used to. Dido was slipping deeper into her infatuation with Aeneas, posing a dangerous distraction from his predestined mission. In a remote corner of the studio, Ms. Zambello went into a huddle with Ms. Hunt Lieberson and Mr. Heppner, reciting the relevant passage from Virgil.
In the words of The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, Ms. Zambello's signature is "visual brilliance and fine acting." Curious impresarios can see that judgment triumphantly vindicated in the hourlong videotape of performance clips that is her electronic portfolio.
In collaboration with such master designers as Robert Israel, Richard Hudson, Alison Chitty and Michael Yeargan, Ms. Zambello has developed a vocabulary of the grand scenic gesture. Visually, the work is unabashedly eclectic, running the gamut from sumptuous, Rauschenbergian poster art in "Madama Butterfly" to spare New England Gothic in Tobias Picker's "Emmeline," from Cinerama grandeur in Prokofiev's epic "War and Peace" to juicy film noir in Carlisle Floyd's "Of Mice and Men," from severe abstraction in the shipboard allegory of "Billy Budd" to gaudy celestial circus in "The Bartered Bride."
ON her broad canvas, Ms. Zambello drops bushels of cherry petals and acres of crimson parachute silk to heart-stopping emotional effect. She deploys monumental blocks of built scenery with the majesty of planets in motion. Yet within the spectacle, the human drama is painted with the finest of brushes. Principal or chorister, it always pays to watch the players closely. Thus, at the final curtain of Wagner's "Tristan und Isolde," Mr. Heppner's Tristan -- safely expired, one would have thought, after his interminable agonies -- tenderly reached out his hand an inch for the hand of Jane Eaglen's Isolde. Having exhaled her last F sharp pianissimo, Isolde, too, was by now to be presumed dead. Yet the gesture made total sense: transcendence by stealth.
Reunited with Ms. Zambello for "Les Troyens," Mr. Heppner speaks of her with warmth. "Cesca has a wonderful ability to bring everybody onto the same page," he said between rehearsals. "Her big thrust in 'Troyens' has been to humanize the icons of mythology, within a very epic set that gives the piece the scope it needs, but with the flexibility to bring the personal emotion."
At lunch in the Met canteen, Ms. Zambello defined her job simply. "To tell the story, by whatever means necessary," she said, munching chicken she had brought from the home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan that she shares with Manuela Hoelterhoff, the acerbic, often devastating culture critic and occasional opera librettist. "To tell it clearly and dramatically, as the composer intended."
As a general matter, Ms. Zambello finds it useful forthe performers as well as for audiences to give them points of reference from the world they live in. "A masterpiece transcends the ages," she said. "My intent is to create an environment in which the work can live today. I'm rarely time-specific in my work. I don't 'modernize' by putting a nuclear reactor onstage. But I do try to make an audience think about our world."
Typically, the design of a new show takes a year, with collaboration at the heart of the process. "It begins by just getting to know the material with your team, reading it aloud to each other, listening to recordings, reading the score, studying the sources, exploring visual references, looking for metaphors of our world today. I often think that a designer does half the directing, the same way that directors do half the design."
Back on C-level that afternoon, a cast of thousands (a hundred-plus, anyway) was gathering for the first rehearsal of what Ms. Zambello calls the "Fourth of July/Thanksgiving" scene with chorus, dancers and extras, complete with a pint-size rainbow coalition of eager children, among them a boy named Troy and a girl named Cassandra.
"We're in Carthage now," Ms. Zambello began, addressing the troops from atop a little step. "It's the city founded by Dido, a sort of ideal world society. A kibbutz. Communism before it all went bad. Dido is a visionary. A pacifist. Indira Gandhi meets Hillary Clinton. And if anybody has a better analogy, please tell me. The first thing we see when the curtain rises is a great rush forward. Like a great wave of the Mediterranean crashing on the shore of Carthage. Run or walk quickly. It's pandemonium."
At Ms. Hunt Lieberson's side for Dido's State of the Union address is Ms. Zambello, now in the role of simultaneous interpreter, urging the chorus on to lifelike, individual reactions. "We've been living in this peaceful world. A boom economy. Carthage-dot-com. Now war may be on the horizon. It couldn't be more contemporary. Break. Twenty-five minutes." As others disperse, a studious chorister moves in to engage the approachable Ms. Zambello in shoptalk on the role of gods in Virgil. Then it's back to pandemonium until the stroke of 5:45, laid down by union rules.
The long day's work done, Ms. Zambello stopped at the Met canteen for a last round of inquisition, this time on the subject of her future.
"Every direction you turn, there's something to entice you," she said. "I'd like to do the 'Ring.' I'd like to do 'Lulu.' But more than a piece, I'd eventually like to run an opera company: a director's theater with a high-level ensemble and strong musical director, performing a wide range of styles. A place for an audience that trusts us and will come to the shows no matter what. A place where all of us -- the artists and the public -- can take a long journey together."

Not Gone With the Wind: Voices of Slavery

BYLINE:  By HENRY LOUIS GATES Jr.; Henry Louis Gates Jr., chairman of the Department of Afro-American Studies at Harvard University, wrote the foreword of "Unchained Memories: Readings From the Slave Narratives," the companion book to the HBO documentary.

 BODY:
My mother's mistress had three boys, one 21, one 19 and one 17. Old mistress had gone away to spend the day one day. Mother always worked in the house. She didn't work on the farm in Missouri. While she was alone, the boys came in and threw her down on the floor and tied her down so she couldn't struggle, and one after the other used her as long as they wanted for the whole afternoon. 
 Mother was sick when her mistress came home. When the old mistress wanted to know whatwas the matter with her, she told her what the boys had done. She whipped them and that's the way I came to be here.
-- Mary Estes Peters, former slave

WILLIAM WELLS BROWN, one of the most famous fugitive slaves on the antislavery lecture circuit before the Civil War and the author of a best-selling slave narrative, once argued that "slavery never can be represented," an ironic claim from someone who spent his professional life trying to do just that.
Brown was not arguing against the use of literary forms to protest the horrors of the "peculiar institution"; rather, he was arguing that there could be no more telling mode of bearing witness against slavery than the unmediated voices of the slaves themselves. You had to go there to know there, Zora Neale Hurston said, and Brown would have agreed. But the question underlying Brown's assertion was: Who could, or should, represent slavery?
"Unchained Memories," an HBO documentary that makes its debut tomorrow night, provides a powerful answer to that question. It gives us, through the faces and voices of African-American actors, an introduction to a vast undertaking that took place in the 1930's: the collection and preservation of the testimonies of thousands of aged former slaves in an archive known as the Slave Narrative Collection of the Federal Writers' Project. This archive unlocked the brutal secrets of slavery by using the voices of average slaves as the key, exposing the everyday life of the slave community. Rosa Starke, a slave from South Carolina, for example, told of how class divisions among the slaves were quite pronounced:
"Dere was just two classes to de white folks, buckra slave owners and poor white folks dat didn't own no slaves. Dere was more classes 'mongst de slaves. De fust class was de house servants. Dese was de butler, de maids, de nurses, chambermaids, and de cooks. De nex' class was de carriage drivers and de gardeners, de carpenters, de barber and de stable men. Then come de nex' class, de wheelwright, wagoners, blacksmiths and slave foremen. De nex' class I members was de cow men and de niggers dat have care of de dogs. All dese have good houses and never have to work hard or git a beatin'. Then come de cradlers of de wheat, de threshers and de millers of de corn and de wheat, and de feeders of de cotton gin. De lowest class was de common field niggers."
Voices like hers had waited more than 70 years to be heard, and why they were silent for so long is itself, in part, a story of class tensions within the black community.
Fugitive African-American slaves enjoy a rare distinction in the long and bloody history of human slavery: they alone created a genre of literature about their bondage and freedom, as Frederick Douglass put it in the title of his second autobiography. The slave narratives, which came of age with the publication of Douglass's best-selling "Narrative" in 1845, were extraordinarily popular, the thrillers of antebellum America.
Encouraged by white abolitionists, more than 100 fugitive slaves wrote or dictated book-length accounts from 1760 to 1865. About as many people born into slavery published autobiographies between the end of the Civil War and the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920's. Slavery -- or rather, its transcendence -- made for good reading. In the first few decades after the Civil War, as slavery receded into memory, rooting one's origins in that putrid soil served as a sort of legitimizing ritual for black men and women establishing themselves as authors and public figures.
If the printed word was no adequate substitute for actual experience, slavery could nonetheless be both represented and remembered -- analyzed, critiqued, contained -- through the written testimonies of the articulate, literate few who had broken their chains, escaped to the North, and mastered literacy, ostensibly speaking for the slaves left behind. William Wells Brown, who devoted his career as an author to depicting slavery in novels, plays, histories and autobiographies, knew this: "I stand here as the representative of the slave," he said in a speech in 1854," to speak for those who cannot speak for themselves."
By the turn of the century, however, slavery had become something of an embarrassment to an aspiring black elite desperate to integrate into a gilded American age. Booker T. Washington himself led the charge by calling for a New Negro, one who would cease complaining about slavery. Even in his classic "Up From Slavery" (1901), he urged his black readers to obliterate their memory of hurt and wrongs, bragging that he had completely rid himself of "any ill feeling toward the Southern white man for any wrong that he may have inflicted upon my race." As his contemporary Benjamin Tanner put it, "The very remembrance of our experience is hideous." Sarah Debro, an ex-slave, told an interviewer in North Carolina in 1937: "My folks don't want me to talk about slavery. They's shame niggers ever was slaves." Slavery? Forget about it.
WASHINGTON'S blueprint for a New Negro was actually a call for a full embrace of white, bourgeois values, complete with his insistence on the importance of "a toothbrush and a bar of soap." Even by then, class tensions had had a long history among African-Americans, and they had also troubled the abolitionist movement. Douglass complained in 1856, "Opposing slavery and hating its victims has come to be a very common form of abolitionism." In the slave narratives, the noble, aspiring fugitive often established his nobility, implicitly, at the expense of the average, illiterate, less adventurous slaves left behind -- whose spoken language even black authors often rendered in a harsh, humorous dialect.
Nowhere are these class tensions depicted more baldly than in "The Bondwoman's Narrative," written by a mulatto house servant, Hannah Crafts, in the 1850's. Crafts describes field hands as the "vile, foul, filthy inhabitants of the huts." By the Harlem Renaissance, Crafts's view had become something of the norm, even if rendered less harshly. As Alain Locke put it in "The New Negro" (1925), "Uncle Tom and Sambo have passed on." Uneducated blacks were not "presentable" to a white American public that stereotyped all blacks as inferior and uneducable, and their voices had to be repressed, both by the fugitive slave authors and by revisionist historians of the Old South, the moonbeam and magnolia blossom school of Confederate apologists.
Slavery lost its romance, and its usefulness. (By 1954, the year of Brown v. Board of Education, only one slave narrative would be in print.) For many black intellectuals, it seems, slavery had been represented all too much, at least as a salient shaping force in the history of Negro citizens seeking to end legal segregation.
The majority of slaves, those who worked in the fields, would gain their voice, oddly enough, only in the Great Depression, initially through the under-financed efforts of a small group of black historians. For them, too, the question was not whether slavery could be represented; the question was, represented by whom? This time, the answer was different. As the historian Lawrence Reddick put itin 1937, "There is not yet a picture of the institution as seen through the eyes of the bondsman himself."
Reddick's impulse indirectly gave rise to interviews with more than 2,000 former slaves, the field hands who had been rendered silent in the printed narratives and in standard histories of slavery. (To understand the project's import, imagine if 2,000 interviews of Greek or Roman slaves suddenly became available to classical historians.) Little could have alarmed Booker T. Washington more than hundreds of interviewers, most of them white, fanning out all over the South, armed with a list of questions and writing down testimonies about life under slavery.
Why turn to the slave so very many years after the abolition of slavery, especially when so many black intellectuals were skittish? There are several reasons, but the most important is the emergence of black historians who were intent on refuting the rosy, and often racist, depictions of slavery propagated by scholars who were little more than apologists for the Confederacy. Chief among these was the Yale historian Ulrich B. Phillips, whose "American Negro Slavery" (1918) portrayed the slave as happy and content, his treatment by his master generous, "civilizing" and humane. Even many black people accepted these stereotypical notions. What more effective way to counter these claims than with the words of former slaves themselves?
Charles S. Johnson, the great black sociologist, had begun a project at Fisk University in Nashville in 1929 to interview former slaves in Tennessee and Kentucky, and later in Alabama. The historian John B. Cade at Southern University embarked on a similar course of interviews the same year. Reddick, at Kentucky State College, proposed in 1934 that the Federal Emergency Relief Fund systematically interview former slaves, in part to give employment to "unemployed Negro college graduates." Reddick's project yielded 250 interviews, gathered in Indiana and Kentucky in 1934 and 1935.
At the urging of John A. Lomax, a seminal figure in the collection of American folklore (and the father of the folk music archivist Alan Lomax), and Sterling A. Brown, a poet, critic and Howard University professor who was director of the Office of Negro Affairs within the Federal Writers' Project, the writers' project began gathering oral narratives of former slaves in 1937. Brown argued the case for black interviewers in as many Southern states as he could. (Zora Neale Hurston actually recorded former slaves in Florida.) Nevertheless, most units of the Writers' Project remained segregated, according to the Jim Crow practices of the time. The project's financing ended by 1939, but not before previously silenced slaves had finally had their say.
The archive that was gathered consisted of 2,300 interviews conducted in 17 states. (Some 1,200 or so more interviews have been unearthed in other archives.) The former slaves had been 1 to 30-something years old when the Civil War ended seven decades before, but most were from 6 to 20; they represented about 2 percent of the total former-slave population.
All sorts of colorful characters in the drama of slavery, relegated to cameo appearances in the earlier narratives, take center stage in these oral histories, from cooks and chambermaids to gardeners, barbers and carpenters. Perhaps the most important contribution the oral narratives make to our understanding of slavery is the registering of the thoughts and feelings of women. Only six slave narratives were published by women before the end of the Civil War, roughly 5 percent of the total. Here, by contrast, about half of the interviews were with women. And they provide details of daily life not generally stressed in the printed narratives, especially about the sexual exploitation of female slaves.
Mary Estes Peters's account of rape, at the beginning of this article, had no counterpart in the printed narratives. Rose Williams, of Texas, even discussed her feelings about her forced marriage to another slave, an institutionalized form of rape commonly practiced on the plantation:
"Dere am one thing Massa Hawkins does to me what I can't shunt from my mind. I know he don't do it for meanness, but I allus holds it 'gainst him. What he done am force me to live with dat nigger, Rufus, 'gainst my wants."
Even the Rev. Ishrael Massie's account of rape is much more direct than anything found in the narratives of Douglass, Brown and their contemporaries:
"Lord chile, dat wuz common. Marsters an' overseers use to make slaves dat wuz wid deir husbands git up, do as dey say. Send husband out on de farm, milkin' cows or cuttin' wood. Den he gits in bed wid slave himself. Some women would fight an tussel. Others would be 'umble -- feared of dat beatin'. What we saw, couldn't do nothing 'bout it.."
Just like Booker T. Washington and Alain Locke, American society has long been haunted by the ghost of slavery past, as if silence about its horrors -- and its significance to American prosperity and the shaping of our institutions -- would make it go away. But the past can't be ignored; it can only be processed, digested and represented, again and again. The Writer's Project archive began to be systematically published in the 70's, under the editorial direction of the historian George P. Rawick, and today no fewer than 40 volumes (10,000 pages totaling 3.5 million words) of these fascinating interviews are available in print under the title "The American Slave: A Composite Autobiography" (Greenwood Publishing Group). Recordings of a number of the actual interviews are also available in "Remembering Slavery," a book-and-tape set published by the New Press. And the original typescripts, as well as 500 photographs, can be viewed on the Web site of the Library of Congress, at http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/snhtml/snhome.html.
HBO's "Unchained Memories" gives voice to the lives of the slaves in a form both accessible and dramatic, two qualities necessary for an event to become part of our national memory. (Even scholars have complained about the readability of the dialect in the interviews, a vice transformed into a virtue through the renderings of actors like Samuel L. Jackson, Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee, Angela Bassett, Vanessa L. Williams and Oprah Winfrey.)
Through the power of these re-creations, the slaves left behind claim the right to represent -- and speak -- themselves into the heart of our national memory, a memory that should be as richly various as the American experience itself.

Rebels in Nepal Drive Down Tourism

BYLINE:  By PHILIP SHENON

DATELINE: KATMANDU, Nepal 

 BODY:
A HALF-CENTURY after this Himalayan kingdom captured the world's attention in May 1953 with the bulletin that Sir Edmund Hillary had conquered Mount Everest, the news is mostly grim for a nation that still depends on mountaineers and other travelers from abroad for its economic vitality.
 The tourism industry in Nepal, a nation towered over by some of the world's highest mountains and revered as the birthplace of Buddha, has virtually collapsed as a result of the Maoist insurgency that now controls more than a third of the countryside and is seeking to abolish the monarchy. 
 Although the insurgents have said that foreign travelers and major tourism sites will be spared from violence, clashes between the rebels and government forces have left nearly 8,000 Nepalese dead since the guerrillas took up arms in 1996.
In November, the State Department said Americans "should consider deferring nonessential travel" to Nepal after the Maoists claimed responsibility for murdering a pair of Nepalese security guards who worked at the United States Embassy here. 
At the end of last month, a surprise cease-fire spurred hopes for an end to the violence. Even before that, Nepalese government officials said that the nation's most important tourism areas, including the popular trekking routes in the foothills of the Himalayas, remained safe. 
They insisted that they would go forward with celebrations this spring to mark the golden anniversary of the ascent of Everest by Sir Edmund and the Sherpa mountaineer Tenzing Norgay. But the officials are not optimistic that the anniversary will signal any sort of turnaround for tourism. 
According to figures from the official Nepal Tourism Board, the number of foreign visitors fell nearly 28 percent last year, as measured by airline passenger arrivals, after dropping 20 percent the year before.
The number of travelers arriving by air in 2002 was 215,900, compared with 298,900 in 2001. Although the board offered no exact nation-by-nation breakdown, it said that the number of American visitors fell by nearly half last year.
"It's very sad, because we've been operating there for 25 years and think Nepal remains a very safe destination," said James Faubel, president of Himalayan Travel of Danbury, Conn. "We certainly wouldn't advise our clients to go into areas that have been problematic in western Nepal, but tourists never went there anyway."
He said that his agency had sent an average of 300 Americans a year to Nepal before the insurgency, but that the number fell to under 100 last year, a result of the rebel threat and the turmoil that resulted from the June 2001 massacre of much of the Nepalese royal family by Crown Prince Dipendra, who then shot himself; many Nepalese say the motivations for the killings remain a mystery.
Mr. Faubel said that despite the recent chaos, none of his clients had ever found themselves in danger -- or reported any other problem. "Not a single problem for a single client," he said.
For foreign visitors willing to take the risk, there are remarkable bargains to be found, especially among the major hotels in the Katmandu Valley, which have slashed rates. The Hyatt Regency, a palatial structure that dominates the capital's skyline and is arguably the most luxurious hotel in the country, is offering a basic nightly rate of $80 for two this month, down from $105 when the hotel opened in 2000.
Apart from a notable lack of foreigners, there is little in Katmandu to suggest the chaos found elsewhere in the country; the capital's narrow, temple-clogged streets remain calm, and its residents are eager to make visitors feel welcome -- and safe.
"The drop in tourism is affecting every one of us," said Sunil Chitrakar, executive director of Mahaguthi, a charitable group that runs one of the city's most popular stores for traditional Nepalese crafts, including handmade paper, ceramics and jewelry.
Because of the drop in tourism, the group, which provides vocational training for hundreds of impoverished women around the country, has had to delay expansion plans that included housing and training dozens more destitute women. "Luckily, we haven't had to lay off anyone," he said.
The insurgents, who call themselves the People's Army and are believed to number about 5,000, have said repeatedly in public pronouncements that they do not intend to undermine tourism and that they will not attack foreign visitors, apparently in recognition of the fact that tourism provides jobs to the Nepalese masses whose support they seek. 
Nonetheless, a handful of foreign trekkers who have passed through Maoist-controlled areas in recent months have been stopped by armed rebels and asked, apparently politely, to pay "taxes" -- equivalent to a few dollars per person -- for the right to pass through.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER; 
Gathering The Family Tree

BYLINE:  By MARTHA STEVENSON OLSON; MARTHA STEVENSON OLSON is a freelance writer.

 BODY:
AS Mary Ferrell tells it, the idea of a family get-together had come up regularly over the years in talks with her mother, Katie Ferrell, who is now 82. So finally, in late 2001, Ms. Ferrell decided to take the initiative. She and her mother sent a letter to the surviving relatives of her father's four siblings. 
 "Basically it said, 'Let's come and be family,"' Ms. Ferrell, director of the Fairmount Park Conservancy in Philadelphia, recently said by telephone. As a gathering place, they picked the town where her forebears had homesteaded, Mountain View, Mo., and chose the weekend of July 4, 2002. Her mother's advancing years were more a motivating force than the events of Sept. 11, Ms. Ferrell said, although both, she believes, were factors in the high turnout -- 20 of the 35 invited. 
 One good source on reunions is Reunions Magazine, which been in business for 14 years and has had a Web site, www.reunionsmag.com, since 1995. "The feeling I get from my readers is, they're not going to be affected by the economy and not by terrorism," said Edith Wagner, the editor. "Reunions are important to them." 
For those who are considering initiating a family reunion, lots of help is available. The Internet has been a boon to those hoping to reconnect: One can look for long-lost relatives via sites like www.geneaology.com, www.classmates.com or at www.whowhere.com, as well as find online articles and checklists, timetables, advice and links to reunion-friendly resorts and travel agents. 
One agency, Trump Travel in Baldwin, N.Y., has made a specialty of reunions over the last six years. "I did one for my own family," said the owner, Claudia Rabin-Manning, "and it sort of blossomed out from there." Depending on what the reunion organizers want, she said, she will collect and disburse money, locate a hotel or cruise ship for the participants, arrange meals, and book tickets for shows, theme parks and tours. The agency charges $250 for all the planning, and will make up and mail fliers to up to 100 recipients for $100. Recent reunions have ranged from a resort in Lake George to a dude ranch in Utah. The agency can be reached at (800) 937-3878 or by visiting www.familyreunionbiz.com.
Convention and visitors bureaus around the country can often help reunion planners. For links to them, visit www.officialtravelguide.com, affiliated with the International Association of Convention and Visitors Bureaus, (800) 208-8661. 

Books and Other Sources
Several books have recently been published on the subject. Ms. Wagner has written "The Family Reunion Sourcebook" (Lowell House, $16.95), and there are several others including "Family Reunion: Everything You Need to Know to Plan Unforgettable Get-Togethers," by Jennifer Crichton (Workman Publishing, 1998, $13.95); "The Family Reunion Planner," by Donna Beasley (1997, MacMillan, $9.95); "Your Family Reunion: How to Plan It, Organize It, and Enjoy It," by George G. Morgan (2001, Ancestry Publishing, $16.95); and the "Family Reunion Planning Kit for Dummies," a book and CD-ROM by Cheryl Fall (2001, John Wiley & Sons, $24.99).
A subscription to Reunions Magazine, at $17.99 a year, also brings a reunion workbook and catalog ($10 if ordered separately) that provides lots of information in a step-by-step format, along with advertisements from resorts and travel companies. The magazine and workbook can be ordered online or at (800) 373-7933.
Ms. Wagner offered some advice. "Start early enough," was first. Many reunion planners suggest 18 months to two years as the right amount of lead time, especially for a large group. Second, Ms. Wagner said, "Don't do it alone -- get other people to help right from the start." A big gathering might require an organizing committee, regional managers and delegates for specific meals and responsibilities. Third, make sure everyone can afford it. Finally, have something going on for everyone and every age, especially children. 
All-inclusive cruises and resorts may carry a daunting price tag initially, but can be a bargain if you price the components individually, she said, and the range of options and meals eliminates many of the most common bones of contention.
Some families choose a time and place with a special meaning, say, the old homestead and the birthday of the family patriarch or matriarch. Others take the path of least resistance, for instance a holiday weekend at a location convenient to the largest number of relatives. Others pass the baton: one year on the East Coast, another on the West Coast, or one year with one side of the family, the next with the other side. 

Discovering Roots
The greatest reward, say reunion veterans, is discovering and exploring the family's roots and connecting with relatives who otherwise wouldn't be familiar. The activities during a family reunion might include videotaped storytelling, designing and creating a family tree, visiting the graves of family members or gathering family photos or recipes for a scrapbook or cookbook. A group photo is usually obligatory, of course. In addition, some families use the occasion to set up a family association to endow scholarships or finance historic or charitable organizations. 
After the popularity of the 1976 book "Roots" by Alex Haley and then the television series, which explored the African-American diaspora, many African-American families started family reunion traditions. The Family Reunion Institute, founded 13 years ago by Dr. Ione Vargas of Temple University, originally focused on inspiring African Americans to seek their kin, but has grown so successful that its annual AfricanAmerican Family Reunion Conference, which now draws participants and speakers of many ethnicities, has been renamed the Family Reunion Conference, (215) 204-6244 or visit www.pathfinderstravel.com/famreunion02.html. This year it is March 21 to 23 in Columbia, Md. 
Some places have become so popular with reunion groups, they are booked solid through the summer and most long weekends a couple of years in advance. One of these is the Estes Park, Colo., branch of the Y.M.C.A. of the Rockies, (800) 777-9622, www.ymcarockies.org, which bills itself as "America's leading host for family reunions," with more than 600 booked last year. To ease travel burdens, many reunions are sited roughly in the center of the country, and near a hub airport, so areas around Denver, Houston and Chicago are obvious choices.
As for whom to invite, the experts suggest casting as generous a net as possible, despite family feuds and cantankerous uncles. This could be an opportunity to mend fences and strengthen family ties. 
That doesn't mean everything will go completely smoothly, though. Asked if she would organize a second Ferrell family reunion, Ms. Ferrell paused, then quoted one of the participants: "Trying to organize Ferrells is like trying to herd cats." Nevertheless, she said, a couple of other relatives are talking about taking over the reins this year.

California Indians Turn Casino Into Full Resort

BYLINE:  By MARTHA STEVENSON OLSON

 BODY:
The Barona Band of Mission Indians, based about 30 miles east of San Diego, has in the last 70 years made an economic transition from cattle ranching to bingo parlor to a small casino. The newest expansion on the tribe's 7,000-acre reservation is the $260 million Barona Valley Ranch Resort and Casino, opened Jan. 1. 
 Its design by Bergman, Walls & Associates, architects of the Paris, Mirage and Caesars Palace casino hotels in Las Vegas, harks back to the ranching days of the 1930's, with dark wood and stone facades, a functioning old-mill water wheel and a restored barn. 
 The centerpiece of the resort is a new 300,000-square-foot casino with 2,000 slot machines, video poker, keno machines, an 11-table poker room and an off-track betting area. A 20,000-square-foot room, Founder's Hall, will have bingo as well as special events, concerts and meetings. 
The two-year-old Barona Creek Golf Club, designed by Gary Roger Baird, is a par 72 course that was named among the top 10 new national courses by Golf Magazine last year. The resort features eight restaurants and a lakefront Victorian-style wedding chapel with catering facilities nearby; the resort is awaiting a liquor license. 
The 397 guest rooms and suites start from $79 on weekdays and from $129 on weekends, with the 33 suites going for $250 to $1,000. Reserve at (877) 287-2624 or www.barona.com. MARTHA STEVENSON OLSON

In 2002, a Jump in Sales Of Million-Dollar Homes

BYLINE:  By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
NOTWITHSTANDING a noticeable softening at the end of the year, Westchester's luxury home market -- residences selling for $1 million and more -- thrived in 2002. 
 In all, 814 single-family luxury homes -- out of 1,575 on the market for $1 million and more -- sold in 2002. That was 250, or 44 percent, more than in 2001, when there were 1,102 homes listed at $1 million or more and 564 of them sold. 
Dollar volume also jumped in the luxury home category in 2002 -- to $1.4 billion, compared with $951 million the previous year. The median list price in the luxury category in 2002 was $1.55 million, somewhat more than the $1.525 median in 2002. 
So, despite a weak national economy, fears of an impending war and worries about terrorism at home -- or perhaps because of those factors, some real estate brokers said -- the luxury housing market flourished.
The economic and political worries, however, may have factored into a downturn late last year, when, as Billie Prizio, a sales associate for Julia B. Fee in Rye, said, "things were lethally slow."
Demand was weak in the fourth quarter, according to Greg Rand, a co-owner of Prudential Rand, which has offices in Westchester, Rockland and Orange Counties. "There was a heavy dose of caution, a lot of concern about the bubble bursting," he said, "and then everything changed."
After "the slowdown at the end of the year when demand dried up," Mr. Rand said, the new year brought a distinct change. "Buyers are back now," he said.
David Sacarny, the owner of Everest Estate Homes, builders in Bronxville, said the market for brand new luxury homes also experienced an upswing in January after a temporary downturn in the last quarter of 2002. "It's my sense is that people got so disgusted with stock market that they sought the stability of real estate," said Mr. Sacarny, who is building four homes in Purchase selling for $2.65 million and above. "For us, it was very quiet in October, November and early December, and then all of a sudden, things got crazy busy."
Houlihan/Lawrence reported a similar trend. It recorded 21 properties listed for $1 million and above going to contract in December and 58 such properties going to contract in January.
Low interest rates are also said to be drawing buyers to real estate, despite concerns about the economy in general. Mr. Sacarny observed that more buyers are able to afford the monthly payments on expensive homes when the rates are low. The prevailing rates for a five-year adjustable rate mortgage in the week that ended on Jan. 31, according to American Home Mortgage in White Plains, was between 3.875 and 4.875 percent.
Houlihan/Lawrence reported that in 2002 Scarsdale remained the top community for sales in the luxury category, followed by Rye, Larchmont, Bedford, Bronxville, Armonk, Chappaqua and Briarcliff.
But the $1 million-plus market has widened in Westchester, according to representatives at Prudential Rand, Houlihan/Lawrence and Julia B. Fee, with sales at that level being seen in places where they rarely were before, like Yorktown, Croton, Irvington, Dobbs Ferry and White Plains.
The most expensive home for sale in 2002 was a $23.5 million 20-room contemporary in Chappaqua, listed by Houlihan/Lawrence. It is still on the market. Others listed in 2002 that have not sold include a $17 million turn-of-the-century residence on the Long Island Sound in Mamaroneck and a $15.5 million 1858 Victorian on 117 acres in North Salem. 
AMONG those that did sell was a $6.5 million 11,000-square-foot mansion on 12 acres in Bedford Corners, a $7.25 million 1950's Georgian colonial along Larchmont Harbor and a $5 million Tudor manor, built by George Jay Gould, the son of the railroad tycoon Jay Gould, that overlooks Manursing Harbor in Rye.
Noteworthy houses now on the market at somewhat lower prices include a 1906 Tudor manor in Bedford Corners on a 4.6-acre hilltop setting with an asking price of $4.1 million. In Pound Ridge, a 15-acre property being offered at $3.5 million includes a main residence with a section dating back to 1775, a guest house, a caretaker's cottage, a barn and paddocks and a pool house.
Realtors said that in general houses selling for more than $4.5 million are taking much longer to sell than those listed for $1 million to $4.5 million.
According to figures for all of Westchester supplied by George Stone, an owner of Julia B. Fee, which has offices in Larchmont, Scarsdale and Rye, the inventory of homes on the market at $1 million and above was 1,575 homes in 2002 compared with 1,102 in 2001.
The jump did not appear to be connected to "any particular outside influence," nor did it contribute to a decrease in prices on luxury properties, according to Anthony P. Cutugno, director of Houlihan/Lawrence's Luxury Country Properties division. "People list their homes for sale for a myriad of personal, family and career reasons," he said, "National or international events don't appear to have anything to do it."
Buyers of luxury homes are benefiting from the increased inventory in that they have more to choose from, with sellers not adversely affected either. "Essentially, we now have a far more balanced market in the luxury sector than we have seen over the last several years when inventories were extremely low," Mr. Cutugno said. "Supply and demand are now far more in synch." 
By contrast, other sectors of the housing market were held back by a severe shortage of listings, with inventory at one-third to one-half of normal levels, according to the fourth-quarter report of the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service.
While the rest of the nation enjoyed record-high home sales in 2002, according to the report, the Westchester-Putnam area was held back by the relative shortage of homes listed at less than $1 million. Over all, the number of sales in Westchester last year was up only 1.8 percent over 2001. In the fourth quarter the number of sales, 1,194, was down 3.6 percent from the corresponding quarter a year earlier, when 1,239 homes were sold. Dollar volume of sales, however, was up 20.3 percent in the latest quarter.
"The consequences of low inventory are the reduced sales rates and the higher prices that we have experienced since 1999 and 2000," the report said. The median sale priceof a single-family home in Westchester during the fourth quarter was $520,000 -- down from the median price in the third quarter, $570,750, but up about 22 percent from the end of the fourth quarter of 2001, when the median price was $428,000.
Over all, the housing inventory in each quarter of 2002 was higher than that of the corresponding quarter in 2001. By year-end 2002 there were 3,700 units available for sale in Westchester County; that was 47 percent greater than 2001's year-end count. But the percentage increases are exaggerated because they were calculated against a very low base, the report said. The recent inventory is far below the levels of 6,000 or more units available in 1998 and 10,000 or more in the early 1990's and earlier. 
Looking ahead, the county is starting the year with more inventory than at the start of 2002, and this may pave the high for a higher rate of sales by a few percentage points, the Board of Realtors predicted. In the high-end sector, the marketing slowdown reported in the fourth quarter of 2002 may be reflected in fewer closings and lower prices in the first quarter of 2003. That circumstance may pull down the overall mean sale prices for the quarter but is not likely to affect median sale prices much, the report said.

New Jersey Shipping Hubs Add Buildings

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
CRATE & BARREL, the home furnishings retail chain, recently signed up to be the sole user of a soon-to-be-built 675,000-square-foot warehouse and distribution center near Exit 8A of the New Jersey Turnpike and said it wanted to expand it to nearly 1 million square feet.
 In the New Jersey Meadowlands, Orix Real Estate Equities, a subsidiary of a Japanese financial services company, is constructing an industrial building of almost 370,000 square feet on speculation. 
 And even closer to New York, in Jersey City, Keystone Property Trust, a Philadelphia-area real estate investment trust, is building two distribution centers totaling about 524,000 square feet. As is the case with the Orix building in the Meadowlands, no tenants have been signed up for Keystone's properties, according to brokers.
At a time when lots of older industrial buildings have plenty of space available, both retailers and developers appear to think that steady consumer demand and a rising surge of imports will provide demand for the newest and most modern buildings that process and handle goods. 
And virtually all of the action is in New Jersey, rather than being spread more evenly throughout the metropolitan area. Real estate executives say the state's ideal location west of the Hudson River but close to New York City, its good road, rail and air connections and the availability of flat land make it a natural site for the handling and distribution of consumer and industrial goods.
"New Jersey is the third largest industrial hub in the nation, after Los Angeles and Chicago," said Stanley B. Danzig, an executive director in the New Jersey office of Cushman & Wakefield, the brokerage and services company. He said land is too expensive in Westchester and Fairfield Counties for industrial development, Long Island is too isolated, and flat land is hard to come by in rugged Rockland Country. Former industrial sites in eastern Pennsylvania are also being marketed, but they are that much farther away from the metropolitan New York consumer core.
The need for distribution centers is likely to increase steadily as the volume of imports grows at Port Newark and Port Elizabeth and as some Asian-made cargo that is now shipped to West Coast ports is diverted to the East Coast to avoid the cost of shipping by rail across the country. According to a study done for the North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority, about 6 percent of the cargo now coming into the New York port originates in Asia. That is projected to grow to 13 percent by 2020, according to the study.
The industrial properties are needed, planners said, to unpack goods, like apparel, that arrive in large shipping containers and quickly sort them for shipment to retail stores in the region. "You have to be able to deliver in one or two days," said Joseph Monahan, the director of financial services for Liz Claiborne Inc., at a recent conference on industrial real estate. "Even if your manufacturing base is overseas, you have to be able to deliver in one or two days to meet last minute promotional events."
Indeed, the ability to swiftly ship to stores in New York City or to support the broader Northeast regional market defines the two major industrial areas of the state: the close-in areas in Hudson, Bergen and Essex Counties, including the Meadowlands, and the former farming regions in the middle of the state near Turnpike Exits 8A and 7A. The Meadowlands are New York oriented, while distributors in central New Jersey are generally serving the wider region.
Proximity to the city is why Orix and Rreef, a division of Deutsche Bank, are building on 18.4 acres of land in Carlstadt in the Meadowlands, said Scott Coopchik, a senior vice president of Orix. Distribution centers there are tailored to handle small, expensive goods intended for retailers who like having their warehouse within five miles of the city.
"Firms that have goods that have to be shipped into the city don't want to go to 8A," about 30 miles to the southeast, said Mr. Coopchik. "We are talking about things like pharmaceuticals, eyeglasses and fashions."
Retailers pay for this proximity, Mr. Danzig said. Rental rates in Jersey City or the Meadowlands are $7.50 to $8 a square foot annually compared with $4.50 to $5 a square foot at Exit 8A.
LIKE most new industrial buildings, the Orix structure, to be called the Meadowlands Distribution Center, will be bigger, stronger and taller than most of the existing buildings in the area. Many of these range in size from 50,000 to 75,000 square feet and have ceiling heights of 18 or 20 feet.
"Most buildings are 300,000 to 400,000 square feet now, and we hear of requirements for 1 million square foot buildings," said Eugene A. Preston, vice president for development of the Rockefeller Group Development Corporation. "The 100,000 to 200,000 square foot buildings are on the sublet market."
The new "high cube" Orix building will have 32 feet of clear height below the roof trusses for more efficient storage. The higher roof increases the number of cubic feet of storage space available over the floor, a more efficient layout. The floor itself will be capable of supporting 750 pounds a square foot compared with 250 to 300 pounds per square foot in older structures.
Since it is assumed the building will be operated on three shifts round the clock and employ 600 people to sort and process goods, the parking areas for employees' cars and shippers' trucks are on opposite sides of the building and have separate entrances.
Real estate executives say efforts of New Jersey's state government to limit the sprawl of housing, retail properties, offices and industrial developments in rural areas may force developers to focus on somewhat contaminated sites, known as brownfields, near older urban areas. "If sprawl is restricted, the developers will look at brownfields," said Andrew J. Merrin, an executive vice president of Cushman & Wakefield's financial services group.
Even now, building sites in places like the Meadowlands are scarce enough that brownfield redevelopment is already taking place. "The site was a clay pit in the 1950's," Mr. Coopchik said, speaking of the Orix property. "In the 1960's it was filled with construction debris and then it sat fallow. When we got it, it was still an open landfill."
In recent years, though, technology has been developed to deal with sites of this sort. At the Orix site, the old dumped material was compacted to provide a base suitable to build on, permits and approvals were obtained and foundations are being poured.
Mr. Coopchik said his company was encouraged to build on speculation by the success of local developers like Hartz Mountain Industries and Russo Development that have built warehouses in the area. "These companies put up high cube buildings on spec, and most were leased to one big credit tenant during construction," he said.
He said the company will build the wall and roof of the structure, but will not pour the floor until a tenant is signed, so that piping and conduits to be built into the floor can be custom tailored to the tenant.
Suitable as the location might be to some tenants, the Meadowlands did not appeal to John J. Ling, the vice president for logistics of Crate & Barrel, an upscale furniture and home furnishings retailer. "The Meadowlands are not price competitive if you want to build a big box," he said, "and there are issues involving pilings and floor flatness" related to the marshy land. 
Mr. Ling said the company looked at sites in New York, Pennsylvania and elsewhere in New Jersey before settling on the Rockefeller Group's Foreign Trade Zone in Cranbury near Exit 8A. The new distribution center will consolidate operations from a multilevel furniture warehouse in Elizabeth and a smaller operation in Dayton, N.J., in the 8A area.
Staying in central New Jersey means that the company will be able to hold on to most of its experienced employees, Mr. Ling said. 
The initial 675,000 square feet of development will consist of two buildings: a 300,000-square-foot structure for furniture and a separate 375,000-square-foot building for housewares that will include a 9,000-square-foot retail outlet. The center will handle distribution to retail stores and ship furniture to customers, Mr. Ling said.
The deal includes an option to add 275,000 square feet of additional space, which Mr. Ling said he expected to exercise within two years to bring the complex to 950,000 square feet. The additional space will probably be used to support Internet sales, he said.
Another large structure recently completed in the Exit 8A area, although outside the trade zone, is a 928,000-square-foot distribution center operated by the automaker Volkswagen.
Being in a foreign trade zone is important, Mr. Ling said, to a company that imports 70 to 80 percent of the products it sells. The company currently brings most of its imports through the Chicago area because of Crate & Barrel's roots in the Old Town section of the city, but will shift to New Jersey and West Coast ports in the future, Mr. Ling said.
Being in such a zone allows goods to get off the docks more quickly, simplifies customs paperwork and can result in lower overall tariffs, Rockefeller Group officials say. Their company has operated a similar operation, the International Trade Center in Mount Olive, N.J., near Interstate 80, for 20 years, although that site is oriented more toward manufacturers than distributors.
Foreign trade zones are places where imported goods are treated as if they had not actually come into the country, for purpose of collecting tariffs, Rockefeller Group executives said. They were originally established near ports to facilitate commerce, but have since spread to remote locations.
"We realized that with containerization and interstate highways, there was no need to be near the port," said Leslie E. Smith Jr., senior vice president of Rockefeller Group Development. "Many companies preferred the suburban locations and the good labor force in those locations." The Mount Olive zone is about 50 miles west of the port.
There are more than 200 such zones operating now in the country, with at least one in each state, according to Brandi Hanback of TradeStar Advisory Services, a consultant to the Rockefeller Group. Some $200 billion in merchandise is shipped to trade zones each year, she added.
With much manufacturing having been relocated to foreign countries, many domestic companies have increased the attention they pay to their supply chains, seeking to move goods faster, with as little handling as possible, to control costs. 
F OREIGN trade zones are an opportunity for U.S.-based companies to compete by reducing their costs by deferring or eliminating duty payments and expediting the flow of goods," Ms. Hanback said. "Companies operating in trade zones are well known to Customs, which usually clears containers for shipment without the delays associated with shipments thought to be of higher risk."
Mr. Smith added, "This is a biggie for importers, who have horror stories to tell about delayed shipments."
Once in a zone, goods can be sorted and shipped out within hours, without waiting for documents to be filled out first. "You can file an entry summary at the end of the week, rather than as the shipments arrive," Ms. Hanback said. "This lowers the administrative burden and can save an importer several hundred thousand dollars a year."
Manufacturers in trade zones can take advantage of rules under which finished goods are sometimes charged a lower rate than would have been imposed on the imported components, Mr. Smith said. Distributors can also take advantage of the duty-deferred imports. "If the pink ribbons are not selling, it might be better to destroy them than pay the tariff," he said.
Besides the Mount Olive and 8A zones, the Rockefeller Group operates two foreign trade zones in Florida and one in the St. Louis area and expects to open more in the Chicago area and California. "We have paid a lot of attention to this niche and want to be in most major markets," Mr. Smith said.
Although there is speculative building in the northeast corner of the state, activity in the central portion is dedicated to specific tenants: the Crate & Barrel development at 8A and a building being constructed by Matrix Development for the electrical parts distributor W. W. Grainger at 7A.
"There is no talk of speculative building at 8A and 7A at this time," said Paul D. Cohen, an executive vice president of SBWE, a New Jersey brokerage company, and a specialist in industrial property in the state's midsection. "It's not like it was two and a half years ago, when the buildings were all coming out of the ground."
There are vacancies, he said, but the problem is not so bad that developers are losing control of their buildings to creditors. The major developers, he added, are acquiring building sites and working on planning and permitting so they will be ready to move fast with new projects when the current space is absorbed.
"The strong developers are planning now," he said, "because the New Jersey industrial market is going to be one of the strongest in the country as long as New York City is just across the river."
Orix's decision to follow local developers into the Meadowlands is unusual, real estate executives say, because institutional investors have generally preferred the central part of the state.
"Central New Jersey has been a focus for national REIT's," said Frank V. Caccavo, Jr. an executive director of Cushman & Wakefield, referring to real estate investment trusts. "It gave them access to the population and the work force, and the roads are pretty good."
Howard Freeman, a senior investment officer with First Industrial Realty Trust, a REIT, said, "We are bullish on New Jersey. It is one of our core markets and we want to be active here." He said the company currently owns 3 million square feet of industrial space in the state and is interested in finding opportunities to redevelop older properties if prices are right.
The development of the warehouse and distribution sector reflects changes in the state's overall economic structure, Mr. Merrin said. "In the 1960's and 1970's New Jersey was an industrial state with a mix of manufacturing and distribution," he said. "Then manufacturing shrunk and the office sector grew to the third or fourth largest in the country"
The availability of jobs in those offices spurred the growth of housing and an increasingly affluent population. "The driver of distribution growth is access to the region's population," he said.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Pension Group in $176.5 Million Deal; 
U.N. Fund Buys 41st St. Tower

 BODY:
A new 25-story, granite and teal-colored office tower at 222 East 41st Street was bought last week by the United Nations Pension Fund for $176.5 million, according to people with direct knowledge of the deal. 
 The site of the 371,814-square-foot building, which had been a parking lot near an exit to the Queens-Midtown Tunnel, was owned by the Travelers Insurance Company until three years ago. 
Travelers then went into partnership with Tishman Speyer Properties on the construction project. 
 The original deal was viewed as something of a rarity because the building was put up on spec -- with no tenants signed before construction -- and the recession of the early 1990's had left lenders loath to finance any building that did not already have a tenant. But by September 2000, with excavation just beginning, the New York branch of a Cleveland law firm, Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue, had leased 210,000 square feet, with an Internet company renting about 162,000 square feet, at an annual rent of $55 a square foot. The Internet company later backed out of the deal.
Last year the pension fund entered into negotiations to buy the building. With the law firm in place, U.N. offices will occupy most of the remaining space. Henry Ouma, the fund's investment director, said, "We don't comment on our investments."

At Tax Time, a Hidden Silver Lining

BYLINE:  By Terry Pristin 

 BODY:
PROMPTED by a flier that was distributed in his building, Orlando Fonseca went to a Harlem storefront last year to have his 2001 tax returns prepared free of charge through a program sponsored by Community Food Resource Center, a nonprofit organization. To his amazement, he discovered that he was entitled to $2,400 in state and federal earned-income tax credits.
 Mr. Fonseca, who works in a Deutsche Bank mailroom, paid $80 the year before to a commercial tax preparer but was never told about the tax credit, a benefit for low-wage workers. "It helped me catch up on my bills," said Mr. Fonseca, who struggles to support a family on an annual income of $19,000, "and my daughter is getting ready to graduate from high school and wants to go to college." (This year, Mr. Fonseca said, he will get $2,100 back.) 
 About 230,000 low-income New Yorkers who are eligible for earned-income tax credits do not claim them, city officials say. These wage earners forfeit a total of $465 million a year, money that could be poured back into the city's economy. Many of them simply do not file returns, said Amy Brown, the director of social justice for the resource center. "The average person thinks of taxes as something you have to pay, not something where you get money back," she said. There is no civil penalty for failing to file a return if no money is owed. 
This year, city officials say, people like Mr. Fonseca are likely to be bombarded with mailings, fliers and public service announcements built around the image of a waitress holding a tray of $10 and $20 bills and a catchy slogan: "It's your money, come and get it." The publicity is part of a citywide effort to help people take advantage of the tax credits without falling prey to the unscrupulous practices of some commercial tax preparers. Storefronts with volunteer tax preparers offering free services have been set up around the city. Locations can be obtained by calling (212) 487-4444.
Millions of pieces of literature relating to the tax credit, known as E.I.T.C., are being handed out in nine languages, including Albanian and Urdu, that are spoken in the communities where the need is greatest, said Gretchen Dykstra, the commissioner of consumer affairs. "By April 15," she said, "if you don't know what E.I.T.C. is, you've had your head in the sand."
Approved by Congress in 1975 and increased under the Clinton administration, the tax credits are based on income and the number of children living at home. A married couple with two qualifying children, for example, is eligible for the credits if the family income is $34,178 or less. 
The city's campaign has been financed in part with some of the proceeds from a recent settlement obtained by the Department of Consumer Affairs against H & R Block, the tax preparation company. In its lawsuit, the department had accused the company of charging customers exorbitant rates to lend them money in anticipation of refunds and tax credits. The tax-anticipation loans are unnecessary, officials say, because refunds can be obtained in 10 days if the return is filed electronically and the deposit is made directly to a bank account.
The advantages offered by direct deposit have provided an opening for four credit unions operating in poor neighborhoods to take the tax credit campaign one step further. They are sending representatives to the tax centers in the hope of enrolling thousands of new members and teaching them how to save the money they get back from the government. "We are using the E.I.T.C. as an excuse to reach out to the community," said Pablo DeFilippi, the chief executive of Lower East Side People's Federal Credit Union. 
Even though April 15 is more than two months away, the tax-preparation centers are already attracting working people eager to get a refund, Ms. Brown said. "People who hear the message will come out to get their taxes done more quickly," she said.
One person who showed up at the Harlem storefront one evening early in the tax season was Latunji Ceesay, a maintenance worker who earns $18,000 a year. Ms. Ceesay, 31, said she used to rely on a family member to get her taxes done, but then a friend told her she might be able to recover some money. Ms. Ceesay, who has no children, was happy to learn she will receive $700. While at the storefront, she also took opened her first bank account.
"I got two things done," she said, smiling.

HEADLINE: The View/From North Canaan; 
Restoring a Landmark, A Rail (and Wish) at a Time

BYLINE:  By JEFFREY COHEN 

 BODY:
MORE than a year after the town's social and historic centerpiece was nearly burned down, residents in North Canaan are now hoping to focus on what can be, instead of what used to be. 
 On the grounds of the charred Canaan Union Depot, which was partly destroyed after four boys set fire to it on Oct. 13, 2001, the "for sale" signs are finally out of sight. 
 Last month, the Connecticut Railroad Historical Association bought the building for $325,000.
"It's been too negative for too long," Lyle Kloke, the association's secretary, said as he and members of the group toured the building with an architect on a cold Saturday just days after the official closing. "The thing now is to turn around and turn it into a positive experience." 
Words like "devastating" and "tragedy" peppered a conversation about the downtown station, which was built in 1872 and had been the home to several businesses as well as a main tourist attraction.
Although residents are trying to put the past behind them, it is the past that has made the depot with its two rail lines so special.
"It's still the talk, of how much the town is missing out on the people that used to stop here," said John Humes, whose father, First Selectman Douglas E. Humes, is working on the project. "Now they just pass through.
"I think the sooner the construction starts, the sooner they'll forget about how everything happened."
Douglas Humes put it simply.
"It burned on Oct. 13," he said of the building that is on the state and national registers of historic places. "We would like to put it back the way it was on Oct. 12."
To do that, the association will need to raise $2 million or more, Mr. Humes said, adding that he expects the money to come from fund-raising and grants.
"It has to work, and it will work," he said. "It's very important for the whole community economically."
The events that left less than half of the Victorian station standing has been described by some as a prank gone wrong. 
Four boys, all under age 15, set fire to the depot, said John Foley, the assistant volunteer fire chief and the fire marshal who inspected the blaze. 
"We knew it had a little help, because it was burning from the outside in, and not the inside out," said Mr. Foley. "The strategy was to cut the fire off at the middle and save this half."
Two of the boys, Andrew Anderson and Devin Lyman, were convicted of arson and received a combination of jail time and restitution. The other two boys involved in the fire were tried as juveniles and their cases were sealed.
Besides his fire department work, Mr. Foley, as might be expected in a town of 3,400, balances several other roles, including being treasurer of the railroad historical association, and treasurer of one of the three banks that loaned the association the money to buy the building . 
First Selectman Humes, who is also the vice president of the association, is overseeing the project along with Leroy Riva and Robert Gandolfo. 
The organization hopes to restore the building to what it was with the help of architects from Lee W. Cable, AIA. Plans include a retail store, office space, a railroad museum, a restaurant and a lounge, Mr. Humes said.
"It's gone now, but we knew what was there, and there was a lot of memories there," he said.
Aiden T. Keilty, owner of the burned-out Keilty's Depot, has been interested in moving his restaurant into the station's salvaged section since Day 1, but only now does the possibility of reopening the dining spot that anchored the depot seem like a reality.
"It's been an ordeal," Mr. Keilty said, adding that the fire devastated a business that supported the two families that ran it. "The one thing my wife and I have taken from this whole mess is that things we don't have any control over we don't really get upset at anymore."
After the fire, the building's owners, Paul Ramunni and Ross Grannan, first tried to raise money to restore half of the building. In early 2002, Mr. Ramunni bought out his partner. 
Mr. Ramunni said he faced three main problems: he was underinsured; he could not find contractors willing to work for what he could afford; and he did not have nonprofit status, making him ineligible for grant money or low-interest loans.
With the money Mr. Ramunni got from the insurance, he demolished the burned wing and the tower that united it and the north-south wing, which all cost about $200,000. But even after architects drew up restoration plans, it just came time to sell, he said.
"I just realized that I was trying to jam a round peg into a square hole and I wasn't able to do it," Mr. Ramunni said.
As for the depot, Mr. Kloke recalled what is was like having another restaurant within walking distance in town.
"It was nice to be able to walk down on a snowy evening, have an after-dinner drink and a cup of coffee, and walk home in the snow," he said. "I can't do that anymore."
William Adam, a retired surgeon who is on the association's board, grew up here, like his father and grandfather.
For Mr. Adam, memories of the station include his neighbor Victor Coe, a ticketmaster and telegraph operator, and the July4 fireworks he ordered as a child that arrived by rail. 
"Canaan is not a very vocal town like a lot of these other towns, but we have a lot of pride," he said.
Mr. Adam also owns the town's only winery, the Land of Nod, and has pledged to make a new label with the depot on it. He said he hopes to give 10 percent of the proceeds from the label to the restoration effort. But at $12 a bottle, the association will have to look to more than wine sales to raise enough money to restore the building.
"Hopefully, with the change in ownership, people will be a little more forthcoming with donations," Mr. Kloke said, adding that people may have been less likely to donate money to a commercial project for which they would not get a tax deduction.
Mr. Adam agreed.
"It wasn't a good arrangement for anybody," he said.

HEADLINE: Catch a Movie, or Maybe 50 

BYLINE:  By GARY SANTANIELLO 

 BODY:
DESPITE a difficult economic environment for many arts organizations, the Director's View Film Festival is offering an ambitious new documentary program this week in addition to its full schedule of film screenings, awards, panel discussions, receptions and galas.
 Founded in 1999 by Robert Kesten, a former actor and documentary producer, the film festival honors and celebrates directors' contributions to filmmaking, while seeking to create a permanent film presence in the region through its program of screenings, conferences, seminars and educational programs in local schools. 
 Mr. Kesten, who lives in South Salem, N.Y., said he hoped that attendance, which reached 10,000 in 2002, would grow again this year over the five days of events, from Thursday through Monday, in Greenwich, Stamford, South Norwalk, New Canaan and Westport. 
"It has been tough economically all around, but we hope the community support will be there again this year," he said. "We think we're offering something special."
The studio premiere of "Daredevil" will open the festival Thursday night at the Crown Regent Theater in South Norwalk. The movie stars Ben Affleck and
Joe Pantoliano, a Weston resident and festival board member. Tickets are available at various locations in South Norwalk.
One of the festival's honorees this year is Arthur Penn, who will receive the Joseph L. Mankiewicz Award for artistic integrity and excellence. Estelle Parson, who won an Oscar for her performance in Mr. Penn's 1967 classic "Bonnie and Clyde," will introduce Mr. Penn Friday night at a screening of his 1975 film noir "Night Moves" starring Gene Hackman. Mr. Penn, 80, will be honored at a black-tie dinner later that night at the Stamford Marriott. 
On Saturday night, Lisa Cholodenko will be given the Dorothy Arzner Prize for women who are filmmakers after a screening of her new film "Laurel Canyon" at the Crown Theater in Greenwich. The movie is about the relationship of a mother (Frances McDormand) with her conservative son and his bride-to-be (Kate Beckinsale). It will be released nationally in March by Sony Picture Classics. Other festival programs include one featuring new films by first-time directors from around the world; one called the International Student Film Festival, which presents the work of filmmakers 19 years old and under; and the Community Film Project, which will unveil two locally produced films, one based on the play "Our Town" and the other on the short story "The Lottery."
The documentary division, initiated by the Weston resident and documentary filmmaker Amy van Daalen, attracted 150 entries from around the world and will showcase more than 20 documentaries over the final two days. Albert Maysles, a documentary pioneer, will be honored on Monday night.
Mr. Kesten said he was surprised not only by the number of documentaries entered, but by "the outrageous quality of the work. So many of them were so good."
"For many filmmakers, documentaries are a real important way of entering the industry," he added, "and it's an area that's growing by leaps and bounds. Many cable channels, for example, are looking for the work of documentarians."
Ms. Van Daalen, whose documentaries have appeared on PBS and National Geographic television, said her vision "was to show the versatility of the documentary form --historical, investigative, humorous, experimental. " About 20 documentaries will be shown during the festival, running the gamut from "Nine Good Teeth," about the filmmaker's 102-year-old Italian-American grandmother to the Finnish film "Cleaning Up!", which follows the rock band Cleaning Women as it tours Eastern Europe, playing instruments made of old cleaning equipment. "The music is quite wonderful, actually," Ms. van Daalen said.
The directors of all but a few of the documentaries will be on hand for question and answer sessions after the screenings. 
Films by women, in particular, are a programming priority at the festival, particularly through the Women In Film series. 
"My feeling is that women are being left out of the industry mix, to a large degree," said Mr. Kesten. "Per capita, more women were directing in the silent era than today, but they bring a unique sensibility to their art."
One other goal of the festival is to secure a permanent site, but until then, it will continue to spread across towns in Fairfield County. As Mr. Kesten put it, "If people won't come to Muhammad, Muhammad will come to the people." 
To order tickets for the festival, call (914) 533-0270 or visit www.dvff.org. Information may also be obtained by sending an e-mail message to info@thedirectorsview.com. There will be approximately 130 films shown, including independent, student films, documentaries, premieres and the films of Arthur Penn. Ticket prices range from free to $20 (for the opening-night premiere of "Daredevil." Prices for the various seminars, receptions and galas vary widely.

HEADLINE: In Newtown, A Master Plan Creates a Stir 

BYLINE:  By NANCY DONIGER 

 BODY:
IT has been a long debate. 
 In 2001, Newtown negotiated an agreement with the state to purchase 186 acres and associated buildings that belonged to the now defunct Fairfield Hills mental hospital and has since been trying to figure out what to do with the property. 
 Now, the town has come up with a plan, which will be presented to the Board of Selectmen on March 3 for approval. 
Taxpayers will also have an opportunity to vote on the plan at a public meeting, although no date has been set. But no one expects the debate to end even after the voting. 
The centerpiece of the town's master plan for the property -- and one of its controversial elements -- is a new $8.5 million, 40,000-square-foot Town Hall overlooking a town green. The plan also calls for the construction of seven ball fields, preservation of buildings deemed worthy for economic development and demolition of the most severely deteriorated buildings. 
The eight buildings earmarked for economic development would be used for town purposes or leased or sold to private industry. 
The town's Fairfield Hills Master Plan Committee spent 10 months and held 24 meetings to develop the plan for the property, which the town will take ownership of in June. The committee invited 45 community groups to make presentations, held two workshops, played host to a tour and produced a video for broadcast on local access television. 
Still, a group called the Friends of Fairfield Hills does not care for the plan. The members oppose the sale of any buildings, and go even further: they want the entire property retained for town use, with very limited commercial use.
Robert Geckle, chairman of the master plan committee, grew up in Fairfield Hills. His father, George Geckle, was the hospital's chief administrative officer for 30 years when it was at its peak, with 4,000 patients and 2,000 staff members.
"When I was growing up I never dreamed the hospital would some day shut down," he said. "We aren't trying to decide everything now. We're going ahead with the playing fields, Town Hall and purchase, but will leave other decisions to the future." 
First Selectman Herb Rosenthal said: "I feel the committee has done a great job listening to the public and incorporating flexibility for the future. Where we are almost parallels what the Friends of Fairfield Hills outlined. We're also taking into account other people who are concerned about the tax base. We're not recommending factories or light industrial uses. We're recommending offices that would offer services that are desirable to have."
Earlier versions of the master plan contained residential development that has since been eliminated in response to a negative reaction fromtaxpayers.
"We had strong feedback against including any housing," Mr. Geckle said. "People also were vehemently opposed to selling any of the land to assure the town keeps control of it."
Although the master plan does not recommend housing, it is permitted under the town's zoning regulations for Fairfield Hills.
Also eliminated from the draft was an idea to build an office park on the campus's west meadow.
"We will leave the high meadow as open space, although future generations will have options to use it if the need arises," Mr. Geckle said.
Fairfield Hills originally comprised 800 acres the state purchased in 1929. A community unto itself, the hospital was designed to look like a college campus rather than an institution. 
After closing the hospital in 1995, state officials determined that the buildings and grounds were surplus and offered them for sale, giving the town the first right of refusal. Residents voted in June 2001 to purchase 186 acres and associated buildings for $3.9 million. The purchase was part of an overall $48.7 million bonding package that contained two related resolutions. 
The first, for $21.7 million, includes the $3.9 million purchase price, plus financing for the master plan, playing fields, asbestos removal, building renovation and demolition and environmental insurance. Another $27 million resolution was approved for a new intermediate school, which opened on the campus in January. 
Ruby Johnson, who heads the Friends of Fairfield Hills, and has been a resident of Newtown for 36 years, was a driving force behind the town purchase. The town already owns 100 acres of the former hospital land, which was acquired by State Representative Julia Wasserman and her 1994 Task Force to Study the Re-Use of Fairfield Hills State, bringing the town's holdings to about 300 acres, in addition to 300 acres deeded to the Department of Agriculture. 
Harrall-Michalowski Associates Inc. of Hamden prepared the master plan for the committee, emphasizing a philosophy of flexibility, leaving 72 percent of the acreage as open space, recreation fields or land banked for future use, while preserving the architectural and design characteristics of the campus.
Ms. Johnson does not believe the master plan committee listened closely enough to what residents had to say when they addressed the group. The Friends of Fairfield Hills want Mr. Rosenthal to form a cultural arts commission to solicit grants and do its own fund-raising.
Although the bond issue does not include funds to renovate any of the buildings for recreational or arts purposes, Ms. Johnson is confident that the artists, dancers, potters, woodworkers, sports enthusiasts and thespians in town who want space will make it happen.
"We see this land in the heart of town that should be used for the desires of the people," she said. "Democracy works from the bottom up, not from the top down. People who care should have the freedom to take their ideas and make them work." 
A private citizen has already offered to contribute $500,000 toward a recreational center, she said. The Friends of Booth Library have been holding their annual book sale at Bridgeport Hall, a building earmarked in the master plan for private development and town use. Ms. Johnson would like to see the building retained for the book sale, cultural arts and for the growing senior citizen population, which has outgrown the present senior center. 
"People have been led to believe that we can make a lot of money out of Fairfield Hills, but they've fallen for a false expectation," she said. "It takes $1.6 million of tax revenue just to reduce taxes by one mill. The tax revenue that could be generated is not enough to affect the needs of the town. If we don't save the land, where will we be able to build another new school when we need one?"
The Friends of Fairfield Hills disagree with the proposal to build a new town hall. They want to see an existing building, either Shelton or Canaan House, renovated at lower cost than new construction, as approved through the bond issue. 
Mr. Geckle said the master plan would accommodate either renovating an existing building or constructing a new one.
Ms. Wasserman said she would like to see the whole process slow down for a time.
"The state budget is in dire straits," she said. "Newtown as the 12th wealthiest community in Connecticut and can expect to get a minimum amount of state aid -- even less than in the past. We shouldn't spend the money in the bonding package now. This isn't the year to do it."
Mr. Rosenthal disagreed.
"The money has already been approved," he said. "The good news is that since we don't get much state money. I'm unhappy that we lose any, but it's not significant."
Robert Hennessey, who moved to Newtown five years ago, said he supports the group's initiative to retain the campus for town use.
"Decisions are being made too quickly," he said. "The voices of residents are not always heard. The consultant is presenting choices based on what the first selectman wants. This is an election year, and he is looking to rush this through, to leave a legacy."
Meanwhile, Mr. Rosenthal has voiced displeasure with the criticism that has been directed at the committee and its master plan.
"The vast majority of the people are happy with the plan," he said. "Attempts have been made by certain individuals who are not getting 100 percent of what they want to try to undermine the good work the committee has done.
Ms. Johnson said: "We have a motto that we say at the end of all our meetings: Keep Newtown rural. Keep Fairfield Hills green."

The Archbishop Speaks

BYLINE:  By JILL P. CAPUZZO 

 BODY:
WITH liturgical music playing in the background, the archbishop of Newark assured about a million Catholics last Sunday that their contributions to his annual fund appeal would not be used to defend priests accused of sexual abuse or to suppress their accusers.
 "Let me once again assure you that not a penny of our ordinary income has ever been used to silence victims of abuse by our priests," Archbishop John J. Myers said in his appeal for donations, which was distributed by videotape to the 235 Catholic churches in the Newark Archdiocese and played by most of them at Sunday services. 
The decision to include such a direct statement in the message had been recommended by members of the archdiocese development group because of the concerns of many churchgoers about where their pledge dollars were going, said Jim Goodness, a spokesman for the archdiocese. He said four dozen to five dozen parishioners had written letters saying they were rethinking their commitment to the church after the sexual abuse scandal broke last year. 
"A number of donors have raised that issue: how much of what has been raised is going toward settlements?" he said. "We felt it was necessary to give reassurance that the money is used wisely, providently, and for the ministries of the people."
The annual drive is intended to benefit programs like bereavement ministry and marriage preparation classes, as well as for training seminarians and for general administration of the archdiocese, Mr. Goodness said. The archdiocese's insurance policy pays for settlements or for defending priests accused of sexual abuse, he said but acknowledged that premiums for that are part of general administration costs. 
Ben Cotton, leader of the New Jersey chapter of the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests, a national group based in Chicago, said it did not surprise him that the archbishop would address the abuse issue directly in his annual appeal.
"Every diocese across the country has been hurt financially by the scandal, and one of the reasons is that the parishioners don't want to pay for the cover-up of priests," Mr. Cotton said. "I don't know if it's in the mind-set of the parishioners to begrudge the survivors their settlements. But apparently whoever is advising the archdiocese on collection policy priorities thought that this would appeal to the flock."
In 2002, about 60,000 people pledged donations in response to the archbishop's appeal, raising $12 million, said Deacon Joe Dwyer, executive director of development for the archdiocese. (This does not include millions of dollars donated in weekly collections at the parishes of Essex, Union, Hudson and Bergen counties, some of which is turned over to the archdiocese.) Over the last couple years, pledge donations have dropped 3 percent to 5 percent, Mr. Dwyer said. 
"Our goal for 2003 is to achieve 10 percent more than last year, but we'd like to at least hold the line in terms of our donor base and the dollars raised," Mr. Dwyer said.
After a conference of bishops last summer in Dallas, Archbishop Myers also issued a videotaped message to the parishes addressing the sexual abuse issue and detailing the church's plans for handling it. But that tape reached a small percentage of the 1.3 million Catholics in the Newark Archdiocese, church officials said. 
At St. Helen's Church in Bogota, the post-conference tape was shown on a weeknight to about 45 people. The annual appeal tape was shown at all six services last Sunday, reaching 3,200 parishioners, said Msgr. William Harms, who called it "a good move."
"We've had letters galore, visits and angry people on the subject," he said. "People are still very interested, and the church is trying to assure them that their contributions are going to be put to good use."
Between the weakened economy and the abuse scandal, Monsignor Harms said, church attendance and giving have declined at St. Helen's, which serves 3,600 families. From the fall of 2001 to last fall, the church lost about 300 churchgoers and $1,000 to $1,200 in weekly donations, he said.
Msgr. Tom Ivory at the Church of the Presentation in Upper Saddle River agreed that it was a good idea for the archbishop to address the abuse issue directly. He said about 200 people showed up last fall for an open forum on the subject at his church.
"It's still in people's minds," he said. "I think it was wise to let people know where the money is not going as well as where it is going." 
Being upfront about how funds are spent has always been the policy of the Paterson Diocese, according to Marianna Thompson, the director of communications there. As spelled out in its financial report, published in a newsletter last week, the diocese has spent $2.4 million over the last 40 years in settlements, legal fees, therapy and support services for priests accused of sexual abuse.
"Our position has been to answer any question someone might have, and that applies to financial statements as well," she said. "Openness should lead to affirmation and restoring the faith of our people."

CORRECTION-DATE: February 16, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about assurances from the archbishop of Newark that contributions would not go toward the defense of priests accused of sexual abuse misstated the location of St. Helen's Church, one of those where the videotaped appeal was shown. It is in Westfield, not Bogota.

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS; 
The Prisoner of the State House

BYLINE:  By Laura Mansnerus 

 BODY:
AS he sat in one of those paneled rooms in the governor's inner office the other morning, James E. McGreevey looked like a sergeant who had just been forced to gun down civilians. In fact, the previous day he had just been forced to deliver the budget address.
 "We did what was necessary," the governor said, when asked how he felt about what should have been the worst day -- among many dreadful ones -- of his 13 months in office. It was also a day, as it happened, when about 4,000 doctors lined the street beneath his State House window, shouting about malpractice insurance rates. 
 What was necessary, in his opinion, was telling the people who elected him -- union members, retirees in trailer parks, marginally employed sick people, lovers of art and culture -- that the state cannot do much for them anymore. 
Mr. McGreevey had made his choice. Rather than raise sales or income taxes, a move that cost Jim Florio re-election 10 years ago, he would, he said over and over, exercise fiscal discipline.
But Mr. McGreevey, running a state where taxpayers give a lot and expect a lot, faces a fact that few predecessors have had to give serious thought to: fiscal discipline can get a governor thrown out, too.
When he talks about axing his constituencies, Mr. McGreevey is indignant, even stirring, at least for a man who almost never leaves the house without a stiffly starched white shirt, red rep tie and three-pointed handkerchief in the breast pocket of his dark suit. Ending grants for the arts is "incredibly painful," he said. The cuts in health care for poor adults are "atrocious."
But he cannot help pleading about the severity of economic conditions, which are truly difficult and overwhelming, but boring. The tax increases needed to close the 50 states' collective deficits, he said, "can exacerbate the contractionary tendencies in the economy and have a negative impact upwards of $150 billion on the gross domestic product." Next came Keynesian models and intergovernmental transfers. 
A few chairs down from the governor was John McCormac, the state treasurer. Mr. McCormac, who has done much to keep this government stitched together, seems to wear an expression of faint incredulity, as if he cannot quite believe he let anybody pitch him into this sinkhole.
"The executive branch has been cut two years in a row," Mr. McCormac said. "It's been a long time since anybody's seen the cost of running the government itself down two years in a row."
Mr. McGreevey interjected, ""It may go back to Governor Meyner," he said, referring to Robert B. Meyner, who was New Jersey's governor from 1954 to 1962.
There was more. The two of them volunteered that next year may not be any better, and the year after that does not look good.
Which leaves Mr. McGreevey, in 2005, to campaign on a record of lopping the near-poor from health insurance rolls, freezing nursing home payments, starving small theater groups and historical societies and pledging away the proceeds that the state was to get from tobacco companies over 30 years. 
Property taxes will have risen, and the governor will have cut property-tax relief, too, canceling the scheduled increases in people's yearly checks and eliminating the rebates altogether for those making more $100,000 a year. (There you have a good portion of the state's McMansion population, which has been surprisingly friendly to Democrats recently.)
Except for Gray Davis, who has to find an additional $35 billion for California, Mr. McGreevey may have the worst job in state government anywhere.
So what else is he supposed to do?
The easiest answer is what is being called the "millionaire's tax," which would raise marginal income-tax rates on high incomes. A liberal research organization in Trenton, New Jersey Policy Perspective, proposes to raise the top tax rate, now 6.37 percent, to 7 percent on incomes over $500,000 and 8 percent on incomes over $1 million.
The plan would raise a few hundred million dollars a year, far too little to balance the budget, and like any tax increase it would put a bit of a drag on the economy. But most economists say it is relatively harmless because it takes money that would probably not be usefully spent anyway. 
For a hypothetical couple earning $800,000 a year, the increase would be $1,890 --or about the difference between a new BMW X5 with a navigation system and a new BMW X5 with a seat pocket for maps.
When asked what there is not to like about this, a healthy majority of voters, at least when polled, support the notion. Some legislators support it, too, most notably the Assembly speaker, Albio Sires, from West New York, in a largely BMW-free district. 
But taxing rich people is not easy, says Senator Wayne Bryant, a Democrat from Camden who is co-chairman of the budget committee. As he put it, it is one thing to look at polls, and another to face the power of the well-heeled and their representatives.
Governor Florio's income-tax increase affected 15 percent of the population, Mr. Bryant said, but after enough wailing the increase "drove the other 85 percent crazy." 
Back in the governor's office, Mr. McGreevey sighed when asked if he favored any redistribution of the tax burden.
"Our perspective is not so much a grandiose discussion as to the equitable nature of tax policy," he said. "Our focus is a much more mundane, and basic requirement, that is, to balance the budget."All right. Some people say that when enough pain registers, the public will demand higher taxes --on someone --and Mr. McGreevey will capitulate. Some people say that has been his strategy all along.
What does Mr. McGreevey make of that? 
"Fundamentally," he answered, "we have to become fiscally disciplined."

HEADLINE: A Costly Battle Whose End May Be Near 

BYLINE:  By GEORGE JAMES 

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD 

 BODY:
THE clock is running out on a high-stakes contest in the Meadowlands Sports Complex, one that has often seemed like a good old-fashioned New Jersey street brawl -- complete with boasts and taunts. 
 Come Wednesday, the long-running battleto redevelop the 106-acre Continental Airlines Arena site -- current home of the New Jersey Nets basketball and Devils hockey teams, which are expected to move to a new arena in Newark by 2005 -- may be over. 
 That is the day the commissioners of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority are expected to announce the selection of what they consider the best of three proposals for the site, ending the warring by two of the developers as well as the stream of endorsements by any number of civic organizations and countless politicians.
To some observers, the lineup of prominent Democrats gathering behind a plan offered up by Mills Corporation of Arlington, Va., and the Mack Cali Realty Corporation in Cranford is as good an indication as any of which way the authority, led by George Zoffinger, its president and chief executive, is leaning. 
At stake is tens of millions of dollars in contracts, at least 20,000 construction jobs and perhaps as many permanent positions once the project is completed by 2011. Regardless of which one of three elaborate plans is chosen, hundreds of millions of dollars in income and sales taxes will be generated during construction over the next 10 years. In addition, 13 surrounding towns will get tens of millions of dollars in payments in lieu of taxes during that period, and millions more every year. 
"We think we have enough information to make a sound decision," said Mr. Zoffinger. 
Will the winner be Meadowlands Xanadu, a $1.3 billion pleasure dome rendered by Mills even though its competitor,-- Hartz Mountain Industries of Secaucus, claims the proposed project of offices, hotel and entertainment center, including indoor skiing and a minor league ball park, is nothing more than a mega-mall in disguise? 
Will it be Expo Park, the $815 million plan by Hartz Mountain and its partner, Forest City Ratner Companies, of Cleveland, with its mix of convention space, hotels, offices, stores and an indoor Formula One-style race track?
Or will it go to Arena Place -- the $989 million complex of offices, hotels, and refurbished arena that would hold, among other things, a 6,200-seat performing center -- proposed by the Westfield Group of Los Angeles? 
As Mr. Zoffinger scurried from one meeting to another last week, conferring with members of a citizens advisory committee, environmental and labor groups and a gathering of about 80 elected officials ranging from mayors and council members to state legislators, Mr. Zoffinger was careful not to reveal which project had the edge.
But regardless of which plan was chosen, he said, "It will have a tremendous economic impact on this region."
"I expect the state is not only going to get significant payment for the use of its land, which will go to pay off the accumulated debt that's choked the sports authority," he added, referring to the $160 million debt on the arena. "But there will also be a significant amount of property tax reduction in each of the surrounding communities."' 
Mr. Zoffinger's circumspection did nothing to discourage speculation over which developer would land the lucrative contract. Hartz -- because it is the biggest private landowner in the Meadowlands and is a major Democratic contributor -- would appear to have the inside track. But Mills, which had been seen as being closely aligned with the previous Republican administration in Trenton -- has spent a great deal of money on public relations efforts and newspaper advertisements extolling Xanadu. 
Moreover, Mills, in the competition to secure the most endorsements, has received the nodfrom such Democrats as Albio Sires, the Assembly speaker, and Bernard F. Kenny, Jr., co-majority leader in the state Senate, both of Hudson County, and Dennis McNerney, the new Bergen County executive.
Bob Sommer, a Mills spokesman, said that officials from the company made it a point to meet with everyone they could to extol the virtues of Xanadu, and added, "So it was relatively easy to get endorsements when political leaders saw their suggestions included in our plans."
Mills undoubtedly got some some bounce by teaming up with the Giants football organization, the primary tenant in the sports complex, which has endorsed the Xanadu plan.
Another seeming Mills advantage is its offer to deed to the state a 600-acre environmentally sensitive swath of land in the Meadowlands called the Empire Tract, where Mills had wanted to build a mall. That offer is contingent on whether Mills gets the contract for the arena site. 
To offset the momentum that Mills has been building, Hartz has recently run a series of advertisements in New Jersey newspapers criticizing the Mills plan as nothing more than a glorified mall. One ad, for instance, asked, "Will this mall be 1.5 million square feet of true entertainment and if so, what are the attractions?" 
To mitigate the advantage Mills might have with its negotiable tract of swamp, Hartz has offered to donate 93 acres of wetlands that it owns. 
Whichever bidder comes up with the contract, some fear that the resulting bitterness could be challenged in the courts. It is just those kinds of concerns that have led to talk of the authority choosing more than one developer for the project -- a shot-gun wedding of the two noisiest combatants, Mills and Hartz, or even a threesome with Westfield.
But Mr. Zoffinger insists that will not happen. 
"I have always said that this is a large enough project to satisfy a lot of companies, and it would be best if they came together and worked out some joint solution," said Mr. Zoffinger. "So far that has not happened. And frankly, we will just move forward in choosing one developer."'
No matter which developer is chosen, this project will hardly appear overnight. In fact, a completion date of of 2011 is the one most commonly cited. To get to that point, Mr. Zoffinger said he wanted to have "a shovel in the ground by late spring." 
Once the authority makes its selection, the commissioners will meet with the developer to make certain that the financial guarantees are accurate, and negotiations on the final agreement will begin. 
Of course, that is just one aspect of this two-carom shot. Discussions about the proposed arena in Newark for the Nets and Devils -- whose fate has been wedded to whatever happened up in Bergen County -- have been continuing. Most recently, Mayor Sharpe James of Newark boasted that YankeeNets, the organization that owns the Nets and Devils, was about a month from announcing an agreement to build the $355 million arena.
Still, Mr. Zoffinger emphasized that even if an an arena in Newark never gets built, the future of those two franchises will not affect the development in the Meadowlands; the teams will only be playing in the Continental Arena through 2005. The New Jersey Legislature debated the Newark arena for almost two years before turning it down last June. Bergen officials had fought against it, contending that there could be no deal until there was a workable plan for the Continental Arena. 
The impasse ended in August when Newark got a $165 million cash settlement from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey that would gotoward the arena's cost in return for an extended lease at the Newark Liberty International Airport.
Since then there have been few details about the Newark plan as Mayor James and officials of YankeeNets have been meeting to negotiate details. 
Even before the deal between Newark and the Port Authority, the New Jersey Sport and Exposition Authority had been seeking proposals for the Meadowlands arena site. And on Sept. 19, it announced that six had submitted proposals. After oral arguments in mid-October, the number was cut to three in late November. Since then the authority has asked for further refinements of the plans, including more information on the financing of the project, the income the authority could expect and rail and road improvements to the site. 
Westfield, which has silently stayed above the fray involving Hartz and Mills, describes its 4-million-square-foot Arena Place project as "an urban entertainment concept" complete with a town square. 
As for the existing arena, it would be refurbished to create a 250,000-square-foot structure that could house a performing area able to seat up to 6,200 and feature entertainment like Cirque du Soleil or concerts 120 days a year. The space could also be used for business seminars. 
The plan calls for 2.2-million square feet of office space -- three 10-story office buildings, two 8-story office buildings, a 15-story office building and an 18-story office building. There would also be a 500-room conference hotel, a 300-room business hotel and a 200-room extended-stay hotel. 
In addition, there would be a 76,000-square-foot multiplex cinema, 100,000 square feet of restaurants and 260,000 square feet of retail space.
As an enticement to those concerned about the effects on the environment, Westfield has said that Arena Place would be the only project that would not require a tidal wetland of eight acres east of the current arena to be covered and filled. As a result, company officials said, they would be able to build the project that much more quickly. On top of that, the company would contribute $7 million toward wetlands protection.
"We have the best environmental solution because we're maintaining the wetlands on the arena site as well as contributing substantial funds to the authority so they can best determine what surrounding wetlands to acquire and protect," said John Goodwin, Westfield's vice president for development.
William Sheehan, the Hackensack Riverkeeper, said environmentalists would pay close attention to how the winning developer dealt with the eight-acre wetland.
"Our concern is that the redevelopment of the land near the arena has to be done in an environmentally sensitive way," Mr. Sheehan said. 
Under the Hartz-Forest Ratner plan, called Expo Park, the arena would become a 500,000-square-foot convention center geared to attract visitors from across the country, said Emanuel Stern, the president of Hartz.
According to Mr. Stern, surrounding the center would sit four office buildings, each eight or nine stories, and two four-star hotels, also eight or nine stories, for a total of 1,200 rooms. Of the total 4.1 million square feet in the project, 2 million square feet would be given over to offices and 700,000 square feet to hotels.
About 478,000 square feet would go to entertainment and include a Formula One-style racing center (with cars slightly larger than go-carts), a skating park with a restaurant service that catered to skateboarders and roller-bladers, an arcade with games and a restaurant/pub and a movie complex. The 75,000 square feet of restaurants and 356,000 square feet of retail would be tied to a sports theme.
Mr. Stern sees his company as the home team that "understands the local and regional landscape," with more than a dozen properties in New York and New Jersey, such as the Soho Grand and Tribeca Grand in Manhattan and office buildings in the Meadowlands, including One Harmon Tower and Harmon Meadow Office Complex. 
And he said that his company was the only bidder that strictly followed the criteria that the authority set up in its requests for proposals. As to whether that would be the basis for a suit if Hartz doesn't get the contract, he said, "I'm not crossing that bridge until I come to it, and I hope I never have to think about it."
To date, Hartz's Expo Park has been endorsed by the New Jersey Thoroughbred Horsemen's Association and the Standardbred Breeders and Owners Association of New Jersey, two groups that Mr. Stern said had extra clout because the racetrack was the top revenue producer in the sports complex. 
But from the company's standpoint, the main selling point is the convention hall. 
"Family entertainment centers and office parks are not traditionally complementary," said Mr. Stern. "And the best chance of getting absorption of the office product rests on there being a business catalyst, and that's what the convention center is."
Then there is Xanadu from the Mills Corporation and Mack-Cali, a 4.76-million square-foot project that consists of four office buildings, each 11 or 12 stories, and a 520-room hotel occupying 1.76 million square feet and 500,000 square feet respectively.
The developers say that more than half the space of the project --2.5 million square feet -- is a "family entertainment component," although 700,000 feet of that is mostly devoted to retail use by high end stores like the British department store Harrods.. 
There would be a sports and recreation zone and a "kids" zone, says Michael Luchkiw, a land use lawyer with DeCotiis, Fitzpatrick & Gluck, an influential law firm in Teaneck.
Among 20 recreational and entertainment sites are an indoor ski slope, an aquarium in the shape of a tunnel, an indoor city for children in which they take on adult occupations roles like bakers and actually bake, an indoor wave surfing facility, a museum of the state's wildlife and the Meadowlands YMCA.
In addition, Mills has also proposed a minor league baseball stadium to seat 6,000 to 8,000 people despite the fact that there already is a minor league team, the Newark Bears, nearby.
As for the Continental Arena, the developers said they would leave it intact should the Nets and Devils decide to stay, but could retrofit it if necessary for conversion to a convention hall. 
As for the Empire tract, Mr. Luchkiw said Mills would again try to build a mall on the site, as it originally intended, if Xanadu was not selected by the authority.
According to figures released last week by the authority, Xanadu would generate nearly twice as much in taxes in the first 10 years as the other two, about $860.7 million, as against $467.8 million by Arena Place and $429 million by Expo Park.
In terms of the economic impact once the businesses are up and running, Xanadu would generate $2.29 billion a year beginning in 2012; Arena Place $958.4 million a year by 2011; and Expo Park $867.6 million a year by 2012.
Arena Place, however, would produce the most full-time jobs by 2011, a total of 22,418, compared with 19,498 by Xanadu and 15,250 by Expo Park in 2012.
Municipalities around the site will share $85 million to $126 million in the first 10 years of construction and operation -- payment in lieu of taxes -- and $12 million to $16.5 million in the 11th year with an escalating sum thereafter.
Mr. Zoffinger said the battling advertisements and the endorsements created a climate that made the selection job more difficult but in the end had no effect on the authority's decision.
"We based our decision on only four things: the economic benefit to the region; the actual amount the sports authority will get for leasing the land, the environmental impact on the region and the number of jobs construction and permanent jobs," he said.
David Listokin, an expert in land use regulation and co-director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University, said that the selection process, despite its drawbacks, seemed "reasonable."
"These are not easy choices," Professor Listokin said. "You have something there now that was kind of conventional when it was developed 15 or 20 year ago, but the world has changed; how we use space has changed." 
He added, "It's a big project with big impact, and this is the process by which we select and evaluate big projects in the United States."
After all is said and done, Mr. Zoffinger, a former developer himself, said he hoped that the winning project would be evaluated as "a job generator, an economic boon to the area."
"I hope," he said, "some 25 years from now that people will look back and say, 'You know, they did the right thing for the state."'

HEADLINE: IN BUSINESS; 
Wall Street North

BYLINE:  By MAREK FUCHS 

 BODY:
STOCKS were first traded underneath a buttonwood tree on Wall Street in 1792, and for a long time afterward, the financial industry was centered within the narrow canyons of Lower Manhattan.
 In the past half century, however, because of a need for more space, the flexibility afforded by computerization and, more recently, Sept. 11, Wall Street began to spread wider. The industry first went north -- to Midtown -- but soon trading desks, retail brokerage branches and back offices took root in New Jersey, Long Island and Westchester. 
 For Westchester, the growth in the financial sector in the last 15 years has been steady, and includes what officials describe as their prize catch: 2,000 jobs coming from Morgan Stanley, which lost 1.2 million square feet of space and 13 employees in the World Trade Center attack. In March 2002, the company bought the former Texaco world headquarters in Harrison, which it is upgrading. The four-story, O-shaped building, with a courtyard that will be turned into a trading desk, was built in 1977 and is 27 miles north of Morgan Stanley's headquarters at 1585 Broadway in New York City. About 20 Morgan Stanley employees are now at the site, working on transition issues, and the company expects 750 employees to arrive in the fall. 
"The financial industry is a mainstay of our economy and the Morgan Stanley purchase was a very important economic development," said Marsha Gordon, the president of the Westchester County Chamber of Commerce. "That is one of our prime properties." 
The building, which is 725,000 square feet, sits on 107 acres. Texaco left the site in 2001, after merging Chevron. 
Morgan Stanley will move senior management and support staff from its individual investor group into the retrofitted building, as well as 700 institutional traders, salespeople and support staff. Mindful of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, the company may keep some seats open in case of an emergency at another location. 
The company had originally intended to use a one million square-foot office tower t it built at 745 Seventh Avenue. But the 32-story building was only a block from Morgan Stanly's existing headquarters and the company thought that such a concentration of space would be too big of a risk. They sold the building to Lehman Brothers a month after the terrorist attacks. 
Sal Carrera, the county's director of economic development and real estate, said that since Morgan Stanley's purchase, up to half of the businesses that contact his office about moving to the county are financial firms. "Westchester can become a mini-New York City," he said. "We don't intend for it to take the place of the city, which will always be the center," but Westchester can provide a lower-cost alternative and serve as a backup location, he said. "If God forbid, there is another terrorist attack, you can still be up and running," he added.
But becoming even more of a financial hub by providing an alternative to New York City in the aftermath of Sept. 11 is a touchy subject for local officials.
"We never poach," Mr. Carrera said. "We just wait for phone calls." 
When the phone does ring, the county is ready with a bag of goodies. This can include mortgage tax forgiveness, low-cost electricity, sales tax abatement on equipment, access to grants, funds for training and help with commuting. The Westchester County Industrial Development Agency awarded Morgan Stanley $8.4 million in sales tax exemptions. 
Other financial service offices in the county are smaller in scale than Morgan Stanley. Merrill Lynch, for example, has a longstanding presence in the county, with three offices of stockbrokers in White Plains, Mount. Kisco and Scarsdale for a total of about 150 employees. 
But officials see the presence of corporations of various sizes as an important element in economic stability, and a break with the past when the county relied on several large companies, like I.B.M. 
"I.B.M. used to account for half the county's office square footage," Mr. Carrera said. 
Now, Mrs. Gordon added: "We're not a one-industry town. The strength of the Westchester economy has become its diversity."
New York Life Insurance Company is also considering moving 1,000 employees to the county. "We have a two-building home office complex in Manhattan and the bulk of the company is exposed there," said William Werfelman, the company's spokesman. The company began searching for space outside the city for part of its employees. "At this point we've narrowed our potential locations to within Westchester and New Jersey. We should have a decision within 30 days," Mr. Werfelman said. Last week the county's Industrial Development Agency offered the company incentives worth $1.7 million.
Within the financial sector there is diversity, which has allowed for areas of strength even during a weak stock market. 
Though equity markets have had it tough since the dot-com implosion began in March 2000, the residential mortgage market has been extremely strong, especially locally. "Many mortgage companies that are here are growing and others are moving here," Mrs. Gordon said. 
Financial services have been one of the industries compensating for the manufacturing jobs that were a big part of the county's employment picture a generation ago, but have since been lost.
Though companies like General Motors, which used to be in Tarrytown, are gone, the county's unemployment rate remains low. Westchester's unemployment rate was 3.7 percent in December, which was unchanged from December 2001. The rate compares favorably with the unemployment rate in New York State as a whole, which was 6.1 percent in December, up from 5.5 percent a year earlier, and the city rate of 8.2 percent, up from 7.1. 
With about 110 employees, Gabelli Asset Management moved from Midtown to Rye a decade ago. It now has 180 employees and the company says its home suits it well. 
"The Wall Street area itself doesn't matter anymore," a spokesman said. "Our sales team works on the phone anyway. And it's as easy to get to La Guardia from Rye as Manhattan. Our research staff does go to Midtown for company presentations, so there's a lot of Rye to Midtown movement." 
He complained, though, about taxes in Westchester and New York State compared with Connecticut, where the firm has offices. "When you sharpen the pencils" to compare costs, he said, the company would have to take a serious look at moving more operations to Connecticut.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET; 
Anger Flares Over Sales Tax

BYLINE:  By YILU ZHAO 

 BODY:
AFTER Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky and seven other of the 12 state legislators from Westchester rejected County Executive Andrew J. Spano's proposal to increase the county sales tax by one cent last week, most likely dooming the proposal, rancor flared between Mr. Spano and Mr. Brodsky, a Democrat representing Greenburgh 
 Mr. Spano and members of his staff warned that the rejection of the proposal would mean adopting a contingency budget passed in December entailing a double-digit increase in property tax collected by the county, layoffs of 30 police officers and 17 assistant district attorneys, reduced county aid to nonprofit organizations, and cuts of 300 day-care slots for low-income families. 
 "There is some kind of game going on here," said Larry Schwartz, deputy county executive, "and the losers here will be the property taxpayers in Westchester."
But Mr. Brodsky accused Mr. Spano, also a Democrat, of using nonprofit organizations as political pawns and of "not telling the public the true county budget."
Mr. Spano and the county Board of Legislators had counted on the extra revenue from the raised sales tax, valued at $67 million for the rest of the year, when they released the 2003 county budget in December that didn't raise property tax at all. 
The county needs approval from both the State Senate and Assembly to impose the additional one cent. Without the support of the county delegation in Albany, it is unlikely that other legislators will vote for the bill.
The county Board of Legislators unanimously supported the sales tax proposal in December. 
"There is still a slim hope" that the bill will pass the State Legislature, said Lois T. Bronz, chairwoman of the board, on Thursday. "Nobody said to me that the bill will not be submitted, so we assume it's still alive."
Mr. Schwartz said that the county government had already been "cut to the bone" by leaving more than 300 county positions vacant, eliminating pay raises for county employees, reducing travel and equipment budgets, lowering aid to neighborhood health centers and decreasing financing for antitobacco campaigns.
So far, no public employee has been laid off, but that will change without the additional sales tax, he said.
In addition, county property tax will need to be raised by as much as 22 percent in some places --Harrison was given as an example -- to balance the budget, Mr. Schwartz said. On average, he estimated the increase to be 15 percent.
Mr. Brodsky, who leads Westchester's Assembly delegation, said he favored a property tax increase because "a sales tax increase hurts poor people more." 
"This tax proposal is unfair," he said. He argued that since Westchester businesses, which don't pay large amounts of sales tax to the county, were big beneficiaries when property taxes were cut in flush times that it's time for them to give back.
He said the sales tax would not be imposed in Yonkers, Mount Vernon, New Rochelle and White Plains, where the sales tax has reached or is near its constitutional limit. 
According to Mr. Brodsky's calculation, total property taxes would need to be increased by only 1.8 percent to save the county budget, translating to between $100 and $200 each year per family. 
Since the county gets only 20 percent of the total property tax a family pays -- the rest goes to towns, villages and school districts -- total property tax will go up by 3 to 4 percent with Mr. Spano's projections if towns and villages hold their shares constant.
According to the 2000 Census, the median property tax bill for single-family homes is $8,826 in Westchester, and a 3 to 4 percent increase will mean around $300 a year. 
Alternatively, for a two-income household that spends $30,000 a year in Westchester, an average amount according to some economists in the county, a 1 percent sales tax increase would translate to $300 a year, about the same as the projected property tax increase.
But Mr. Schwartz pointed out that many kinds of food and medication are tax exempt in the county, thus providing relief to low-income families and the elderly.
"Sales tax is discretionary while property tax is mandatory," Mr. Schwartz said. "If you cannot pay your property tax, you lose your house. If you cannot afford the sales tax, you just don't go to Macy's."
The county has also pledged to return 25 percent of the revenue collected on the increased sales tax to the towns and villages to help keep local property taxes down. 
"Sales tax is a tax you don't think about," said Susan Tolchin, Mr. Spano's chief adviser, explaining that people don't usually fuss over 1 cent of sales tax when they shop.
But a significant increase in a property tax bill is something taxpayers will notice. Mr. Spano was reelected with 72 percent of the vote partly because he had lowered taxes.
"Andy Spano got himself into this mess," Mr. Brodsky said, pointing out that Mr. Spano chose to spend the county's income from tobacco settlements all at once. "He did a lot of tax cuts before the last election funded by borrowing and gimmicks." 
"Mr. Spano is not interested in going tit-for-tat with Richard Brodsky," said Ms. Tolchin. "He is only interested in avoiding a double-digit increase in property tax."

R.V.'s and Tourism Help Areas Buck the Economic Tide

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
ELKHART and Goshen, two small cities in northern Indiana, are a hotbed of job creation. How could it be? 
 The metropolitan area they anchor seems about the least likely place to have boomed in 2002. It says it has the nation's highest concentration of manufacturing, and this is a time when manufacturers are mired in a deep downturn. 
 But a comeback in the recreational-vehicle industry after a slump in 2001 helped give Elkhart-Goshen greater job growth than any other metropolitan area last year: -- 4.6 percent. With the Sept. 11 attacks still limiting foreign travel, sales of R.V.'s have jumped, and Monaco Coach, Keystone RV and Dutchmen are all adding workers in the area, which is near the Michigan border.
Across the country, employment rolls fell 0.2 percent last year, but some areas managed to do well. Almost 140 of the 316 metropolitan areas added jobs; among the biggest gainers were centers for tourism or the military, according to Economy.com, a research company that follows regional trends. 
Of course, job growth doesn't always mean that an area is booming. Elkhart-Goshen's work force at the end of 2002 totaled 122,500 people, still about 5 percent below the level three years ago. 
"It's making its way back," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com, "but it's coming off a very low bottom."
Several areas are posting record employment numbers, thanks to strong job growth last year. Like Elkhart-Goshen, at least three other metropolitan areas -- Biloxi, Miss. (second on the Economy.com list), Las Vegas (eighth) and Atlantic City (ninth) -- are benefiting from the gain in domestic tourism. Each of the three is drawing people to its casinos.
Biloxi has also been helped by another reaction to Sept. 11: the increase in military and security spending. Employment is up at its Air Force base, just as it has grown at the border security office in McAllen, Tex. (fourth on the list); at Los Alamos National Laboratory near Santa Fe, N.M. (fifth); and at the Army base in Tacoma, Wash. (seventh).
Completing the top 10 were Fayetteville, Ark. (third), where Wal-Mart and its suppliers continue to expand; Chico, Calif. (sixth), where affordable housing is wooing new residents; and Madison, Wis., where financial services are growing. 
At the other end of the spectrum, the bottom 10 areas highlight the surprising nature of Elkhart-Goshen's growth. The list of areas with the biggest employment declines is filled with manufacturing hubs, including Florence, Ala., and Flint, Mich., not for from Elkhart-Goshen. Technology centers like San Jose, Calif., are also still shrinking.
The economy began growing again in late 2001, but companies kept eliminating jobs. About 100 metropolitan areas remain in recession, according to Economy.com. 
"They're everywhere," Mr. Zandi said. "They're not just in one region. They're not just in one corner of the country. They're coast to coast."

HEADLINE: For Power Lunchers, an Entree of Malaise 

BYLINE:  By MIREYA NAVARRO 

 BODY:
ANNETTE OSNOS, who entertains frequently as an advertising sales manager for Business Week magazine, has not been explicitly told to cut back on costs, but in this economy "it's somewhat implied," she said. So while Ms. Osnos still takes clients to lunch every day, she does it with the practiced eye of a Costco bargain shopper.
 If wine must be served, she orders a bottle rather than one glass at a time, which is costlier. Steakhouses are avoided: they are too expensive because everything on the menu is a la carte. 
 And in a telling sign of a cultural shift in that sacrosanct ritual, the expense-account meal, Ms. Osnos said she favored places like Blue Smoke, a -- gulp -- barbecue restaurant, where it was almost impossible to spend more than $50 on food for two at lunch, but that still offered a trendy name. 
"I don't want anyone to think that I'm chintzing out on them," she said. 
The business lunch, a deep-rooted New York institution that oils the gears of publishing, finance, advertising and other industries, is an unfailing indicator of economic stress, and lately it has grown lean as poached halibut, hold the sauce. Suddenly people will declare that something light, very light, will do. Tabs are being watched closely. Tips are less generous. 
"The business lunch still exists -- some businesses can't do without it," said Marco Maccioni, a co-owner of Osteria del Circo in Midtown. "But all that bonus money at lunchtime disappeared or spread out," he said. "People are much more diligent getting their receipts. You see this instinctual behavior."
At Gabriel's, near Columbus Circle, Gabriel Aiello, the owner, said he had not seen such an erosion in corporate spending at lunchtime since the stock market crash of 1987. Regulars from neighboring media companies like ABC, CBS and Newsweek now come twice a month rather than once a week, but they often spend more on those rarer visits, Mr. Aiello said. "It's weird."
Restaurateurs all over town report dwindling crowds of businesspeople at lunch, while customers from corporations say that they feel like victims of an epidemic of budgetary self-control.
These are times of layoffs and hiring slumps, of an impending war and looming billion-dollar deficits, so who feels like plunking down big dollars for three scallops?
Rob Gregory, the publisher of Rolling Stone, said that in flusher times he often went out to lunch five days a week and spent $200 for two. But two years into a severe advertising downturn in the magazine industry, Mr. Gregory goes out perhaps three times weekly and tries to keep the check at $100 or so, partly to prevent his guests from getting ideas that lavish spending might mean that the magazine's advertising rates are too high.
"There are some things you can't help," Mr. Gregory said. "When you take out a big advertiser and they start eyeing the $400 bottle of wine you have to go along. What I try to do is grab the wine list first."
A couple of years ago, Rolling Stone put out a three-page policy memorandum for employees that downgraded the restaurants suitable for entertaining, specified the amounts that could be spent on meals and prohibited employees from entertaining each other, Mr. Gregory said.
"Some of the expenses take care of themselves in really tough times because about a third of my business lunches are canceled anyway because people are crazed working," he said.
The Manhattan business lunch long ago ceased to be a fabled three-martini social occasion. Concerns over diet and time forced the shift away from a long, social, high-octane drinking lunch, said Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, a business leadership group that works at improving the city's economic climate.
"Senior executives don't have the discretion to spend social time during the workday," Ms. Wylde said, citing the volatile economy and the increasing demands of business and travel as reasons.
Ms. Wylde remembers when she was taken to lunch quite a bit by chief executives. Now she is lucky to get a 15-minute meeting "on the fly," she said.
Senior and midlevel executives selling an idea or a product say that nothing beats breaking bread at lunch to impress, to create good will and to make the sale, without interruptions and in a more relaxed environment than the office can provide. And in a bad economy, some executives said, lunch becomes even more crucial in generating revenue, so some have stepped up their entertaining.
But the growing mind-set at many companies seems to be "Why do lunch when there's the telephone?"
"Our staff figured out a long time ago that the 20 minutes of business over a two-hour lunch can be done on the phone," said Adam Rothberg, a spokesman for Simon & Schuster, the publisher.
He said that editors, publishers and publicists did lunch "for the relationships and entertainment factor" but that many employees found it more efficient to spend the lunch hour at the gym.
With a white-tablecloth lunch dwindling in importance for business meetings, what is taking its place? 
For some, the after-work Heineken or the one-egg breakfast have assumed greater importance.
Mr. Gregory of Rolling Stone can exploit his ties to the music industry. Even while cutting back on dining, he is not skimping on great concert seats for advertisers -- fifth row center at a U2 show, "they remember that for years," he said.
Frugal habits have intensified over the last two years or so, especially during the recession and after Sept. 11.
The latest retrenching, however, has more to do with an atmosphere of caution, many of those interviewed said.
Usually, there is no specific policy or directive curtailing expense-account meals. Instead, said Ian Kaufman, managing partner at the patent law firm Ladas & Parry in Manhattan: "This is all subliminal. It's self-recognition rather than an edict."
Mr. Kaufman said that his firm had experienced "some diminution" in business, losing some clients to bankruptcy, but that the partners still took clients out. Their internal compass, however, is more likely to lead them to Jean Georges's cafe, Nougatine, rather than to the more expensive part of the restaurant, on Columbus Circle.
One printing company owner downtown said that some clients had tried to save him money by choosing less-expensive items on the menu. One even chose a diner, he said, with a resulting total tab of $30 for two. The client said he was in the mood for a sandwich. 
"I spent $300 on him once," said the businessman, who asked to remain anonymous because he took clients to lunch almost every day but wanted each to feel that he was getting special treatment. 
"I see people be more conscientious about the money I spend on them," he said. "They'll get the prix fixe, too. People are cutting back and not even realizing it."
Customers are indeed spending less, confirmed E. Charles Hunt, executive vice president of the Greater New York City Chapter of the New York State Restaurant Association, which has 2,500 membersin the city generating more than $10 billion in revenue a year. The decline of expense-account spending is one reason, he said, although such a drop is difficult to measure.
To fight back, Mr. Hunt said, restaurant owners nationwide were lobbying in Washington for the return of the fully deductible expense-account meal, which is only 50 percent deductible now.
"It's one of the things that would help," Mr. Hunt said.
Danny Meyer, who owns five restaurants in New York City, said his places had never been as packed for the twice yearly Restaurant Week promotion as they were last month. 
Among the usual Restaurant Week customers -- older people from Long Island and Connecticut taking advantage of three-course lunches for $20 -- Mr. Meyer noticed for the first time more youngish, working types. 
"This year, there were all kinds of people who were also doing business," he said. "It was another way to use your expense account wisely."
Tim Zagat, the restaurant-guide entrepreneur, said that the downturn in expense-account lunches had affected some restaurants more than others, and that it was hard to quantify the situation without a survey. But overall, he said, the drop seems to be significant.
Mr. Zagat said that for many Manhattan restaurants the cutbacks were compounded by the post-9/11 drop in traffic from business and recreational visitors. One indication that the restaurant industry is hurting, he said, was the decision by many restaurants this year to offer Restaurant Week discounts at both lunch and dinner, and some have preserved the low prices indefinitely. Another is that even the most in-demand restaurants are now eager to please.
"They are polite when they pick up the phone, and they're glad to hear from you," Mr. Zagat said.
Ms. Osnos of Business Week said she was pleasantly surprised last December when one of her lunch hangouts took 10 percent off a bill without prompting.
"I'm a fairly good customer for them, and maybe that was a way to say thank you," she said.
In a way, many restaurants are trying to offer plain good service. Mr. Meyer, whose restaurants are known for hospitality and good value in good and bad times, said the good will he had nurtured was paying off and that his restaurants were, for the most part, making the cut among corporate customers, who he said accounted for 75 percent of his lunch business.
Mr. Meyer said he was emphasizing quality even more to give him an edge. Like many other restaurateurs, he keeps a database of the tastes, table preferences and birthdays of regular customers in order to personalize service. 
"I don't know any restaurant in the city that is full at 2 p.m.," Mr. Meyer said. "The business and international travelers who were here on vacation are gone."
With no end in sight to economic woes and the threat of war, the prospects for the expense-account lunch look dim, some restaurateurs said. 
"When you're uncertain, how's your appetite?" Mr. Maccioni asked. "Are you hungry?"

CORRECTION-DATE: February 13, 2003

 CORRECTION:
The main article in Sunday Styles this week reported that business lunches had grown fewer and smaller in the economic squeeze since 9/11. It quoted restaurateurs' accounts of dwindling crowds, saying that the owner of Gabriel's, near Columbus Circle, called the erosion of corporate spending the worst since the crash of 1987.
A large photo of Gabriel's, at the top of the page, showed only two diners and many vacant tables. The caption, affixed by editors, said, "Lunch at Gabriel's." But the picture was made after 3 p.m., and the owner says he served 63 lunch customers that day. In fairness, The Times should have chosen a more representative photo, or should at least have specified the time.

A War Rally for the Dollar Could Be Short-Lived

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
THE outlook for the dollar has been deteriorating rapidly, but a quick start to a war with Iraq would be a short-term fix. War would lift the veil of uncertainty and give the dollar a boost. 
 Since the beginning of December, the dollar is off 8.2 percent against the euro and 1.9 percent against the Japanese yen. Against a broad index of America's trading partners and adjusted for inflation, the dollar is off 1 percent from December to January, according to Federal Reserve data. 
 But even a war rally is unlikely to get the dollar back on its feet for a sustained period. 
A look back to the Persian Gulf war of 1991 offers some insight into what the dollar may face in coming months.
After the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, the dollar fell 9.3 percent against the German mark, then the dominant European currency, and 15.1 percent against the yen. But once the ground war began in February 1991, the dollar took off, rising 30 percent against the mark and 13.5 percent against the yen by summer.
That is the lesson that most people remember. But what happened during the rest of 1991 is instructive. Although the 1990-91 recession was officially over in March and a recovery had technically begun, the economy showed few signs of life; the lift from the gulf war faded and the dollar sank. By the end of 1991, the broad trade-weighted dollar was almost back to its February low and was down 1.1 percent for the year.
History may repeat itself. Even though Europe and Japan are in worse shape economically than the United States, there are few positives for the dollar now.
Yianos Kontopoulos, chief global foreign exchange strategist at Merrill Lynch, estimates that about 2.5 cents of the current value of the euro against the dollar, which finished the week at $1.083, is a risk premium, which includes the threat of a war. He said that a war rally could push up the dollar almost 3 percent, to $1.05 to the euro, by the end of March, assuming that a war goes well.
David Gilmore, a partner in Foreign Exchange Analytics in Essex, Conn., added, "There will be a victory lap for the dollar following a victory by the United States."
But while a successful war with Iraq would cause much of the current global uncertainty to dissipate, Ashraf Laidi, chief currency analyst at the MG Financial Group in New York, said, "there is an inherent risk of an explosion of retaliation in the region."
There are also economic considerations. James McCormick, global head of foreign exchange strategy at Lehman Brothers in London, said that the dollar could not begin a sustained comeback until there were at least two back-to-back quarters of at least 3.5 percent economic growth in the United States.
In Lehman Brothers' current economic forecast, that won't occur until the end of the year, and by then Mr. McCormick is predicting that the dollar will have fallen to a value of $1.12 against the euro.
Laurie A. Cameron, global currency strategist at the J. P. Morgan Private Bank, says she thinks that oil prices will not come down as much as hoped after a war. That would be a negative for the American economy and for the dollar.
Then there are the twin deficits: the American current account deficit and the federal budget deficit, a duo that has not been a worry since the late 1980's. The budget deficit raises concerns about the performance of the government and, therefore, the economy. The current account deficit requires a continuous inflow of foreign capital to be offset. If this flow just slows a bit, the dollar will fall.
THAT should be a comfort to investors who have made bets in foreign markets and can bring home bigger profits, or at least mitigate their losses, as long as the dollar is weak this year.
A weaker dollar should also be a boon to investors who stayed at home and are still waiting for the economy and the stock market to revive. A lower dollar increases growth by making American exports less expensive abroad and by making domestic products, like autos, more competitive against foreign imports.

HEADLINE: An Iceberg of Irate Investors 

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
FRANCIS EDWARD WOLFE, a close-cropped, soft-spoken family man who hoped to travel the country with his wife in a motor home when he retired, hardly seems intimidating. But this 58-year-old former truck driver from Fredericksburg, Ohio, and other investors like him, have become one big nightmare for Wall Street. Mr. Wolfe sued Merrill Lynch last year over $172,000 in stock market losses in his 401(k) plan, and last month, arbitrators awarded him $310,000, including legal expenses.
 What happened to Mr. Wolfe may be particularly egregious -- it involves an investment in an Internet fund that his broker bought at the top of the market that also enriched the daughter of a supervisor. But across the country, there are hundreds of thousands, perhaps even millions, of people like Mr. Wolfe. They, too, pinned their hopes on the stock market in the 1990's boom and then lost out as the brutal bear market ravaged their investments. Many are making claims against their brokers. And there are growing signs that arbitrators judging these cases are showing more sympathy to investors than the firms had expected. 
 The trend, if it holds, is yet another sign that the worst is not over for Wall Street, which breathed a big sigh of relief in December when its top firms agreed to pay almost $1 billion to settle accusations that much of their research has been tainted. Other bills from the 1990's market mania, like these covering customer complaints, continue to come in for payment.
"The Wolfe decision sends a message that big Wall Street firms, and their brokers, will be held accountable for destroying the retirement savings of unsuspecting customers by recommending risky high-tech stocks and funds," thundered Jacob Zamansky, a lawyer at Zamansky & Associates in New York who represents Mr. Wolfe.
It is impossible, of course, to know how much brokerage firms will wind up paying customers who are suing them. Investor complaints can take years to make their way through arbitration, and investors who claim to have been hurt by corrupt Wall Street research may be waiting to file their cases until securities regulators release documents related to investigations into the practices of brokerage firms. 
But some securities lawyers and experts in arbitration cases say the flood of newcomers to the stock market in the late 1990's may be prompting arbitrators to take the side of investors more often. Unsophisticated and inexperienced investors who took enormous losses in speculative stocks peddled by brokers appear to be arguing with more success that the recommendations were unsuitable.
"When you get newcomers to the stock market, this adds a factor favoring the customer which may not have been as prevalent as before," said Lewis D. Lowenfels, an expert in securities law at Tolins & Lowenfels in New York. "The element of a newcomer's inexperience in investing builds on other factors which are weighed in determining suitability." Regulators require brokers to suggest only those investments that are appropriate or well suited to their clients' needs and circumstances. 
Accusations by customers that brokerage firms recommended unsuitable investments rocketed last year. According to NASD, which oversees the nation's largest securities arbitration forum, 2,644 cases in 2002 claimed unsuitability, 73 percent more than in the previous year. 
NASD statistics also show that customers are winning a greater percentage of cases than in previous years. Of the roughly 1,500 cases that were decided last year, 55 percent involved customer awards. In both 2000 and 2001, 53 percent of cases generated awards.
Not surprisingly, given the losses incurred in the bear market, arbitration awards were also higher in 2002. Customers received $139 million in awards, up 43 percent from 2001 and almost double the level of 2000.
There is more. The NASD's figures do not include class-action cases brought in state or federal courts; those cases are hard to track. They also do not include arbitrations going before the New York Stock Exchange or other arbitration forums. According to the Big Board, customer complaints almost doubled last year from 2001, rising to 1,009 cases.
Richard Ryder, editor of the Securities Arbitration Commentator, an industry publication in Maplewood, N.J., agreed that the higher customer awards indicated a shift in sentiment of arbitration panelists. But he cautioned that the greater numbers of cases in arbitration and the higher awards might also be a result of brokerage firms' inability to settle cases before arbitration. Lawyers for the brokerage houses are overwhelmed by the flood of cases, he said, and have less leeway to offer settlements because their firms, also hit hard by the bear market, have much less cash to throw around.
"There is always a greater risk to the firm in going to the fact-finder for determination than in settling the case," Mr. Ryder said. 
CONSIDER the arbitration decided a few weeks ago in favor of Mr. Wolfe. He sued Merrill a year ago, and the New York Stock Exchange arbitration panel that heard his case awarded him $235,000 in compensatory damages and $75,000 to cover lawyers' fees. Arbitration awards are binding and are rarely overturned. 
Although every customer's case is different, Mr. Wolfe's situation mirrors that of many neophyte investors across America who were convinced by overly optimistic stockbrokers that the only risk associated with the stock market was not being in it. 
Mr. Wolfe's case is very close to that of dozens of other Merrill Lynch customers who invested with Joel Cessna, a stockbroker at the firm's office in nearby Wooster, Ohio. 
Mr. Wolfe was one of almost 200 people who in January 2000 took early retirement deals from Rubbermaid. At least 50 of them went with their payouts to Merrill Lynch, where Mr. Cessna and a colleague advised them to buy Internet and technology stocks, said Mr. Zamansky, who also represents some of Mr. Wolfe's former colleagues who have filed claims against Merrill, which are pending.
"Hard-working Rubbermaid retirees like Ed trusted Merrill Lynch to invest their retirement savings responsibly," Mr. Zamansky said. "Instead, the firm betrayed that trust and wiped out their savings in about a year."
Mark Herr, a Merrill spokesman, said: "It would be a mistake to assume that because the number of claims has gone up, that industrywide the amount of wrongdoing has gone up. What plainly is at work here is a prolonged bear market. And you also see a number of investors who were heretofore not experienced in the market and are experiencing their first downturn and casting about for a cause."
For more than 32 years, Mr. Wolfe worked for Rubbermaid, doing everything from driving a truck and working on the company's assembly line to mowing its yard. But in early 2000, when the company offered retirement packages to him and other workers, Mr. Wolfe signed up. In each of his years at Rubbermaid, Mr. Wolfe had never made more than $50,000, but with company contributions he had managed to amass a 401(k) worth $325,000. 
In his final days at Rubbermaid, Mr. Wolfe said, he had heard other workers talking about a seminar they had attended for new retirees that was sponsored by Merrill Lynch. Mr. Wolfe and his wife made an appointment to talk about their finances with a Merrill representative at the firm's office in a strip mall in town. After an hour with Mr. Cessna, the branch manager at the two-man Wooster office, they decided to switch their account from Fidelity, where it had been placed in a conservative bond fund.
"He convinced us that we could have apretty safe investment with an 8 percent return on our money," Mr. Wolfe recalled. "We wanted no risk. I told him, 'No gambling with my money.' "
Despite that instruction, he said, Mr. Cessna immediately put him into technology stocks and three tech-stock mutual funds, two of which were concentrated in Internet stocks. One fund that Mr. Cessna recommended, Merrill Lynch Internet Strategies, was the firm's ill-timed attempt to participate in the boom for Internet stocks.
Merrill brokers were pushed hard by their superiors to sell the fund. In March 2000, the very month the stock market reached its pinnacle, the fund took in about $1 billion. The sales push included a half-day series of presentations in San Francisco that were beamed to the computer screens of Merrill's 14,000 brokers across the nation. Among the presenters were Henry Blodget, Merrill's celebrity Internet analyst, and top executives from two technology companies. The firm also flew in Michael Lewis, author of "The New New Thing: A Silicon Valley Story," a book celebrating the new economy, from Paris for the event. 
In just a few weeks, however, investors who had bought the fund when it was offered were down 25 percent on their money. Soon the fund became known as the Internet Tragedy fund; Merrill closed it less than two years later, after it lost almost all its value.
Testifying before the arbitration panel in the Wolfe case, Mr. Cessna explained that he had more than 1,400 clients and that he had routinely recommended the Internet Strategies fund to many of them. Mr. Cessna counted many retirees from local companies among his clients; he had sponsored a series of seminars in town offering retirement guidance to those attending.
In his testimony, Mr. Cessna cited two other Merrill employees. One was David Ruckman, Merrill's district director for the Ohio region. 
The other Merrill employee was Mr. Ruckman's daughter, Nicole Elizabeth Dobbins. She worked for the fund management group that sponsored the Internet Strategies fund and was responsible for having brokers in Ohio sign up their customers for it. Her compensation was based at least in part on how many brokers in the region did so.
Mr. Herr of Merrill said: "We deny that there was any conflict of interest." Merrill maintains that Mr. Wolfe's success in arbitration will not be repeated by other former clients of Mr. Cessna in similar circumstances. "We win the preponderance of our arbitrations," Mr. Herr added.
BONNIE BURNS, 56, was another Rubbermaid retiree who invested with Mr. Cessna. When she accepted the company's early-retirement offer in April 2000, she was a machine operator earning $32,000 a year. She had worked for Rubbermaid for almost 34 years. 
Ms. Burns attended one of Mr. Cessna's seminars along with roughly 30 other Rubbermaid workers. When she met with Mr. Cessna, he discussed the ins and outs of I.R.A.'s but never said what he would invest in. "There was no mention of stocks or how he was going to invest it," Ms. Burns recalled. "He said, 'You worked for that money; now your money is going to work for you.' "
She deposited $357,421 with Merrill in mid-April 2000. When her first brokerage statement came, she saw that Mr. Cessna had bought technology stocks and stock funds, including the Internet Strategies fund. "I didn't question it," she said. 
But with each new statement, Ms. Burns saw that she was losing money. In October, she called Mr. Cessna to ask what was going on. "He would say, 'I know we're in trouble, but don't you worry, the market's going to come back,' " Ms. Burns said.
It did not, of course. She lost $250,000 in stocks like Cisco Systems, JDS Uniphase, Xilinx and Oracle. The final blow came last year when Exodus Communications, a company whose stock she held, filed for bankruptcy. 
Ms. Burns's case against Merrill Lynch is pending. She has gone back to work as a teacher's aid in the Wooster school system. 
"I know about 40 people in this circumstance, and there's more to come," she said. "We're all so embarrassed because we were so stupid to let this happen. Every one of us are back to work; some of us are making $6 an hour because the economy's not good around here. One guy has to work till he's 67 now because he lost everything."

More Advice for Curing Japan's Ills

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

 BODY:
RICHARD KATZ, author of "Japanese Phoenix: The Long Road to Economic Revival" (M. E. Sharpe, $24.95), likens Japan's economy to a driver thrown from a speeding car.
 As the country's policy makers, playing the metaphorical role of paramedics, attend to the driver at the side of the road, they have three choices: repair the broken bones (structural reform), stop the bleeding (the fiscal deficit) or revive the heart (the banks). All three must be done, but in the right order if the patient is to survive. 
 This macroeconomic triage faces Japan as its economy, second only to that of the United States, sinks deeper into a 12-year funk, and Mr. Katz does an admirable job of describing the carnage. His prose is accessible, is well supported by facts and is divided into easily digestible chapters.
He aptly shows how Japan's "lost decade" of the 1990's has its roots in an unwillingness to discard policies more suited to the country's high-growth era of the 1960's, when a fixed foreign exchange rate, high tariffs and collusive regulations shielded companies from competition.
"Japanese Phoenix" is a follow-up to Mr. Katz's "Japan: The System That Soured," (M. E. Sharpe), published in the financial crisis of 1998. Sadly, much of Japan's story is unchanged: more promises to reform, followed by half measures and resistance. Deflation, meanwhile, has deepened and the national debt has exploded. China and South Korea have stolen Japan's momentum.
In this book, however, Mr. Katz has turned optimistic, which in the Japanese context means calling for a recovery in 10 years. While it is refreshing to find someone willing to predict an end to the country's malaise, the prediction is not exactly bold, given the time frame.
The litany of bad news that Mr. Katz throws at the reader also makes one wonder whether 10 years will be enough. His policy prescriptions, too, are as old as Japan's problems: open markets to competition, force banks to write off their nonperforming loans, lower taxes to stimulate consumer spending and push companies to abandon unproductive factories and workers.
None of this is wrong per se, but Japan's economic problems at their root are really political ones, as Mr. Katz points out. The book, though, provides little detail on when that will change. Instead, he says, "Japan will act once the pain of inaction surpasses the pain of action."
"Until then," he adds, "the real danger in Japan is not cataclysm but relentless corrosion."
That's hardly a road map for reform or a cause for optimism.

To the Editor:
As a black American, I would like to respond to "Hiring in Nation Hits Worst Slump in Nearly 20 Years" (front page, Feb. 6). 
 The surge in discouraged workers is going to continue unless America takes back the jobs that are being held by millions of illegal aliens, jobs that we blacks used to have. 
 Instead of asking Congress to pass a 10-year tax cut totaling $670 billion, President Bush should ask Congress to cut legal immigration by 90 percent for 10 years and deport all illegal immigrants. There is no point in creating new jobs if we allow illegal immigrants or future newcomers to take those jobs!

Can Energy Ventures Pick Up Where Tech Left Off?

BYLINE:  By AMY CORTESE 

 BODY:
FOR Andrew Beebe, the light bulb went off almost two years ago at a computer technology conference in the Arizona desert. Mr. Beebe, who had just sold his profitable Internet start-up and was wondering what to do next, picked up a book on harnessing the sun's energy -- or, as he saw it, "how to hack photosynthesis."
 At the time, March 2001, the computer industry was suffering from post-bubble shock and California was being racked by an electricity crisis. The normally zealous attendees at the annual gathering seemed dazed. After reading the book, Mr. Beebe, 31, was convinced that the almost-within-grasp promise of solar-, biomass-, hydrogen- and wind-generated power was "the new new thing." After returning to San Francisco, he became a partner at Clean Edge, a firm in Oakland, Calif., that is a consultant to energy start-ups. 
 Mr. Beebe's former company, BigStep, provided Internet services to small businesses. Now he is one of several former Internet entrepreneurs and professionals who over the last several months have quietly migrated to the emerging field of alternative energy. 
With the threat of war in Iraq refocusing public attention on the United States' dependence on oil from the Middle East, renewable energy is regaining some of the buzz it had when Mr. Beebe was in diapers. It is attracting the attention of entrepreneurs and venture capitalists who not long ago were dreaming of riches on the Internet.
For now, the size of venture funds that are focused solely on energy is relatively small. About $2 billion is available to invest -- as much as in two good-size computer-focused funds. About $488 million of that was actually invested in 2002. That is off from a peak of slightly more than $1.2 billion in 2000 but up significantly from the early 90's, when less than $25 million a year was being invested, says Nth Power, a venture capital firm with a long history of energy investing.
While interest is growing, enthusiasm has been tempered by the fact that renewable energy -- particularly solar energy -- has been the subject of optimistic pronouncements that have not always panned out. And some people who are racing to start alternative-energy companies once extolled the world-changing virtues of the Internet.
As they race to commercialize fuel cells, wind farms and solar panels, are Silicon Valley's whiz kids setting themselves up for another fall, along with investors?
Alternative energy, like the Internet a decade ago, is largely the realm of arcane technology and technologists. The newcomers see an opportunity to apply the formula they honed with the Web: take technology with big market potential and add managerial talent and venture capital. It remains to be seen, of course, whether that will result in the equivalent of Webvan -- the Web-based grocery, a multibillion-dollar Internet-era idea that vainly searched for a market before going out of business -- or in something as wildly successful as eBay.
"The tech refugees are moving in," said Martin Lagod, managing director of Firelake Capital Management, an investment firm that specializes in energy, advanced materials and communications companies. And he says that's a good thing. "They are technically savvy, know how to build companies and access capital," Mr. Lagod said.
Investors who were burned by buying into highflying dot-coms may think otherwise. And alternative energy, unlike the Internet, has a history. High expectations for it were punctured in the early 1980's when oil prices tumbled, making the new technologies uneconomic. With oil prices still relatively low, adjusted for inflation, selling alternatives like solar remains difficult.
"Solar is sexy and everybody loves it, but the fact is it remains too costly" for anything but niche applications, said Stanley R. Bull, director of research and development at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, an Energy Department center in Golden, Colo. "We get concerned about overhyping some of these technologies."
In the 1970's, when solar energy was first commercialized as a source of heat for homes, promoters declared that the sun would also become a mainstream and affordable source of electricity in just a few years. Today, converting sunlight into electricity is still four times as expensive as coal or gas power, though the price has come down to 20 cents to 30 cents a kilowatt-hour from $1 in 1980, and advocates say technological advances will make it competitive with coal within a decade.
More recently, fledgling energy companies that went public in the last few years, like Capstone Turbine and Plug Power, have suffered along with the rest of the market, or more so. Shares of Capstone, which peaked at almost $100, can now be bought for less than $1; Plug Power, which soared to $150 a share during the California crisis in 2001, closed Friday at $5.05.
The outlook is uncertain. Deregulation, which should encourage the use of alternative energy sources, has been set back by the Enron debacle and market manipulation by traders during the California crisis.
"Some of the hopes and expectations about how quickly energy would be liberalized and how fast distributed generation would catch on have been dampened," said Nicholas Parker, a longtime investor in alternative energy and chairman of the Cleantech Venture Network, which brings together so-called clean-technology entrepreneurs and investors.
But advocates of alternative energy say things are different this time.
"Twenty years ago, a lot of the technology just wasn't ready," said Dan W. Reicher, an assistant energy secretary in the Clinton administration. He is now the executive vice president of Northern Power Systems, an energy engineering company, and a partner at New Energy Capital, which invests in alternative energy projects.
Today, he said, energy technology is more reliable and is often backed by giants like General Electric, which bought Enron's wind power business, and BP, which is pursuing several projects in solar energy, windpower and alternative fuels like hydrogen.
Advances in biological and materials sciences could become breakthroughs, advocates of alternative energy say. Most important, they add, the economics of alternative energy are beginning to look compelling.
Wind power, the most developed renewable energy source, generates electricity for around 4 cents a kilowatt-hour, putting it on par with coal. Advances in solar technology, like so-called thin-film materials that are being used in place of rigid silicon disks, may cut costs significantly, people in the industry say.
Biomass technology -- which takes organic materials, waste products or gases trapped in the earth and turns them into fuel -- is already widely used. It is attractive to companies like Cargill Dow -- which has a biomass plant and is a joint venture of Cargill, the agriculture conglomerate, and Dow Chemical -- because it also creates chemicals for plastics, clothes or carpets.
The market potential is certainly large. Electricity alone is the third-largest industry in the United States, worth about $300 billion annually. And of the two billion people in the world who the United Nations estimates are without electric power, some may be candidates for off-the-grid renewable sources of energy.
Governments are helping to drive demand, which could spur innovation. About 30 states encourage renewable energy; New York and California, for example, require that 20 percent or more of their energy supplies come from renewable sources in the next decade and a half. Mr. Reicher said, "It's a convergence of technology, policy and market forces that make clean energy such a terrific investment."
ENTREPRENEURS' and venture capitalists' enthusiasm for alternative energy stems partly from the continuing slump in the computer and telecom industries. "There's nothing much else to look at," said Ivor Frischknecht, a co-founder of Angara Database Systems of Palo Alto, Calif. He is investigating opportunities to invest in clean technology.
Venture capitalists are starting to follow the entrepreneurs into this unfamiliar terrain -- with an estimated $90 billion in venture capital idle, they are looking for places to invest it. Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers, Silicon Valley's top venture fund, is reviewing deals in energy and clean technology. Draper Fisher Jurvetson, another well known venture firm, in October led a $13.5 million investment in Konarka Technologies, a start-up in Lowell, Mass., that is working on less-costly thin-film solar panels.
Many entrepreneurs see in alternative energy that rare and desirable condition -- a disruptive technology that could transform entire industries, from energy to transportation. "This is really the Internet 10 years ago," Mr. Beebe said. "We're on the verge."
Such enthusiasm has been scarce since the bursting of the Internet bubble also deflated entrepreneurs' big dreams. They might be advised to be careful what they wish for.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: HARLEM; 
A Vacant Mart, Symbol of Failure, Is a Candidate for Redevelopment

BYLINE:  By DENNY LEE 

 BODY:
As a symbol of Harlem's long-promised renaissance, Mart 125 has embodied the failure of local black businesses. Now the Bloomberg administration is hoping to give the market a new lease on life. 
 The mart, an indoor space for vendors selling everything from blaxploitation videos to African curios, was built in 1986 as a incubator to get peddlers off the streets and helped toward establishing their own businesses. But the mart, on 125th Street opposite the Apollo Theater, was plagued with problems from the start. Roofs leaked, toilets did not flush and radiators remained cold. 
In 1996, the city took control of the mart from the state, but the conditions worsened. Each side blamed the other. Merchants pointed to the deteriorating structure. City officials accused merchants of not paying their rent. 
 "Everything went haywire when the city took over," said Daniel Perez, a member of Community Board 10, which covers Harlem. "The idea was to help vendors get off the streets." Instead, the city began evicting all 50 merchants in 1998. About six months ago, the last tenant was kicked out, ending a 17-year failed experiment in encouraging small businesses in Harlem. 
 At the urging of the Manhattan borough president, C. Virginia Fields, the city is now hoping to revive the experiment by redeveloping the site with a large restaurant or another anchor tenant. 
 "This is a very prime location that was underused," said Janel Patterson, a spokeswoman for the city's Economic Development Corporation. "Under the request for proposal, there is an option of renovating, adding or demolishing the building." 
 Twenty-one developers have submitted proposals to the city, with a final candidate to be selected as early as this spring. 
 The commercial spine of Harlem has come a long way since it resembled an outdoor flea market. The recent arrival of megachains like Old Navy, H&M and HMV Records have led to higher real estate prices and given 125th Street a new cache. 
 But the increasingly brand-name strip has also left many local entrepreneurs feeling priced out of their own community. 
 "There's nothing unique about 125th Street anymore," said David Wetstone, the owner of Black Star Music and Video and a former mart merchant who has since relocated to Lenox Avenue. "It's just like another strip mall."
 Ms. Fields, along with the community board, wants to ensure that local businesses are not forgotten in the name of progress and says she hopes that former mart merchants can return to the space.
 "It's about hope," Ms. Fields said. "This building should stand for opportunity." DENNY LEE

HEADLINE: S.U.V.'s Under Fire 

 BODY:
The 1990's economic boom, combined with cheap gasoline, turned the sport utility vehicle -- the S.U.V. -- into one of Detroit's most popular and profitable products. Lately, though, S.U.V.'s have been taking their lumps, including sharp criticism from the new head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Jeffrey Runge, one of the first federal officials to speak openly and honestly about rollovers and other hazards associated with a vehicle that the industry insists is essential to its economic survival.
 But most of the criticism remains focused on the vehicles' environmental costs and the huge contribution they make to the nation's growing dependence on imported oil. And properly so: S.U.V.'s produce, on average, 40 percent more carbon dioxide -- the main global warming gas -- than ordinary cars. They are also far less efficient than ordinary cars, averaging as little as 13 miles a gallon in city traffic. 
 It's past time to change all that. Even the Bush administration is getting nervous. A massive loophole in federal law allows S.U.V.'s -- and all other vehicles technically classified as light trucks, including minivans -- to achieve an average fleetwide standard of 20.7 miles per gallon, compared with the 27.5 miles per gallon required of regular passenger cars. The administration recently proposed a slight increase from 20.7 miles per gallon to 22.2 miles per gallon by 2007.
A bipartisan bill introduced last week in the Senate by Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, and Olympia Snowe, Republican of Maine, would reach much higher -- a 33 percent increase for all light trucks to 27.5 miles per gallon by 2011. That would not only bring S.U.V.'s and minivans into line with the standard for ordinary cars but, when fully effective, would save this country a million barrels of oil a day -- more than a third of what we now import from the Persian Gulf. Technologically, this is easily within Detroit's reach. Indeed, most manufacturers are already planning limited rollouts of gas/electric hybrid cars capable of 40 or more miles per gallon. 
The question is whether it is within Congress's reach. Similar proposals were crushed last year in the House and Senate by the combined weight of the automakers and the unions. The White House, fearing both, did nothing to help the cause. Perhaps this time it will: oil dependency is no less an issue, and the S.U.V. problem seems to have registered, however faintly, on the White House radar. 
But the bill will not succeed without the vigorous intervention of President Bush himself, who at the moment seems enraptured by the hydrogen car. Unfortunately, the hydrogen car and the vast infrastructure needed to fuel it are at best 20 years away, probably a lot longer, whereas the problems we face now -- air pollution, global warming, oil dependency -- require immediate attention. And that means making the cars we have now a lot cleaner and a lot more efficient -- starting with S.U.V.'s.

The Programmed Disintegration of the Golden Era in the Golden State

BYLINE:  By ANDRES MARTINEZ 

DATELINE: SANTA MONICA, Calif. 

 BODY:
John Deasy, the superintendent of one of the state's most affluent school districts, clearly knew the figures, but he couldn't help but look for them on the sheet before him, as if to make sure this hadn't all been an unpleasant dream. The numbers are that dire. California's budget crisis will soon force Mr. Deasy to terminate more than 200 of the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District's 900 employees, including 102 teachers. There will be no more school nurses and no more elementary school music programs. High school classrooms will be crammed with up to 40 students.
 "It's disastrous. This district is going to know times it hasn't known before," Mr. Deasy said last Thursday, as he steeled himself to review the budget cuts at a public school board meeting. "This whole state is going to know times it hasn't known before." 
 Residents along this picturesque coastline on the fringe of Los Angeles may yet prop up their schools through private fund-raising, but there is less hope for poorer districts across the state, not to mention for imperiled investments in everything from transportation to health care. Moreover, California's budget crisis now threatens the state's overall economic recovery. Yet surprisingly, there is little discussion about how the state's coffers can better endure another dot-com-like boom-and-bust cycle in the future.
On Thursday, California state officials were in Manhattan, trying to convince skeptical credit-rating firms that the state is making progress in getting its finances in order. With California's projected $35 billion budget shortfall over the next year and a half, by far the bleakest outlook for any state, Moody's is considering lowering its rating on a par with New York and Louisiana. Wall Street's skepticism is justified. Mired in a partisan stalemate, Sacramento doesn't seem capable of resolving its fiscal mess. Things are so bad you almost expect the International Monetary Fund to get involved.
California's political leadership is in a state of denial. Republican legislators blindly oppose any tax increase, while some of Gov. Gray Davis's fellow Democrats jostle with him about the extent of the spending cuts needed. Mr. Davis has proposed a tough $24.4 billion package of spending cuts and tax increases. The governor would impose two new double-digit marginal income-tax rates for the wealthiest taxpayers (who would forward a portion of their federal tax cut on to Sacramento) and increase the sales tax by a cent. But he is threatening to veto a plan by Democrats to restore vehicle registration fees to their 1998 level (when they were slashed by two-thirds). 
The governor feels this strategy will help him gain the support of some Republicans for his overall package. That seems unlikely, given the increasingly entrenched positions on either side of tax issues, according to Lenny Goldberg, the executive director of the California Tax Reform Association. Along with term limits, the latest reapportionment of legislative districts, which cut down on the number of competitive seats that might favor moderate candidates, has furthered this division. It is a trend also discernible in Washington. In California, Mr. Goldberg says, "the voters will ultimately have to help us break the present stalemate."
That would be fitting, since Californians helped to get their state into this fix. Since the 1978 triumph of Proposition 13, which signaled the rise of a grass-roots antitax movement that helped send Ronald Reagan to the White House, populist initiatives have been an impediment to sound, long-term policy making in the state. By freezing local property taxes and imposing an onerous requirement that any other new tax be approved by a two-thirds' majority of lawmakers, Proposition 13 has starved California of needed investment capital. It also gave large commercial properties an unintended tax advantage that needs to be addressed, and it forever muddled questions of local versus state responsibilities. Subsequent initiatives earmarking revenues or approving new programs without any regard to their cost have further curtailed the government's discretion.
Popular sovereignty has become so much a part of California's political DNA, according to Bruce Cain, the director of the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, that there is little use in trying to abolish the initiative process or to limit "ballot-box budgeting." (He used to try.) Voters will have to amend their past mistakes, for example, by passing initiatives to lift the two-thirds' legislative majority required for new taxes.
In the meantime, California remains heavily dependent on state income taxes. The Legislature seems almost nonchalant about the loss of all the taxable capital gains once generated by Silicon Valley. The late 1990's bull market and the large concentration of option-rich high-tech workers in California lifted state personal income tax receipts from $28 billion in 1997-1998 to $45 billion in 2000-2001. They fell back to $34 billion in 2001-2002. Personal income tax receipts now account for roughly half the state's general fund revenues, compared with only 18 percent in 1962-1963.
The sudden falloff is driving today's crisis. "It feels like we're funding education out of some giant hedge fund in Sacramento," Mr. Deasy said.
California treatedthese windfalls as ordinary revenue that could pay for an infinite number of new programs. The politicians in Sacramento were not alone in their irrational exuberance. As Professor Cain noted ruefully, many of his students left Berkeley before collecting a degree in hopes of cashing in on the dot-com boom. Many of them are now unemployed.

HEADLINE: Some Unexpectedly Sunny State Economies 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

 BODY:
RISING costs for education, Medicaid and domestic security are deepening a fiscal crisis many states were already facing, according to a survey by the National Conference of State Legislatures. For the next budget year, which begins in June for most states, the aggregate shortfall could exceed $68 billion, the highest level since World War II and almost three times greater than projections for the current fiscal year. 
 But three states not known as major economic forces -- New Mexico, Wyoming and Arkansas -- have avoided deficits, making them the only states projecting balanced budgets for this year and next. 
 For Wyoming and New Mexico, the poorest state in the country by some measures, fiscal calm evolves from dumb luck and smart management. Both have vast supplies of gas, oil and other natural resources that produce a steady flow of tax revenues even when times are bad. 
In addition to their usual revenue streams of sales and income taxes, both states have created special reserve funds for the resource taxes, using the interest on the principal to shore up holes in the general budget and saving the principal for emergency use. The reserve fund in New Mexico is now $4 billion after contributing about 10 percent of the state's $4 billion budget. Wyoming's fund has about $2 billion and contributes about $100 million a year to the state's budget.
Arkansas's balanced budget is mandated by a state law passed in the 1940's that requires the Legislature to spend no more than it takes in. It also means that when economic forecasts change, so do the budgets of state agencies, and that happens several times a year, said Mike Stormes, administrator of the state's budget office.

War Fear Sends the Market Lower, Again

BYLINE:  By JEFF SOMMER 

 BODY:
With investors preoccupied by the possibility of war with Iraq and of renewed terrorism, the three main stock market gauges declined for the fourth consecutive week.
 The Bush administration put the nation on a "high" terrorism alert for only the second time since Sept. 11, dampening investors' appetite for stocks. 
 An unexpectedly robust economic report on Friday briefly sent the market higher. But, despite a decline in the unemployment rate in January to 5.7 percent from 6 percent, stocks resumed their fall. 
 AT&T, down 11.7 percent for the week, was the biggest loser among the 30 stocks of the Dow Jones industrial average. 
 El Paso, the nation's largest pipeline company, fell 41.7 percent for the week, the worst decline in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. The company said it was cutting its dividend 82 percent, trimming capital spending and selling assets.
 For the week, the Dow fell 189.58 points, or 2.4 percent, closing at 7,864.23. The S.& P. 500 lost 26.01 points, or 3 percent, closing at 829.69, and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 38.44 points or 2.9 percent, closing at 1,282.47. JEFF SOMMER

Inviting a Critic Into the Tent

BYLINE:  By Patrick McGeehan (COMPILED BY MARK A. STEIN) 

 BODY:
Before he left Congress last year, John J. LaFalce, as the ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, sought to curb so-called predatory lending by companies that make loans to people with weak credit ratings. His efforts were opposed, successfully, by many financial institutions, including Household International. 
 Last week, Household appointed its old nemesis, Mr. LaFalce, to a board that it created almost two years ago to advise it on, among other things, how to respond to accusations that it was preying on low-income borrowers by charging hefty fees and high interest rates they could not afford. 
 Mr. LaFalce said consumers should not fret that they have lost an ally. "I view myself as representing the consumer and giving advice on behalf of the consumer," he said. Patrick McGeehan

Sluggish Money Market Funds

BYLINE:  Compiled by Jeff Sommer 

 BODY:
With yields of money market funds at record lows, assets in the funds grew in January at the slowest rate in six years, according to iMoneyNet Inc. of Westborough, Mass., which tracks the industry. 
 For the month, total assets of money market funds grew by less than $10 billion, to $2.24 trillion. 
 For the week ended on Tuesday, the average yield on taxable money market accounts remained at an all-time low, 0.81 percent. Yields have lagged behind the short-term money market rates largely determined by the Federal Reserve, which cut its key interest rate by 0.5 percent in November. The federal funds rate, for interest on overnight loans between banks, is now 1.25 percent.

HEADLINE: Sexy It's Not, but Big Science Thrives on Earth 

BYLINE:  By GEORGE JOHNSON 

 BODY:
AMONG the science projects pursued by the crew of the space shuttle Columbia -- the dynamics of sand and soil under pressure or the effect of dust storms on global warming -- was one that in retrospect seems terribly poignant: an inquiry into the nature of fire and the best way to suppress it in space.
 Unlike many recent shuttle flights, this one was promoted as a research mission, its primary purpose not routine servicing of the International Space Station but the expansion of human knowledge. 
 "We are that part of creation which seeks to understand all creation," President Bush said at the astronauts' funeral last week. But if the words were true symbolically, they seemed less so in substance. Whatever these explorers died for, it didn't have much to do with science. 
Basic research, without obviously profitable applications, has always been a hard sell. Several decades ago when the physicist Robert R. Wilson was soliciting money for a high-energy particle accelerator at Fermilab, he was asked at a Senate hearing how the project would contribute to national defense. "It has nothing to do with defending our country," Wilson famously conceded, "except to make it worth defending."
What he promised has turned out to be true a millionfold, as Fermilab and other accelerators explore the tiniest pieces of matter and even probe the possibilities of extra dimensions and creating miniature black holes.
Don't ask about practical spinoffs (though you can be sure that laboratory lobbyists could come up with a few). Like the Hubble Space Telescope and the automated space probes sent beyond the solar system, the real value comes not from any new consumer products or military technologies. The projects are priceless because they are opening up deeper layers of human understanding.
But the space shuttle? Most Americans, even scientists, were barely aware Columbia was up there until it fell. The space program had long ago become boring.
Since the end of the moon landings, the agency has been saddled with a problem that the visionaries of the 1960's -- Robert A. Heinlein, Arthur C. Clarke, Isaac Asimov -- would never have imagined: the need to make manned space flight seem interesting.
It is a curious turn of the tables. The modus operandi for most big science projects is to play down the sheer fascination of intellectual investigation and emphasize supposed economic benefits. Supporters of the ill-fated Superconducting Supercollider, a would-be successor to Fermilab, tried to convince budget-minded lawmakers that the program offered all kinds of commercial byproducts -- bigger, more powerful magnets, advances in tunnel digging. But what the physicists were really after were things that can only be described mathematically, phenomena like supersymmetric particles and Higgs bosons.
With the space shuttle, the economic benefits are clear enough, at least to the aerospace industry. Just the day before the explosion, NASA put the finishing touches on a two-year, $2.9 billion contract with United Space Alliance of Houston, jointly owned by Boeing and Lockheed Martin. (Last week company employees turned their attention to a new project, gathering and analyzing shuttle debris.) Even the pressurized scientific laboratory carried in Columbia's payload bay was leased to NASA by a private contractor, Spacehab Inc. (Its motto: "We mean business in space.")
When it comes to manned space flight, the scientific claims have long had the ring of phoniness. With recent shuttle missions devoted to building and supplying the space station (and the space station to giving the shuttle something to do), the doomed Columbia mission seemed like a half-hearted gesture to the scientific community, more NASA public relations. After knocking off a couple of weeks of minor experiments, including shepherding high school science projects (more good P.R.), the program was to revert to business as usual.
It's not that the research done on board was unimportant. But most of it, except maybe the effects of space travel on humans, could have been carried out on unmanned craft or here on earth. Sadly, the most significant science to come out of Columbia's last mission may be a final theory of why it crashed.
Every time the shuttle goes up and safely returns it costs a few hundred million dollars. For about the same price, the Japanese recently completed their Earth Simulator, a gargantuan computing complex almost five times more powerful than the fastest supercomputer in the United States. The unprecedented fineness of its simulations could result in a better understanding of meteorological phenomena, and of global warming and other climatic change. What could be more exciting than that?
IMAGINE the possibilities of five of these machines, each working away at different problems -- solving mathematical mysteries that have languished for centuries, scouring cosmic signals for signs of messages from other worlds, simulating living tissues or even the human brain. Or we could have five more round trips to the space station.
The United States is already rushing to catch up with the Japanese race into cyberspace. A new supercomputing complex planned for Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California will have two machines each faster than the Earth Simulator. But the center will be only partly devoted to science's most profound problems. Its primary purpose will be as practical as can be: simulating nuclear explosions.

Not All Executives' Perks Are Rising

BYLINE:  By JULIA MEURLING 

 BODY:
Even as salaries for top executives have increased in the last few years, some types of benefits have faded away, at least at small and midsize companies.
A survey by Sibson Consulting, human resources consultants, found that these companies generally reduced benefits for senior executives from 1998 to 2002. 
Among the perks that were cut were low-cost mortgages, company cars and country-club memberships.
 As companies have cut back, management and executive-level job seekers over all are demanding fewer luxuries, though they still want career development. Lee Hecht Harrison, a career services concern, found in a poll of job-seeking clients that 8 percent expect company cars in 2003, down from 13 percent in 1999. Still, 51 percent expect help with job placement, up slightly from 49 percent in 1999. JULIA MEURLING

German Demonstrators Oppose War, Not U.S.

BYLINE:  By RICHARD BERNSTEIN 

DATELINE: MUNICH, Feb. 8 

 BODY:
Christine Bauer stood in a snowfall near the stately Odeonsplatz around noon today, and while a local band pounded out American-style rock 'n' roll, she worried that German opposition to a war in Iraq had been misinterpreted in the United States.
 "For us, it's very important that being here doesn't mean that we don't like America," she said, near the end of one of several antiwar demonstrations in Munich timed to coincide with Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld's appearance at the Munich Security Conference, which was being held in a nearby hotel. 
 "We know what America did for us," Ms. Bauer said. "But in a democratic world, people should be able to give their opinions." 
Around her, people wearing blue buttons saying "No to War in Iraq" and displaying placards like "War is Terror," "Stop Bush," and "Donald Dr. Strangelove" listened to the noisy rock band. Nearby there wasa small group of young men with Mohawk haircuts and a large amount of body piercing.
Despite the snow and icy streets, several thousand demonstrators turned out in Munich today, watched over by a security force of 3,500 police officers. While the number of demonstrators in Odeonsplatz had fallen to a few hundred by late afternoon, there was no question about the strength of antiwar sentiment in Munich, as elsewhere in Germany. 
"Peace, not war, Mr. Rumsfeld," was the large English headline in the local evening newspaper, the Muchen Abendzeitung, on Friday, when the secretary of defense arrived. The newspaper then listed all of the antiwar activities in the city, including a midnight vigil at a Protestant church Friday night and a concert this evening. 
On the street, among the people bundled up in the snow, mingling with the antiwar sentiment was concern that German relations with the United States not be spoiled.
"We aren't anti-American," Munich's mayor, Christian Ude, said in a speech welcoming the delegates to the security conference Friday night. "We are against the war." 
Mr. Ude's well-known opposition to the war prompted the American ambassador to Berlin, Daniel R. Coates, to call on American participants not to attend the reception where the mayor made his welcoming speech. But most of the Americans, including Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Connecticut Democrat who has already announced his intention to run for president next year, did attend.
In general, the mood outside the conference center mirrored many viewpoints expressed inside, most notably by the German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer. In a vehement if rambling speech seemingly directed at Mr. Rumsfeld, Mr. Fischer practically shouted, in English at one point, "Excuse me, I'm not convinced."
Many people here were saying that the prospect of war against Iraq had brought out something different and bigger than the usual antiglobalization demonstrators who had turned up in recent years at similar international gatherings.
"This time it's a lot of ordinary people, not just the pacifists," said Christian Stubs, an engineer. "It's the first time in my lifetime that I see the Germans are really worried about a war." 
The Iraq question comes along at a time when many Germans are worried about other thing -- most notably an 11 percent unemployment rate that has led to a plunge in the popularity of Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, who won national elections last fall in part because of his antiwar theme. 
"Nobody knows how to handle it," said Michael Kruger, the director of a Munich publishing company, speaking of the pessimism in Germany. "It's like bad weather.
"And then, in the middle of this situation, along comes Rumsfeld who says that we don't want to fight for our freedom, we only want to stay in our nice warm beds. And people are very offended.
"There must be a very good reason to go to war," he continued. "And up to now, I don't think a very good reason has been given."
Demonstrators in the snow today, asked what should be done about Iraq and Saddam Hussein, generally said more time should be given to the United Nations inspections, to diplomacy, and only then, after several months, military force might be justified.
But even then, there was skepticism about at least one of the reasons given by the Bush administration for attacking Iraq, that it has links to Al Qaeda. 
"A war will not solve this problem," Ms. Bauer said, speaking of suicide terrorism. "Because anybody can wrap a bomb around themselves and blow themselves up to kill people. It's like Joschka Fischer said, you won't have wars like in the 19th century anymore, wars of armies against armies. That time is gone."
"We haven't forgotten September 11," she said, "I feel really threatened by the situation in the world, and if the Americans think we are not with them, that's very bad."

HEADLINE: Energy Consumers Playing the Field? Oh, Behave! 

BYLINE:  By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
The original idea of energy deregulation in New York sounds like something Austin Powers might have thought up. Consumers, so the theory went, would be divorced from their old ball-and-chain utility companies, and the electricity marketplace would become a kind of giant dating game, full of come-ons and casual liaisons: no long-term commitments, no guilt.
 Utilities like Con Ed, which had been boring -- if dependable -- partners under the old regulated regime would become spontaneous and exciting, surfing for the best wholesale prices to pass on to their customers. Customers would move fast, too, and be able to dump their old energy providers in a heartbeat if a sexier, cheaper deal walked in the door. 
 But the divorce, as it turned out, was not final. Most residents and small businesses did not get wooed by anyone, so they missed out on the electricity singles scene. Now, more and more economists, environmentalists and consumer advocates are saying that uninhibited consumer choice, at least as it was envisioned in the mid-1990's under the state's deregulation plan, is unlikely to arrive at all. 
"If consumer choice isn't dead, it's certainly in emergency care," said Fred Zalcman, executive director of the Pace Law School Energy Project, an advocacy group that works for renewable energy and conservation. "In the current vein, it seems inevitable that the system will fail."
The reasons for that growing conviction are far-flung, and some might seem entirely unrelated to the question of self-determination. In December, for example, Con Ed said that because investors were not building new power plants in New York City, the company would offer a 10-year commitment to buy 500 megawatts of electricity if a builder would come. And last month, Gov. George E. Pataki said that in the next decade New York would sharply raise the mixture of renewable energy, from things like solar and wind generation, required in the state's power portfolio. 
Both steps are likely to nudge utilities toward more long-term energy-buying contracts, and that, economists say, implies a word that can chill the spine of any free-market swinger: commitment.
Because more payments to buy electricity are locked in, utilities, the argument goes, will need more customers locked in on the other side to balance the risks. They will need to know that there will be takers for the energy they will be committed to buy.
Other experts say the very failure of deregulation to separate utilities and consumers is beginning to create its own consequences. When free choice only seemed delayed, they say, problems like price volatility that can make monthly electricity prices surge on hot summer days could be explained away as evidence of a bumpy transition. 
But with every year that residential and small-business customers really have nowhere to turn -- and nothing to suggest anything different on the horizon -- a passing phase is coming to look like a permanent condition.
And a permanent condition, some consumer advocates argue, creates an obligation by the state to wade back in to reregulate or otherwise modify the system to protect small customers from a relationship they cannot escape, in the same way that the police would shield a battered spouse.
What completes the circle is that many of the very measures proposed to address the problems of stalled choice would also most likely make the bonds between utility and customer unalterably permanent. 
Putting a ceiling on utility bills, for example, might help some people in Con Ed's territory on hot summer days (some upstate utilities already have temporary caps), but artificially low rates would also probably mean that no one could ever compete for those customers. The utility would have them, till death do they part. 
"I think there's been a realization that we lost some of the good aspects of the old system, so let's try to bring them back so there's more certainty and reliability," said Anne Reynolds, the air and energy project director at Environmental Advocates, an Albany-based conservation group that favors tinkering to protect consumers and the environment. "The challenge is what to bring back and how to mesh it with the new."
Retail consumer choice still remains the official goal of the state's electricity policy. A spokesman for the State Public Service Commission, which oversees the state's energy system, said more long-term contracts in a utility's portfolio were a natural and expected sign of a maturing market, and not a threat to choice at all.
"We don't believe, nor do we expect, that supply contracts will inhibit the growth of the competitive market and consumer choice," said the commission's spokesman, Edward Collins.
Con Ed's vice president for energy management, Terry Agriss, also said the company remained committed to consumer choice. Of Con Ed's 3.1 million customers in New York City and its northern suburbs, just over 5 percent -- almost all of them big companies with big electricity needs -- have chosen another vendor.
But increasingly, the question is coming down to semantics and definitions: what does the word "choice" really mean? Consumer behavior experts say that in any open system, many people will choose not to choose. They will do nothing, no matter what. And so the real question, they say, is: how many are able to choose, or, on the other hand, are prevented from choosing by economic or other barriers?
It is the sort of debate that can easily veer toward the philosophical outer limits. Some environmentalists, for example, advocate what might be called "choice where there is no choice."
Customers, they say, should be able to request renewable, or "green," power through their regular utility company, which would then be required to buy and insert that amount of power into its portfolio. The Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation, which serves upstate and western New York, has been offering just that sort of choice.
But offering options like that, environmentalists admit, would also tacitly acknowledge that the partnership between utility and customer was permanent. It would be freedom, but only of a kind.
The Natural Resources Defense Council, a Manhattan-based conservation group, has also argued that Con Ed should be required -- as it would have been under the regulated system -- to figure out whether its 500-megawatt proposal to buy energy is more or less cost-effective than an option to reduce demand by 500 megawatts through investments in energy conservation.
But investing in energy conservation technologies, just like the company's proposed 10-year purchase plan, would also be a long-term commitment, the group's energy experts say. And so in many ways the implications for locked-in consumers would be the same, whatever the differences might be for the environment or air quality. 
"I think we should try to allow as much choice as we can," said David R. Wooley, a spokesman for the American Wind Energy Association, which advocates a green choice within the utility monopoly. "Because we didn't have the meltdown that California did, we have the opportunity to make some midcourse corrections to take advantage of the positive things that have happened and avoid the risks that small customers currently face."
Others say the issue is not choice, but clout. If people cannot really get away, incentives should be created to give them more control of their fate through technology.
Sophisticated meters and switches are available that can give buyers great discretion about when they use electricity, and that can save them a lot of money because electricity costs a lot less at night, for example, than during the peak daylight hours, when everyone wants it.
"Competition has its place even if doesn't take a huge share of the market," said Lee S. Friedman, a professor of public policy at the University of California. "If it continues to prod the utilities to continue to bring technology to the market in a good way, that's a positive."
If a utility modifies its behavior and improves its service to keep customers that it might lose, has choice failed, or succeeded? That's the question, Professor Friedman said, adding, "If the system has gotten better, isn't that the goal?"

HEADLINE: In Towns That Slowed Growth, Backlash Stirs 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: ERIE, Colo., Feb. 5 

 BODY:
As a bruising recall campaign ended here this week, Mayor Barbara Connors was still in office and her policies to slow the growth of this old mining town northwest of Denver were intact.
 Yet the battle to save her political life and beat back overdevelopment was only the latest of a small but growing number of conflicts around the country over so-called slow-growth policies. Such policies were all the rage in recent decades, when rampant growth was viewed as a bad thing, but their supporters are not having an easy time of it in the current economic downturn. 
 In December, departing members of the Habersham County Commission in Clarksville, Ga., upset that their successors favored slow-growth policies, passed a motion to eliminate the county planning commission, land-use plans and the building inspection program. A judge later reinstated them. 
This week in Loudoun County, Va., a burgeoning Washington suburb, more than 150 lawsuits were filed against the county by people who oppose its growth-control policies.
In Colorado, where the economy has sagged for two years, several small towns eager to spur development and increase the local tax base are turning away from growth restrictions. It is a fundamental shift from the booming 1990's, when job growth, housing prices and incomes soared and towns began putting limits on growth to preserve the quality of life that was attracting so many new residents.
In the last few years, voters in at least three towns have rejected proposals to limit growth. The next big fight is coming in Berthoud, an agricultural town of 4,800 about 45 miles north of Denver, where local officials are reviewing a petition to remove a 5 percent growth cap that voters have approved three times in the last three years. The town board may adopt the proposed change or let voters decide in a special election.
Stuart Meck, senior research fellow for the American Planning Association, a group of city planners and officials, said the pro-growth forces had not yet sparked a national trend. But challenging slow-growth plans, he said, is not always a bad idea.
"As economies change, systems need to be evaluated," he said. "You can't assume metropolitan economies are static. The reason to enact something when the economy is at Point A may not hold up over the long term."
Environmentalists say that lowering the obstacles to scattershot development could easily produce ugly sprawl, cookie-cutter subdivisions and environmental degradation.
"This is very shortsighted," said Elise Jones, executive director of the Colorado Environmental Council, a nonprofit coalition of 85 conservation groups. "In Colorado, the job market follows workers, and long-term economic vitality is tied to the protection of our quality of life. When you lose things that draw people to Colorado, you lose your economy."
In some places, that notion has been a difficult sell. Sam Mamet, associate director of the Colorado Municipal League, said the sluggish economy, combined with a persistent drought, was creating difficult choices for many towns. While some are acting, he said, others are waiting it out. "It's a mixed bag," he said, "but an increasing number of communities are looking at how they can expand their local economics and relax previously adopted policies."
The effort in Berthoud, where the population has doubled since 1980, illustrates the problem's complexities. Jeff Hindman, a homebuilder from Boulder who is leading the campaign for change, said Berthoud's fiscal problems almost demand a new approach to development.
In 2000, the town issued a record 104 building permits. Late that year, voters approved the annual cap on new permits to 5 percent of the number of existing homes. Mr. Hindman said that the cap created uncertainty for builders, making it harder to secure financing for new projects.
As a result, the town issued just 21 housing permits in 2001 and 8 in 2002. Not surprisingly, tax revenues from the permits fell, forcing town officials to cut the budget each of the last two years and impose a $38 surcharge on water bills to help pay for a new treatment plant.
Karen Stockley, a Sierra Club member who led the campaign for the cap, said removing it would destroy Berthoud's rural ambience and put added strains on local services. Already, she said, the new water treatment plant will be operating at capacity within two years.
"Berthoud is very much a small town; that's the attraction, that's why a lot of people have moved here," she said, adding that builders were "twisting the truth" when they talk about uncertain financing, pointing out that builders did not even apply for the permits that were available. "Not a single developer was denied a permit," she said.
Similar issues were debated in the effort to recall Ms. Connors in Erie, a rural town of 8,500 about 20 miles south of Berthoud. A campaign financed by developers sought to remove her and another town official, charging that they "abandoned Erie's efforts to secure economic development," as the recall ballots read. In the voting on Tuesday, Ms. Connors survived by a 1,065-to-874 vote and her colleague, Paul Carter, by 1,057 to 866.
Ms. Connors, a former teacher and school administrator from Manhattan, said her policies made sense for a town of Erie's size, which is straining town services. She echoed complaints in Berthoud that developers were more interested in outlying residential projects than commercial projects in town that would add more to the town tax base.
"We've been growing too much, too fast," she said. "I'm particularly concerned about pressures on our infrastructure. Citizens here want to run the town for their own benefit, not developers'."

An examination of the shuttle's history since the Challenger disaster shows that despite improvements, NASA's pursuit of a safer shuttle has largely stalled. It is a story of seesawing budgets, political infighting and radical policy shifts, all carried out against a backdrop of falling interest in space exploration. 1

The board named to investigate the space shuttle disaster will employ independent laboratories and outside experts to review the major technical work performed by NASA and its contractors, one of its members said. 1

HEADLINE: OUTDOORS; 
Desperately Seeking Salmon

BYLINE:  By Pete Bodo 

 BODY:
We had left the high desert of Oregon's Deschutes River country to the northeast, and come under the shadow of the Cascades. But as my wife, Lisa, and I followed a path across the buff-colored earth, through a meadow of sparse sedge and cheatgrass, the air still felt thin, dry and clear. 
 Warmed by the morning sun, the air was a delicate medium transmitting scent: a fire, somewhere distant, and the cold water of the Metolius River, streaming a hundred yards away through ponderosa pines and lissome willows. I clutched the cork grip of my fly rod, fighting the urge to sprint ahead. 
 As recently as the 1960's, the Metolius still had prolific runs of chinook (king) salmon. It also once featured one of Oregon's only two runs of sockeye salmon. The river is now the domain of native redband trout (a subspecies of rainbow trout) and the hardy but acutely vulnerable bull trout, which needs unusually cold water (55 degrees or less) to survive. But the salmon have vanished on the wind, like the smoke from a campfire.
Lisa reached the bank first, and stopped. For a while, we just stood, entranced. The Metolius had full banks and a robust flow of water that reminded me of thick, flawed antique glass. 
Born from giant underground springs, the river is surrounded by absorbent ground that collects, stores, filters and metes out frigid water at a constant rate, year-round. The riverbed is paved with colored stones and boulders, among which lay dark, indolent, bull trout. Insects hovered just above the water.
However, something wasn't right. In similar rivers all over the world, large numbers of trout or juvenile salmon might be found feeding all day under such ideal circumstances. But we saw only sporadic rises, and few caddis or mayflies. Something was missing. 
"We want to do this restoration project because we feel there's a vital piece missing from the puzzle, and it would be great to put that back in," said Brad Nye, the conservation project director for the Deschutes Basin Land Trust, a private charitable corporation. The trust has an option to purchase the ecologically diverse 1,240-acre Lake Creek tract, which includes the most productive salmon spawning habitat on the Metolius system. 
Imagine the sight of salmon pouring into this river and its tributaries. 
Of course, the entire Columbia basin, which is to say the entire Pacific Northwest, is an ecological puzzle characterized by scores of missing pieces. Once, five distinct species of salmon (including chinook, sockeye, coho, steelhead and chum) flooded into the mighty Columbia like stampeding buffalo and dispersed in tributaries like the Deschutes. 
Today, the depleted ranks of those fish are unwitting players in what may become the most breathtaking extinction event we have ever witnessed: the extermination of a resource that helped develop, drive, develop and define the economy and culture of a region that represents about an eighth of the contiguous United States. 
This may happen despite the relief offered by legal measures (including the Endangered Species Act), and a growing public awareness of the multilayered value of the fish.
But stubborn, remnant populations of salmon, like those inhabiting the lower Deschutes, still cling to their ecological niches. And others, with our help, may reclaim some. 
The irony in this whole history, says Nye, is that Metolius salmon weren't wiped out because they couldn't get up over dams (the Pelton and Round Butte dams on the upper Deschutes went online in the late 1950's). The fish were lost because the smolts (outgoing juveniles) couldn't get down around them. 
Although Pelton had a fish ladder and Round Butte boasted a tramway to ensure safe upstream passage, the fate of the indigenous Metolius salmon was sealed by the failure of a screening system intended to shepherd the tiny, oceanbound juveniles safely around the 400-foot-tall Round Butte dam. 
The failure occurred because the thermal properties of the three rivers that meet to form the Deschutes just above Round Butte (the Little Deschutes, the Crooked River and the Metolius) created conflicting currents that led the little travelers away from the dam and into an eddy -- a virtual dead end.
Now, though, the dams are up for relicensing, and the groups who jointly operate them (Portland General Electric and the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon, which owns a great deal of land along the Metolius and Deschutes) are committed to addressing that problem. They plan to add a costly (up to $30 million) -- and as yet unproven -- concrete intake tower, that would alter the flow profile above the dam in order to attract fish for safe downstream passage.
If the engineering solution works, and the Deschutes land trust can raise the $3 million it needs by late July to purchase the Lake Creek parcel from a friendly seller, Willamette Industries, the wind might shift and the smoke might blow back toward us, bringing salmon to the Metolius again. 
To aid in the conservation efforts, the outdoor retailer Orvis has pledged to match dollar donations to the land trust three to one. Details can be obtained by calling (802) 362-8794 or by visiting www.orvis.com on the Web.

HEADLINE: A Clarion Call, a Warning Siren 

BYLINE:  By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
MARY ALFANO has been going to Long Island Rail Road stations since November to pass out literature opposing war on Iraq. The morning commuters rushing past, she said, have been getting friendlier as the time for war draws near. 
 "People pat you on the back and say, 'Good work lady, somebody has to do it,"' said Ms. Alfano, 74, of Bohemia, who stood with a small group of generally middle-aged to elderly people at the Ronkonkoma station on a recent weekday morning, handing out leaflets. 
 She carried a sign that said, "Peace Is Patriotic." The leaflets asked, "Are you safer now than you were a year ago?" 
Most of the commuters boarding trains bound for the empire city of a nation poised for a pre-emptive strike against Iraq accepted or politely declined the leaflets, and the question was left hanging.
But a few stopped to debate. "I watched the Twin Towers fall down, and these people did not," said Greg Merkle, 43, a computer service support manager from Manorville catching the 7:04 to Manhattan. "Whether or not Iraq was in on 9/11, they are part of the axis of evil, like the president says." 
No polls have focused on Long Islanders' opinions on the war. But it is clear that local sentiment runs the gamut from emphatic opposition to a war against Iraq to enthusiastic support of President Bush's invasion threats, bookending a broad middle of highly nuanced views. 
The Island's college campuses are hardly hotbeds of dissent or support, though some faculty members opposed to the war said that might be changing. "My sense is that there has been a massive shift against the war in the last month," said Martin Melkonian, a professor of economics at Hofstra University and a peace activist. But he conceded that only a small minority was active.
Others said support for the Bush administration's policy was not only predominant but also presumptive. "No sane person wants war, but I believe a solid majority will support the president if he believes war is necessary," said Representative Peter T. King, a Republican from Seaford. "When I talk to people in the deli or in a diner, that's what they tell me."
While generalizations are risky, the most active opponents of the war tended to be older than 50 and many were part of the civil rights and peace movements of the 1960's. Others dated their activism to anti-nuclear campaigns of the 1980's. 
Most were part of religious groups such as Pax Christi, a Catholic group that has mounted motorcades to bring to Long Island parishes a statement by Catholic bishops calling the war unjust, or organized peace groups such as the Long Island Alliance for Peaceful Alternatives, a coalition formed in the mid-1980's to support a freeze on nuclear weapons. 
Maurice Brooks of Great Neck, 80, a member of Great Neck SANE/Peace Action, summed up the opponents' view about a pre-emptive strike against Iraq. "It would result in the death of thousands of innocent Iraqi people, risk the lives of American troops, cost billions of dollars needed for health care, housing, the environment and education, violate international law and destabilize the Middle East," said Mr. Brooks, a World War II veteran.
Supporters of Mr. Bush's assertion that Iraq must be disarmed by force if necessary were equally fervent in their support.
"We can't appease this man," said John J. Taft, a Vietnam veteran from North Merrick who lost both legs when he stepped on a mine. "The last time we let someonelike him do what they wanted there was Hitler and World War II," he said.
But if feelings, once solicited, were running high, the public mood seemed civil, subdued and tolerant of differing views. Mr. Merkle, who debated war opponents at the Ronkonkoma railroad station, said he felt no rancor toward them. "They didn't change my mind, and I didn't change theirs," he said. "But we could still have a cup of coffee together at Dunkin' Donuts."
Nina Friedberg, 78, of Patchogue, a retired nurse and teacher and a peace movement veteran, said commuters she had leafleted at several stations were almost unfailing polite.
"I have never been in anything where there is so much positive response," she said. "Bush can say whatever he wants, but these people are wondering, and they are saying wait a minute."
Officials at Long Island colleges say students seem quiescent, if curious and perhaps apprehensive. A scattering of antiwar campus rallies have been held, but there were few posters or signs opposing or supporting war with Iraq, and no tables in commons areas with students handing out literature.
At the State University at Stony Brook, posters on a kiosk near the student union advertised a Feb. 15 antiwar rally in New York City. Inside the student union building, of five students who spoke of their feelings about the war, one had plans to attend the rally. Others were noncommittal or lightly leaning one way or the other. 
Nelson Dovale, 21, a math and philosophy major from Mineola, was concerned about friends in the military who could be placed in harm's way. "I don't know if war is the answer, and I am never for violence," he said. "But we have to do something." 
Daniel Nagler, 20, sociology major from Malverne who sat with Mr. Dovale over lunch on a recent afternoon, wondered about President Bush's assertions that Iraq was hiding weapons of mass destruction that posed a grave threat. "I don't necessarily know where he is coming from," Mr. Nagler said. "He may know there is something there, or he may know that there's not. But you have to accept it unless you want to become a politician."
Neither student had plans to attend the rally in Manhattan, and both said the issue was not a topic among friends or other students they knew. "It really doesn't come up in conversation," Mr. Dovale said.
At another table, Suad Yaghmour-Shapiro, 18, a freshman from Manhattan studying biochemistry, said she would most definitely be going to the Manhattan march. "Iraq is not the only country with destructive weapons, and they haven't really threatened anybody," said Ms. Yaghmour-Shapiro, who said her father was Palestinian and her mother Jewish. 
"Saddam has killed millions of people," interjected Raheel Mahmed, 18, a freshman from Omaha studying psychology, who said his pacifism had given way to a feeling the Iraqi dictator is "not the kind of person you can talk to using diplomacy." 
"I can kind of see why war is the only option now," said Mr. Mahmed, whose parents are Pakistani. 
Nadia Pretto, 19, a health sciences major from Glen Cove, said she saw both sides but leaned against war. "What will we accomplish with a war except we'll have a lot of people against us," she said. "We are just going to hurt ourselves and our economy."
Four students waiting out halftime at a basketball game at Suffolk Community College in Selden said they were ready to serve in the war.
"The peace people say we should wait," said Gary Schor, 20, of Ronkonkoma. "What are we going to do, wait for a million people to die and then retaliate? If there's a draft, I'd go."
"He's a threat to our security," added Thomas Bobka, 20, of Bayport, referring to Mr. Hussein.
"It's us or them," said Christopher Canale, 21, of Ronkonkoma. 
"We have to stop them before they stop us," said Anthony Canale, his twin brother.
The four men said they knew of no campus rallies and had heard little discussion among students and friends about the war they thought was coming. 
At Nassau County Community College in Garden City, Reginald Tuggle, the director of college relations, said there had been one campus rally before the Christmas break where antiwar speakers addressed about 150 students. But except for as few antiwar flyers, the issue had since been in the background, he said.
"I've got to tell you, people are generally not focused on that," Mr. Tuggle said. "Most of them are focused on their own lives, and just trying to get by, day by day."Michael B. DeLuise, a Hofstra spokesman, described students as "nervous, questioning, and looking at where things might be going."
"They were listening to the State of the Union address," he said, referring to President Bush's recent appearance before Congress. "And for I don't know how many years people never listened."
Mr. DeLuise said he was struck by the age of people protesting the war outside the Long Island Association annual meeting and luncheon on Jan. 28, featuring former President George H.W. Bush and his wife, Barbara. "I honestly don't think I saw anybody under 50 in that crowd," Mr. DeLuise said of the protesters.
Sheila Croke, 74, a Pax Christi member from Greenlawn who was at the protest, said the age of the protesters was not surprising because the event was held during school and working hours on a Tuesday.
Ms. Croke spoke of a group of more than 100 high school students who rallied against the war earlier this month at the intersection of Routes 25A and 110. "We have both ends of the spectrum now," she said.
The offices of the Island's congressional delegation said calls and letters were running against the war. "But it's not necessarily who you hear from, it's can you count on it to be a representative opinion?" said Doug Dodson, the chief of staff for Representative Timothy Bishop, a Democrat from Southampton. "You have silent majorities and vocal minorities," he said. 
Mitchell H. Pally, the vice president of government affairs for the Long Island Association, said opinions in the business community were muted. "It's not really something people think about unless they are personally involved, unless they know someone in the reserves," he said. "There seems to be hope that the Iraq issue can be solved diplomatically rather than militarily, but it's not the first thing anybody brings up."
The Rev. Thomas W. Goodhue, the executive director of the Long Island Council of Churches, a Protestant group, said the war was a frequent topic from the pulpit. "It's very much on people's minds, especially when they are preaching, and it has been for a long time," he said. "What I sense among many clergy is that the case has not yet been made that a pre-emptive strike could possibly be a just war."
Some clergymen said they found no support for the war among their parishioners. "Frankly, I don't known anyone at First Parish Church who favors war with Iraq," said the Rev. Robert Palin, the pastor of the United Church of Christ congregation in Riverhead. "In fact, all are adamantly opposed."
In Massapequa, Timothy J. Gang, whose stepson Timothy Nolan, 18, is a new marine, said he was proud of his stepson but also apprehensive. "Nobody wants a family member to go to war," said Mr. Gang, a Marine Corps veteran. "But the general opinion among my friends is we just want to get this over with."
"We should have done the job years ago when the father was in office and we had the troops there," he said. 
Others have been called into the military from civilian jobs. "I am enthusiastic about performing my duties, it's what I have been trained to do," said James DuPont of Garden City, a Nassau County police officer activated as a gunnery sergeant in 2nd Battalion, 25th Marines. "If people want to have different points of view, that's their right. Don't hold us responsible for the policies of it. We are just following orders."
The battalion spent 11 months of training at Camp Lejeune, N.C. "Right now we are just standing by," Sergeant DuPont said.

Re "Young, Jobless, Hopeless," by Bob Herbert (column, Feb. 6): 
 As a retired New York City high school teacher, I have known many poor young people who became hopeless, frustrated and defeated because they could find neither a niche nor a job in this society. 
 I was shocked to receive an e-mail message from a former student last week who wrote that he would do anything, "even singing telegrams," if he could find employment. 
Unlike the undereducated young people Mr. Herbert writes about, this young man, born in poverty in Georgia and raised from the age of 13 in Harlem by his father, graduated from Brandeis High School and then the University of Rochester last year. 
He has put himself in debt and struggled against all odds at a university that was neither diverse nor inclusive, and where he was mostly unhappy and isolated, to get the degree that promised entree to the mainstream of society.
He started out as a premed student but by senior year decided he could not incur any more debt and chose to look for a teaching job for the time being. 
Is this the American dream? Shame on us.

 Bob Herbert is right in "Young, Jobless, Hopeless" (column, Feb. 6). 
The Bush administration, while choosing to hide behind the veil of war, has failed to grasp the seriousness of the unjust war it is waging against its own citizens. 
 The decision to eliminate certain work force programs for youth may mean that these young people pose a far greater threat than any external enemy. 
If as a country we are going to grow, our young people must have hope and a drive for the future. Right now those seem to be withering away.

 Perhaps "Young, Jobless, Hopeless," by Bob Herbert (column, Feb. 6), is the material that should be presented to the United Nations on an emergency basis. 
He describes a scenario that has the potential to destroy not only our society, but also that of almost every civilized country. 
 Mr. Herbert writes of teenagers and young adults who have nothing to do. They lack the skills to get themselves involved in occupations that will make them contributing citizens. 
The situation is growing, and no one is doing anything about it.

HEADLINE: Costly Questions Arise on Legal Opinions for Tax Shelters 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Like sellers of treasure maps, promoters of tax shelters promise that for a large fee one can navigate a secret route. What clinches these deals is not the chart itself but a second document that appears to warrant that the map is as good as gold.
 That document is called an opinion letter and it blesses the tax shelter as a legitimate way to reduce taxes. Written by tax lawyers using the embossed stationery of their firms, the letters typically cost $50,000, $75,000 or more, and require a signed promise to keep the contents secret, like the treasure map, lest the Internal Revenue Service discover where untaxed fortunes lie. 
 But as top executives at the Sprint Corporation are discovering, opinion letters may not be worth the paper they are written on. William T. Esrey, the chief executive, and Ronald T. LeMay, the president, bought Ernst & Young tax shelters hoping to escape $114 million in federal income taxes on the exercise of their stock options. The executives paid Ernst & Young, the firm that audits Sprint's books, about $8.7 million for the shelters, according to Ernst's confidential pricing guide, assuming all their 1999 and 2000 stock options went into the shelters.
Neither Sprint nor Ernst & Young would say which law firm wrote the opinion letter for that shelter. But whichever firm it was, the letter may be of little value, because the I.R.S. is moving to disallow the shelter as illegitimate.
If the taxes must be paid now, Mr. Esrey disclosed Wednesday, he may lose his entire fortune because all of his Sprint shares are worth millions less than the taxes he avoided on those shares in the shelter.
What even sophisticated tax shelter buyers often fail toappreciate is that "it's just an opinion, it's not an insurance policy," said David P. Hariton, a partner at Sullivan & Cromwell in New York who does not write such letters. He said promoters try to imbue opinion letters with great significance, even implying that there is some standard for grading the quality of the assurances, but this is not true. 
Larry A. DiMatteo, an associate professor of legal studies at the Warrington College of Business at the University of Florida who has written extensively on opinion letters, said that even financially smart people "treat opinion letters as if they were binding, when under American law they generally have no legal consequence."
Opinion letters often run to 100 pages. The cover page offers comforting assurances, typically saying that even if the I.R.S. finds out about the shelter it is "more likely than not" that taxes will never come due. The rest of these letters are economic and legal analysis heavy with caveats.
The letters can be quite lucrative for law firms, because the same opinion can be sold over and over to buyers of an identical shelter simply by changing the name on the opinion. 
A number of tax lawyers and professors, none of whom draft tax shelter opinion letters, said opinion letters all boiled down to this: A tax shelter works unless the government says it does not.
Lately the I.R.S. has been busy notifying people that their tax shelters do not work, with disastrous results for some of those who relied on the opinion letters. In New York, North Carolina and Florida, a few wealthy Americans are already suing two big accounting firms, Ernst & Young and KPMG, that sold failed tax shelters, as well as the lawyers who wrote the opinion letters. More litigation is expected. The accounting firms say their advice was sound and they and the law firms they worked with will defend the shelters before the I.R.S.
Blair C. Fensterstock, a New York lawyer representing four Indiana men who bought an Ernst & Young tax shelter to avoid taxes on $70 million from selling their business, said the promises in an opinion letter were crucial to resolving doubts and closing the deal to set up the shelter. Yet, he said, the letter itself was not delivered until after the shelter was set up.
Even if his clients had received the letter ahead of time, Mr. Fensterstock said, they would not have understood all the subtle disclaimers in it. 
"Even for people who are sophisticated, it doesn't mean they understand anything about the complexities of tax shelters," Mr. Fensterstock said.
Two decades ago, the Treasury Department tried to rein in the use of opinion letters to sell tax shelters, but under protests from various lawyer organizations it backed down, according to Ann Southworth, a professor of tax law at Case Western Reserve University who wrote a law review article about opinion letters.
The real value of opinion letters is as a shield from government penalties for not paying taxes when they were due. Penalties are usually waived when a taxpayer relied on professional advice that the I.R.S. regards as reasonable and given in good faith.
John P. Freeman, a University of South Carolina law professor, wrote in the Columbia Business Law Review that court rulings "strongly suggest that courts today are willing to go to considerable lengths to protect lawyers" whose opinion letters encourage misconduct. That was in 1989, and Professor Freeman and others said the trend had only grown. 
A leading opponent of tax shelters, Representative Lloyd Doggett, Democrat of Texas, said Congress should pass a law mandating penalties if the opinion letter a taxpayer relied on was written by a lawyer picked by the shelter promoters.
In many recent cases, the opinion letters were written by lawyers the sellers had selected and they barred an independent legal review, according to court papers. Ernst & Young even gave clients a pricing sheet on what the opinion letters would cost.
Mr. Doggett, a former Texas Supreme Court justice, said "the opinion letter is essentially a get-out-of-jail-free card because penalties are waived."
In turn, he said, "that makes tax shelters a no-risk strategy because your chances of getting caught in the audit lottery are low," and if one is caught, all that is due are the taxes plus interest.

SAUDIS PLAN END TO U.S. PRESENCE

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 8 

 BODY:
Saudi Arabia's leaders have made far-reaching decisions to prepare for an era of military disengagement from the United States, to enact what Saudi officials call the first significant democratic reforms at home, and to rein in the conservative clergy that has shared power in the kingdom.
 Senior members of the royal family say the decisions, reached in the last month, are a result of a continuing debate over Saudi Arabia's future and have not yet been publicly announced. But these princes say Crown Prince Abdullah will ask President Bush to withdraw all American armed forces from the kingdom as soon as the campaign to disarm Iraq has concluded. A spokesman for the royal family said he could not comment. 
 Pentagon officials asked about the Saudi decisions said they had not heard of any plan so specific as a complete American withdrawal. Since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, in which 15 of the 19 hijackers involved were Saudis, members of both parties in Congress have urged broad reform in the conservative kingdom. 
Until Abdullah actually issues the decrees, it remains to be seen whether he will be the first son of Saudi Arabia's modern unifier, King Abdul Aziz ibn Saud, to undertake significant political change.
The presence of foreign -- especially American -- forces since the Persian Gulf war of 1991 has been a contentious issue in Saudi Arabia and has spurred the terrorism of Osama bin Laden, the now disowned scion of one of the kingdom's wealthiest families, and his followers in Al Qaeda.
Saudi officials said the departure of American soldiers would set the stage for an announcement that Saudis -- but probably not women, at least initially -- would begin electing representatives to provincial assemblies and then to a national assembly, Saudi officials said.
The goal would be the gradual expansion, over six years, of democratic writ until a fully democratic national assembly emerged, a senior official said.
The debate over the need for reform is described by Saudi royal family members as part of the post-Sept. 11 reckoning to head off foreign and domestic pressures that threaten the royal family and its dominion over the oil-rich Arabian Peninsula.
As the United States prepares for what could be a long military occupation of Iraq, the Saudi royal family does not want to appear as if it was pressured into reform, according to Saudis familiar with the debate. To be seen as acting under American sway might undermine the monarchy's credibility before a population that is increasingly young, unemployed, pious and anti-American.
Still, the departure of all American military forces from Saudi Arabia would be a potentially troubling milestone in the history of the relationship that dates to World War II.
Since the Persian Gulf war, when the United States sent 500,000 troops to the Saudi desert, a security pact has endured to confront and contain Saddam Hussein in Iraq. Thousands of American engineers have built supply depots, air bases and a state-of-the-art air operations headquarters south of Riyadh that were intended to join the two countries in long-lasting military collaboration.
Even if American troops did leave, Saudi and American officials said, security cooperation would probably continue, and they noted that the soldiers could return if the Saudi rulers faced a new threat.
The Saudi reform debate, according to one participant, has taken place in an atmosphere of opposition from senior princes, including Prince Nayef bin Abdul Aziz, the minister of interior, and to a lesser extent, Prince Sultan bin Abdul Aziz, the minister of defense.
Prince Sultan, who family members say has been privately designated as the next crown prince by Abdullah, was described by a family member as "moderately against it or, stating it another way, very reluctantly for it."
One royal family member said that despite opposing views, senior princes "will support the decisions of Prince Abdullah when he makes them" because "the royal family will always stick together, especially in times of crisis."
The reported decisions have enthusiastic support from Saudi Arabia's influential business sector and from the second tier of senior princes in their 50's and 60's who have had the most contact with the West. Among those family members are Prince Saud al-Faisal, the Princeton-educated foreign minister, and Prince Bandar bin Sultan, son of the defense minister and a former F-15 fighter pilot who has been ambassador to the United States since 1983.
For now, a senior prince said, Crown Prince Abdullah, the day-to-day ruler since King Fahd fell ill in 1995, has overcome resistance with the admonition, "Isn't it better if I do this now before I have to do it later?"
The senior prince added, "After the last shot is fired in Iraq, it will be a good time to say that we have won, and that we both agree there is no longer any need for American forces." But he said that "the real politics of this is to win the hearts and minds of a majority of the people" in Saudi Arabia, adding, "That is the way to really fight terrorism and the bad guys." 
Another senior prince said, "The fact is, reform is imperative and not a choice, so is participatory government." There will always be opponents to reform, this prince said, though the family is capable of facing opposition "with resolve, but with understanding for the other view."
If he issues the decrees, Abdullah will have to contend with those religious authorities who will resist reforms and a change in the fundamentalist contract that has empowered a clergy who practice one of Islam's most conservative interpretations, It is based on the teachings of Sheik Muhammad bin Abd al-Wahhab and sometimes referred to as Wahhabism. 
American specialists on Saudi Arabia said it appeared that Abdullah was seeking a national consensus to maneuver around the most conservative elements of the clergy by appealing to the influential Saudi business establishment, the military and tribal leaders. The aim, Saudi officials said, is to create an Islamic parliament that would be able to wrest some control over social policy -- even basic questions like whether women can drive -- away from the puritanical religious establishment.
Richard N. Murphy, a leading Arabist who served as President Reagan's assistant secretary of state for the Middle East, said that "if this turns out to be solid, it is a dramatic demonstration of leadership, which people have been worried about" since Abdullah took over day-to-day rule from King Fahd. "It also shows that they are capable of generating movement from within, which is where it had to come from if they are going to survive as a ruling family," he added. 
One royal family member said there was a great deal of frustration among younger princes who feel that the older generation, most in their 70's and 80's, have been unwilling to take on the religious establishment.
"There is nothing in the Koran that says that women cannot drive," one prince said. "But we never tested the theory that women could drive," he added, explaining that the royal family simply subordinated itself to clerical rulings because that was the historical bargain under which the House of Saud came to power.
"As it stands now, one religious leader can veto anything that you want to do," one prince said. "Eventually, we became the culprits under this system," he added. "And now, we have exhausted every inch of that coalition. It is time to move on to the next generation."
The last time Saudi Arabia purged itself of foreign military forces was 1963, when King Faisal ordered the Strategic Air Command squadron of nuclear-armed bombers to evacuate the base they had maintained at Dhahran since the 1950's.
The reason at that time was a streak of Arab nationalism coursing through the region with the rise of Gamal Abdel Nasser in Egypt, said David E. Long, a longtime State Department specialist on the Saudis. He said that "our presence in a military base became a liability" for the Saudis, "and we were asked to leave."
Saudi Arabia's dalliance with democratic process also dates to the early 1960's. King Faisal told President John F. Kennedy that he would create an assembly whose appointed deputies would advise the throne, but not make laws. But nothing came of the proposal until 1992, when King Fahd finally carried it out after the Persian Gulf war.
Whether Abdullah can push through the deeper change now apparently envisioned is unclear. The decision by some family members to air the debate seemed in part intended to nudge the Saudi leader forward.
"Doing political reform in Saudi Arabia is like publishing the Kama Sutra in the Victorian Age," said a royal family member, referring to the Hindu encyclopedia of erotica. But, he added, "the changes that Abdullah is doing show that he is willing to proceed with only a slim majority of religious support" and a significant amount of opposition.
In doing so, Abdullah has apparently concluded that he will need to put distance between himself and the United States.
"I think they will step away from us, and I think it is healthy for both sides," Mr. Long said. "The median age in Saudi Arabia is now 15, and within this demography, there is an ideological justification for getting mad at American troops on your soil."
"But over and over again, we have given them the umbrella of our security, and our interest in them is that they own one quarter of the world's oil and can export a higher percentage of it than anyone else," Mr. Long said. "That has created a very strong relationship that is under a lot of strain, but I think it will survive."

HEADLINE: Reagan's Son 

 BODY:
With the perspective of history, those who so choose can now, with some credibility, see Ronald Reagan as a master communicator and politician who revitalized our nation's spirit and its economy. 
We can also realistically choose to credit him with boldly exposing the frailty of the Soviet Union and accelerating its demise. 
 What, exactly, has George W. Bush accomplished to even begin to merit comparison? He has pledged to bring Osama bin Laden to justice and to eliminate the threat from Al Qaeda -- so far without success. Under Bush's watch the economy has weakened. And his policy toward Iraq threatens increased global conflict at the philosophical, political and physical levels.

EmbracingDeficits To Deter Spending

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif. 

 BODY:
AT the Hoover Institution, a bastion of conservative Republican economists on the Stanford campus, it is an article of faith that deep tax cuts are the best tonic for the nation's economy.
 No news in that. 
 What is surprising is the consensus here that budget deficits are not only acceptable but the preferred state of fiscal affairs, a view that President Bush seems to have adopted without explicitly saying so.
And what was really striking in a week spent at Hoover talking to the scholars, many of whom have held top positions in previous Republican administrations, was how unenthusiastic most of these Republican stalwarts are about the president's proposal to eliminate the income tax that individuals pay on stock dividends. 
Here is the Hoover take on budget deficits:
Back in the 1980's and early 90's, when red ink flowed as far as the eye could see, conservatives could safely rail about the wisdom of a balanced budget. There seemed to be no hope of getting there. So any movement toward balance was bound to lead to less government spending, which is the main conservative goal.
But when surpluses began to appear late in the Clinton administration, conservative economists -- and Republican politicians, though most are reluctant to say so -- decided that deficits were best after all, because they restrained spending.
John F. Cogan, a Hoover fellow, was a top official in the Office of Management and Budget in the Reagan and first Bush administrations and probably could have been the current president's budget director if he had wanted the job. He put the case this way: "It is wrong to allow surpluses because these surpluses invariably lead to higher spending. Governments simply cannot hang onto money."
On the exclusion of stock dividends from individual taxation, the centerpiece of the president's tax plan, everyone who was interviewed here agreed that it was generally good tax policy. Double taxation of dividends, once as corporate profits and again after the same money has been distributed to shareholders as dividends, is a serious distortion in the tax code that encourages companies to borrow money and not issue stock, the scholars said.
"It is good tax reform, something we need to do," said Michael J. Boskin, who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under the first President George Bush.
But Mr. Boskin and most of his colleagues said that there were better ways to use the $364 billion in lost revenue over 10 years -- about half of the total proposed tax cut -- that Mr. Bush would allot for the dividend exclusion.
Mr. Boskin would rather use the money for what he called traditional investment incentives, like allowing companies to depreciate investments in plants and equipment more rapidly. 
Martin Anderson, who was a senior economic adviser in Ronald Reagan's White House, and his wife, Annelise G. Anderson, a budget official for Mr. Reagan, said that as much as they liked the idea of scrapping the tax on dividends, they would rather see deeper across-the-board cuts in tax rates. 
"In terms of what will get the economy going, reducing tax rates is what's key," Mr. Anderson said.
ALVIN RABUSHKA, one of the leading academic proponents of a flat tax on all income, said he would also favor using all the money for rate cuts. But rather than cutting rates for all taxpayers, he would reduce only the top rates.
Charles E. McLure Jr., a top tax official in the Reagan administration, wrote a book in the 1970's advocating the elimination of the double tax on dividends. Mr. McLure said he still believed it would be good tax policy.
But he said it would not be his first choice now as the best way to lower taxes. "I certainly wouldn't characterize it as a stimulus," he said. "It would be a tax break mostly for fat cats, who are just going to save the money. And it would not do much for the stock market." 
Mr. McLure recalled that when he was in the Reagan Treasury Department, he and his colleagues favored taxing corporate profits only once. But every proposal they looked at proved to be expensive.
Under instructions in 1984 to prepare a tax reform plan for the president that, over all, neither increased nor decreased revenue, the Treasury tax writers kept paring the dividend exclusion until they proposed a 10 percent exemption. 
When Mr. Reagan submitted his plan to Congress, the exemption had been whittled to 1 percent. When the bill became law, it had no dividendexclusion. "It was too little bang for the buck," Mr. McLure said.

New Savings Plans Wouldn't Be for Everybody

BYLINE:  By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH 

 BODY:
THE Bush administration's proposed "tax free" savings plans are supposed to be all about simplicity, and for many young adults that may be true. Most people starting marriages and careers don't have a lot of financial assets yet, so they won't face many confusing choices about whether to move their money if Congress approves the new accounts.
 But the older you are, and the more money you have stockpiled in 401(k)'s, 529 accounts, individual retirement accounts, Roth I.R.A.'s and other vehicles that now dot the financial landscape, the more complex the decisions will be. 
 Hank Madden, chief executive of Madden Advisory Services, a fee-only financial planning firm in Jacksonville, Fla., that caters to affluent customers, says he has some reservations about the new savings plans. He fears that they could bring on a storm of advertising, sending false signals that they are better for everyone. People who would be better off leaving their money in the old accounts may be persuaded to move it, Mr. Madden said, enriching money managers and the Treasury, but hurting themselves. 
"When you look at these tax-free plans, you have got to get beyond the smoke and mirrors," he said. "Think about the time value of money, because that's not what's being presented to the average person out there."
That means keeping in mind a basic financial principle: a dollar in hand today is worth more than a dollar that will show up in the future. And some of the current tax-advantaged plans do offer that dollar now, when it's worth more.
The 401(k), for example, offers a tax break at the beginning, when contributions are made, using pretax dollars. The pretax dollars form a larger base to generate investment income for the life of the account. The traditional I.R.A. can have the same upfront advantage, at least for people who can deduct their contributions. For both accounts, the money is taxed in the future, when withdrawals are taken.
The proposed new individual savings accounts, by contrast, have their tax advantages built into the future, as tax-free withdrawals. The contributions themselves are to be made with after-tax dollars and offer no tax break. So, while the idea of tax-free future income is appealing, the 401(k)'s upfront tax advantage gives it a hidden power that could offset the new accounts' benefits for some people.
Which people? That depends on many factors, some hard to gauge: the saver's age, income, current tax bracket, expected future tax bracket, current investments, whether the saver has a retirement plan at work and how generous it is, and other circumstances.
For Deborah Darrell and Rhod Williams of Manhattan, the tradeoffs in the old and new savings instruments are relatively straightforward. They are expecting their first baby in April and want to set up a tax-advantaged account for future tuition; until now, they have been investing in real estate and in their 401(k) plans at work. 
The two new individual savings plans -- the Lifetime Savings Account and Retirement Savings Account -- look attractive to them for precisely the reasons Treasury officials say they should: they remove many of the current restrictions on when tax-advantaged money can be withdrawn and for what purposes.
"The idea of having a savings plan that you could take money out of at any time with no penalties is a good thing," said Ms. Darrell, 37, a senior vice president at LaForce & Stevens, a marketing and public relations firm. She agrees that if the rules are relaxed, she will save more.
EVEN so, the couple intend to keep their current savings strategy in place, even if the new vehicles appear. They won't cash out their existing 401(k) accounts, pay taxes due and put the money into the new accounts. Nor will they stop making annual contributions to their 401(k)'s, which would get a new name -- Employer Retirement Savings Accounts. "I like the idea of the tax benefits now, on an investment I'm making for the future," Ms. Darrell said.
Mr. Williams, 36, who left Citigroup last year to start a small, specialized investment bank, said he and his three partners expected to set up an employer-sponsored retirement savings account at their firm. Besides having a front-loaded tax break, as in a 401(k), the program would give the option of providing "free" matching contributions, which some employers now pay. And it would offer the simplicity of automatic payroll deductions at work.
These advantages are more clear-cut for savers who are somewhat closer to the time they'll want to withdraw the money. Marcus Weaver, 45, a branch manager for an industrial cleaning company in Jacksonville, Fla., said he could see no sense in removing money from his traditional I.R.A. or his 401(k), paying taxes and diverting the rest to one of the new savings vehicles.
"I haven't done the math, but we all understand the value of compounding interest," he said, noting that if he transferred his savings to the new plans, paying taxes along the way, his interest would compound from a smaller base.
Mr. Madden, who is Mr. Weaver's planner, asked, "Why would you take a tax-deferred investment and put it into a tax-free investment? The person who benefits from this is the broker or agent who sold it to you, with a high commission."
For Ms. Darrell and Mr. Williams, there are even more reasons to stick with the old vehicles. They are planning to set up a college fund for their child, and while Ms. Darrell said the Lifetime Savings Account sounded fabulous, they are leaning toward the current college savings instrument, a 529 plan.
"The thing I like about the 529 plan is, it's singularly focused," Mr. Williams said. "It's an education plan."
Indeed, the 529 plan requires that savers use withdrawals only for education expenses; if they don't, they pay a penalty. The proposed Lifetime Savings Account allows people to take tax-free withdrawals at any time and for any purpose.
The couple's financial planner, Melissa Levine, said that ever since the Lifetime Savings Accounts were unveiled, she has been urging clients to keep financing 529 plans if they have them, restrictions and all, in part because of the discipline they instill. 
"When they brought out these 529 plans, people were saying, 'Let's really focus on college,' " said Ms. Levine, who has a solo practice in Manhattan. "With the Lifetime Savings Account, I don't think you're going to see that. People are going to focus on the house, the boat and when they get to college they'll say: 'Oops! What went wrong?' "
The 529 plan has yet another advantage for a couple like Ms. Darrell and Mr. Williams because of the way they have handled their investments thus far. For the last seven years, they have been active investors in real estate, buying properties to rent or improve for resale. 
One of their investments is a multifamily dwelling under construction in Newark. It is scheduled to be completed and ready to sell in April, the same month their baby is due. Ms. Levine has devised a tuition plan for the couple, which projects that if they put $55,000 into a 529 plan now, and inflation and investment returns follow certain trends, they should have enough to cover their child's tuition in 18 years.
So the profit from the Newark building project will finance a 529 account -- not a Lifetime Savings Account. For a couple with a large windfall or bonus to work with, the old 529 plans turn out to be the more advantageous tool. The 529's permit large, lump-sum contributions in a single year; the Lifetime Savings Accounts limit annual contributions to $7,500, or $15,000 a couple.
Not that all prosperous savers will have no use for the new accounts. Ms. Levine said that for people with the resources, they might work best as supplements to existing accounts. "I think you really need to have a retirement account for retirement, a college account for college, and if you have anything left over, good for you," she said.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH; 
Yet Another Persecuted Architect of the Tech Bubble

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
DURING the technobubble, Frank P. Quattrone was the man to see if you were a new-economy entrepreneur looking for other people's money to pocket. In the technobust, Mr. Quattrone, an investment banker at Credit Suisse First Boston, is facing questions over his advice to colleagues that they shred documents about the faltering companies he helped finance.
 Mr. Quattrone was suspended by his firm last week while it determines whether he is right in saying he has done nothing wrong. 
 But even as this beleaguered banker and former technology stock research director participated in a Pro-Am golf tournament in Pebble Beach, Calif., last week -- the sumptuous course that abuts one of his homes -- securities regulators were preparing a suit against Mr. Quattrone. According to people briefed on the case, it will contend that Mr. Quattrone failed to supervise his subordinates. Regulators may say, for example, that he failed to rein in his enthusiastic analysts who recommended chancy stocks that the firm had underwritten to unsuspecting investors.
It is entirely predictable that Mr. Quattrone would be a target. Looking for fame, regulators often attack productive members of society. Doesn't the NASD realize that Mr. Quattrone cannot have been expected to supervise his 260 bankers and 100 analysts? Not when he had real work to do.
Supervising, after all, is unbearably boring. It may be fine for government work, but Mr. Quattrone was in the real world, creating wealth for entrepreneurs, for his firm, for himself. The man was busy.
From 1998 to 2001, Credit Suisse brought 186 companies public, more than any other firm. Besides arranging these deals, Mr. Quattrone had the generosity of spirit to keep investors alert to the fine values these stocks represented. His analysts helped there, of course. So what if the companies' insiders were selling? So what if many of the companies later failed?
A true 24/7 guy, Mr. Quattrone shouldered other duties as well. He gamely volunteered to manage with two other executives Merchant Capital, a venture capital fund in which Credit Suisse First Boston executives, including himself, had invested. Wearing this hat, Mr. Quattrone spent valuable time selecting companies for the fund to buy. He also had to make sure that he could sell the stakes before they crashed. For instance, Merchant sold 115,119 shares of Sonus Networks in March 2001 for $2.4 million, or around $21 a share. Sonus's stock now trades at $1.33.
Mr. Quattrone also toiled to ensure that he and his family could sell their stakes in companies that his firm and others later brought public. As one test of his organizational skills, Mr. Quattrone had to navigate pesky lockup periods that restrict sales by pre-offering investors, who typically pay far less for their shares than the public does.
The man was up to the task. From late 2000 to early 2001, Mr. Quattrone sold stock worth $1.05 million in three companies in which he had invested before their public offerings: Interwoven and the Riverdeep Group, both software makers, and Sonus Networks, a communications concern. All are trading for a small fraction of what he received on his sales.
And the Quattrone Family Trust sold stock worth $1 million in 14 companies during the bubble. As trustee, along with his wife, Mr. Quattrone devoted time to the trust's many real estate transactions in Pebble Beach, Carmel and Los Altos, Calif.
Clearly, Mr. Quattrone had a lot on his plate. And the sooner securities regulators recognize this and stop harassing a highly productive executive, the quicker we can return to the good old days. Remember them, when no one asked questions and stocks only went up?

HEADLINE: Second Acts; 
Mike Dukakis Rides Again

BYLINE:  By MARK KATZ; Mark Katz, speechwriter and humorist, was a member of the Dukakis presidential campaign's rapid-response team.

 BODY:
MEMO to Governor Mike Dukakis 
From: Mark Katz 
 Subject: Thoughts on 2004 
 Now that your old rivals Gary Hart and Dick Gephardt have once again tossed their hats into the ring, it is only natural for people to recall the 1988 campaign and the Democratic Party's nominee for president. That was you. 
Here are some thoughts on why the time is so right for Mike Dukakis to run again. 
* Today, President Mike Dukakis could negotiate with Mikhail Gorbachev from a position of real strength. 
* The state you once governed so well is ripe for another "Massachusetts miracle." In fact, your slogan, "good jobs at good wages," resonates now more than ever! 
* Boston Harbor is clean. No problem there. 
* No one has given more speeches on "deja voodoo economics" -- humongous tax cuts and enormous defense spending -- than you. Suggested warmed-over sound bite: Bushonomics is deja-voodoo economics all over again again!
* Your killer stuff on the Strategic Defense Initiative -- "we need star schools, not Star Wars"-- still works for me. 
* Your running mate, Lloyd Bentsen, was vindicated by time: Dan Quayle was no Jack Kennedy. 
Governor, perhaps the most compelling case to be made for a new campaign is your track record against a similar-looking field of candidates. 
In 1988, you vanquished all rivals: an attractive Southern moderate, Al Gore (attention, John Edwards!); the spoiler, Jesse Jackson (Al Sharpton, look out!); an avuncular nerd, Paul Simon (Joe Lieberman's ears are burning); as well as a populist Congressman, Dick Gephardt (Dick Gephardt beware!). As for John Kerry, certainly your former lieutenant governor will have no choice but to endorse you like the good soldier and mensch that he is. Gary Hart? Go ahead and watch him campaign. You'll be bored. 
You may not know that your 1988 campaign had a rapid-response team, and that I was on it. Here are some of the hard-hitting lines I should have gotten to you sooner:
* I love the American flag and anyone who suggests otherwise will get a punch in the nose!
* Hey, wait a minute, Bernie Shaw -- that's my wife you are talking about!
* Willie Horton? Trent Lott!
Governor Dukakis, I strongly believe that you have a second date with destiny and urge you to run. Al Gore was wise to get out of the way. You are the guy with the grudge to settle against George Bush.

Crises, Crises Everywhere. What Is A President To Do?

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
IRAQ. North Korea. Terrorism. Tax cuts. The stock market. The shuttle. The president? 
 Busy! 
 If, as F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote, "the test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function," the test of a successful presidency may be the ability to multitask in crises. In fact, it's more or less the definition of the job. 
Sure, President Bush had a full week: a space disaster and a wrenching memorial service, a $2.23 trillion budget proposal to Congress, a North Korean threat of "total war," a dramatic showdown at the United Nations over Iraqi defiance of weapons inspections, a stepped-up orange-level terrorism alert based on ominous intelligence rumblings. 
But the current confluence of challenging events is hardly new. Harry S. Truman faced almost nonstop crises from the moment he took office after Franklin D. Roosevelt's death in 1945. Roosevelt himself managed the Depression, then a global war, not to mention paralysis.
In 1957, Dwight D. Eisenhower was in the middle of a crisis over desegregation of Central High School in Little Rock, Ark., when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, a silver satellite the size of a beachball, setting off a panic about preparedness in the cold war. By his own account, Richard M. Nixon managed "Six Crises" before he ever reached the White House, then created a doozy of his own in Watergate. Bill Clinton complained that it was his bad luck to be president in placid times of plenty, when greatness cannot easily emerge, then managed to become the second president in history to be impeached.
"This is what a president is -- a crisis manager," said the historian Robert Dallek, who wrote a two-volume biography of Johnson and has just finished another on Kennedy. "Of course, what suffers in all of this is any domestic agenda a president has. A standard reality is that war kills reform. The Spanish-American war killed populism, World War I killed Progressivism, World War II killed the New Deal, Korea killed the Fair Deal, Vietnam the Great Society."
Mr. Bush is not the first president to govern in a 24-hour news cycle, but the endless drumbeat no doubt worsens the sense of perpetual crisis. The media, and sometimes the politicians themselves, have a tendency to inflate every event, from a school shooting to a sniper on the loose to the prospect of nuclear war, into a round-the-clock happening.
"It plays into the story line that we are now living in this immensely more dangerous, unpredictable world," said Richard Norton Smith, a presidential historian who leads the Dole Institute of Politics at the University of Kansas. "I don't mean to make light of what we're going through now, but I do suspect that in ways difficult to quantify but impossible to ignore, that the media echo chamber is at least partially responsible for inflating a more or less permanent sense of crisis. History has gone the way of politics in becoming theater. It's the 'Oscarization' of history, overly produced, overly packaged."
To hear television anchors most days is to think that disaster is perpetually at hand. 
"It is certainly a challenge for the president, balancing the exigencies of the day," Peter Jennings intoned on ABC last week. "Two critical situations, in Iraq and North Korea, and an epic battle over financing the activities of the federal government, with the very real need to provide leadership at a time of national mourning."
Daniel Schorr, the veteran broadcast journalist, acknowledged on NPR last week that Washington has a hard time managing multiple problems and tends to be a "one-thing-at-a-time type of town." Attention spans are short, politicians rise and fall, issues come and go.
Professor Smith said, "Buried deep within it all is a continuing, albeit discreet, concern on the part of opinion leaders, real or imagined, about Bush's capacity."
To all appearances, Mr. Bush often seems the calmest one in the storm. For months, he has remained steadily determined to disarm Saddam Hussein, first in the face of warnings that doing so without a Middle East peace risked Arab rage, and now despite worries that North Korea is the more volatile threat.
"The old saying in F.D.R.'s Washington was 'Keep all the balls in the air without losing your own,' " said the historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. "As Kennedy said after the Cuban missile crisis, 'I earned my pay last week.' You know, it's your job. Hysteria is the last thing to be recommended."
Ronald Reagan survived an assassination attempt after just weeks in office, then went on to face recession, survive the Iran-contra scandal and help end the cold war. Lyndon B. Johnson fared less well waging the Vietnam War while trying to build a Great Society, and was ultimately consumed by wrenching public division.
Harry C. McPherson Jr., who was Johnson's special counsel, said he marked the toll of White House crises in the annual albums of photographs that the Johnsons gave the senior staff at Christmas. "I got there in '65, and by '67 I looked pale and overtaxed and Johnson looked very gray." 
He remembered a lunch on the White House lawn in March 1968, just a couple of weeks before Johnson's surprise announcement that he would not run again. "You could hear the chants from the other side of the building from the demonstrators," Mr. McPherson recalled. "At one point, Johnson said, 'Why should I run?' I said, 'Well if I were you, I wouldn't, because there's so much grief in the air.' It was a moment in which the mistrust, the antiwar sentiment, the anti-civil rights sentiment in the South, the sum of it just seemed enormous."
There are costs and casualties for failing to keep up with events. The first President Bush soared to stratospheric approval ratings after the Persian Gulf war, but was seen as out of touch with a faltering economy and unemployed Americans. Jimmy Carter micromanaged the White House tennis courts but could not manage to confront a national malaise and the failure to rescue American hostages in Iran.
Sometimes the price is more personal. Everyone remembers Truman's acid letter to Paul Hume, The Washington Post music critic who panned the singing of his daughter, Margaret. Less well remembered is the week that led up to Truman's outburst.
On Nov. 28, 1950, Truman received word that the Chinese had plunged into the Korean War, with a quarter-million troops in a furious assault. Two days later, Truman set off a worldwide firestorm by suggesting at a news conference that the United States was prepared to use the atomic bomb in Korea. The man responsible for trying to calm that crisis was the president's press secretary, Charlie Ross, who was also his longtime friend.
On Tuesday, Dec. 5, Ross dropped dead of a heart attack, hours before Miss Truman's concert at Constitution Hall. The president kept the news from her until afterward. The next morning, when the president read Hume's assessment that Miss Truman "is flat a good deal of the time," he reached for paper and pen.
"Some day I hope to meet you," Truman wrote. "When that happens you'll need a new nose, a lot of beefsteak for black eyes, and perhaps a supporter below!"

HEADLINE: The Nation; 
For Republicans, Deficits Are Nothing to Be Ashamed of

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
THE idea of a balanced budget ranks high in the hierarchy of American political virtues. Thomas Jefferson proposed a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution in 1798, and Franklin D. Roosevelt ran with the promise of a balanced budget in 1932.
 President Bill Clinton, ever eager to shed the tax-and-spend image of the Democratic Party, embraced the cause of deficit reduction in his 1993 economic plan, and Newt Gingrich's revolutionary Contract With America promised, first and foremost, a balanced budget. By the late 1990's, both parties had managed to declare a victory over the demon deficit and were promising surpluses as far as the eye could see. 
 So how did it happen that a conservative president submitted a budget last week that included a substantial $304 billion deficit? And that his budget director, Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., described a balanced budget as a "high priority" for this administration, but quickly added, "It is not the top, let alone the only priority"? And that Mr. Daniels scoffed at the idea that these deficits would hurt the economy?
It was an Alice-through-the-looking-glass moment that revealed how much the debate over the deficit in recent years was not, really, about the deficit. Then and now, the debate is as much about politics as economics, about the two parties' vision of government and what it should -- and should not -- do.
For many conservatives, the deficit is simply not as important as cutting taxes, letting Americans keep "more of their own money" and limiting the size of the government. In general, spending on national security and the military is considered appropriate, spending on new social welfare entitlements is not -- with a few exceptions for popular items like prescription drugs.
Whatever the ultimate reality, after the gritty process of appropriations occurs, an article of faith is that less government is better. As the conservative strategist Grover Norquist put it: "If we had a little teeny government and a big deficit, I wouldn't care. It's the size of the government we're focused on. It's also the size of the government the left is focused on."
Indeed, for many liberals, eliminating the deficit is simply a counterintuitive means to an end: protecting the grand old entitlement programs of Medicare and Social Security and restoring the government's credibility so it could plausibly do (and spend) even more. 
Michael Waldman, a former speechwriter for Mr. Clinton, recalls Mr. Clinton telling him one night in 1998, when they were writing his State of the Union address, "Our mission is to save government from its own excesses so it can again be a progressive force."
All this helps explain why Republicans were defending deficits last week, though some did so through gritted teeth, while the supposedly free-spending Democrats were deploring said deficits at every turn.
"It's like a parallel world -- that a deficit doesn't matter and that it's coming from a conservative president," said Stanley E. Collender, a budget expert with Fleishman-Hillard, a public relations firm.
Former Senator Warren B. Rudman, the New Hampshire Republican who engineered a signature deficit reduction act of the 1980's, the Gramm-Rudman Act, said: "I don't understand it. It reminded me of the movie, 'Trading Places.' Everybody's had a role reversal."
For Mr. Norquist, it is simply a more honest debate. "In the 80's and 90's, the Democrats said, 'We're against deficits,' meaning, 'We're against tax cuts,' " he said. "And the Republicans said, 'We're against deficits,' meaning 'We're against spending increases.' " 
The deficit, in other words, was simply a useful proxy. When the surplus appeared, the real struggle was clear.
But what about the voters, warned unrelentingly through the years that deficits are dangerous and bad? 
"Having headlines from coast to coast that the Bush budget brings record deficits is still a bad day for the president," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster. 
But Mr. Garin and others agree that the deficit is an abstraction that acquires political power only when linked with the concrete: bad economic fallout, threats to Social Security and a heavier burden of debt for future generations.
This is exactly the argument that Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, a longtime deficit hawk and ranking Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee, is making. "The president said in his State of the Union that we shouldn't pass the problems of today onto future generations, but that's precisely what he's doing," he said. 
Democrats are particularly scathing about the role of the administration's tax cuts in creating these budgetary strains.
On the other hand, Mr. Bush's budget, which reflects increases for the Pentagon, can be defended as the necessary response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks (though it does not include a projection of the cost of any war with Iraq). 
"The question is, What would you not do?" Mr. Daniels demanded last week. "Would you not try to spur economic growth? Would you not continue the strengthening of our defenses and the prosecution of the war on terror and the strengthening of homeland security?"
Many Democrats have a ready answer for what they would not do: create sweeping new tax cuts.
By week's end, Democrats were circulating the 1996 Republican platform that declared the budget deficit was "a stealth tax" that "pushes up interest rates" and would "mortgage our children's future."
Scholars note that while a reverence for balanced budgets runs deep in American history, so does the acceptance of deficit spending when necessary to pursue other goals. James D. Savage, professor of politics at the University of Virginia and author of "Balanced Budgets and American Politics," said the first deficit spending in the American colonies was in 1690 in -- of course -- Massachusetts.
The struggle to explain and defend deficit spending has a proud history as well. Franklin Roosevelt instructed his speechwriter in 1936 to "give a good and convincing explanation" of what he had meant four years earlier, when he had promised a balanced budget, given that he had subsequently incurred substantial deficits. 
His speechwriter replied that there was only one possible explanation. "Mr. President, the only thing you can say about the 1932 speech is to deny categorically that you ever made it."

HEADLINE: Venezuelan Oilman: Rebel With a New Cause 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Feb. 8 

 BODY:
He wears pastel-colored suits and wire-rimmed glasses. His thinning hair is neatly combed. Restrained and a little stiff, he speaks in the dry tones and jargon-filled language of a technocrat on such obscure topics as 1958 American oil regulations or 1930's energy policies in Venezuela.
 In short, he looks and sounds every bit the oil executive he is -- the president of one of the largest, most complicated and, these days, most embattled companies in the world, Petroleos de Venezuela. 
 But make no mistake, Ali Rodriguez still sees himself as a revolutionary. His boss, after all, is President Hugo Chavez, whose sharp tongue and efforts to remake Venezuelan society have left the country deeply divided and on the edge of economic collapse. 
Though his resume makes no mention of it, Mr. Rodriguez has leftist, some would say radical, credentials. For 20 years, he was a clandestine agitator and a fighter in a Cuban-inspired rebel movement, where he specialized in political proselytizing and making bombs, according to former guerrilla comrades.
"I am still a revolutionary, of course," said Mr. Rodriguez, 64, who remains a member of a party, Fatherland for All, on the left fringe of the government's coalition. "But it is under different conditions, in accordance with the realities of the day."
The irony of how the son of a humble Andean farmer became an idealistic guerrilla and, years later, rose to the upper echelon of a widely hailed company makes Mr. Rodriguez shake his head and smile. To be sure, he does not seem entirely comfortable poring through planning documents, but though he does not carry a rifle anymore, he still says he is fighting to shake up the system for the betterment of the poor. 
Still, the reality is that today's rebels are his former oil executives. For more than two months they have been out in the streets protesting against Mr. Chavez and, by extension, Mr. Rodriguez's management of Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.
Indeed, thousands of Petroleos workers helped to topple Mr. Chavez for a few days in April, and then gave backbone to a national strike of several weeks that strangled oil exports to Venezuela's main customer, the United States.
Mr. Rodriguez may have once believed in hemispherewide revolution. But these days, as he looks out from his penthouse office, he sounds more like an unforgiving capitalist. He vows that the thousands of dissident workers who went on strike -- and continue to strike -- will never return to their jobs.
"Their movement seriously damaged the company and the country," Mr. Rodriguez said, his ire just slightly shaking his calm demeanor. "That is why I am indignant at what happened, because it makes our work so much harder. We have to reduce investments, and that means a loss of possibilities, a retreat for the country."
"There is no possibility of an amnesty whatsoever," he added.
Petroleos de Venezuela, once valued at $110 billion, is producing just half what it did before the strike, which ended in the non-oil sector last week after 63 days. Moribund oil fields are sanding up, losing the ability to produce oil; the company's reputation is in shambles; and the 9,000 workers Mr. Rodriguez has fired represent a loss of experience and skill.
Whether to take back striking workers is one of the critical decisions Mr. Rodriguez has made as he tries to guide Petroleos de Venezuela through venomous political waters into uncharted territory.
To his left are hard-liners in the governing party who believe Mr. Rodriguez was too lax in purging dissenters and too close to the global oil industry to be of much use to Mr. Chavez's reforms. 
To his right are those who accuse him of allowing ideology to cloud logic, resulting in a scaled-down company that will generate far less wealth than before.
Those who know him see Mr. Rodriguez as independent, decisive and clear on how to reshape the company. He has a plan to break the company into eastern and western divisions, making the Caracas headquarters, where dissidents planned antigovernment walkouts, obsolete. He proposes reducing the company's scope, possibly selling off refineries and other assets overseas.
Mr. Rodriguez insisted that Venezuela would soon export as much petroleum as before the strike, about 2.7 million barrels a day, most to the United States. He suggested that as demand grows in the years to come, so would Venezuelan supply.
But the company he envisions would also conform more to Mr. Chavez's vision, to generate a steady stream of revenues for social programs. It would also continue forging ties with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
"I think that effectively, at least culturally, the true nationalization of petroleum is coming," Mr. Rodriguez said recently, though he emphasized that foreign companies would continue to operate here. The role of a company that controls such riches, he said in an interview, is to "incorporate that value of the natural resource for the maximum benefit."
But getting the company back to where it once was will be difficult -- some say impossible -- even for a longtime oilman who served as president and general secretary of OPEC before taking over the Venezuelan company last April.
"It is hard to see the company overcome this quantitative and qualitative setback," said Mazhar al-Shereidah, an oil economist who helped write oil regulations for the Chavez government. "He is not in charge of a healthy company. They are giving him a company, a body, that is in intensive care."
The company's 2003 budget is being cut by $2.7 billion, to about $6 billion, to offset the slide in revenue. Mr. Rodriguez acknowledges that investments that are crucial for exploration are being cut by 30 percent.
If he is strained by the Herculean task ahead, Mr. Rodriguez does not seem to show it. He has learned to be resilient. 
"As I have said, everything you do as human beings, is a step forward," he explained. "You learn from the hard knocks, while someone who does not go through it might not find it so easy." 
The hard knocks came in the 1950's when Mr. Rodriguez was a student agitator fighting against the strongman Marcos Perez Jimenez. Even after Perez Jimenez was overthrown in 1958, Mr. Rodriguez said he continued in the Venezuelan underground, pressing for change.
Accused of having detonated a fatal bomb blast, which he denies, Mr. Rodriguez fled into the mountains in 1964 and joined others intent on toppling the government. Former fellow fighters remembered Comandante Fausto, as he was known, as shrewd and tireless, excelling in combat and political work and spending his free time listening to classical music.
"He could move in any scenario," said Alberto Tirso, 61, a former comrade who now opposes the Chavez government. "He was a man of valor, very serene, a great reader. I remember he always carried four or five books in his knapsack."
But the revolution never caught on, and in 1979 Mr. Rodriguez was one of the last rebels to demobilize under a government amnesty. He became a lawyer and won a seat in the lower house of Congress where his interest in oil blossomed, leading to the chairmanship of the energy committee. When Mr. Chavez was elected president in 1998, he became minister of mines and energy.
"I have had the good fortune of being in different situations that have to do with petroleum," he said. "And now it is as an entrepreneur, a role I had never thought I would play in my life."

THE COSTS
Venezuela's Oil Industry and the Strike

The strike has reduced Venezuela's oil capabilities.

Oil produced, total:
3.1 million barrels a day before the strike.
1.3 million now, say dissidents. The government says the figure is 1.9 million.

Oil exported:
2.7 million barrels a day before the strike, most to the U.S.
700,000 barrels now, according to Mines and Energy Ministry.

Work force:
33,000 full-time employees before the strike, and 37,000 contract workers, which fluctuated.
Unclear how many now, but 9,000 of the full-time workers have been fired.

Gasoline produced for home market:
250,000 barrels a day before strike.
150,000 barrels now, the Mines and Energy Ministry says.

Gross oil revenues:
2002 (estimated) $22.2 billion.
2003 (forecast)$14.3 billion, according to UBS Warburg.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE DRAFT; 
A New Tactic Against War: Renew Talk About Draft

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 8 

 BODY:
Back in the late 1960's, Pete Stark was known as the hippie banker for installing a huge peace sign on his bank in the East Bayand counseling draftees on whether to flee to Canada.
 Now, Mr. Stark, a pugnacious liberal House member from Northern California, is back in the antiwar movement. But he and some of his fellow Democrats are trying a new approach -- advocating a return of the draft. 
 "My constituents at home think I have lost my mind," Mr. Stark said. "They say, 'Why do you want to give the military more soldiers?' I am supporting the draft as a way to oppose the war."
Mr. Stark, a veteran who said the chief danger he faced in the military was getting his tie caught in a typewriter, is co-sponsoring a proposal by Representatives Charles B. Rangel of New York and John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, both Democrats. 
Those two lawmakers, veterans and senior members of the Congressional Black Caucus, say the risks of combat losses should be spread more equitably among Americans. They have a Senate ally, Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, who says he wants to give advocates of American military action in Iraq and elsewhere a little something to chew over.
"One way to avoid a lot more wars to come is institute the draft," Mr. Hollings said. "You will find that this country will sober up, and its leadership, too."
While Democrats are climbing aboard the induction bandwagon, Republicans are dropping off. Representative Nick Smith of Michigan, who in the past had his own draft proposal, has no interest in helping Democrats with theirs, an aide said. Republicans generally view the Rangel plan as a cynical effort to rouse antiwar sentiment.
"There is no serious discussion of it," Representative John A. Boehner, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the Committee on Education and the Workforce, said about bringing back the draft.
Mr. Rangel, who was wounded in Korea and decorated for his efforts to evacuate the injured during a battle, makes no apologies for trying to score a political point. "I hope I am saying that war is hell and if indeed our country's security is in jeopardy, then we must as a country be prepared to make sacrifice," Mr. Rangel said. 
While few in Congress give the legislation any chance, it is reminding some of the days when the lottery they followed most closely was not Powerball but the one conducted by the Selective Service. Mr. Rangel is scheduled to address students at Harvard on Monday, a meeting that could illustrate whether the draft still has the capacity to stir crowds on college campuses.
It is already clear that the subject continues to elicit raw emotions. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld was forced to apologize last month for saying Vietnam draftees had added "no value" to the military, a comment that infuriated veterans groups.
Though Mr. Rumsfeld might have had to back down from his choice of words, the Pentagon is adamantly opposed to a return to the draft, saying its all-volunteer military is a superior fighting force. 
"The all-volunteer force has served the nation for more than a quarter-century, providing a military that is experienced, smart, disciplined, and representative of America," a recently circulated Pentagon position paper said.
The draft has had a long and troubled place in United States military history, from colonial conscripts through the riots of the Civil War to the draft-card burning of Vietnam. That was the last war in which some young American men were forced to serve. Faced with protests, President Richard M. Nixon abolished the draft in 1973.
Those advocating a return of the draft do not quarrel with the capabilities of the modern American military. They argue that it is more of a fairness issue, that the weight of combat should not fall just on those who signed up, often to get ahead economically or educationally.
"In the event that we do find ourselves in a war," Mr. Rangel said, "those that have to go to fight should not be selected from those who volunteered because of economic circumstances."
Mr. Hollings said bringing back the draft might also ease the burden on National Guard and reserve personnel whose lives are disrupted by frequent deployments. 
Were the draft in place today, Mr. Rangel said, President Bush would be required to make a more forceful and detailed case about why intervention in Iraq is necessary. The draft, he said, "means that when you are selling war, you have to be good about it."

HEADLINE: War: Still Good Business on the Island 

BYLINE:  By PHILLIP LUTZ 

 BODY:
AS war clouds gather over Iraq, some economists are warning that the effects of an American invasion could be felt at home in higher energy costs, higher interest rates and lost jobs. Long Island would not be immune from such risks. But to the Island's military contractors, war means more business for a sector that has already been invigorated by the post-9/11 tightening of security in the United States.
 Long Island as a whole lost jobs in 2002, but Yacov Shamash, dean of the school of engineering and applied sciences at the State University at Stony Brook, said the Island's military contractors gained at least 1,000 jobs and won more than $1 billion in contracts. Energized as they haven't been in years, the contractors and politicians are busily organizing to make sure they get their share of military and homeland security contracts to be awarded in the coming months. 
 "If we go into Iraq, I've heard estimates that the economic impact would be as high as $300 billion," said Representative Steve Israel, Democrat of Huntington. Adding the $38 billion increase budgeted in 2002 for spending on homeland security and an additional $48 billion for the Pentagon, Mr. Israel said, "you're talking about a very significant impact on the national economy and, because of Long Island's technology and defense orientation, just as significant an impact locally." 
The military spending increases put Long Island in an unaccustomed position, said Mr. Israel, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee. In the late 1980's, he led a commission of Long Island officials that concluded that, with military spending falling as the cold war was ending, the Island's military contractors should diversify. Most stepped up efforts to crack commercial markets. "Now," he said, "they've got to dediversify."
While no one is predicting that Long Island will return to the days when it was a major manufacturer of military aircraft and 80,000 people had defense jobs, most people agree that there is plenty of profit to be made in developing 21st-century war materiel -- advanced radar systems, communications devices, jamming equipment and the like. 
"Since 9/11 there has been growth in defense expenditures, and companies on Long Island have certainly benefited from that," Dr. Shamash said. "They are hiring people, and it has been very helpful to that part of the industrial sector."
Philip A. Teel is a vice president for airborne early warning and electronic warfare systems at Northrop Grumman in Bethpage. "We were already working on a couple of programs that were major upgrades," he said. "Sept. 11 sort of accelerated that. Budget has been added, maybe not directly as a result, but the impetus probably came from that."
Topping the list of such programs, Mr. Teel said, is one to upgrade the radar on Grumman's E-2C Hawkeye, the Navy's carrier-based surveillance aircraft. "The program was expected to be around $1 billion," he said. "We now know it is expected to be in excess of $2 billion."
Over the past year, the Naval Air Systems Command has awarded Northrop Grumman two contracts worth a total of $118 million for early development work on the program. Work on this phase is being done exclusively in Bethpage, Mr. Teel said. Contracts for more development are still being negotiated with the Navy, but he expected to finalize one for at least $1.6 billion by midsummer.
For that phase of the program, he said, Northrop Grumman's Bethpage division, the prime contractor, will subcontract with Lockheed Martin in Syracuse and other off-Island companies. But, he said, "Most of the money will come here." Work on the upgrade should completed in the next four years, he said. 
Prominent among other programs involving the Bethpage division is the upgrading of the EA-6B Prowler, a variant of another Grumman aircraft that jams and disrupts enemy radar and communications. In recent months, the Naval Air Systems Command has awarded two contracts totaling $49 million for work on the wing sections of the aircraft. The Bethpage division will share work with Northrop Grumman's St. Augustine, Fla., operation. 
Military budgets actually started rising before the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. But it wasn't until the year after the attacks that Northrop Grumman reported net gains in its local workforce to the Defense Contract Management Agency, which monitors military contractors for the Department of Defense. According to the agency's Boston office, Northrop Grumman's Long Island workforce declined steadily between December 1998 and December 2001, from 4,026 to 2,697 employees. In the next 12 months, however, the company added a reported 150 employees, bringing the total to 2,847. In the next two years, the company expects to add another 500 employees, Mr. Teel said. The increases are significant, although the company's local workforce is still nowhere near its 1986 peak of 26,000. 
At Farmingdale-based Telephonics, "We've gotten lots and lots of inquiries about either accelerating production or increasing quantities of things the military have bought," said Joseph Battaglia, the company's president. In the past year, for example, the Air Force asked Telephonics to speed up delivery of spare parts for its Awacs radar planes. Telephonics cut 5 months off the 13-month delivery schedule, he said. 
Telephonics, a division of Jericho-based Griffon Corporation, has won a number of contracts for military work over the past year. Among the biggest is one with Sikorsky to develop a digital communications system for the Army's UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter modernization program. The contract, which includes options for 1,200 systems plus spares, could be worth $40 million.
While they seek military contracts, Long Island companies are also gearing up to win homeland security contracts. Companies like Telephonics have been preparing to compete for some time. 
In November 2001, Telephonics demonstrated for Mr. Israel and others its advanced all-weather ground surveillance radar system, a low-cost, lightweight adaptation of a technology the company has sold to the military for decades. The system, used in conjunction with cameras, can help detect intruders along borders or around the perimeters of power plants, airports, bridges and other high-value assets.
So far, the system has generated upwards of $20 million in foreign sales, Mr. Battaglia said. One contract is with Israel, a longtime Telephonics customer that has received 60 units in the past 12 months and should get another 65 in the next 12. Another is with Norway, which has received 14 units in the past year and might buy more, Mr. Battaglia said.
Telephonics employs nearly 1,200 people in Farmingdale and Huntington, almost double the total of six years ago. About 150 workers have been hired in the past year. 
Other Long Island contractors are also stepping up their hiring. And with competition for security contracts expected to be fierce, they have been meeting with political leaders, academic consultants and business groups to exchange ideas about how they can work together.
On Monday, Mr. Israel held a meeting in his district office in Hauppauge attended by about 20 officials from military-contracting firms. At the meeting, Dr. Shamash presented preliminary recommendations on how Long Island could create an "industry-based, industry-led organizational infrastructure" that would facilitate local companies' winning security contracts. Among his recommendations are two that have already begun to be put into effect: a shared database of companies' competencies and a demonstration collaborative project. Dr. Shamash said he expected to come up with more detailed recommendations in the next week or two.
After the meeting, Frank. W. Otto, group vice president for North Amityville-based EDO, said it was important that Long Island's major contractors make a concerted effort to show the Island's small subcontractors that, after a long fallow period, work was again becoming available. Mr. Otto said that in the last year his company had won a $1 billion contract from Lockheed Martin to build as many as 3,000 pneumatic weapons delivery systems for the Air Force's Joint Strike Fighter over the next 15 to 20 years, but that it might be difficult to complete the work using Long Island subcontractors alone if the Island's small firms did not make the investment necessary to handle the increased volume of work that lay ahead. 
Mr. Israel said he expected a "political tug of war" over the awarding of contracts. Even so, he felt that in his new position as a member of the Armed Services Committee he would be well positioned to help secure contracts for Long Island companies.
The additional business would not isolate the Island from broader economic forces, experts said. Pearl Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Association, said that in a short war with little United States involvement after hostilities have ended, the benefit to Long Island's military contractors could outweigh any disruption to the local economy, but that "if it's a significantly long war or if we have to pay for a long period of governance after we win said war, you're really increasing the deficit to the point where long-term interest rates could shoot up. This could be very harmful to an economy which is struggling to achieve a sustained recovery."
Thomas Conoscenti, an economist and consultant in Farmingdale, noted that a war in Iraq could push up oil and gas prices, taking a lot of money out of the local economy. The uncertainty alone, he added, could inhibit consumer spending, and that could result in layoffs in the retail sector.
A December poll by RoperASW appeared to support the notion that consumer spending would be affected by a war. In the poll, 34 percent of Americans said a war would have a "major effect" on their "willingness to spend"; another 25 percent said it would have a "minor effect." 
Some upscale retailers on the Island were not overly concerned. Frank Castagna, a partner in the Americana Manhasset, said that while spending at his mall might drop in the first few days of a war, it would likely "not be materially affected" by a war lasting "a moderate period." Even if the war dragged on, he said, the impact might not be significant, assuming that nothing catastrophic occurred on the home front. Spending, he noted, recovered quickly after Sept. 11. "People are getting immune to a lot of things," he said.
But along Tulip Avenue in Floral Park, a more modest shopping area, some shopkeepers were not so sanguine. Talk of war, amid continuing worries about terrorism and the economy, had "already put a damper on people's activities," said Madelaine Aliano, owner of Mady's Attic, which sells antiques and gifts. "There's sadness and apprehension. People are focusing on things other than spending."
But down the street at Estates Hardware, Howard J. D'Amico,the owner, said business had not been hurt. In fact, he added, business might improve during a war if people decided to save money by making home repairs themselves.
And at Jameson's Bar and Grill, the war on terror had already fostered camaraderie among patrons, said the manager, Thomas Violagis. If the United States invaded Iraq, he said, it was not a stretch to say that bar business could pick up. "We have a couple of Vietnam vets who have gotten pumped up about the situation, from 9/11 forward," he said. "War brings people closer together."
Mr. Israel said the Island's businesses should not focus on a war with Iraq. "Al Qaeda is not going away quickly," he said. "As long as you have a teenager who's willing to strap a suicide bomb around his or her torso, we're going to continue to need to develop technologies to stop those threats. And that ought to be the long-term economic strategy of Long Island."

I feel ambivalent about the fact that some Chinese fulfill their "California dreams" in Orange County, China, a gated community marketed to Chinese elites and entrepreneurs (news article, Feb. 3). 
 Since Deng Xiaoping led the nation toward economic development and growth 25 years ago, China and its people have turned to industrialized nations for capitalism and free-market reforms. This journey of opening gates to, as well as learning science and technology from, Western countries has brought remarkable economic power and wealth to China, not to mention to the elites in your report. 
 I assume, however, that the California dreams go beyond the tangible part of the American lifestyle. Gated communities and privileged schools for offspring, after all, were not in the minds of those who fought for freedom of speech and representative democracy some 14 years ago.

To the Editor:
 The Bush administration's efforts to make life even better for the wealthy would be easier to stomach if they were not coupled with efforts to make life even harder for the poor ("Aid to Poor Faces Tighter Scrutiny," front page, Feb. 5). 
 With projected budget deficits of $307 billion for the fiscal year 2004, increases in military spending and more tax cuts for the wealthy, it is amazing that the administration can say that assistance for the poor is what needs tighter scrutiny. It is hard enough for the poor to live with dignity, yet the administration seems intent on forcing them to jump through ever more hoops to collect their modest benefits.
If some assistance reaches those who may not technically qualify, why not view it as the cost of ensuring economic security for all?

Even as it gazes toward the stars, the space program has broad benefits for those rooted to Earth.

BYLINE:  By Amy Harmon 

 BODY:
SINCE the destruction of the space shuttle Columbia nine days ago, squads of men and women have fanned out across eastern Texas toting state-of-the-art global positioning devices to mark the precise location of fallen tiles, mechanical parts and assorted debris. The devices make their calculations by triangulating with satellites that carry atomic clocks and orbit the Earth at an altitude of 12,000 miles.
 Besides performing a task that could help piece together the cause of the calamity, the searchers with their sophisticated global positioning equipment evoke an almost poignant contrast between the creaky 1970's-era space technology that lies scattered across the Southwest and the decidedly snazzy 21st-century commercial technology that is the space program's direct descendant. 
 "It's really cool that the military put all those satellites up there so we can tie into this and get these positions," said Lee Meeks, a sales manager for Leica Geosystems' United States subsidiary in Norcross, Ga., which usually provides mapping services for counties and is supplying equipment and personnel for the recovery of shuttle debris. "We know within one meter of where we are at any given time with our gear." 
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has come under intense criticism for failing to know much of anything with that kind of accuracy, including what happened to the Columbia. Locked into an expensive, if underfinanced, program developed three decades ago, the agency has essentially been retrofitting and reskinning old technology ever since. Now critics from many corners are calling for a reduction in spending on space, particularly for manned missions.
Meanwhile, many of the technologies that the space program has spawned have taken root and flourished in the commercial world. Among other things, the space program gave rise to the 24 orbiting satellites that make up the Global Positioning System, developed by the United States Air Force as a means of knowing exactly where military troops were at any given time.
Automakers use the system to build devices into car dashboards to enable drivers in many cities around the world to see precisely where they are on a street map displayed on the screen. Car makers also use the virtual wind-tunnel technology developed by NASA to test cars for safety and reliability. The vehicles that emerge are in many ways far more technologically sophisticated than the shuttle itself.
No one argues that potential technology spinoffs are reasons in and of themselves to pour money into NASA. But now, when space technology looks so fragile, may be the time to note some of its often overlooked legacies.
"We're benefiting now from what NASA did 20 years ago and 30 years ago," said Jaron Lanier, a virtual-reality pioneer who developed several technologies for NASA that migrated into commercial devices. "If we stop funding the space program, will we still have the supply pipeline of things that are improving life, or will we be one of those places in the world that feels like the past?"
Twenty years ago, NASA gave Mr. Lanier a contract to help design the first virtual-reality glove, which is supposed to replicate the sensation of touch accurately in a computer-generated environment. Mr. Lanier is now chief scientist of the National Tele-Immersion Initiative, an effort to produce a new generation of Internet technology to provide a physically immersive experience for users. The group is sponsored by the National Science Foundation. Before taking that post, Mr. Lanier parlayed his virtual-reality work into a company called VPL Research, later purchased by Sun Microsystems, which sold gloves and head-mounted displays for entertainment systems. He has also been a consultant for the development of surgical applications for the technology.
Another fruit of the space program is satellite television, made possible by geostationary communications satellites that hover 22,000 miles up, some of which were hauled part of the way into space by the shuttle before using their own propulsion systems to complete the journey. Iridium, a company that eventuallywent bankrupt, launched orbiting satellites only 400 miles up that still enable people to use wireless phones in places like Afghanistan without needing conventional cellular towers on the ground.
Various plastics, environmental technologies like solar cells, biomedical sensors used by emergency medical technicians, sound-enhancing circuit cards in PC's and the very idea of computer chips have roots in the space program.
"The government doesn't patent these things," noted Arthur Molella, director of the Smithsonian Institute's Lemelson Center for the Study of Invention and Innovation. "What the space program or military research programs allow you to do is nurture these technologies, and there's no question that corporate interests benefit from that. The space program itself doesn't seem to be advancing, but the technologies are taking off outside."
The biggest technological legacy of the space program may be reliable electronics. In the early 1960's, when President John F. Kennedy declared a space race with the Russians, electronics were notoriously capricious. The needs of the Apollo program, historians of technology say, speeded up the early stages of the semiconductor industry by perhaps 10 years.
Soon after the first moon landing, though, Congress began to cut the financing for the space program.
The space program still spawns technologies that make their way into everyday life. The Mars Pathfinder mission, which featured a remote rover that took pictures and explored the planet's surface in 1997, sparked a flurry of activity in robotics.
But the space program's budget, in inflation-adjusted dollars, is a small fraction of what it was during the race to the moon, so, to a much larger extent, the agency draws on technology designed by the marketplace and adapts it to its own ends. Critics say that is a backward flow for technology -- that it is the indirect spinoffs of ambitious government projects that provide the greater public benefit. That is why they say the space program should not be curtailed, or confined to a 1970's field of vision, but should once again train its sights on the future.
"The government does things that cannot be done by the marketplace," said Paul Saffo, a director of the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park, Calif. "And one is to capture the imagination, to give us something we can aspire to. It is the single most important thing."

Scientists of Very Small Draw Disciplines Together

BYLINE:  By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 7 

 BODY:
Nanotechnology, biotechnology, electronics and brain research are converging into a new field of science vital to the nation's security and economic clout.
 Or so say influential research agenda-setters like the National Science Foundation, along with a loose-knit group of government, academic and industry researchers who are trying to accelerate the convergence process. 
 "Leading scientists are stepping forward and saying, 'We don't have departments organized for this, but this is what's hot,' " said Philip J. Keukes, chief architect for quantum science research at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories.
Mr. Keukes was speaking at the closing session of a three-day meeting here that attracted a wide range of researchers interested in the convergence, as well as a smattering of investors, analysts and representatives of groups primarily concerned about possible negative consequences. 
The organizers believe that there are potentially large benefits to nanotechnology, which focuses on materials and processes with dimensions so small they are affected by the behavior of individual atoms and molecules. But they say the greatest opportunities lie in bridging the gaps between the rapidly growing ranks of nanoengineers and researchers in other fields -- professionals who often use such different terms to describe their work that their common interests go unnoticed.
For instance, nanotechnology researchers suspect that the natural world's ability to assemble atoms into complex tissues with very exact specifications may hold the key to making vast quantities of minute, inexpensive pollution sensors or solar cells. Bioengineers, on the other hand, are looking to artificial nanostructures as possible drug delivery systems or as scaffolds to help injured organs repair themselves.
Such convergence was given a name late in 2001: NBIC, for nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology and cognitive science. The concept is new enough that researchers have not yet agreed on a pronunciation for the acronym. Some say "EN-bick"; some say "NIB-bick."
But convergence advocates are already laying plans to ask the Bush administration to invest hundreds of millions of dollars a year in a new program to encourage collaborative work in NBIC technologies, according to James Canton, a technology consultant involved in the effort through the National Science Foundation.
"NBIC are the power tools of the 21st century," said Mr. Canton, who is president of the Institute for Global Futures, a technology trends research firm in San Francisco.
Putting the tools together, not just for researchers but in the curriculums of the nation's schools, has become a top priority for Dr. Mihail C. Roco, who heads the National Nanotechnology Initiative, a program created by President Bill Clinton and expanded by President Bush that this year will oversee $780 million in nanotechnology research grants by numerous federal agencies.
"We have an obligation not to get sidetracked," Dr. Roco said in Los Angeles.
The NBIC concept grew from a meeting Dr. Roco convened in 2000 to explore the social implications of nanotechnology research. The field derives its name from the nanometer, which is a billionth of a meter, roughly the length of a line of five hydrogen atoms.
Nanoscale innovations include novelties like tubes of carbon that are far stronger and lighter than steel and tiny light-emitting structures, called quantum dots, that are being used as identification tags in biological research. But because all the activities of living cells are governed by nanoscale interactions of atoms and small molecules, nanotechnology researchers looking for new ways to make and use nanomaterials are increasingly finding their interests overlapping with experts in biotechnology.
Similarly, electronics experts are looking to biotechnology and nanotechnology as they seek innovations that will allow them to construct far smaller and faster computers than today's silicon processors, and to create equally tiny data storage systems and communications devices.
Experts in cognition -- which includes the way the brain processes the sensory data it receives from the nervous system and from proteins or other compounds in the blood -- have also been invited into the fold. Their inclusion has focused the NBIC on technology applications that could improve human health or even advance human performance in areas like memory, mood control or the ability to communicate with machines.
A number of speakers emphasized the educational and organizational changes needed for success.
"Convergence is about setting up the right social system so that advances in one area rapidly move into others," said James C. Spohrer, an executive at I.B.M.'s research center in Almaden, Calif., who recently became head of a new group there focused on innovations to support the 170,000 consultants and technicians in I.B.M.'s Global Services unit. "The nano is hard, the biology is hard, the cognitive stuff is hard," he said, "but a new science of putting it together is really hard."
The group also wrestled with how to broaden discussion to include input from potential critics. Dr. Roco said that another meeting focused on social implications would be held next year and that I.B.M. would probably join with the National Science Foundation to hold a meeting on the business implications next fall.

Unscrupulous advertisers are said to outbid reputable merchants for top billings in online searches.

BYLINE:  By Bob Tedeschi 

 BODY:
TOP online merchants have advertised extensively on search sites like Google, Yahoo, MSN and AOL, buying their way to prominence. But analysts and executives say that reputable advertisers increasingly find themselves outbid for top search listings by unscrupulous and perhaps fraudulent e-tailers.
 Executives for the search services say they weed out the bad actors when they are made aware of them, but critics say the search sites are not aggressive enough. 
 "Search engines make money off of the bad boys," said Carrie A. Johnson, a retail analyst with Forrester Research, a technology consulting firm. Retailers with more established reputations "get mad at the search engines for letting this go on," Ms. Johnson said, "but frankly, Google and Overture have almost no incentive to do anything about it." Google and Overture are the leading providers of search technology for their own and others' Web sites. 
The situation is most common in consumer electronics, industry executives said. Consider the example of the Canon ZR50MC camcorder, one of the best-selling items on the Web last week, according to BizRate, the shopping comparison firm.
On Google, the top paid listing that appeared above the search results for that camcorder was for the site of Broadway Photo (www.bwayphoto.com). Broadway Photo sells photography goods on the so-called gray market -- in which merchants import goods into the United States without the consent of the trademark holder. The sale of gray market goods is generally legal, but products may not come with warranties or may differ from those sold by authorized dealers.
Broadway has been dropped from the shopping comparison site PriceGrabber.com because of poor customer reviews, and has earned poor ratings from thousands of customers on BizRate.com. Among other reported shortcomings, the site has been accused of attracting customer orders with low advertised prices, then charging more for the items. (In an interview, a company representative denied such accusations.) 
Overture dropped Broadway Photo from its listings in December, amid concerns that the site provided "a poor, and possibly fraudulent, user experience," according to Overture's editor in chief, Dana Baker. 
Yet last week on Overture, which provides search results for MSN, Yahoo and others, the second listing in the results for the Canon camcorder was for CameraTopia, which has been cited by customers as a seller of gray market goods. CameraTopia, also dropped by PriceGrabber, has drawn almost universally bad reviews in BizRate surveys.
CameraTopia's supervisor of customer service, Adam Rose, disputed the contention among customers that his company's sales representatives engaged in bait-and-switch tactics. Mr. Rose did not respond to a later request for comment about whether the site sells gray market goods. 
The top listing on Overture's search results for the camcorder belonged to A&M Photo World (www.amphotoworld.com), which "shares some aspects of management" with Broadway Photo and operates at least some of its business from the same offices in Brooklyn, according to Mark Sanders, A&M's general manager.
Last Thursday, in response to a reporter's inquiry, Overture said it planned to look into CameraTopia's business practices. Jim Olson, a spokesman, said Overture had already been planning to drop A&M Photo from its listings because "we had received other complaints about them." He added, "We think this shows our system is extremely proactive, and works in the best interest of customers and advertisers."
Ms. Baker, Overture's editor in chief, said screening advertisers for ethics was difficult. "We have nine million listings, and we're very focused on making sure we provide a high-quality product," she said. "We're doing everything we can to stay ahead of that." 
The screening process relies heavily on comments from other advertisers, "who always call to tattle on the other site," Ms. Baker said, adding, "We wouldn't be able to find it all by ourselves, so we really rely on that information." 
Once alerted to a problem, Ms. Baker said, the company takes steps like checking with its customer service representatives to see if customers have complained to the search site. Overture also looks at other ratings sites for more feedback. 
If the news is grim, Ms. Baker convenes a team of managers to decide whether the potential harm to consumers is enough to drop the advertiser. Legal issues are also considered, she said, as is the financial impact of dropping a site. 
A Google spokesman declined to say whether the company had ever dropped advertisers for bad behavior. Nor would the company disclose details about how it evaluates advertisers. In a statement, the company said it would "diligently enforce" violations of its advertising terms and conditions. Among other things, those terms bar advertisers from engaging in any "illegal or fraudulent business practice under the laws of any state or country where the ad is displayed."
Ms. Johnson, of Forrester, remains skeptical. "You can't rely on the search sites to be the watchdogs," she said. "It's like having the robber mind the store. Why would they send up a red flag if the sites they're flagging are paying the most?" 
Online merchants with solid reputations have also struggled with this problem. They include Crutchfield.com, an electronics retailer that BizRate named one of the top 20 e-tailers of the holiday season. 
Several times last week, when users looked for a Sony Handycam DCR-TRV27, Crutchfield ranked second -- behind Broadway Photo -- on Google's paid search listings. "It hurts," said Alan Rimm-Kaufman, the vice president for marketing at Crutchfield. "Hopefully, when people follow the link they'll get a sense of the site, then come to us." 
Companies like Broadway Photo "certainly change the pricing" on search engines, Mr. Rimm-Kaufman said. Those sites bid aggressively to secure the top advertising placement when consumers type in specific search terms, he said. 
And the prices they bid are sometimes far higher than what more well-known merchants will pay. For instance, on Overture, A&M Photo World paid 50 cents each time a consumer clicked on its link at the top of the page, while searching for the Canon camcorder. The next highest bid for that search term was 6 cents, from NexTag.com, a comparison shopping site that has won plaudits from publications like Forbes and PC Magazine. 
Mr. Sanders, from A&M Photo World, suggested that any poor ratings his site or Broadway Photo collected were mostly the result of "competitors trying to bash us," and he said the shopping comparison sites that rate his business "are very, very unfair, because they don't give us a chance to give our side of the story."
At least in theory, there would be an economic incentive for the shopping comparison sites to help push the less reputable sellers from the search engines. For many valuable search terms -- like those related to hot-selling items, words like "camcorder" or "Canon digital camera" -- the shopping comparison sites, which make money through referrals, are the next highest bidders after the gray-market sellers.
But whatever the motivations for casting the gray-market retailers in a bad light, Chuck Davis, the chief executive of BizRate, said that his company's ratings were statistically sound. The data are gleaned from an average of 16,000 surveys per merchant, including surveys BizRate seeks from a panel of 600,000 shoppers, Mr. Davis said. Such methods, he said, ensure that neither competitors nor the merchants themselves sway the results with false reviews. "We rate no one," Mr. Davis said. "Buyers rate." 
More troubling than the name-calling among competitors are the implications for consumers, said Ms. Johnson of Forrester. "The absolute worst-case scenario is that someone hits the search engine and doesn't realize one of these sites isn't an upstanding merchant," she said. "On the search engines, consumers can't tell these links apart."

HEADLINE: Rising Costs Alter Rules For Shows On Tour 

BYLINE:  By JESSE McKINLEY 

 BODY:
The news last week that the national tour of the Broadway production "Oklahoma!" would be cast with nonunion actors isjust the latest indication of what union officials and producers alike say is the changing economic landscape on the road. 
 Producers say that costs are rising so fast that it is increasingly difficult to make a profit mounting a union tour at full rates, known as a first-class professional tour. In the case of "Oklahoma!," for example, the Broadway producer Cameron Mackintosh dropped his attempt to take out a tour of his show after he was unable to get salary concessions from Actors Equity, the actors' and stage managers' union. The rights were then handed off to Networks Presentations, a producing company that will take out the show on a much cheaper, nonunion contract. 
 Union officials, meanwhile, charge that producers are reluctant to open their books and are padding their budgets by adding expensive fees, paid to the producers themselves, for everything from booking the show to copying the script, and then asking the actors to cut their own rates. 
"There's been an enormous increase in the last 5 or 10 years in these kinds of fees," said Alan Eisenberg, the executive director of Equity. "And they always come to us first for cuts."
In between the union and the producers are the road presenters themselves, theater owners and managers from Spokane, Wash., to Miami, who are increasingly having to choose between loyalty to Equity and the bottom line.
"We would prefer to book Equity productions," said Randy Weeks, the executive director of Denver Center Attractions, which books two large theaters in Denver. "But they often do not address the economic reality of this world."
Mr. Weeks was one of the road presenters who booked last year's non-Equity tour of "The Music Man," a production that was tens of thousands of dollars cheaper to book than any Equity tour. Road presenters typically pay a guarantee to the producer of the tour and then take a percentage of the profit after their expenses -- including marketing, stage hands, utilities and taxes -- are covered.
"The Music Man" tour, produced by Big League Theatricals, prompted calls for a boycott by Equity and picket lines in front of theaters, a tactic the union is saying it will use with the "Oklahoma!" tour as well. But for Mr. Weeks it all comes down to cost, expenses that are inevitably passed onto the consumer. 
"Everything is more expensive, for us and the audience," Mr. Weeks said. "What I fear is that we'll eventually have to charge $100, and people will say, 'Well, I'm just going to buy more DVD's and stay home.' "
Like theatergoers in New York, who have seen the top regular ticket for a musical go to $100, audiences in big cities like Denver, Los Angeles and Chicago have also seen their ticket prices rise, with musicals regularly charging $75 a seat.
Mr. Eisenberg said his union was also concerned about rising ticket prices and touring costs and had been increasingly willing to offer concessions to allow Equity actors to go on the road in so-called special-arrangement tours, which have lower rates. Several current tours, including "Seussical" and "Saturday Night Fever," are operating under these agreements. This, however, can sometimes backfire on union leaders, as in the case of the revival of "42nd Street," which Equity allowed to go out on its first national tour under a special-agreement deal last year that was subsequently criticized by many members for allowing too many concessions. 
"In retrospect I think the cuts were too deep," Mr. Eisenberg said. "The first national tour is a particularly sensitive topic."
One of the traditional appeals of road productions is that they have a far greater potential profit margin because theaters on the road tend to be much larger than Broadway houses, with upwards of 4,000 seats in some markets. (Broadway's largest theater, the Gershwin, seats only 1,933.)
Still, presenters say that since the advent of tours for blockbuster musicals like "The Phantom of the Opera" (1988) and "Miss Saigon" (1991), both produced by Mr. Mackintosh, they have been dealing with an increasingly savvy and choosy ticket-buying audience.
"I think when Cameron Mackintosh put out 'Cats' and 'Phantom' and 'Les Miz,' he really gave audiences a big bang for their buck," said Scott Zeiger, chief executive of the North American Theatrical division of Clear Channel Communications, which produces on Broadway and the road. "These are sophisticated shows with high-priced talent, and people have come to expect that."
Road presenters and producers have also always had a certain amount of security in the form of subscription sales, in which audiences buy a season-long ticket, guaranteeing income up front. But even that security is being eroded, as shows sit in cities for longer runs, making more seats available.
"It used to be that if a big show, say 'Phantom,' was coming to town, people figured it was necessary to subscribe to get tickets," Mr. Weeks said. "Now that they know they show will be around for a while, they won't subscribe."
The touring market still generates more gross income than Broadway, which bought in some $643 million last season, and recent blockbuster musicals like "The Producers" and "Hairspray" have been enormous hits on the road. But, say presenters, you cannot have a blockbuster in your theater every night.
"When you subtract out the blockbusters, the reality is very tough," said Mike Isaacson, vice president for the 4,000-seat Fox Theater in St. Louis. Like his colleagues on the road, Mr. Isaacson suggests that Equity will have to be more and more willing to allow shows that are not enormous, storm-the-stage hits -- like "Oklahoma!," which did not recoup its investment on Broadway -- to go out at lesser rates. Otherwise, he said, non-Equity tours will only become more common. 
"I think the question we're asking Equity is that we have this new economic reality on the road, and we need to talk about it with everything that's not a blockbuster," he said. "Because if we can't live off bread-and-butter musicals, it could get very nasty out there."

HEADLINE: A Crush Of Applicants 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT; E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Huge, unexplained traffic jams began building up on the North Side of Chicago last Tuesday morning. Drivers struggled for half an hour or more to travel just four blocks. The police had to close entrance and exit ramps at a couple of spots along Lake Shore Drive. Baffled officers raised their arms in frustration as motorists demanded to know what was going on.
 The traffic crush was caused by people desperate for jobs. Rumors that job applications for a Ford assembly plant would be accepted at a community college had swept through several of the city's neighborhoods. Chicagoans by the thousands responded, turning out in bitterly cold weather for a shot at gainful employment. 
 The first arrivals showed up well before dawn. By 7 a.m. more than 2,000 people had lined up outside Truman College, and the hopefuls kept coming throughout the morning. They shivered, and tears from the cold ran down some of their faces. It was like a scene out of the Depression.
The rumors were false. No job applications were being accepted. City officials said an "orientation" session was being held at the college to identify candidates who might be qualified for relatively low-paying jobs that might materialize in the distant future -- next year, maybe -- at a supplier of parts for Ford.
This is what the jobs picture is like in the U.S. in 2003. And no one thinks it will get much better soon.
A front-page headline in The New York Times last Thursday said, "Hiring in Nation Hits Worst Slump in Nearly 20 Years." Two million jobs have vanished in the last two years. 
Joblessness is right up there with war and terror as an ingredient contributing to the high national anxiety. If you want to see desperation close up, look at the eyes of the increasing numbers of breadwinners who can't find work.
As Tuesday's fiasco in Chicago demonstrated, the situation is much worse than official unemployment statistics would indicate. The government reported on Friday that the jobless rate had slipped to 5.7 percent in January, but few economists believed that was the beginning of any substantial improvement.
The official jobless figures are deceptive because they don't count people who have stopped looking for work. The ranks of these so-called discouraged workers have grown by more than a million since last summer.
Another enormously difficult problem is the hard core of jobless, undereducated young people, ages 16 to 24, who are roaming the streets with nothing constructive to do. There are 5.5 million of these out-of-school, out-of-work youngsters, and that number is growing.
If the Bush administration has any real plans for dealing with the nation's employment problems, it is keeping them very carefully concealed. The president insists he's concerned and said again on Friday, "We will not be satisfied until this economy grows fast enough to employ every man and woman who seeks a job."
He's got a long way to go, and his only proposed remedy -- ever more tax cuts for the wealthy -- is not likely to get him there. 
A particularly disturbing aspect of this so-called jobless recovery is that many of the people who are out of work are staying out longer. Nearly two million of the officially counted unemployed have been out of work for six months or more. That group is now three times larger than it was two years ago.
Many of those fortunate enough to be working are struggling nevertheless. Raises are fewer and skimpier, barely keeping pace with inflation. More and more young college graduates are accepting jobs that used to be handled by people with just a high school diploma, waiting tables or working as clerks or construction laborers.
Dr. Andrew Sum of the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University in Boston mentioned the phenomenon of "queuing down." As workers are forced to take jobs beneath their qualifications they displace members of the group immediately below them. "Older adults looking for jobs are bumping the younger kids down," he said. "The college kids are bumping down the kids who graduated high school. And the kids from high school are bumping out the kids with no diploma."
The U.S. cannot afford to ignore this problem. Even as the Bush administration continues with its plans for war with Iraq, last Tuesday's traffic jams in Chicago should be read as a cry for help here at home.

PERSON: John Westergaard 

HEADLINE: John Westergaard, 72, Dies; Founder of Mutual Fund 

BYLINE:  By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH 

 BODY:
John Westergaard, a stock picker who built his career on the belief that small companies could richly reward investors who went looking for them, died on Jan. 31 at Calvary Hospice in the Bronx. He was 72.
 The cause was prostate cancer, said his son, Emile Westergaard. 
 In addition to spending more than 40 years prospecting for undiscovered small company stocks, Mr. Westergaard served as treasurer for Daniel Patrick Moynihan from the earliest days of his political career through four Senate campaigns. 
Mr. Westergaard started on Wall Street as an analyst for Standard & Poor's, the securities rating service, but in 1960 he opened a research firm with a friend, William Prime. Their company, Equity Research Associates, offered analytical services to small brokerage firms that could not afford research departments. 
The financial services industry was not consolidated then as it is today, and with hundreds of firms vying for business, few could afford to assign an analyst to researching small companies full time.
Equity Research Associates was eventually acquired by Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company, a brokerage firm. 
In the 1980's, Mr. Westergaard founded the Westergaard Fund, a mutual fund that tried to carry out his ideas about finding emerging companies and investing shareholders' money in them. But the results were disappointing. Stocks of small companies generally lagged the market during the bull market of the early and mid-1980's, then crashed harder than the rest of the market in October 1987. Mr. Westergaard closed the fund that November.
He continued to publish research, however, first mailing his newsletter to subscribers, and later faxing it. His descriptions of small companies were still able to move stock prices and trading volume.
As Mr. Westergaard's publishing business grew, he eventually took it to the Internet, starting a Web site devoted to small company stocks. He also was the host of an investment radio show, "Johnny Dotcom's Journal," where he interviewed executives of fledgling companies, and he offered a service to companies in which he tried to monitor electronic rumor mongers and to counteract the stories they spread.
Blending these various lines of work proved problematic. In 1997, Mr. Westergaard wound up in a heated online battle with a mysterious chat room visitor called Pluvia, who was leaving negative electronic postings about a financially troubled company Mr. Westergaard represented, Premier Laser.
Mr. Westergaard posted a $5,000 reward for Pluvia's identity, touching off an online debate about free speech, the right to remain anonymous, and the propriety of Mr. Westergaard's strategy, which called for companies to pay him fees for disseminating information about their prospects.
This came to the attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which in 2000 filed civil fraud charges against Mr. Westergaard. The S.E.C. said that Mr. Westergaard ought to have made it more clear to his readers that the companies he was writing about were paying him. The complaint was one of many that the agency filed against online stock tipsters, but it stood out because of the way Mr. Westergaard chose to fight it. 
Instead of agreeing to a fine or temporary suspension, Mr. Westergaard wrote a letter to Arthur Levitt, chairman of the S.E.C. at the time, saying that he was terminally ill with cancer and that the S.E.C. had ruined him. Word that the agency was investigating his business had leaked as he was about to enter a financing round, Mr. Westergaard said, and the scrutiny had scared potential lenders away. He had had to lay off his research staff and close the business, he said, and because he held 47 percent of the equity, he was destitute. 
Amid the publicity that followed, a former United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, Paul Curran, stepped in and represented Mr. Westergaard for free. The case was settled in October 2001 with the S.E.C. dropping the fraud charges and pursuing only a charge that Mr. Westergaard had violated an anti-touting disclosure provision. Mr. Westergaard neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing, although he said he did not commit fraud. 
A judge said no civil fine was imposed because of Mr. Westergaard's financial condition.
Mr. Westergaard later created a Web site where he hoped other people unhappy about their dealings with the S.E.C. could communicate. 
Mr. Westergaard was born Johannes Westergaard, to immigrants from Norway, and was raised on Long Island. He became interested in Democratic Party politics while studying at Williams College in the early 1950's, and ran unsuccessfully for the New York State Senate. He attracted attention to one campaign issue, the dating of milk containers, by leading a cow through Wall Street.
Later, after meeting Mr. Moynihan at the Samuel J. Tilden Democratic Club, Mr. Westergaard agreed to serve as his campaign treasurer when he ran for New York City Council president. Mr. Moynihan lost that race but the two men remained friends, and in 1976 Mr. Westergaard became treasurer of Mr. Moynihan's first successful Senate race.
In addition to Emile, Mr. Westergaard is survived by three other children, Cathrine and Kermit, owners of the Stinger bar in Brooklyn; and Elizabeth, a musician in California. He is also survived by three grandchildren.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: NUCLEAR EXPERTISE; 
Iran Says It Has Developed Ability to Fuel Nuclear Plants but Won't Seek Weapons

BYLINE:  By NAZILA FATHI 

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Feb. 9 

 BODY:
President Mohammad Khatami said today that Iran was determined to develop nuclear technology, but he reiterated that it would be for peaceful purposes.
 "I assure all peace-loving individuals in the world that Iran's efforts in the field of nuclear technology are focused on civilian application and nothing else," Mr. Khatami said during a meeting with Mostafa Moin, the minister of research, science and technology, and with university professors, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported. "This is the legitimate right of Iranian people." 
 The United States has put increasing pressure on Iran over the issue, accusing Iran of trying to develop nuclear weapons. 
Mr. Khatami said Iran had begun mining uranium near the city of Yazd, in central Iran, and that the country had acquired the knowledge to prepare the ore for use in civilian power plants.
He added that Iran was planning to build two plants -- in the cities of Isfahan, in central Iran, and Kashan, south of Tehran -- for processing the uranium to provide fuel for generating electricity.
Russia has helped Iran to complete a 1,000 megawatt nuclear power plant in the southern city of Bushehr, which is expected to begin operating by the end of 2003.
The United States has raised concerns about the Bushehr power plant and about newly disclosed plans for two other nuclear plants.
An Iranian dissident group, the National Council of Resistance of Iran, said in August that it had learned from sources within Iran about two secret nuclear sites under construction. One, about 25 miles southeast of the city of Kashan, was to be used for nuclear fuel production, the council said. It said the site included two large spaces that are 25 feet underground. A facility meant to produce heavy water was along a river near the central city of Arak, the council said.
Iran has large oil and gas reserves, and the United States argues that Iran has no need to develop nuclear energy.
However, Iran has rejected claims that it is trying to acquire weapons of mass destruction. It contends that nuclear plants are needed to help increase its electricity generation by 6,000 megawatts over the next 20 years.
The State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said in a written answer to a question at a Friday news briefing that the United States believed that "Iran uses Bushehr as a cover and a pretext for obtaining sensitive technologies to advance its nuclear weapons program."
"The recent revelations that Iran has been secretly constructing nuclear-related facilities capable of producing fissile material not needed for Iran's 'peaceful' nuclear energy needs, is but one example of the sustained effort by Iran to cloak the true activities and intentions of its nuclear program," he said.
A Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hamidreza Assefi, denied the accusations and said that Iran's nuclear activities were carried out under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations body that monitors nuclear facilities.
"In spreading their poisonous and disdainful rumors, the United States is trying to militarize international relations to serve its political and economic interests," he said.
The European Union, in talks aimed at strengthening economic ties with Iran, has also put pressure on Iran to sign the energy agency's additional protocol to expand inspections in the country and to require more rigorous declaration of nuclear-related activities.
Chris Patten, the European Union's commissioner for external relations, said last week during a visit to Tehran that Iran was still seeking to acquire nonconventional weapons. He said that openness was vital for arms control.
Although Iran has signed the international treaty on nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, signing "the International Atomic Energy Agency additional protocol would send a most positive message, setting a regional lead and underlining serious international commitment," he said.
Mr. Khatami emphasized that Iran had cooperated with the International Atomic Energy Agency and "welcomed international supervision to dispel the lies being fabricated against Iran."
The director general of the atomic energy agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, is expected to visit Iran on Feb. 25 to inspect sites to make sure they are part of the "civilian fuel cycle."

HEADLINE: Where Scorpions Roam, and Snowbirds Flock 

BYLINE:  By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: QUARTZSITE, Ariz. 

 BODY:
Desert or not, traffic along the busiest one-mile stretch of Main Street here can take half an hour to pass. Motor homes towing pickup trucks choke gas station entrances. Septuagenarians in shorts amble fearlessly between busy intersections. Waits for a table at Silly Al's restaurant stretch to an hour.
 "The thing you have to learn when you come to Quartzsite, you have to learn patience," said Bob Cast, 64, a deli owner. 
 Approached on Interstate 10, Quartzsite unfolds as a surreal sandscape of metal boxes packed side by side in town and scattered like buckshot over thousands of acres of Sonora Desert. 
To nest there with Cinerama sunsets, among scorpions and coyotes, saguaro cactuses and thorny saltcedar bushes, campers pay the federal Bureau of Land Management $25 to park for two weeks and $125 for the six-month season. Nearly all are retirees.
A post-9/11 fear of flying, new concerns about war with Iraq, a surge in baby boomers retiring in their mid-50's, the country's numbing cold this year -- all of these seem to be pushing a human tide into Quartzsite. Two hours west of Phoenix, four hours from Los Angeles, Quartzsite is an old Gold Rush town where the population had dropped to 11 families by the 1950's.
It has since become winter's busiest, slowest-moving and by any known measure biggest destination for refugees with homes on wheels.
Quartzsite might seem like the middle of nowhere, except to travelers who, like turtles, have time to spare and their homes on their backs.
"We're closest to everyplace," Willard Meyer, 71, a snowbird from Lander, Wyo., said. "Yuma, Parker, Lake Havasu and Blythe, Calif. Joshua Tree National Park in California is only 120 miles away."
The number of permanent residents is about 3,000, but in the high season, January and February, 100,000 to 175,000 vehicles carrying twice as many snowbirds are parked here every day. Tourism officials estimate that one million people from the seven million households that the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association in Reston, Va., says own R.V.'s, settle here for at least a few days at some point during winter.
But reliable statistics are hard to come by. Mayor Verlyn Michel says two million people have already come or gone this season, and he predicts a record 2.25 million by spring. "It started in 1964 with camping and rock hounding," or hunting, he said. "Then they got the idea to sell rocks off their pickups. Now we have 77 R.V. parks."
Quartzsite's growth jibes with sales of recreational vehicles. 
Ken Sommer, spokesman for the vehicle association, said that last year the industry sold more than 300,000 vehicles, 20 percent more than in 2001 when the recession slowed sales. "On top of that," Mr. Sommer said, "our experts are predicting a 5 percent gain in 2003." That would be the most in 25 years. 
These snowbirds are largely a patriotic crowd that plants American flags outside vehicles beside folding chairs and all-weather green rugs nailed down with foot-long spikes. Except for the steps into their motor homes, no one need raise a foot to stroll through town. There's little athletic activity, other than hiking, and little for children to do.
"This is a talk-about-the-weather, talk-about-sports, talk-about-your-motor-home type of town," Paul Winer, owner of Main Street's Reader's Oasis bookstore, said. "There's no structure to the town, no association that coordinates it."
But there is some organization. "We have a thriving Senior Singles community, widows and widowers, with dances every night of the week," Mr. Winer said.
Except for their ubiquitous white Nikes, Quartzsite's campers have long passed the peacock season of fashion-alert youth. But whatever the state of their veins, they cling to the diets of youth. Quartzsite's busiest restaurant and bar, Silly Al's, specializes in multiple-topping pizzas and beer. The new McDonald's is bustling.
"Reading glasses is our main thing," said Kitty Shipley, 61, who with her husband, Dick, 62, moved their motor home and sales tent to 46 sites last year and stayed longest in Quartzsite, November to March. Along with gloves and socks, they sell a lot of back scratchers and Jiffy Seats. "It's a cane to walk with," Mrs. Shipley said, "and when you get tired, you open it up and sit down."
Among the many desert encampments is a nudist colony. Two well tanned, rumple-skinned men were scrubbing down an R.V., and a woman was playing catch with a Labrador. The colony is 1,000 feet from and in full view of a community of retired executives from the Antelope Valley in California. 
The 13 couples there have homes costing $100,000 and up. Frank Heard, 61, has a new Windsor with a double-door refrigerator, an electronic toilet and cherry-stained cabinets. "The sticker on it was $271,000," he said. The campers have placed their homes in a circle around a fireplace. They gather there for potluck suppers. 
Rather than hook up to utilities in R.V. parks, desert campers like these use generators and batteries for electricity and propane for cooking. Forming interminable lines, they take water from community spigots and dump sewage at community depots. At some sites they can flag down water wagons and "honey trucks." The honey trucks, circulating among the encampments playing jingles like ice cream trucks, drain away sewage.
Many retiree-campers reside all year on their wheels. When summer comes and temperatures here soar, they bail out for Calgary, Alberta; the Rockies; and the Great Lakes.
"I don't have a house," said Bill Mapes, 76, who worked for the highway department in Nebraska for 43 years. "I got a 36-foot Cruisemaster motor home with a slide-out," a section of wall that can be pushed out to expand a room. "That's a Class A motor home. It's got a 454 Vortec engine in it. It makes about eight miles per gallon going down the road pulling my pickup."
Mr. Mapes's wife, Virginia, operates the Best of Everything Beauty Salon at the Main Event, a 100-acre site of vendors and parking lots, the biggest of three big concentrations of vendors. She can pack up and move in a day.
Quartzsite seethes with rampant, mostly good humored and little regulated entrepreneurship. Six years ago, Mr. Cast left Eugene, Ore., to visit here. For $285,000 he bought four acres with a coin laundry on it just off a corner of the town's biggest intersection. 
"I put in the smoked meat store with a deli and a propane dealership," he said. He planted a double-wide home just behind the shops. "I think we're sitting on a situation where we have the potential to be something big," he said.
From Lynn, Mass., Mr. Winer, the bookseller, is a gray-bearded, long-haired sartorial jolt. Fifty-nine years old, he wears a cowboy hat, suede boots, three turquoise necklaces and a thong. On chillier days, he adds a T-shirt.
He said he and his wife, Joann, started out here 12 years ago in a 10-foot-square tent with three boxes of used books. Today his jerry-built store, big as a small supermarket, carries 80,000 titles, mostly old paperbacks. "We were lucky," he said. "Snowbirds are the reading generation."
More than 2,000 itinerant vendors have set up tents beside their vehicles in Quartzsite. Eight sell R.V.'s. They also sell Polish dogs and Dutch dogs, dug-up blue bottles, aircraft drills and holding tank ventilators for R.V.'s. A sign on one of two barrels in front of one shop advertises, "Quartzsite summer wear" -- men's and women's satiny thongs -- for $1 each. The other holds $1 "winter wear" -- satiny briefs and panties.
From his family's quartz mine near Custer, S.D., Carl Scott has hauled in two 18-wheeler loads near one of Quartzsite's few monuments, a white-painted camel made of automobile wheel rims. For $1 a pound, he sells mostly 2- to 10-pound chunks that customers cut up and polish and sell for many times more back home. He is offering a boulder of rose quartz the size of an old Volkswagen. "I'll sell that for $6,000," he said.
Promoters call the activity swap meets. True swapping is rare, but it happens. "I have a large meteorite I'm trying to interest somebody in," said Bob Kleinschmidt, 72, of San Diego. "It's in the neighborhood of 100 tons. It's in southern Nevada. I staked a claim to it."
With Quartzsite's growth, longtime visitors like Greta Knudsen, 69, and her husband, 70, complain of a decline in the rock hounding and swapping that was its original lure. Full-timers from Brooklyn, the Knudsens have traversed the country 25 times and have come here on vacation and now in retirement for 18 years.
Sunning outside their camper, they looked lonely. The score of rock hunters they once gathered with here have died or moved on. "I used to like it here a lot more," Mrs. Knudsen said. "Now you see a lot of junk. I collect dinosaur bones for my grandchildren. They're a lot more expensive now. You can get a dinosaur tooth for $28. I used to pay $10."

HEADLINE: City Pares Its Summer Job Plan and Draws Ire 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN 

 BODY:
It is an annual fight, New York City's battle to find dollars to pay for its summer youth employment program.
 Each year, well before the season approaches, the Department of Employment sounds the alarm that money is scarce and that thousands of jobs will probably be in jeopardy. 
 But this year,the program appears to be up against more than just its usual fiscal troubles: the program itself has become a problem, some City Council leaders and youth employment groups say.
In an effort to adhere to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's demand that city agencies do more with less, the Department of Employment radically retooled the way it distributes grants to social services groups that hire the youths. 
With a reduced budget of $5.5 million -- just more than a third of what the city budgeted for it last year -- it plans to employ only 5,600 teenagers and young adults this summer, compared with 36,000 last year.
But the way the department has revamped the program, which serves primarily poor youths, has drawn heavy criticism.
As part of the reorganization, the city was carved into eight regions, selecting one contractor for each area instead of the dozens used in the past. Groups competing for contracts this year were asked to take over administrative duties formerly handled by the department's staff and to pair up with at least two smaller organizations with which they would share financing. Under the program, teenagers are paid minimum wage for seven weeks and placed in jobs at public and nonprofit settings.
The agency's hope was that by pairing up contractors and shifting administrative work to them, the city would cut costs but still reach out to a cross section of children. At a City Council hearing on Jan. 31, the city's employment commissioner, Betty B. Wu, declined to address criticism about the overhauled bidding process, saying lawyers had forbidden her to speak about a process that was still under way. 
But Council officials and youth employment groups say the program's new bidding process pits entire neighborhoods against one another, threatening to alienate thousands of children who, while economically eligible, do not live in one of the areas in each region that have been designated high-need, ones in which at least 20 percent of the residents fall below the New York City poverty level. Seventy percent of the youths selected must live in the high-need areas.
"It is galactically stupid the way D.O.E. has set this up," said Lewis A. Fidler, a Brooklyn councilman and chairman of the Youth Services Committee. "It's as clear a plan for failure as I've ever seen."
Part of the problem, Mr. Fidler said, is that bidders had only six weeks to form partnerships with other groups and submit proposals. The department is currently reviewing 31 applications.
"I represent Southern Brooklyn," he said. "And I know for a fact the chances that the Orthodox Jews, the Asians and the Haitians all found each other in a single successful bid are virtually nil. Yet under this process, only one of them might be selected to represent their region. What happens when it's the Asians and none of their partners are Haitians or Orthodox Jews? D.O.E. is going to wind up necessarily excluding entire neighborhoods and groups of kids from the summer youth program."
Others say the formula the department used to determine how many jobs would be distributed to each borough has proved equally problematic. They say that a child living in a family with income below the poverty level but not in a designated high-need area will have fewer chances of finding employment.
"This is a disaster waiting to happen," said Helen Diane Foster, a Bronx councilwoman. "It's hard enough to find the money for these jobs. Now D.O.E. is pitting poor kids and against poor kids." 
Previously, the city conducted interviews for the program and handled the enrollment and application processing, while the contractors identified eligible applicants.
Of the 5,600 jobs the department is currently proposing financing for, 1,242 are expected to be assigned to two Brooklyn contractors; 1,558 to two contractors in the Bronx; 948 to one Manhattan contractor; 655 to one Queens contractor; and 395 to one contractor in Staten Island. An eighth contractor will be awarded 847 jobs that are to go to children throughout the city.
Mr. Fidler, as the Council's youth services committee chairman, has asked the department to abandon its reorganized program and to work with contractors that have been used in the past. A department spokesman said it was considering the committee's recommendations. 
"If at the last minute the cavalry comes over the hill with something approaching reasonable funding," Mr. Fidler said, "and runner-up bidders are told in late June that they are now in, who could possibly believe they could do what's necessary to hire young people?"
All of the changes have caused worry and frustration among youth employment groups.
Florence Li-Maldonado, assistant executive director for the Chinese American Planning Council, submitted one of the 31 proposals under consideration. She teamed up with 10 smaller groups, primarily African-American and Hispanic ones, hoping to make her contract reach a variety of children and stand out.
"Even if I get a contract, I still have a problem," she said. "The money they want to give for administrative work, $300 per child, is not enough to cover the added work and share with subcontractors. We don't expect 100 percent funding when the city is having budget trouble, but this process is too complicated to make anyone happy."
Kofi Boateng, executive director of the National Puerto Rican Forum in the Tremont section of the Bronx, said he found the process too frustrating even to apply. In the past, his organization has relied on financing from the department to help employ about 300 teenagers each year.
"It is too much of a cutthroat situation now," he said. "Everyone is grandstanding, trying to muscle one another out because the plate is suddenly smaller and the hands trying to eat from it are many."
In the meantime, Mr. Boateng said, he is doing the only thing he can.
"We're beginning to tell the children we're sorry, that they might have to look elsewhere," he said. "What else can we do?"

HEADLINE: An Indicator Of Economy: Empty Seats On Small Bus 

BYLINE:  By DAISY HERNANDEZ 

 BODY:
Mohammed Hamdy considers himself an expert on Manhattan's economy. For 13 years, he has driven a small commuter bus, taking people from New Jersey to work and shop in the city and taking New Yorkers to jobs and malls across the Hudson River. 
 The work was plentiful three years ago, Mr. Hamdy said. He would earn $300 a day, after expenses. But times are tough now. On a recent evening, Mr. Hamdy was bundled up in a thick dark coat as he stood near three empty buses on 42nd Street opposite the Port Authority Bus Terminal. Passengers trickled into one bus. 
 "Now, I make $60, I'm happy," Mr. Hamdy said. "We try to survive. The reality is, we lose. It's not Christmastime." 
Mr. Hamdy's bus, with 25 seats, is one of about a thousand that compete with established private and state bus lines like New Jersey Transit, making their way into Manhattan every weekday via the Lincoln Tunnel or the George Washington Bridge, according to John Dourgarian, a spokesman for the New Jersey Department of Transportation. 
Passengers include white-collar professionals and maintenance workers, and the drivers, like Mr. Hamdy, who is 50, are mostly immigrant men from places like Colombia, Egypt and Peru. They conduct their business in a mixture of Spanish, Arabic and English, and drive buses with either 25 or 33 seats. They charge about 50 cents less per trip than New Jersey Transit, pick up passengers more frequently and sometimes play salsa on the radio. 
The business of these buses, which emerged in the early 80's with the federal deregulation of the transportation industry, evolved alongside a rise in employment in the city and housing in New Jersey, and the daily lives of these drivers gives a clear picture of what the local economy looks like at any given time. 
A typical weekday for drivers begins in New Jersey, in places like Jersey City, Fairview or Paterson. In Fairview, drivers sometimes show up at 2 a.m. to add their names to a dispatcher's list and get a better chance at picking up a sizable chunk of the morning-rush commuters. They drop off passengers at the 42nd Street lot opposite the Port Authority terminal.
By 10 a.m., drivers know how busy they will be for the day. The more commuters they bring to Manhattan, the more they will take home later. By 4 p.m., the drivers are lined up on 42nd Street, waiting. They do not leave until every seat is filled, which can often take more than half an hour outside of peak travel times. 
"It's hard to fill a bus," said Harold Caicedo, a dispatcher at 42nd Street. "Now it's every 15 minutes. Before it was every five minutes."
On Boulevard East, a windy road on the Palisades cliffs in New Jersey, the situation is worse. After the morning rush is over, it can take two hours to fill up a bus. These days, buses frequently come to the city with empty seats. With fewer passengers, it is harder for these drivers to pay their bills. 
While some drivers own their buses, most get their commercial driver's licenses and pay $150 to $250 a day for a bus rental and insurance from one of a half-dozen companies in New Jersey. These companies pay a one-time federal fee of $300 for the right to pick up passengers and go across state lines; the regulating authority, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, also requires the buses to undergo safety inspections twice a year. 
A driver earns money by finding enough passengers to pay for the rental, tolls, gas and occasional parking ticket. Passengers pay $1.75 to $4 each way, depending on where they are picked up, and a full 25-seat bus can bring in $44 to $100 in gross revenue with one trip. Drivers on Boulevard East say they used to cover their costs with five trips to the city, earning close to $300. Now they often make only three trips. So they work longer hours.
Samer Awawdeh, 23, a Palestinian immigrant who has been driving buses for four years, works from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m., sometimes six days a week. But it is not enough. He lives in Washington Heights with his wife and two toddlers and supports his mother and relatives in the West Bank.
"After I pay the rent, the toll, I sometimes make $40," he said. 
The economic situation is not better for their passengers. Mr. Caicedo, who has worked as a driver and is now a dispatcher, said he has seen former passengers in West New York, N.J., where he lives. "I ask them why they don't come and they say, 'No, I lost my job,' " Mr. Caicedo said. Sometimes they tell him that they are tired of the city. Other times, they say they have found jobs in New Jersey.
On a typical morning, a dozen small buses crawl along Boulevard East in New Jersey in search of city commuters. They compete with New Jersey Transit buses that also run this route through Hudson County into Manhattan and use the same bus stops. 
While some commuters are strictly New Jersey Transit riders and others are loyal small-bus passengers, a sizable number of them, especially on cold winter mornings, will board the first bus that shows up. So the trick is to be there first. With citizens' band radios and cellphones, drivers on the small commuter buses let one another know when one of them might lose a passenger to a "shark" or a "horse," as they call the New Jersey Transit buses, which can carry twice as many commuters as a small bus.
On a recent Saturday morning, the CB radio in Mr. Awawdeh's bus crackled with warnings in Spanish, Arabic and English: "Run! Run! The horse is behind me."
Kenneth Hitchner, a spokesman for New Jersey Transit, said that there were enough passengers needing service into the city and that the company, which offers riders monthly passes and makes about 20,000 trips every weekday to the Port Authority Bus Terminal, did not feel the rivalry with the small commuter buses. "They're filling a need," Mr. Hitchner said. "New Jersey Transit just can't do it alone."
Drivers like Mr. Awawdeh said they wished they had some of New Jersey Transit's perks during these hard economic times, like state and federal subsidies, or parking inside the new and improved Port Authority terminal, which offers commuters fast-food outlets and warm waiting areas on chilly evenings. Instead, these drivers wait in the cold on 42nd Street and compete by charging less and offering more frequent and late-night service. They charge $1.75 for a trip to Weehawken, N.J., that costs $2.10 on New Jersey Transit, and after midnight on Friday, when the big buses are leaving every hour, the small commuter buses take the tired bar-hopping crowd home every half-hour.
Competition for passengers, however, is not limited to road battles with New Jersey Transit. Those who have driven small commuter buses for years say they work with a shaky code of respect that only deteriorates during tough times. Some drivers cut off other small buses to reach passengers first, regardless of personal friendships.
"This job is like the lizard that changes its color," Mr. Awawdeh said. "One day you're friends. Then you're enemies." 
It is stressful, he said, and the freezing temperatures this winter have not helped. In this business, weather is often a measure of passengers and revenue. Mr. Awawdeh was hoping for a warm winter.
"If it's cold, it's less people," he said. "In the cold, people take their cars."

HEADLINE: Grand Vision For Remaking The West Side 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Where some people see the far West Side of Manhattan as a low-slung district of tenements, small shops, warehouses and parking lots, the Bloomberg administration envisions a neighborhood transformed.
 Tonight at the Jacob Javits Convention Center, city officials plan to publicly unveil an ambitious proposal to redevelop the area between Eighth Avenue and the Hudson River, from 28th Street to 42nd Street. 
 The plan, which would require billions of dollars in public investment, calls for a $1.5 billion subway extension, new office towers along 11th Avenue, opposite a greatly expanded convention center, and a commercial corridor stretching from Madison Square Garden on Seventh Avenue west to the Hudson River, between 30th and 34th Streets. A new boulevard with a tree-filled center median -- similar to Park Avenue -- would be built between 10th and 11th Avenues and run from 38th to 34th Street to help ease traffic congestion between office skyscrapers to the west and new apartment buildings to the east.
There would be a waterfront esplanade, ferry terminals at 38th and 34th Streets, hotels and residential buildings along 10th Avenue and small parks throughout the district, which now has few such amenities. 
Some elements, like a $1.2 billion stadium over the West Side rail yards, have already generated resistance from local residents, business executives and politicians.
But the deputy mayor for economic development, Daniel L. Doctoroff, argues that the transformation of the West Side over the next several decades is critical to the city's future growth. If companies that are pressed for space in other areas of the city cannot expand when the economy rebounds, he said, their jobs will go to the suburbs in New Jersey and Connecticut. Many proposed public investments would also provide the foundation for Mr. Doctoroff's bid to bring the 2012 Summer Olympics to New York, though he says the plans are not dependent on New York's being chosen as the site of the Games.
"The West Side presents the best opportunity for the city to invest in its future and grow," Mr. Doctoroff said in an interview. "Our highest priority is to create jobs for people, to develop businesses and to provide places for people to live. There has not been a time in the city's history when relatively virgin areas did not grow and develop after the extension of mass transit and public investments. This is the best return on our investment we can get."
Development in the area has been hobbled, he said, by outdated manufacturing zoning and a lack of public transportation. To catalyze the vast development envisioned, the Bloomberg administration would overhaul the zoning and together with the state extend the No. 7 subway line from Times Square to 34th Street, where plans call for the establishment of a transit hub that would link the Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North and the subways and would be several blocks west of Pennsylvania Station.
Plans also call for a $1 billion public investment to double the size of the convention center, to approximately 1.6 million square feet, by expanding it northward and linking it to the new stadium to the south, over the rail yards.
The planned Farley post office project would provide the link between the current site of Madison Square Garden and the stadium, which is proposed for a massive deck that would be built over the rail yards.
These projects, city officials said, would spur the private development of roughly 28 million square feet of office towers and thousands of apartments.
"This is an area where the public sector can make an investment," Mr. Doctoroff said, "and have it returned many times with new jobs and new businesses that generate an enormous amount of tax revenue."
The administration likens the potential effect of its proposal to how the construction of Grand Central Terminal in the late 1800's on a one-time rail yard and the sale of development rights over the tracks heading north sparked the development of the city's premier business district, along Madison, Park and Lexington Avenues.
But critics have questioned whether the city even needs a stadium and another business district, as well as how much commercial development such a district would generate. 
Because the proposal is subject to the city's land-use review process and approval by the City Council, and because state assistance would be needed to expand the convention center and extend the subway line, the Bloomberg administration is waging an intensive campaign for official and public support as it also faces huge budget deficits and a recession.
City officials have been meeting privately with hotel and real estate executives, and officials from the hotel construction and restaurant unions, in an effort to sell what the city is calling the Hudson Yards Master Plan, to evoke the image of change coming to the rail yards rather than the entire neighborhood. And the word stadium has been banished in favor of "multi-use facility."
Not everyone is impressed.
"They've gone through a bunch of euphemisms," said Simone Sindin, the chairwoman of Community Board 4, which covers the West Side. "They've been instructed to drop the word stadium from their lips. I call it the 900-pound gorilla in the room."
The stadium, which would be built as an Olympic stadium and a home for the New York Jets football team, is the lightning rod for opposition to the plan, be it from local residents fearing the destruction of working-class housing in favor of tall towers, or Broadway theater operators who are worried that further traffic congestion will discourage patrons from coming to Times Square.
One opponent, State Senator Thomas K. Duane, has called for a "movement like the one that stopped Westway," a reference to a successful 10-year campaign against a $4 billion federal landfill and highway project along the Hudson River from the Battery to 59th Street. And John Fisher, a founder of the Clinton Special District Coalition, has organized a Web site for the opposition, www.kitchen@hellskitchen.net.
Ms. Sindin complimented the City Planning Department for meeting with community leaders and incorporating some of their recommendations. But she has not been won over.
"One of the positives I see is that they're planning for a great swath of green to run southwest across the district," she said. "They've also added housing on the side streets between Ninth and 10th Avenues. But they're still married to the esplanade of skyscrapers along 11th Avenue. What does not impress me is the stadium. It doesn't belong here."
A business executive who is active in civic affairs and generally supports the West Side planning effort also questioned the wisdom of building a stadium there. "We should be planning for future growth in an orderly manner so that when the time for expansion comes we're not caught flat-footed," said the executive, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity because he often deals with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. "But I think the stadium would be better elsewhere, like in Queens."
While the Jets have told the city they would be willing to finance much of the cost of a domed stadium, which could replace Madison Square Garden, taxpayers would still have to pay for the $250 million deck on which the stadium would be built.
Jonathan Bowles, research director of the Center for an Urban Future, a nonprofit urban planning group, says he doubts that the billions of dollars worth of infrastructure projects will spark the 30 million square feet of commercial development the Bloomberg administration foresees over the next 30 years.
"Their plans look great, with all the parks and esplanades," Mr. Bowles said. "But this is about office development. Economists see very little growth in the financial industry. If Wall Street isn't going to grow, will there be enough jobs created in the service sector?"
Mr. Doctoroff said the city's projections are based on a study of the historic growth of office buildings, hotels, retail and housing in the city by Cushman & Wakefield, a real estate firm, and Economics Research Associates, a consulting firm. He said that based on very conservative assumptions, the city estimates that from about 2010 through 2040 New York will need an additional one million square feet of commercial space and roughly 400 apartments each year on the West Side.
The city's plan estimates that the stadium would be completed in 2009 and the convention center in 2010, which alarms the hotel industry because it is far in the future. 
"The industry is still focused on the Javits expansion as something that could be started almost immediately," said Jonathan M. Tisch, chairman of Loews Hotels and the city's convention and visitors bureau. "It might take a couple of years to build, but it would send a message to booking groups that New York City is serious."
Mr. Doctoroff has long said that the public investments would be recouped by the sale of development rights and new tax revenues from rising real estate values within the district, a phenomenon known as tax increment financing, or TIF. The redevelopment area would be the largest so-called TIF district in the country, but state officials have expressed some doubts about the marketing of bonds based on revenues expected from taxes based on increased property values. In any event, such revenues would not cover the $1 billion cost of expanding the convention center.
City and state officials have talked to hotel and tourism-related industries about a dedicated tax, say $1 per hotel per night, that could finance the center and a marketing budget. Mr. Doctoroff said the city was still revising its financial plan, which will be completed in six to eight weeks.
"The assumption remains that we'll finance this through incremental tax revenues generated as a result of our investment in infrastructure," Mr. Doctoroff said.

HEADLINE: As Cities Move to Privatize Water, Atlanta Steps Back 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: ATLANTA 

 BODY:
Privatization has hit the water sector, which has remained mostly the bastion of public utilities. Over the last five years, hundreds of American communities, including Indianapolis, Milwaukee and Gary, Ind., have hired private companies to manage their waterworks, serving about one in 20 Americans.
 The main reason is that the cities are facing enormous costs to repair aging sewer pipes, treatment plants and other water infrastructure. Federal officials say the total cost of repairs could outstrip current spending by more than $500 billion in the next 20 years. The utilities' hope has been that partnerships with private companies could generate savings and provide access to capital to help cover such staggering bills. 
 But a cautionary tale has emerged here in Atlanta, where the largest water privatization deal collapsed in January. Instead of public savings and private profit, a deal reached in 1999 between Atlanta and United Water resulted in bitter disappointments for all sides, not least of all consumers. Atlanta is now retaking control of a system that United Water was to have managed until 2019. 
"This city had a motto for years, and it went something like 'Atlanta grows where water goes,' " said Jack Ravan, the city's commissioner of watershed management. "I think we've learned enough to know that we'd prefer to see the city in charge of that destiny."
The decision, in many ways, takes Atlanta back to square one. It will have a publicly controlled system that, on paper at least, will be more costly to ratepayers than the one it replaces. The arrangement offers no clear way to pay for extensive water-system repairs, estimated to cost $800 million over the next five years. (A separate bill to upgrade the city's sewers could exceed $3 billion.)
But Atlanta officials, along with customers like Gordon Certain, the head of a local neighborhood association, say almost any change seems preferable to existing service they call poor, unresponsive and fraught with breakdowns, including an epidemic of water-main breaks and occasional "boil only" alerts caused by brown water pouring from city taps.
"Is it possible to have private water work right?" Mr. Certain asked. "I'm sure it is. But if you have a political problem in your city, you can vote in a new administration. If you have a private company with a long-term contract, and they're the source of your problems, then it gets a lot more difficult."
The breakup comes as the question of privatized water is generating increased attention around the country, with advocacy groups like Public Citizen waging campaigns against the proposed deals. And while water privatization advocates describe the Atlanta failure as an aberration, all sides say that it is likely to weigh heavily in places like Stockton, Calif., which is considering whether to go down a similar path.
"This is a huge setback for privatization, and it's going to have to give both cities and companies pause," said Dr. Peter H. Gleick, president of the Pacific Institute, a nonpartisan environmental research organization in Oakland, Calif., that has written extensively about the risks and benefits of water privatization.
United Water, a subsidiary of the giant French company Suez, has acknowledged problems with its management of the Atlanta system. But it has also said it was stuck with trying to run a system in unexpected disrepair, while losing at least $10 million annually under a $22 million-a-year contract that the city refused to renegotiate.
"It was important to recognize reality in Atlanta," Michael Chesser, United Water's chairman and chief executive, said of his company's consenting to the breakup. Still, United Water, one of the country's two biggest private water companies, has contracts to operate more than 100 other municipal systems, and Mr. Chesser said he expected that number to grow. "This is a market with a huge potential," he said.
It was Atlanta's new mayor, Shirley Franklin, who forced an end to the partnership, demanding that United Water quit or be fired. But in announcing an end to the partnership in Atlanta on Jan. 24, Mr. Chesser and Ms. Franklin said each side had recognized that continuing the deal was in neither party's interest.
Across the country, 94 percent of water systems are publicly controlled, said William G. Reinhardt, editor of Public Works Financing, the leading trade journal covering the industry. Most are owned and operated by municipalities, in what remains the most fragmented of any American utility, divided into roughly 5,000 different pieces. 
The number of publicly owned systems that, like Atlanta's, are operated under long-term contracts by private companies has increased to about 1,100, from about 400 in 1997.
"It all comes down to economics," said Debra Coy, a research analyst with Schwab Capital Markets. "In an environment where cities are paying much more attention to their problems with wastewater and water, you have an industry that's coming in and telling them, hey, we can help you do this."
A 1997 executive order helped to smooth the way for such public-private partnerships. But in cities already strapped for cash, the bigger factor has been the dark shadow cast by the need for new investment, to meet the needs of growing population or to keep aging systems in compliance with strict environmental laws.
Some federal estimates of the need for new spending for municipal water systems have reached as high as $1 trillion over the next 20 years.
In Atlanta, some water pipes date from the 19th century, and its water system has been in failing shape since the mid-1990's, when the federal government began to assess fines against the city for failing to meet water-safety standards. In striking the deal with United Water in 1999, city officials said they hoped to save as much as $20 million a year from the $42 million budgeted for the existing, bloated public utility, and to apply those savings to capital improvements.
But at most, Atlanta officials say, the city has managed to achieve only $10 million in annual savings, and only at what has been a significant political cost, with ratepayers blaming the city for United Water's shortcomings. At the same time, United Water said its expected profit had turned into heavy losses as operating costs soared. Atlanta's pipes, fire hydrants and water treatment plants turned out to be in much worse shape than the city had let on, the company said.
The return to public control that Atlanta has now embraced will send the city's water costs soaring back to about $40 million a year, compared with the $22 million in direct costs it was paying United Water, Mr. Ravan said. But he said there would be other, less tangible savings. "What is the cost of a 'must boil' alert?" he asked.
But critics, including Hugh Jackson, a Nevada-based researcher with Public Citizen, are using the example of Atlanta to offer a broader indictment of a privatization process they regard as misguided from the start.
"Obviously, water is a basic necessity, to a degree that electricity isn't, when you get right down to it," Mr. Jackson said. "We do not feel that it should be managed for quarter-to-quarter returns for a corporation that is trying to satisfy a profit demand."
Some experts, including Adrian Moore, a privatization advocate who is a vice president at the Los Angeles-based Reason Foundation, say the main lesson of the Atlanta collapse is that cities and private companies needed to be realistic about what a partnership can achieve.
"It's like a marriage," Mr. Moore said. "You've got to work to make it work."

 The agency has announced its intention to release rules on Thursday that will govern how much the four Bell companies can charge their rivals for using their networks and equipment. With Michael K. Powell, the agency's chairman, so far unable to find a majority of support from among the four other commissioners, that deadline could slip. Page C9. 

HBO Offers Series to Networks
In another indication that cable and network programming are becoming interchangeable, HBO has offered the four major broadcast networks a chance at picking up "Sex and the City" for use in prime time. C8.

Giving the Classics a Makeover
The stiffest competition in the book business may be among the many publishers staking claim to Dickens, Austen, Herodotus and Plato. Selling the classics is one of the few areas of significant growth in an otherwise stagnant business. Major publishers are defending their share of the consumer and academic markets by investing in redesigning and expanding their classics lists. C8.

E-mail Spam Scam Is Sent in Bush's Name

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW MIRAPAUL 

 BODY:
At first, the e-mail message reads like all the others: There's the need for confidentiality. An assurance that the transaction is completely legal. And the inevitable appeal, in awkwardly formal language, for help in procuring a large amount of money. 
 This may come to you as a surprise (to borrow the language of such e-mail notes), but the message was not sent by someone claiming to be an African potentate's heir. Instead, it says, it was written by President Bush, the son of a former president, who seeks your urgent assistance in financing the removal of Iraq's leader. His "trusted intermediary" for the transaction: the Internal Revenue Service. 
 The spoof was written by Zoltan Grossman, a geography professor at the University of Wisconsin at Eau Claire. Like most people in the wired world, Professor Grossman, 41, has been swamped with e-mail messages from Nigeria and other foreign lands, seemingly sincere solicitations that are really schemes designed to defraud gullible recipients with promises of quick riches.
Although Professor Grossman routinely deletes such messages, he was prompted to write his parody after Mr. Bush's efforts to raise economic and political support for a war on Iraq began to remind him of the messages from Nigerian spammers. 
"They're all from the son or daughter of a former ruler," he said. "A lot of them talk about oil money. And they need huge sums of cash very quickly. I thought, Why does this sound so familiar?" 
Professor Grossman sent his spoof to two Web sites on Jan. 21, and it has spread rapidly from there. The full message can be read at scamorama .com/gwb.html. The parody is a witty variation on a vintage scam. Its victims are promised a big payoff if they supply money to gain access to, say, a bank account. Of course, the payoff never materializes.
The Nigerian Fraud E-Mail Gallery, at potifos.com/fraud, holds 420 different examples. Lawrence Kestenbaum, a researcher at the University of Michigan who is the site's operator, said he had 1,000 more entries to add.
A White House spokesman said he had not seen Professor Grossman's sham spam. Nor are unsuspecting readers likely to be duped by the spoof, in part because its stilted prose differs from Mr. Bush's colloquial style. 
Still, Professor Grossman said, "Let's hope no one takes it seriously and actually donates," as the e-mail requests, 10 to 25 percent of one's annual income. MATTHEW MIRAPAUL

War and Peace On the Runway As Designers Weigh the Mood

BYLINE:  By GINIA BELLAFANTE 

 BODY:
Ever since the music impresario Sean Combs attached his enterprise to the world of fashion, it has been clear that his last will and testament is unlikely to contain a codicil directing large sums of money to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Typically, Mr. Combs's runway spectacles have left one wondering if he had secured possession of every last chinchilla in the Andes. But aside from a position on fur that seems more Liberace, say, than Susan Sarandon, Mr. Combs's political views have not been easy to determine.
 His fall 2003 Sean John show at Cipriani on Saturday night provided little in the way of illumination. Last year, Mr. Combs showed suits that paid tribute to martini-era glamour. This time he turned out storm-trooper coats, cargo-style jumpsuits, menacing black army jackets -- and relatively little fur -- all of which suggested that the wearer might be consumed by fantasies of showering the planet with smart bombs. Incongruously, he looped bits of the Martin Sheen voice-over from "Apocalypse Now" through the soundtrack and offered up Marvin Gaye's antiwar anthem, "What's Going On?" as audience members filed out after the show. 
But as Mr. Combs explained yesterday, the fact that the models looked intimidating and the clothes seemed as if they concealed weapons systems was not meant to telegraph a message of hawkishness. "You know, I'm just so into peace right now," he said. "I wanted to do some stuff that people would actually buy."
And could it be that perhaps Mr. Combs has read the mass psychology correctly? Is it possible that young men, aggrieved by diminishing job prospects and other global miseries, are eager to look as angry as they feel?
It is aquestion that came up again over the weekend at the show for a label called Cloak. Cloak represents the output of two young men who once worked for Marc Jacobs: Alexandre Plokhov, a native of suburban Moscow who was his patternmaker, and Robert Geller, a designer. Here again, the image was not one of contented manhood. If the models weren't wearing combat boots, they had on shoes that looked as if they had been assaulted with mud.
A full-length canvas poncho came without armholes. There were flak vests and hooded bombers and pants with enough superfluous zippers that if laid out end to end, they could stretch to Fort Bragg. The clothes hung sloppily, and the models looked not so much frightening as they did resigned to a life of nothingness. Cloak is sold at stores like Louis Boston, but the idea the designers are going for is available on Eighth Street from about Cooper Square to Avenue B, as it has been for the last 30 years.
A more sanguine view of the masculine condition came in a debut line by William Garrett, called Blue Khaki. Mr. Garrett, who has designed men's clothes for Valentino, bucked the trend of using models who appear to be hovering around learner-permit age and sent men down the runway with gray hair and imperfect skin. 
Mr. Garrett hokily called his collection Ellis Island, because, his press notes proclaimed, he intended it pay homage to "the men who built our cities from the ground up on steel I-beams and big dreams." The clothes -- bulky sweaters, drapey wool suits, sturdy unadorned coats -- were the most practical on display during the weekend men's shows. 
That is a distinction that in seasons past has been reserved for John Varvatos, a designer who has usually steered clear of the effete. At his show at the Altman Building on Friday night, which was set against a backdrop of crystal chandeliers and empty gold picture frames, Mr. Varvatos, seemingly out of tune with the current mood, showed smoking jackets and velvet suits in eggplant and mauve, indicating that he is less interested in the working man than in the unemployed swain relying on a bartender's good will.
Mr. Varvatos's political views might be guessed at, however. He offered his young swain a sweater with a peace sign.

HEADLINE: Bush Rallies Republicans Around Tax Plan 

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 9 

 BODY:
President Bush urged Republican members of Congress today to pass his economic plan, seeking to rally them behind proposed tax cuts that have caused some Republican skittishness on Capitol Hill.
 "The tax reduction plan that I want you to pass and I want to sign will put more money into the pockets of the entrepreneurs of America, which is good for those who are looking for work," Mr. Bush told Republican members of the House and Senate attending a retreat at a West Virginia resort, according to a transcript provided by the Federal Document Clearing House Inc. 
 As he sorted through a laundry list of his domestic initiatives, the president specifically sought support for one of the more contentious elements of his economic plan -- the elimination of incometax on stock dividends.
"It makes sense to help our seniors and to make the tax code more fair," Mr. Bush said. "The double taxation of dividends is unfair. It is unfair to tax profits and the distribution of those profits."
Democrats have criticized the dividend proposal as too generous to the wealthy and a handful of moderate Republican senators have suggested it needs to be scaled back. In the House, Republican leaders are considering their own economic ideas and may reshape the president's plan as well. Others in the party last week expressed concern over trying to cut taxes when the federal deficit is back on the rise.
With a fight expected in the Senate this week over the nomination of a Washington lawyer, Miguel Estrada, to a federal appeals court, Mr. Bush commended Senate Republicans for "standing strong" behind a nominee whom Democrats have criticized as an extreme conservative.
"I expect the people of the Senate not to hold him up, not to try to talk his nomination into the ground," Mr. Bush said, referring to the threat of a Democratic filibuster, "because Miguel Estrada not only represents the American dream, but will do us proud on the bench."
Republican lawmakers were secluded for the weekend at the Greenbrier resort in White Sulphur Springs for a joint House-Senate retreat that included celebrity entertainment, motivational speakers, strategy sessions and bowling parties, though a snowfall precluded any golf. The resort was closed to other guests. Vice President Dick Cheney spoke earlier in the weekend.
In his remarks before the retreat wrapped up today, Mr. Bush said that while he realized many people were focused on Iraq and international issues, he said he wanted to remind lawmakers "that we've got a domestic agenda that is positive and strong and hopeful and optimistic."
He touched on another domestic issue that is making Congressional Republicans anxious -- Medicare changes. The administration is developing a plan to provide older Americans with prescription drug coverage through Medicare, though the specifics remain elusive. Some Republicans have already made it clear to the White House that any plan that forces people to leave the traditional Medicare program to qualify for the drug benefit will be a difficult sell.
Mr. Bush told the lawmakers, "We will address the Medicare issue in a way which enables us to say, as a country, we fulfilled our promise to senior citizens."
He also lobbied for his "compassion agenda," urging support for religion-based social programs, new financing for treatment of AIDS overseas and a mentoring program for children whose parents are in prison.

HEADLINE: More Itchy Ticket Fingers, Chasing More Revenue From Parking Fines 

BYLINE:  By DIANE CARDWELL 

 BODY:
The city will soon become a much colder place for drivers who double-park, even for a few minutes.
 The Police Department plans to hire nearly 1,000 new traffic agents over the next year, including 29 scheduled to start today. Another 250 will be hired in the next few months. The new agents will replace those lost through promotion or retirement, and will bolster the ranks by 300, part of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's plan to raise $69 million for the city by issuing an extra 1.7 million parking summonses. The city has been issuing more than 8 million a year. 
 The ticket blitz will not reach full force until all the new officers are in place, sometime in the fiscal year beginning in July. But already, drivers say that parking rules are being enforced more aggressively, especially since October, when the city raised fines for some offenses to $105 from $55.
"Before they even get up to your car, they're already writing the ticket," said Nelson Andino, a computer technician, who was behind the wheel of his 1981 Oldsmobile Delta 88 in Park Slope, Brooklyn. "They don't even give you a chance. You know I've broken down, I pull over, my car had stalled, they still ticketed me."
Henry Levine, a furniture maker, said that he had gone from having almost no tickets to getting five in the last month. "They're just quicker to get you for no standing; they're faster when your meter expires," he said, calling the planned ticket expansion "a nice insidious tax increase."
City officials say the plan is intended to help avoid dangerous traffic conditions and to ease congestion. "It's aimed at illegal things that cause an effect on you and me as another driver," said Iris Weinshall, the city's transportation commissioner. "In every neighborhood the issue is different. In Midtown, it's a problem of trucks' double-parking. In Upper Manhattan, it might be cars double-parking. In other neighborhoods it's that cars like to park in the bus stops."
Fiscal experts say that going after parking scofflaws of one stripe or another is an easy way for a cash-poor city to raise money. "People break the law on parking all the time, especially in New York," said Douglas Muzzio, a professor at the School of Public Affairs at Baruch College. "In the words of budget experts, it's low-lying fruit; it can be picked off. You can get at it without climbing the tree."
But as a fiscal policy, experts said, it is not necessarily the most sound because traffic laws exist to ensure traffic flow, not to generate revenue.
"In the best of all worlds, you want to enforce traffic laws tightly enough so that New Yorkers stop blocking the box" and committing other such infractions, said Ronnie Lowenstein, director of the city's Independent Budget Office. "Then traffic flows better, people are safer and the police are able to focus on other things. Ultimately in terms of public policy, that's where you really want to be." 
Nonetheless, in going after, say, those drivers whose weekend double-parking routinely turns neighborhood arteries into vehicular slaloms, New York is joining a trend. In San Francisco, officials are planning to raise some of their parking fines, and Washington has been increasing the number of parking officers and has raised several of its fines.
In New York, the focus on parking has begun to pay off. Officials have noted a 15 percent jump in parking-ticket revenue during the first five months of the current fiscal year. That, officials say, is a result of a slight increase in the number of tickets issued, combined with the near doubling of some fines and more aggressive collections. 
And other ideas are under consideration. City Council Speaker Gifford Miller and City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. recently proposed an amnesty program to help collect unpaid tickets. "It's fair and it makes sense," Mr. Miller's chief spokesman, Christopher Policano, said in an e-mail message. "Give people an opportunity to settle their fines without penalties and interest for a defined period of time, and make it clear that penalties will increase after the amnesty period."
In Chicago, for example, an amnesty program helped bring parking ticket revenue, which has been steadily increasing from $68 million in 1995, to $140 million in 2002, said Bea Reyna-Hickey, the director of revenue for that city.
Martha E. Stark, the New York City finance commissioner, whose agency is responsible for collections, said that her office was analyzing whether or not such a program would help collect what is owed, estimated by Mr. Thompson's office at about $600 million. Only about $177 million of that is considered collectible, Ms. Stark warned, adding that the city had already started taking several new approaches to help collect the money owed, and was considering several more. 
For the moment, those who will face the new ticket-writers are hardly pleased. "It's ridiculous as it is now," said Al Vousa, a manager at the Good Deal Trucking Company in Brooklyn, adding that his drivers were frequently forced to drive around and around before making deliveries because of a dearth of legal spaces. "They have to give a break to commercial vehicles." 
Greg Weiss, the owner of Dart Courier Service, echoed that sentiment, saying that a big problem for commercial vehicles is that they are not given enough time for loading and unloading, now down to 20 minutes from 40. "It's tough enough to make a living," he said. "It will just put more of a burden on the drivers and on corporations." 
But several drivers, perhaps already numbed by the barrage of gloomy budget forecasts, seemed unfazed by the impending ticket blitz. "I guess they want driving in itself to be a luxury for only the rich," said a man who gave his name as Amit S., sitting in an S.U.V. double-parked along Seventh Avenue in Park Slope, Brooklyn. "You know, I don't know what's fair anymore. It's all relative. They need money; we don't have money. There's no explanation."
Other drivers said that they supported going after those who break the law. "If it's illegal, fine, ticket the hell out of them," Mr. Andino said. "If you're in front of a hydrant, crosswalk, you know, blocking emergency services, bus stop -- I have no mercy for those people."
But Claudio Wilson, while allowing that it would help to ticket those who block traffic, said: "It's too much what they're doing anyway; it's very aggressive. We have to pay for everything. That's not fair."

Two Precocious Stars, Two Different Fortunes

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM C. RHODEN 

 BODY:
WHOSE shoes would you rather stand in? Whose path would you follow, Maurice Clarett's or LeBron James's? At a time of change, two young stars represent conflicting ways of negotiating a complex and often confusing sports world. 
 Clarett is the dynamic 19-year-old freshman running back from Youngstown, Ohio, who led Ohio State to the national title. 
 James is the 18-year-old high school basketball star from Akron, Ohio, whose talent and charisma have turned the news media on their ears and put him in the center of the sports universe.
Aside from sharing an Ohio connection, James and Clarett understand that the sports world is a brothel. Clarett is struggling with this reality a little more than James, who seems to be devouring everything placed in front of him -- trucks, jerseys, opponents, whatever. 
The reality truly hit home for Clarett in the week before the national title game, when he learned that the university would not buy him a plane ticket to Ohio so he could attend a friend's funeral.
Clarett flashed back to the season, but instead of focusing on the games he focused on the games' periphery. Each week, Clarett played before 70,000 to 100,000 fans in leading Ohio State to an undefeated season. All this money flowed in, yet Clarett was denied a $300 plane ticket to go back to Youngstown for the funeral of a close friend.
Come the national championship game against Miami, Clarett did his job, scoring twice and leading Ohio State to a dramatic, double-overtime victory in the Fiesta Bowl.
He is handcuffed to an archaic system of control imposed by the N.F.L. and happily embraced by colleges. Players cannot jump to the N.F.L. until after their third year out of high school.
He looks down the road to Akron and sees LeBron James about to earn millions out of high school. In the coming months, James will sign a million-dollar shoe contract. In the spring, James is expected to be the first player taken in the N.B.A. draft.
Unlike Clarett, James is free to pursue a professional career. He will be drafted out of high school, signed and paid well. Then he will fade into relative obscurity while he learns the pro game, and in the process he will be criticized for not being able to walk on water after all.
The deeper bond that Clarett and James share is that each has lost a piece of his childhood. On the surface, arguing that either player's childhood has been stolen seems like a reach. This is voluntary duty, after all. They are playing sports they love. Clarett earned a scholarship to Ohio State. James helped keep open the doors to his high school, and in the process achieved national fame. But there has been a price.
James's high school games became so big that they outgrew the cozy 1,700-seat gymnasium at St. Vincent-St. Mary and were moved. James lamented the growth. "I wish we had more games here," he said. "We like the crowds sitting right on us. But that's how the ball bounced some times."
On senior night on Jan. 24, each of his senior teammates was accompanied by a parent. Not James; his mother did not arrive in time to take part in the ceremony. The ball bounces that way, too.
For James, basketball is no longer a hobby. He doesn't fully realize it yet and may not for a couple of years, but basketball is work, a full-time job that will allow James to realize his dreams of a better life.
The part of his sports childhood that Clarett lost was the joy of playing the game: I work hard for you; you work hard for me. After being denied a trip to the funeral, Clarett sat before reporters and wondered what he was even doing in Tempe, Ariz. He talked about the juxtaposition of fans and good times in Tempe and the homeless and the unemployed in Youngstown.
While his compassion is commendable, his ability to use football to right society's wrongs is much narrower than James's. Clarett plays a sport that is infinitely more grueling than basketball. As a freshman he absorbed unbelievable punishment. He had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee; he sustained a shoulder injury that will probably haunt him; his ankle was banged up, too.
He has to play two more seasons in the Big Ten before he can apply for the N.F.L. He threatened to challenge the rule early last season, but was harshly criticized. After the university and the conference get their pound of flesh, how much will be left?
As bright as James's future appears, he will discover that he was everyone's latest flavor of the month. If he has the misfortune to land in an unforgiving market like New York, his apprenticeship could be the sort of nightmare that takes seasons to snap out of. By that time, we'll be hyping the next prodigy.
Who would you rather be? Maurice Clarett or LeBron James?

HEADLINE: Even as the Big Airlines Struggle, Computer Booking System Prospers 

BYLINE:  By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
As the airline industry heads closer to insolvency, it is no surprise that Sabre Holdings, the world's largest computer reservations system, is having a tough time.
 Not only is overall travel down, but the rapid adoption of Internet travel booking is causing an even more rapid decline in the number of bookings through travel agencies, Sabre's main users. Making matters worse, Travelocity, Sabre's own online travel agency, has stumbled, ceding the leading position to Expedia. 
 But financially, Sabre is doing amazingly well. The company, which was separated from American Airlines in 2000, predicts that its revenue will fall by only a few percentage points this year. And its profit margins are still higher in this bleak year than airlines achieve even at their best. Indeed, Sabre has been able to raise the price it charges airlines to book each ticket by 3 percent, even as airfares fall. 
Sabre in reality may be doing too well for its own good. The airlines have set their sights on its highflying profits and are seeking to bring them down.
"They charge exorbitant rates relative to the value they add," J. Scott Kirby, executive vice president for sales and marketing of America West Airlines, said of Sabre and its rivals. "It is a cost that we don't find justified."
The airline industry is fighting a battle on several fronts with Sabre and other reservations systems. Five big airlines started Orbitz, an online travel agency that is developing technology to bypass the reservations systems. Northwest Airlines already has a Web site that agents can use to book tickets for their clients directly, and America West is building one.
In all these cases, the airlines are pressing travel agents to cooperate by keeping their best fares off the common reservations systems, an action that undercuts the systems' big advantage -- that they give agents one screen where they can book nearly any travel arrangement.
At the same time, the airlines have used their considerable lobbying power, persuading the Department of Transportation to propose eliminating some of the rules that help Sabre and its three rivals -- Galileo, Worldspan and Amadeus -- keep their fees up.
On the other end of this assault is William J. Hannigan, Sabre's chief executive. No stranger to tough conditions, Mr. Hannigan served as a Navy radioman on a fast-attack submarine. After a career with phone companies, he joined Sabre in December 1999, on the eve of its spinoff by AMR, American's parent.
Things started to deteriorate, with business travel in recession and then the Sept. 11 attacks and their economic aftermath. Mr. Hannigan responded by selling much of Sabre's computer operations to Electronic Data Systems and eliminating one-third of Sabre's jobs.
But he has continued to raise fees, rather than cut them as most airlines demand. His strategy is to exploit the reservations business, a cash cow, for as long as he can and use the money to build new lines of business, especially online travel.
The jury is out on whether this is a wise use of Sabre's cash. A new high-margin hotel product has yet to prove that it can revive Travelocity. And a $757 million acquisition of GetThere, an Internet corporate travel site, is still losing money. Some investors would rather see Sabre pay a dividend than make more acquisitions.
But there will be little cash for anything if the airlines make good on their pledges to revolt against the reservations fees. Sabre has introduced one discount program, but in general Mr. Hannigan asserts that Sabre's fees are worth every penny. Since Sabre mainly serves travel agencies that book business travelers, it sells much more profitable tickets than a site like Orbitz that draws bargain-hunting vacationers.
"I make no apologies for our pricing structure," Mr. Hannigan said from his office in Southlake, Tex. He said airlines sold $80 billion worth of tickets on Sabre last year and its total revenue from those sales was $1.5 billion, or about 2 percent.
But the airlines argue that since 1993, Sabre's fees have increased in some cases by about 20 percent while airfares have fallen 30 percent. Moreover, executives at most airlines say they need to be in all the reservations systems to be available to all the travel agents. "We sell over $5 billion a year through Sabre," said Craig Kreeger, vice president for sales at American. "If they increased their fee by 50 percent, I would probably have to pay it. I have absolutely no leverage."
Mr. Hannigan replies that the industry practices the airlines object to were all developed when Sabre was owned by American and its rivals were owned by other airlines. Worldspan and Amadeus are still controlled by airline groups. Galileo was bought by Cendant in 2001, a few years after it was spun off from United.
"It is a structure that was created by the airlines," he said, "and you always have to take it with a grain of salt when they complain about it."
And indeed the airlines are partly responsible for the current state of affairs. American started installing Sabre systems in travel agencies in 1976. At first, Sabre blatantly favored American flights, listing them before more convenient flights from other carriers. In 1984, the government imposed regulations to ensure the reservations systems treated all airlines alike.
Even after that, the airlines found a kind of "halo effect" -- where agencies booked more flights on the airline that owned the reservations system they used. That is why the airlines, not the travel agencies, pay for the systems. Indeed, the airlines instructed their own systems to woo agencies with free computers and later, cash payments referred to as incentives for each ticket sold.
The reservations systems paid for these incentives by raising the fees they charge airlines for each booking. And because of the way the government wrote its rules, the airlines decided they had little choice but to pay those higher fees.
Sabre says it has responded to the airlines' criticism with a program in which it will cut its fees 10 percent for any airline willing to sign a three-year contract and give Sabre access to all its low fares, including those that had only been offered over the Internet. So far, only US Airways and a few small foreign carriers have accepted the deal.
Galileo has introduced a variation on that program that offered a 20 percent cut in booking fees, but only at agencies that agreed to waive about half of the incentive payment. In addition to access to Web fares, the agency gets extra commission on some of Cendant's brands like Avis car rental. US Airways and United have signed up for that deal.
Most of the other big airlines say that even that the 20 percent cut proposed by Galileo does not go far enough. "Sabre and Galileo have the most to lose," said Al Lenza, vice president for distribution and e-commerce of Northwest. "They are taking baby steps in order to protect 95 percent of their revenue."
American has proposed its own program that would have agencies pay 50 percent of the booking fees in return for access to its Web fares. It says that 90 agencies have agreed. 
Analysts say it may fall to the government sort all this out.
"I don't see the two sides coming to an agreement," said Scott Barry of Credit Suisse First Boston. "The airlines are from Venus and the reservation systems are from Mars."
Before the airlines commit to long-term deals, they are waiting to see the final rules proposed by the Transportation Department, perhaps later this year. The draft regulations, released last fall, read like an airline wish list -- allowing big carriers to use their bargaining power. They would end the rule that reservations systems charge all airlines the same fee. And they would ban the incentive payments.
"The proposed new rules would significantly weaken the control of the reservation systems on the individual airlines," Mr. Lenza said.
Sabre says that a complete deregulation would be fine, but the proposal, which eliminates some rules and imposes others, does not create the proverbial level playing field.
"We say 'Regulate us: that's fine. Or deregulate us; That's fine. But we don't want to be stuck in the middle,' " Mr. Hannigan said.
Left unsaid is that those most likely to be disadvantaged are travelers. If the airlines go through with their threats to pull more of their best fares off Sabre and its rivals, it will be harder for the agents to find itineraries at the best prices.
That is one result, Mr. Kirby conceded, of America West's plan to bypass the reservations systems.
"Unfortunately, it will never be as convenient for travel agents as the current systems."

CORRECTION-DATE: February 12, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Monday about Sabre Holdings, the online travel reservation system, misstated its revenue forecast for this year. The prediction is for growth of 4 to 9 percent, not decline of a few percentage points. The article also misstated Sabre's reason for selling part of its computer operations to Electronic Data Services. The goal was to exit unattractive lines of business, not to respond to a slowdown in business travel.

C2) Graph: "Opposite Routes"Since 1993, the average fare for a 1,000-mile flight has dropped 30 percent, to $120, even as Sabre's fee for its highest level of airline reservations service has risen by about 20 percent, to $4.39. Figures are adjusted for inflation. Graph tracks the percentage changes in the average airfare and Sabre's fees since 1993. (Sources: Air Transport Association; Sabre)(pg. C1) Chart: "Booking Flights, Collecting Fees"Sabre and other reservations systems allow travel agents to compare and book flights on major airlines. Airlines argue that the fees they pay to reservations systems are far too high, particularly because a portion of the fee is rebated to travel agencies. Here is how it works. 1.) A traveler wants to buy a ticket through a travel agent for $500. The agency charges the traveler a $25 fee, in addition to the cost of the ticket. 2.) The agency uses Sabre to search for and book the best ticket. 3.) The airline pays Sabre a booking fee of $4.40 a segment. The average trip is 2.5 segments, making the average fee about $11. 4.) Sabre pays a smaller fee to the travel agent, of a little over $1 a segment, making the average fee about $3. (pg. C2)

HEADLINE: Flawed Snowfall Data Jeopardize Climate-Change Research 

BYLINE:  By FRED BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
When it comes to snowfall, even a flurry is likely to provoke a blizzard of reporting.
 "People love hearing about snow," said Nolan Doesken, a meteorologist at Colorado State University. But too often, he and other experts say, the nonstop coverage of winter weather masks a troubling decline in reliable snowfall statistics. 
 "The loss of snowfall data globally is a major concern," said Dr. Barry Goodison, a climatologist in Toronto. As chairman of a scientific steering group in the World Climate Research Program, Dr. Goodison depends on snowfall figures to help predict climate change. But too often, he said, the information he needs does not exist. 
In Russia, social and economic shifts have undermined data collection across that vast and snowy country, Dr. Goodison said. In the United States, after the National Weather Service closed many of its weather stations in the 1990's, snowfall measurements were left in the hands of untrained workers.
And training is critical, meteorologists say. "Of the basic weather parameters, snowfall is the most difficult to measure," said Mr. Doesken, the author of a book and a videotape used to teach measuring techniques. 
The basic method -- sticking a ruler in the snow -- has not changed much in hundreds of years. But decisions have to be made about where and when to measure.
"If one person's measuring on the roof of his car and another on a snowboard," Mr. Doesken said, referring to a surface that is cleared of snow at regular intervals, "you've got a problem," Mr. Doesken said.
Snow reaching the ground can melt, turn to vapor or compress snow that fell before it. If two people measure the same snowfall, one every hour and the other at the end of the storm, they "would come up with different numbers," he added.
Even the precise location matters. Dr. David J. Nolan, a meteorologist at the University of Miami, said: "Drifting has to be accounted for. And think about walking around in the backyard with a ruler. You can get large variations just from the effects of a tree." 
For much of the 20th century, the Weather Service operated hundreds of stations where meteorologists used established measurement techniques. In the 1990's, the service closed nearly half of its 300 stations, including offices in Stratford, Conn.; Newark; and Wilmington, Del.
"When you look at the historical weather records," said Michael Schlacter, chief meteorologist at Weather 2000, a forecasting company in New York, "you see this beautiful tally of snowfall going back 40 years or more. And then in 1997 or '98, the data just stop."
Some Weather Service offices were consolidated. The station at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, N.Y., on Long Island, now controls data collection for the entire New York metropolitan region, which once had six stations. The meteorologist in charge of the office, Michael E. Wyllie, conceded that the approach left "gaps in snowfall measurement."
At the major airports, he said, Federal Aviation Administration employees have continued to take readings, "although they're not required to." 
In Central Park, zookeepers, not meteorologists, take the measurements, according to Mr. Wyllie, who said he had fought to keep the lone weather station in Manhattan open. 
Mr. Schlacter said the last 12 measurements Central Park that totaled at least three inches ended in "point zero" or "point five."
"It makes you very suspicious that they're just rounding," he said.
"We're working with them," Mr. Wyllie said about the zookeepers. "We're doing the best we can."
At airports, meteorologists said, F.A.A. employees may not take measurements unless airport operations are affected. As a result, small snowfalls are reported as "traces" rather than actual amounts. Heavier snow may not be measured until it stops falling, meaning that there is no information about the progress of a storm.
"And that isn't much use if you're trying to compare a snowfall of 1889 with a snowfall of 2003," Mr. Doesken. "The numbers you hear on the news are typically from helpful spotters, who love to call in their reports. The media have learned to tap into these people. But they aren't the kind of measurements that can go into the official record."
Paul Knight, who is the state climatologist for Pennsylvania and a meteorologist at Penn State University, which has provided weather information to The New York Times for 17 years, agreed. "The quality of snow reports has certainly diminished," he said. "The Weather Service can't go sending out their personnel to Ronkonkoma and Passaic to see if the volunteers are measuring the snow correctly."
The loss of information has real-world effects on fields like insurance and litigation. Mark Kramer, a meteorologist who often appears as an expert witness, said he testified in a slip-and-fall case in which the amount of snow on the ground was an issue. Mr.Kramer said he could not find snowfall figures for Manhattan for several weeks before the accident. "The judge," he said, "was stunned."
The Weather Service moved heavily into automation in the 90's, replacing many staffed stations with electronic devices. "For most weather variables, that's a story with a happy ending," Mr. Schlacter said. "When it comes to temperature and humidity, readings were no longer impacted by human error. And you could get the information on the Web in real time."
But that is not true of snowfall. "As easy as it seems," Mr. Doesken said, "science is not producing a quick answer to the question of snowfall measurement." 
In Canada, where vast amounts of snow collect in remote areas, hundreds of electronic measurement devices are used. Typically, a device sends an ultrasonic pulse from the top of a pole to the ground. The time it takes for the pulse to return, adjusted according to temperature, indicates snow depth. 
"I have one of them right here," Mr. Doesken said. "It works once the snowfall has stopped and the snow on the ground has a firm, solid surface. If snow is still fluttering down or if the surface is fluffy, it's almost useless."
Dr. Goodison works for the Meteorological Service of Canada, where he helped develop the device. Although it is imperfect, he said, it fills a need in a country where snow often falls in remote areas. Over time, he said, scientists will develop formulas that will allow them to come up with accurate snowfall numbers from imperfect readings. 
For an automated approach to work, in Mr. Schlacter's view, it will have to simulate the actions of a human measurer. Such a device, he said, could take decades to develop. In the meantime, scientists hope to rely on more trained measurers, including volunteers.
In places like Stratford, where the Weather Service closed its office in the 90's, "volunteers have kept the snowfall records going," Mr. Wyllie said. 
"We've been lucky in the New York City area," he said, "to have good people who have continued to take the measurements for us."

(Steve Payne for The New York Times) Chart/Diagram: "A New Way To Measure Snow"Consolidation of six National Weather Service offices in the 90's into one office at Brookhaven National Laboratory has led to incomplete snowfall records for the New York area. Concerned that a lack of snow measurements will harm study of the world's climate, scientists are employing electronic devices like the SR50 sensor. It measures snowfall by sending down an ultrasonic pulse that is reflected back by the snow's surface. The length of the pulse indicates the snows depth.

HEADLINE: At Tax Time, Health Care Costs May Be a Factor 

BYLINE:  By LIZ GALST 

 BODY:
When James Busby, a Brooklyn music teacher, was battling Kaposi's sarcoma, an AIDS-related cancer, his doctor prescribed some blood-building drugs to help him deal with the side effects of chemotherapy. The drugs allowed Mr. Busby to regain much of his strength. But, he said, they cost about half of his annual income.
 Mr. Busby eventually got some of his medical costs back -- from the Internal Revenue Service. 
 "My tax preparer told me about the deduction available to people who have high medical expenses," Mr. Busby says. "It turned out to be a very good thing."
That deduction -- for people who spend more than 7.5 percent of their adjusted gross incomes on what the I.R.S. broadly defines as medical and dental expenses -- is becoming increasingly popular as Americans spend more out of pocket for health care. In the 1997 tax year, for instance, 4.3 percent of taxpayers claimed the deduction; by 2000, the last year with available data, the number had risen to 5.02 percent. 
"Health care spending is rising rapidly, outpacing income," said Mark Pauly, a health economist with the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. Many workers who are covered by employer-supplied health insurance are facing increasing co-payments with fewer benefits. 
Workers without health insurance tend to earn lower wages, making it easier for them to surpass the 7.5 percent threshold. And a good portion of those claiming the deduction are senior citizens. Many of their health care costs, says Mr. Pauly, are not covered by Medicare.
Claiming the deduction is relatively straightforward, but taxpayers have to use the long form 1040 rather than the 1040EZ or 1040A. As long as a taxpayer's medical and dental expenses exceed 7.5 percent of the adjusted gross income -- that is, income minus a few costs like I.R.A. deductions, self-employment taxes and certain moving expenses -- that excess amount is deductible. If the total exceeds the standard deduction, says Jill Feldman, a Manhattan certified public accountant, "it's definitely worth it." 
Individual taxpayers can claim their expenses and those of their spouses. Taxpayers can also claim the expenses of other dependents who don't necessarily live with them, including, in most cases, parents, siblings, children and grandchildren, as long as these dependents meet certain income criteria. A taxpayer with a same-sex domestic partner can claim his or her expenses also, as long as the partner has an income lower than $3,000, "lives with you all year, and isn't married to someone else," said Bruce Friedland, a spokesman for the I.R.S.
Deductions are available for the current tax year, as well as for the two years previous, if amended returns for those years are filed.
Mr. Friedland said the best explanation for what expenses are covered is in I.R.S. Publication 502, which is available from the agency's Web site, www.irs.gov, or by calling 1-800-TAX-FORM.
For the most part, the following expenses can be counted: health insurance premiums and co-payments, payments to doctors, hospitals, acupuncturists, chiropractors, psychotherapists, Christian Science practitioners, dentists and certain nursing and long-term care providers. A portion of most long-term care insurance premiums is deductible also.
Included, too, are the costs of prostheses, reconstructive and/or prophylactic surgery, prescription medication (over-the-counter drugs and nutritional supplements are specifically not covered), smoking-cessation programs, infertility treatment, eyeglasses, contact lenses, hearing aids, wheelchairs and other medical devices. Medically necessary transportation and lodging are deductible as well.
One problem for many people who might be eligible for the medical/dental deduction, says Jeff Spengler, a Pittsburgh accountant, is record keeping. The deductions must be documented.
For those who qualify, the deduction can mean significant savings. Gerry Sauers of St. Petersburg, Fla., who has been treated for ovarian cancer since July 1999, said that in 2000, her medical costs exceeded the 7.5 percent threshold by almost $5,000. In 2001, the figure was close to $3,500. She and her husband "hover between the 28 and 36 percent tax bracket," said Mrs. Sauers, a former H&R Block tax preparer. "So we get about $1,000 back from the government that we wouldn't have gotten."
Mr. Busby says he has put the savings to good use.
"I put the money I got back into yoga classes and other things that build my health," he said.

HEADLINE: Russia to Build 2 Pipelines in the East 

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE

DATELINE: IRKUTSK, Russia, Feb. 10 

 BODY:
Along a snow-swept highway, an oil pipeline with a capacity of one million barrels a day is running at a relative trickle. The pipeline comes to an abrupt end at a giant refinery in Angarsk, a short distance from this Siberian city 150 miles from the Mongolian border. That is as far east as the Russian crude oil pipeline system goes.
 But there are vast energy-hungry markets further east, and Russia's government and its oil industry have been wrangling for months over two competing visions of how to reach them -- with a relatively short pipeline to China's industrial northeast, or a much larger and longer line to the port of Nakhodka on the Sea of Japan, where oil could be shipped to Japan, South Korea, or perhaps even California. The issue touched off debates about private property rights and Russia's geopolitical future. 
 Now a compromise has been struck: build them both. 
According to a senior executive of Yukos Oil, Russia's largest producer and the main backer of the China route, a single new pipeline will start at Angarsk and then split, with one -- the first to be built -- going to China and the other to Nakhodka. At 2,300 miles, the project would be one of the longest pipelines in the world, nearly three times the length of the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline, and would traverse terrain nearly as harsh. The government has projected a cost of $6 billion, though analysts say $8 billion is more realistic. Details of the plan are to be filled in by March 12, when the Russian cabinet is scheduled to meet to discuss it.
Yukos had wanted to build and own the China pipeline itself, and had argued that the longer route was impractical. But the company said it was satisfied with the compromise. 
"China is a developed market that's ready for our oil," said the Yukos executive, Yuri D. Ivanov, deputy director of oil trade and transportation. "Let the government stretch it further if it wants." 
In some ways, politics seemed to trump economics in the government's decision. It shrugged off criticism of the route to Nakhodka as too expensive, insisting on it as a way to accelerate development in Siberia, a vast territory the size of Australia where most roads are dirt and telephones are rarely seen. A pipeline could help carry prosperity as well as oil from western Russia to the east, the thinking has been.
"What leader would refuse investment, when life is so difficult for us here?" said Pyotr M. Gerasimov, the mayor of Usolye-Sibirskoye, a town near Angarsk that is along the pipeline's route. "It would be shameful not to take the chance. It will bring jobs, money for our budget."
For the oil companies, the pipelines promise to bypass bottlenecks in the existing export pipeline system. The line to China is meant to carry 400,000 barrels a day, with the Pacific route planned for one million barrels a day -- potentially expanding Russia's current export capacity of 3.2 million barrels a day by nearly half. 
The decision also seemed to settle the debate over pipeline ownership in Russia. The existing 30,200-mile network, the world's largest, is controlled by Transneft, a government-owned monopoly. The oil companies say they want to move faster and export more than Transneft can allow them to do, but the government has been deeply reluctant to give up any of the revenue or the influence over geopolitically important trade flows that Transneft commands.
"Unfortunately, experience shows that we can't regulate fully and efficiently what we don't own," said one senior government official.
Extensive government involvement, however, could mean delays in completing the pipelines. Mr. Ivanov of Yukos said the timetable for building the China pipeline "has obviously been disrupted," though construction might yet start this year. And the reassertion of Transneft's monopoly may complicate a proposal for a new privately owned pipeline to the Barents Sea port of Murmansk to ship oil to America. 
Analysts expressed some skepticism that the eastern pipeline project would succeed. The high cost of building the link to Nakhodka would have to be reflected in shipping rates, they said, and that would deter producers in western Siberia, where the great majority of Russia's oil is extracted, from using the eastern routes. 
Eastern Siberia, meanwhile, does not yet have enough proven reserves to fill the pipe economically, according to Philip Vorobyov, a Russia specialist at Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Moscow who recently prepared a report on Russia's eastern energy sources.
"Energy security is very important, but ultimately you'll have to find a source of funds for this pipeline," Mr. Vorobyov said. "Unless it's economic, it's very difficult to imagine it being built. They still need to prove additional reserves, specifically in eastern Siberia." 
The China pipeline backed by Yukos, which was well along in planning, had been challenged by local environmentalists. The route crosses areas where earthquake risks are high and cuts through the Tunkinsky National Park, a spectacular, sparsely populated forest region set aside in 1991.
But the company's environmental impact study "does not inspire trust," said Victor A. Kuznetsov, a former park ranger who works at Baikal Ecological Wave, an environmental group in Irkutsk. "Responsibility is up in the air. There is no mechanism for who will answer for a spill."
Executives at Yukos said the precautions they planned go far beyond Soviet-era practices, and use modern earthquake engineering. And Yukos said the China pipeline project alone would create 1,500 jobs and bring new roads, bridges and tax revenue to some of the poorest regions of the country. 
The portion of the pipeline in Chinese territory is to be built in cooperation with CNPC, a Chinese state oil company. The Japanese government had publicly urged Russia to build the pipeline to Nakhodka.

Ending 4-Day Slump, Shares Rise as War Fears Ease a Bit

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Shares pushed moderately higher yesterday, ending four consecutive days of declines on news that Iraq approved a United Nations demand for surveillance flights. 
 Trading was light and choppy as investors refrained from major purchases despite reports of a possible bid for Hughes Electronics by SBC Communications and news that Johnson & Johnson was buying the biotechnology company Scios. 
 "We're going to have this slow torture because nobody on the corporate front is going to stand up and say things look terrific," said Tony Cecin, director of institutional trading at US Bancorp Piper Jaffray, referring to the uneven trading. 
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 55.88 points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 7,920.11, having declined 2.4 percent last week to post its fourth consecutive losing week. Earlier in the day, blue chip stocks were down as much as 62 points. 
The broader market also finished moderately higher. The Nasdaq composite index gained 14.21, or 1.1 percent, to 1,296.68, after a weekly loss of 2.9 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 6.28, or 0.8 percent, to 835.97, having dropped 3 percent last week. 
Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, Mohammed Aldouri, said his country had sent a letter to the United Nations yesterday allowing U-2 surveillance flights. Iraq also pledged to pass legislation next week outlawing the use of weapons of mass destruction. 
Hughes Electronics rose 45 cents, to $10.20, after reports that SBC Communications, the nation's second-largest local phone company, might bid for Hughes, the nation's top satellite broadcaster. SBC fell 68 cents, to $24.50. 
Johnson & Johnson gained 20 cents, to $52.04, after the company confirmed it was buying Scios in a deal worth $2.4 billion. Scios rose $1.72, to $43.92. 
Anxieties about a war with Iraq and terrorism have put pressure on the market in the last month, leading to sharp declines. The Dow and S.& P. 500 are down about 5 percent for the year, while the Nasdaq has lost 3 percent.
Some investors were also avoiding major commitments as they waited for Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, to testify on Capitol Hill today and Wednesday about the economy, analysts said.
Steven Goldman, chief market strategist at Weeden & Company in Greenwich, Conn., said investors should expect continued market volatility on developments with Iraq until there is war or peace. 
Wal-Mart Stores, the discount retailer, gained 23 cents, to $47.02, after the company said that last week's sales fell below forecasts but that it expected to meet sales forecasts for February. 
United Technologies rose 31 cents, to $63.98, after the company affirmed its earnings estimates for 2003.

Treasury Prices Decline
By Bloomberg News
Treasury prices fell yesterday on news that Iraq will allow U-2 surveillance flights, easing concern about a United States attack as soon as this month. 
"The market believes a timetable for a war is being pushed back" diminishing "any flight to quality" toward Treasury notes, said Alex Li, an interest rate strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston.
The 10-year note fell 7/32, to 100 9/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 3.97 percent from 3.94 percent on Friday.
The 30-year bond dropped 21/32 , to 108 1/32 . Its yield rose to 4.85 percent from 4.81 percent.

Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

As an alternative to pop-up ads, marketers are trying to create useful Web sites to draw viewers.

BYLINE:  By Nat Ives 

 BODY:
A WEB site built by MSN for Lexus, the maker of luxury cars, hopes to attract customers by applying the increasingly important dictum of online advertising: make yourself useful.
 The site, called Luxury for Living, contains links to Lexus advertisements, but it is dominated by lifestyle information on topics including luxury hotels, high-technology homes and farmers' markets. It also contains links to outside sites like Slate.com and MSNBC.com. Hoping to make users feel relaxed and pampered, the site plays music: piano, jazz or "new luxury," the music from Lexus commercials. 
 The content offerings are intended to keep users on the site without bombarding them with advertisements. But those ads are just a click away, if a user decides to look at them.
The site is a response to a rising chorus of disdain for online advertising clutter and intrusion, hallmarks of the widely despised pop-up ads. The reaction has forced advertisers to give something to consumers, like news or lifestyle information, in exchange for looking at their ads.
Advertising on the World Wide Web needs to provide useful information because Web users typically go to the Internet for a specific reason and do not want to be bothered, said Geoffrey Ramsey, chief executive at eMarketer, a market research firm in New York. "In general, thinking of the Internet as a push medium for advertisers -- pushing messages out to prospective customers -- is not as effective as using pull strategies, where you create a venue where prospective customers can get something from you," he said.
To that end, Salon.com began offering free access to its subscription-only content to readers who agreed to interact with an ad from Mercedes-Benz. Similarly, the Web site for The Economist magazine rejects pop-up ads, but late last year began to offer its $69-a-year subscriptions to the site free to selected users, provided those users were willing to receive e-mail advertisements from Oracle, which sponsored the deal.
Meredith Interactive in New York, a unit of the Meredith Corporation that runs Web sites for magazines like Ladies' Home Journal and Better Homes and Gardens, is using custom-produced Web sites to attract users to ads, said Bobbie Halfin, managing director. Clients like Kraft have bought online packages based on a theme, like recipes, in which to embed their ads and products.
Shortly after Meredith began offering the online packages in the fourth quarter of 2001, roughly 10 percent of its clients had signed up, Ms. Halfin said. By the end of last year, 60 percent of Meredith online clients used custom packages.
Joanne Bradford, chief media revenue officer at MSN in Redmond, Wash., part of Microsoft, said the "custom solutions" group established in July at MSN is seeking the same result. The group tries to make sure that advertisers offer Web products that provide information to their target market, Ms. Bradford said, so those users get something of value out of their online encounters.
"We really wanted to get past the stigma of online pop-ups and clutter," she said. MSN, which built the Lexus site, Lexus.MSN.com, expects to send at least 500,000 visitors to the site each month from links at other MSN sites.
Ann Bybee, corporate manager for advertising and product strategy at Lexus, part of the Toyota Motor Sales division of Toyota, said Lexus, which does not use pop-up ads, wanted to build a site that kept people coming back. So it concentrated on features and a feel that affluent consumers, those with income of at least $100,000, would appreciate, she said. 
"Ninety-nine percent of all advertisers online are doing banner ads, which are great, but it's a shotgun effect," said Arthur Chan, associate communications director at the agency used by Lexus, Team One Advertising in El Segundo, Calif., part of the Publicis Groupe. To reach a more select audience, he said, "We had to continue to be on the leading edge," and use music, for example, to produce a polished feel.
Despite the gyrations that marketers go through to try to catch users' attention, sometimes their efforts are really just throwbacks, said Mr. Ramsey of eMarketer. A Web portal built by Lexus is not so different from the practice in the early days of television of having series presented entirely by one corporate marketer, he said.
"We can think of the old Procter & Gamble-sponsored soaps," Mr. Ramsey said. "More and more, we're seeing the tried and true and sometimes forgotten marketing principles coming to the Internet."

Sao Paulo's Fancy Hotels Feature Bargain Rates

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, Feb. 10 

 BODY:
Rogerio Fasano, scion of Sao Paulo's most celebrated dynasty of restaurateurs, sidesteps sacks of cement as he paces back and forth across what soon will be the lobby of his new luxury hotel, bearing -- of course -- the family name.
 "I find lobbies in most hotels lifeless, devoid of activity," Mr. Fasano said. "But here I want to give the entrance a bit of human warmth." 
 So he will give it soft lighting and antique club armchairs that he brought from London and Paris. He will place the reception desk discreetly at the back, behind the elevators. And he will put the family's flagship restaurant, Fasano, and jazz bar, Barreto, both Sao Paulo institutions, off to the side. 
In April, the 68-room Fasano will be the latest in a string of luxury hotels to open in Sao Paulo over the last 18 months, revolutionizing businesstravel to one of the primary Latin American destinations for United States business travelers.
For years, visitors complained about the shortage of first-rate accommodations and the inflated prices of the lodgings that were available.
Suddenly, all that has changed.
In June 2001, the Emiliano, just around the corner from the Fasano in the fashionable Jardins district, opened its 19 suites and 38 apartments. Last year, the Hyatt and Hilton chains both opened 450-plus-room hotels in a new business district by the Pinheiros River, closely followed by the Unique, an ultramodern hotel that hangs between giant concrete pillars like a huge slice of watermelon and is near Ibirapuera, Sao Paulo's equivalent of Central Park.
Corporate executives who are hitting town for the first time in a year or so are remarking on the difference.
"When I first came to Sao Paulo, you only had the usual big chain hotels to choose from; it was a bit boring," said Manfred Ferber, a mergers and acquisitions specialist with Dr. Ferber & Partners in Munich, who has traveled to Sao Paulo at least five times over the last year. "Now, with these new places, you get a feeling of a mixture of the best hotels from around the world -- the Costes in Paris, the Delano in Miami, the Mondrian in L.A. I've told all my friends about the Unique."
The flurry of five-star inaugurations, the construction of lower-priced corporate apartments known as aparthotels and the faltering world economy have together created an oversupply of rooms, according to Luiz Carlos Nunes, president of the Brazilian Hotel Industry Association. Mr. Nunes says Sao Paulo will have 57,000 hotel beds by the end of this year to accommodate an annual market of five million visitors. By contrast, he says, New York City had 60,000 beds for a market of 35 million visitors in 2001.
The glut of rooms is bad news for established hotels. Even high-end hotels around the Avenida Paulista, a main banking district, have seen occupancy rates drop to levels as low as 30 percent and are lowering their prices drastically.
"It's not just us; everybody's hurting," said Paulo Patullo, commercial director at the Maksoud Plaza, a classic five-star hotel near Paulista. Most hotels in the city are less than one-third full, he says, and he blames the aparthotels which he says are cheaper to build and run than traditional hotels.
Whatever the reason for the price slump, the fresh competition is good news for bargain-hunting business travelers. "Today, in Sao Paulo, you can stay at a five-star hotel for what you would pay for a three-star in Rio de Janeiro," said Flavio Vieira of Grife Turismo, a Sao Paulo travel agency specializing in business events. "Hotels are willing to negotiate prices, even in the luxury sector."
And what luxury. Here is what you get at the Emiliano for about $250 a night: a massage on your arrival; a luxury apartment with remote control television, DVD player, telephone and air-conditioning all run from a high-technology console in the living and sleeping area; a home theater; Eames chairs; art books; and the choice of eight types of pillows atop a huge bed decked out in 300-count Egyptian cotton and a Hungarian goose-down comforter. A butler service sends two staff members to your room to pamper you by unpacking your suitcase and even checking what wine vintage you prefer. And, oh yes, there are heated toilet seats.
For an extra $140, travelers can be whisked by helicopter from Sao Paulo's airport to Emiliano's rooftop landing pad, avoiding what is normally a grueling hourlong road trip.
"When Idecided to build this hotel, my idea was for a place where guests would be treated in the way I always would like to be served and received while traveling," said Carlos Alberto Filgueiras, Emiliano's owner.
Although he says at least one major American hotelier has inquired about a possible alliance, Mr. Filgueiras says he prefers to stay independent. "The big chains don't know your name, who you are, what paper you read, whether you like popcorn, coconut milk or Bordeaux," he said, stressing that the Emiliano even keeps records on the temperatures that guests set for their air-conditioning and showers. On subsequent visits, he said, the apartments are made ready to fit clients' tastes.
Such an eye for detail is just what makes people want to stay in smaller luxury hotels instead of the chains, said Jonas Siaulys, owner of the Unique, which cost $30 million.
"Our guests are attracted by things like the red illuminated swimming pool, by the round windows, by the fact that the bedroom and bathroom can be combined into one open space so you can watch a movie while you're in the bathtub and your partner is reading on the bed," Mr. Siaulys said.
Modern design is crucial to the image of the Emiliano and Unique -- Unique was designed by the iconoclastic Sao Paulo architect Ruy Ohtake, while the Emiliano's lobby is dotted with chairs made from golden rope created by the well-known Brazilian designers Fernando and Umberto Campana. However, some business travelers might find them simply too chic.
"When traveling alone, I'd stay at the Unique, but with more conservative colleagues, I think I'd go for the Inter-Conti," said Mr. Ferber, the German investment banker. "First, design hotels don't always have fully fledged business facilities. Second, even though it's cheap to stay there at the moment, they look expensive and that might be interpreted as extravagance by some clients."
Mr. Fasano, however, says his clients will not be put off by extravagance. After all, his Fasano restaurant sells more white truffles than any other establishment in Brazil.
But he has shied away from ostentation.
The Fasano is a 25-floor, English red brick structure designed by the Brazilian architects Isay Weinfeld and Marcio Kogan in a style that recalls Sao Paulo's first Art Deco skyscrapers of the 1940's.
The interior decoration is subdued and comfortable, rather than outright opulent. But it is no less glamorous for that.
"We want to give an extra dose of charm and glamor to staying in a hotel," Mr. Fasano said. "Wherever I go, I always prefer to stay in the worst room of the best hotel, rather than the best room in a so-so hotel."

HEADLINE: Moody's Cuts Bond Rating For California 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The bond rating for California was cut yesterday by Moody's Investors Service because of a record $34.6 billion budget shortfall expected in the next two years.
 The downgrade occurred four days after California's top two finance officers met with Moody's and Standard & Poor's in New York to make their case for not cutting the state's rating, citing Gov. Gray Davis's plan for closing the gap. 
 Investors are "looking for significant action to be taken," said Joseph Deane, who oversees $7 billion of municipal bonds at Citigroup Asset Management in New York, including about $1.25 billion of California state and local debt. The Moody's downgrade is more proof "everybody's watching" whether the state can take steps needed to close the deficit.
Moody's lowered California's $21.9 billion in general obligation debt to A2 from A1, bringing California's assessment in line with ratings assigned by S.&P. and Fitch Ratings after downgrades in December. California is tied with Louisiana and New York for the lowest state credit grade from Moody's. Moody's rating has now dropped one level lower than the worst grade during the state's recession a decade ago.
Lower ratings can cut the value of existing bonds and raise future borrowing costs. The impact of Moody's downgrade may be muted because the state's bond prices have already tumbled on concern over the growing deficit, investors said. The state plans to sell $900 million in general obligation debt on Thursday.
The downgrade reflects "an expectation the state will not be able to sufficiently address the imbalance in the upcoming fiscal year" that begins July 1, a Moody's statement said. The rating company expects deficits "to persist beyond fiscal 2004."
Ten-year California bonds yield 4.33 percent, or 0.46 of a percentage point more than bonds with the highest Aaa rating, according to Bloomberg data.

HEADLINE: A Glimpse Of a Future In a New Kind Of Light 

BYLINE:  By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
How many scientists does it take to change the light bulb?
 It's not a joke. The ubiquitous light bulb is quietly on its way to becoming as quaint a relic as the gas lanterns it replaced more than a century ago. Incandescent bulbs, neon tubes and fluorescent lamps are starting to give way to light-emitting microchips that work longer, use less power and allow designers to use light in ways they never have before. 
 The chips -- 18 million of them -- are already on display in the $37 million Nasdaq sign in Times Square. They are in the vibrant facade of the Goodman Theater in Chicago and adorned last year's White House Christmas tree. More notable, the chips are penetrating blue-collar tasks like illuminating traffic lights, brake lights and exit signs. 
Lighting experts expect the pace of change to pick up as researchers continue their relentless efforts to shrink the chips to microscopic size, improve their already impressive energy efficiency and increase their brightness. The chips are expected to move into the general home and office lighting market as early as 2007.
The eventual result, the experts say, will be savings of billions of dollars annually in energy and maintenance costs and a revolution in how people use lighting in homes and offices to influence their moods.
"We are not talking about replacing light bulbs," said Arpad Bergh, a former Bell Labs researcher who is president of an industry trade group working with the government to promote the new technology. "We are talking about a totally new lighting industry."
The vision of revolutionary new uses of light reflects the ability of such lighting, also known as solid-state lighting, to switch virtually instantaneously among more than a million shades of color at the command of a computer. Researchers talk about using the technology to coordinate lighting effects in a theater with film scenes, which might make a battle sequence appear to leap off the screen, or to alter the color and brightness of lighting in nursing homes at appropriate times, which could help stimulate or soothe residents. 
The chips, which are known as light-emitting diodes, or L.E.D.'s, have huge performance advantages in many mundane tasks. In devices like traffic lights, for example, they consume 80 percent less electricity than do the bulbs they replace and last up to 10 times as long. Moreover, they have the safety advantage of gradually fading instead of unpredictably burning out.
Beyond such obvious benefits, though, it is the ease of mating the chips to computers that is driving interest. Programs simple enough to run on a hand-held personal digital assistant can alter the intensity, pattern and colors produced by solid-state lights. Color Kinetics, a five-year-old lighting company based in Boston, calculates that the various chips it packages with computer controls can generate up to 16.7 million colors.
That flexibility is already used in advertising and entertainment. Solid-state lights are featured in numerous Times Square signs and Broadway shows like "Hairspray." Mad Doc Software, based in Lawrence, Mass., has designed tools to link video games to room lighting so that a player in a Star Trek game who is passing a red nebula would have one side of a room shift in color. 
"It's fantastic how much more immersive the game becomes," said Ian Davis, founder of Mad Doc.
Architects and building designers have far more ambitious possibilities in mind, including mimicking indoors the variability of natural lighting as the day progresses. Lighting experts predict that once costs come down, such flexibility will greatly increase the attention paid to the role of light in people's moods and health.
"L.E.D.'s are only limited by what we put in the computer," said Fred Oberkircher, director of the Center for Lighting Education at Texas Christian University. "I'm waiting for the day when clouds of light float across my ceiling."
It may sound whimsical, but Mr. Oberkircher's vision is rooted in research suggesting that people find the rigid lighting environments they normally work and dwell in boring and, in some cases, unhealthy. While most market projections are based on assessing the progress of solid-state lights toward matching the cost and performance of traditional incandescent and fluorescent white lights, some experts say that such comparisons miss the point.
"The ability to do things you couldn't do before is what will trigger mass adoption," said Michael Holt, president of LumiLeds, a leading diode producer that is a joint venture of Agilent Technologies and Philips Lighting. "People will become much more attuned to the mental and health aspects of light in the next 5 to 10 years."
The chips driving the revolution currently cost too much to use in general lighting. The cost of white-light diodes for standard electrical sockets is anywhere from 40 to 100 times that of comparably bright incandescent bulbs, according to various industry estimates.
But like their cousins the microprocessors, the diode chips are continually improving in performance and plunging in price. They could become cheap and luminous enough to break into the general lighting market as early as 2007, according to a technology road map developed by the Optoelectronics Industry Development Association, the trade group Mr. Bergh heads.
By then, the chips are likely to be facing competition in many specialty applications from a newer form of solid-state lighting known as organic light-emitting diodes, or O.L.E.D's. These light-emitting plastics are not nearly as bright or durable as the chips but may prove to be more economic for many uses. Like other polymers, they would be manufactured in continuous processes instead of batch by batch the way microchips are made. They are already being used to light small displays, like the battery-life monitor in the Norelco Spectra razor.
Whatever the progress, experts like Mr. Holt and Charles A. Becker, head of the L.E.D. for lighting project at General Electric's research laboratory, say incandescent bulbs are likely to remain so cheap that they will be widely used for years to come as white-light sources, even though they are quite inefficient and fragile.
Light bulbs, which lighting experts deride as heaters that happen to give off visible light, work by forcing electricity through a metal filament in a vacuum. About 6 percent of the energy ends up as light. Today's light chips are up to five times as efficient. 
Researchers say that further development could double the chips' efficiency advantage. If achievable, these gains would allow solid-state lighting to surpass the efficiency of fluorescent lamps.
The first practical diode, which emitted low intensity red light, was invented in 1962 at General Electric. Red and amber L.E.D.'s came to market in the 1970's as on-off signals and other indicators for electronics and machinery. Using diodes for general lighting seemed laughable until researchers at companies like Cree, Nichia Chemical, Toshiba and Hewlett-Packard discovered much brighter materials and relatively inexpensive emitters of blue and green light in the early 1990's.
Blue diodes were crucial to generating white light, which could be produced by blending the blue, red and green or by shining the blue light through a coating of yellow phosphor. By last year, products built around the new generation of higher-intensity colors and white light had become a $1.2 billion market, according to Dr. Robert V. Steele, director of optoelectronics research at Strategies Unlimited, a market research company in Mountain View, Calif.
The biggest market at the moment is in outdoor signs and in lighting the contours of buildings like fast food restaurants, where the diodes are displacing neon. The nation's four million or so traffic signals represent a smaller market, but diodes have taken over a third of it and continue to spread rapidly, according to Gary R. Durgin, vice president for business development for Dialight, a solid-state lighting supplier based in Farmingdale, N.J.
Buses, trucks and autos have diodes in brake lights and interior lighting. Styling and maintenance benefits are driving the trend, but there are safety benefits, too. Because the diodes light up fractions of a second faster than do incandescent lights when a driver hits the brakes, anyone trailing a vehicle at 65 miles an hour is able to stop about 19 feet sooner, according to a study at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute.
New research fields like nanotechnology are spurring innovation. In July, for instance, Kopin, a manufacturer of semiconductors and electronics displays based in Taunton, Mass., disclosed that it had discovered a way to make millions of pockets just two nanometers thick -- the width of just 10 hydrogen atoms -- in the dust-size light-emitting chips. The nanopockets, as Kopin calls them, help light escape the chip without being obstructed by microscopic defects in the chip's crystal structure. The new design cut the voltage needed to get light out of the chips enough to grab the attention of makers of battery-operated electronics.
As a result, Kopin, which was once unknown in the industry, is gearing up to ship 100 million light chips this year to contractors who will package them with power and optical components for use by device manufacturers.
The first applications, according to John Fan, Kopin's chief executive, are likely to be back-lighting for liquid-crystal displays on portable electronics and night-lighting for keys on devices like cellphones. The chips are so small that the entire year's production could be easily enclosed in a golf ball.
Mr. Fan and other entrepreneurs have been attracted by the potentially huge environmental and energy returns from replacing traditional lights with solid-state devices. One widely cited study for the Energy Department concluded that the widespread use of solid-state lighting by 2025 could cut electricity demand 10 percent and save consumers $100 billion.
Getting there is not a trivial challenge, though. Researchers say there are numerous hurdles to overcome in fields like manufacturing technology, chip design and extraction of the light created in the chips. 
The new technology also requires changes in regulations and standards. For instance, the advertised life of a product line of light bulbs is set as the length of time until half of them fail in tests. But solid-state lighting slowly degrades rather than burning out so the industry is struggling to come up with an agreed standard for "useful life."
While many in the industry are confident about where their markets will end up, the hurdles make it hard to project how they will get there.
"It's easier to know what will happen 10 years from now than 2," said Mr. Durgin of Dialight.

HEADLINE: Washington Talk; 
Conservatives Now See Deficits as a Tool to Fight Spending

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 10 

 BODY:
Seven years ago, before the political ground shifted in Washington, freshman Representative Sue Myrick won the "deficit hawk" award of the Concord Coalition, a group dedicated to eradicating red ink in all its federal forms.
 Four terms later, Ms. Myrick is now an elder in the House and the chairwoman of the Republican Study Committee, a group of the most fiscally conservative House members. But after terrorist attacks and the Republican takeover of Congress and the White House, Ms. Myrick, and the group she leads, have adopted a new attitude toward the deficit they once abhorred. They are not fond of it, and they hope it goes away someday, but for now they say it plays a useful role in fighting off something they like even less -- government spending. 
 "Anything that will help us stop spending money, I'm in favor of," Ms. Myrick, of North Carolina, said in an interview last week. "This place is set up to spend money; you know it's just the nature of the beast. And we've tried to say, hey, we don't have to spend so much of it. And if there's a deficit, that may help us."
Many of the 70 members of the study committee, which is growing in influence, have praised President Bush for proposing a budget that deeply cuts a wide variety of taxes and carries a record budget deficit. In the next week or so, the group will issue its own budget proposal that adds even more tax cuts to the administration's, including cuts in the capital gains and alternative minimum taxes.
Being half in love with deficits represents a remarkable shift in thinking from the group's early days, which were consumed with balancing the budget. Members of the group, still known on Capitol Hill as the Cats from their former name, the Conservative Action Team, were among the strongest advocates for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the committee's chairman in the early 1990's, called it a higher priority than cutting taxes.
"Jack Kemp worships at the altar of tax cuts," Mr. DeLay, now the House majority leader, said derisively in 1997 of the party's best-known supply-side theorist. "Jack has always said that deficits don't matter. We think that deficits do matter."
But now Mr. DeLay supports the president's budget, which has a $307 billion deficit. Several of the Cats cite an essay in The Wall Street Journal last month by Milton Friedman, the Nobel-prize winning economist, which sets out the new theory on the utility of deficits that result from tax cuts.
"Deficits will be an effective -- I would go so far as to say, the only effective -- restraint on the spending propensities of the executive branch and the legislature," wrote Mr. Friedman, who compared government spenders to spendthrift children. On Friday, R. Glenn Hubbard, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, acknowledged that reducing the size of government was a goal of the deficit plan.
Less than a decade ago, that notion would have been anathema to the ambitious Republicans who seized the House from the Democrats. In 1995, the Republican-led House passed a budget resolution accompanied by extensive documentation about the virtues of a balanced budget, saying the benefits included "lower interest rates, a faster rate of economic growth, increased national wealth, increased rate of saving and investment, faster growth in the capital stock, higher productivity and improved trade balances." But now White House economists say there is no evidence for any of that, and many House conservatives agree.
"I think it's clear now that there's no correlation between the size of the deficit and interest rates," said Representative Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, who leads the study committee's budget task force. "There's a much better case to be made that the deficit will force spending down." 
All of this has produced considerableridicule from the Democrats, who now sound more avid about balancing the budget than the Republicans ever were.
"Where have all the Republican budget hawks gone?" Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, asked a few days ago. "They have become the endangered species."
There are, actually, a few left. Representative Gil Gutknecht of Minnesota, a member of the study committee, said he would have a hard time justifying tax cuts while fighting terrorism, improving domestic security and paying for prescription drugs.
"This is a tough pill to swallow," Mr. Gutknecht told the White House budget director at a Budget Committee hearing last week. 
But a far larger number of Cats are convinced that the tax cuts will eventually produce a robust economic growth that will bleach away the red. Given their success last year in forcing significant changes in the House appropriations process, they will probably get their way in the House, at least until the far less ideological Senate gets its hands on the budget. 
"We're not playing games here," said Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin. "We are going to have an impact on this budget."

HEADLINE: ON HOCKEY; 
Sather Makes a Move To Right a Wrong

BYLINE:  By Joe Lapointe 

 BODY:
The trade of Aleksei Kovalev from Pittsburgh to the Rangers yesterday was good for New York, bad for the Penguins and a mixed blessing for the N.H.L. Kovalev is a dynamic attacker who learned his craft with Dynamo Moscow in the Soviet Union and began his North American career with the Rangers. His return to Manhattan helps them correct one of the great mistakes of their long decline since their Stanley Cup championship in 1994.
 The deal was an obvious move for Glen Sather, who has been a blithe failure thus far in almost three seasons as the Rangers' president and general manager. Having replaced Bryan Trottier as coach two weeks ago, Sather used the financial power of Madison Square Garden to acquire an expensive player who might help put the Rangers in the playoffs for the first time in six seasons. Kovalev might even help save Sather's three jobs. 
 Sather refused to confirm reports that the Rangers sent $4 million to the Penguins to sweeten the eight-player deal. He even refused to reveal the Rangers' payroll, which, at about $80 million, is the highest in the league.
Sather's silence said plenty. With the Ottawa Senators and the Buffalo Sabres in bankruptcy protection and the Penguins having emerged from it only four years ago, the N.H.L. has reached a state of financial crisis in the 11th year of Commissioner Gary Bettman's tenure. Few teams can afford a player like Kovalev, who will probably receive a $7 million salary next season through arbitration or negotiation.
As much as Bettman has tried to blame the N.H.L. Players Association for the current crisis, it is Bettman's business plan that has expanded the league market to 30 teams and increased the bidding for good players. It is Bettman who has twice agreed to extend the collective bargaining agreement that he gained after a 15-week lockout in 1994-95. It is Bettman who must explain why N.H.L. owners are occasionally underfinanced and sometimes even in trouble with the law.
Bettman should also explain the league policy regarding money and trades. The Islanders were stopped a few years ago from trading Ziggy Palffy to the Rangers because the deal included the transfer of several million dollars from the Rangers to the Islanders. Mike Milbury, general manager of the Islanders, said yesterday that the different treatment of that proposed deal and the Kovalev trade "does raise some questions about how we do business as a league."
So why was the Islanders' deal forbidden then but the Penguins' deal allowed now? Bettman was not available for comment yesterday, but Bill Daly, the N.H.L.'s executive vice president, said: "The league does have limits. They are not hard and fast limits. Each situation is assessed on a case-by-case basis."
Daly said the proposed Palffy trade in 1999 depended on money and that yesterday's Kovalev trade did not. "The financial issue is important," Daly said. "The bottom line is the Penguins were determined to move this player. They were going to cut the best deal they could possibly get.
"At this time, there is a financial reality to all player transactions. Under the circumstances as we know them, we were not comfortable disapproving this trade."
From a competitive standpoint, the trade is disheartening for Pittsburgh. Now 10th in the race for eight playoff berths in the Eastern Conference, the Penguins have traded their second-best player to an Atlantic Division rival that trails them by 2 points. This tells the ticket buyers in Pittsburgh that salary dumps are more important than winning games. Craig Patrick, the Penguins' general manager, who has made many bold and good trades, got little in this one besides money and fringe players -- no first-round draft choices, no front-line players.
Kovalev, who will turn 30 on Feb. 24, has matured since his days as a confused young Ranger. He shoots the puck more and has learned to taper his skills to the narrower North American rinks. Kovalev still plays with enthusiasm and with gifts that are appreciated by teammates and opponents. From a Penguins' standpoint, this makes the deal worse than the 2001 trade in which Pittsburgh sent a disgruntled Jaromir Jagr to the Washington Capitals.
The Rangers' championship team in 1994 was animated by four Russian players. Along with Kovalev, the other great young one was defenseman Sergei Zubov. But both fell out of favor when Colin Campbell took over as coach for Mike Keenan. Campbell had little patience with them and there were personality conflicts.
Now if Pavel Bure returns from knee surgery, the Rangers will have five players from the recent Russian Olympic team. At forward, they are bigger, tougher and more talented than they have been in years. Despite four games without a victory under Sather, they have played acceptably and have shown signs that their whole might someday blend into something equal to or better than the sum of their parts.
In the larger perspective, Kovalev could help this happen and enhance the league at the same time. With interest flagging and its television picture growing faint, the N.H.L. needs some excitement in its largest market, the one located a few blocks from league headquarters.
While a surge into the playoffs remains unlikely for the Rangers, even the quest for a postseason spot could spice up local rivalries and general hockey interest. Ten of the Rangers' final 24 games are against the Penguins, the Flyers, the Devils and the Islanders. Kovalev is usually at his best in big games against top rivals.
Despite all Sather's mistakes so far, and despite troubling implications for the league over all, the return of Kovalev to Manhattan is the best move by this franchise since the firing of Neil Smith as president and general manager in 2000. As this long, dreary winter slogs toward distant spring, hockey here has a heartbeat.

HEADLINE: Silver Is an Albany Strongman, And It's Not Because He's Flashy 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Speaker Sheldon Silver, the most powerful Democrat in Albany, is having lunch at a tiny kosher pizza parlor on the Lower East Side, the center of his universe, when some local residents approach to ask why they have not yet received their share of grants for staying put after 9/11.
 "The governor has your checks," Mr. Silver says in his gravelly voice, subtly shifting the blame to his political nemesis. 
 Fischer Fisch, an elderly fixture in the neighborhood who has known Mr. Silver since he was a boy, begins to razz him. "When are you going to be governor?" Mr. Fisch asks. 
Mr. Silver looks up calmly from his falafel sandwich. "I thought you were my friend," he says. "Why would you wish a job like that on me?"
The joke has an element of truth. Mr. Silver, who will turn 59 this week, already holds a job he loves, and it makes him a very powerful man. He has ruled the State Assembly for nine years, longer than any other speaker in the last three decades, and has become the de facto leader of a state Democratic party some members think is adrift after losing the governor's race in the last election.
For eight years, Mr. Silver has been the main counterweight to a Republican governor and a Republican Senate majority, the strongest liberal voice in Albany's ruling triumvirate, a guardian of school spending and programs for the poor.
The entire time he has played defense, delaying the passage of budgets and holding Republican bills hostage in a fight to protect his party's agenda.
Some critics say Mr. Silver's stubbornness at the negotiating table is a major reason for the gridlock and paralysis that characterizes the Legislature. He sees holding out for the Democrats' priorities as his duty.
Yet never has Mr. Silver faced such a tough test of his abilities and principles as he does this year, when he must negotiate a way to close an $11.5 billion budget shortfall with a governor who has vowed to cut spending deeply on schools and health care rather than raise taxes.
The negotiations are likely to go far past the April 1 deadline and well into August, according to many lawmakers, among them the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno. Mr. Silver has already set the tone of the battle, declaring that Gov. George E. Pataki is balancing the budget on the backs of students and the working poor.
Mr. Silver lacks the flashy bravado one usually associates with long-serving legislative leaders. He almost never swears, even in heated negotiations, his aides say. He can be prone to droning on in his diesel-engine baritone about the intricacies of public policy. Yet he is not without charisma. He projects warmth when speaking to an audience and he often displays a deadpan sense of humor.
The usual competitive pride that marks most politicians flares up in his voice when he talks about having surpassed Stanley Fink as the longest-serving speaker and having built the Democratic majority in his chamber to 103 seats, its largest majority ever.
Much of the time, however, Mr. Silver can be self-effacing, as if he cannot believe an Orthodox Jewish boy from Grand Street has risen so far in the world. When President Bush shook his hand at a ceremony commemorating the Sept. 11 attack and said he had heard of Mr. Silver, the Assembly speaker responded with an incredulous "You have?"
His acquaintances say he is a wary man, hard to befriend, but very loyal once he has decided to trust someone. Two years ago, for instance, he stood unflinchingly by a top aide accused of rape, when many other politicians might have cut their ties right away. Charges were never filed.
"He has a huge sense of personal loyalty," said Fred Jacobs, Mr. Silver's former legislative counsel. "Some would say he's loyal to a fault."
No one in the Legislature doubts Mr. Silver's intelligence and political smarts. He is a maddening negotiator, willing to use delay as a tactic, brilliant at finding what his opponents need and then blocking it to get what he wants. It is a skill, he says, he learned watching his father do business as a hardware dealer and that he later honed in Manhattan's courtrooms as a litigator.
"There is an art to it," he said. "You have to find your strengths, protect your weaknesses, and find your opponent's weaknesses."
But his critics say Mr. Silver is so focused on the inside game of running the Assembly and winning victories at the bargaining table that he sometimes loses sight of the larger political struggle.
A year ago, for instance, he agreed to pass a health care package Mr. Pataki wanted, even though the governor got the endorsement of a powerful union in return. The deal helped Mr. Pataki at the expense of his Democratic opponent in last year's governor's race, but Mr. Silver was proud of it, because he forced the governor to accept some changes to health programs the Assembly had sought for years.
"He's a true legislative insider," said one legislator who is close to him. "He loves the game. He loves being one of the three men in the room."
Some Democrats complain that Mr. Silver is so concerned about increasing his majority in the Assembly that he sometimes undercuts the interests of his New York City colleagues. In 1999, for example, he allowed the repeal of a commuter tax that was dear to the city in order to help suburban members facing tough races. City officials now face an uphill battle to restore the tax and the hundreds of millions of dollars it brought in each year.
Aides say Mr. Silver cares little about wresting the Senate from the Republicans. Some Democrats gripe that he has never thrown his full energy and resources into dislodging Mr. Pataki from office, either.
"Shelly is very content to be the one Democrat in the triumvirate," said one former staff member.
The speaker denies the charge. "Obviously Governor Pataki thinks I tried," he said. "He's tried to emasculate every program I put forward."
Mr. Silver can trace much of the long track of his life without leaving a four-block circle around the corner of Grand and Henry Streets on the Lower East Side.
He and his wife, Rosa, a schoolteacher, live in an apartment in Co-op Village only three blocks from where he was raised as a boy and where his son's family now lives. Her parents still live nearby. The Bialystoker Synagogue, where he has worshiped all his life, with its dreamlike frescoes and stained-glass light, is a stone's throw from his home. So is the former site of Rabbi Jacob Joseph School, a parochial school where he was a teenage basketball star, and the Henry Street Settlement, where he was a piano student dropout.
"I can stand on one street corner and show you my whole life," he says.
Mr. Silver was born at Beth Israel Hospital on Feb. 13, 1944, the youngest of four children of Nathan and Frieda Silver. He was raised in a five-story walk-up on Henry Street. His father, a Russian immigrant from Minsk, went to night school to learn English and built a successful hardware business from scratch on Ludlow Street. Nathan Silver dedicated his life to educating his children.
"He took care of all expenses. He had only one condition. All the original diplomas he got," Mr. Silver recalled. "He'd point to the diplomas and say, 'Do you like my $20,000 wallpaper?' "
Through the middle of his freshman year at Yeshiva University, Mr. Silver intended to become a professional basketball player. But when he discovered he was having trouble keeping up with his studies, he instead took a job covering the basketball games for several newspapers for $25 a week. He remains an avid sports fan and says he still sometimes regrets not being a sportswriter.
He avoided the path to medical school that an older brother took, graduated from Brooklyn Law School, and became a trial lawyer.
"A Jewish boy who couldn't stand blood," he said. "That's the definition of a lawyer."
Mr. Silver ran for City Council in 1974 while working as a clerk for Manhattan Civil Court Judge Francis N. Pecora, coming in a close second to Miriam Friedlander. Two years later, he beat out five other Democrats to win an open Assembly seat he has held ever since.
His district is the polyglot tip of Manhattan, with its myriad housing projects, tenements, and its Jewish, Latino and Chinese quarters. He also represents the financial district, where the attack on the World Trade Center sucked the economic life out of the neighborhood.
Though he says he has never been poor, Mr. Silver leads a modest life. He usually makes his own travel arrangements and prides himself on getting the best air fares. He binds up his bills and credit cards with a rubber band, because he finds a leather billfold too bulky. He carries two cellphones because he can save money once the free minutes have run out on the first by switching to the second. "That's the business upbringing of my father," he said.
Mr. Silver's idea of a good time is a round of golf in the Catskills or having lunch with his grandchildren in Cedarhurst, on Long Island. On summer weekends, he retreats to his vacation home in Sullivan County, only a few miles from the Pioneer Country Club his family frequented when he was a boy. There he entertains old friends on the deck of his bungalow.
"He's the straw that mixes the drink," said Heshie Oberlander, the proprietor of Kosher Bagel Hole in Brooklyn and one of Mr. Silver's oldest friends. "We do a lot of reminiscing. About the Lower East Side. People. Situations. We try to get the fun out of things."
Mr. Silver seldom shows his fun-loving side in the capital, where he cuts a sober figure in a world of backslapping and instant friendships. His poker-faced reserve sometimes puzzles his colleagues. He is the sort of man, they say, with whom one can have a long conversation about a request and walk away feeling good but not knowing if he has said yes or no.
That quality landed him in trouble three years ago, when some members, led by Assemblyman Michael J. Bragman of the Syracuse area, tried to oust him as leader, complaining that he was too inaccessible and aloof. He beat back the coup with a deft campaign of intimidation and calling in old debts. Since then, he has opened up the internal workings of his operation and cemented his power.
Some of his associates chalk up Mr. Silver's reserved public style to his upbringing in a close-knit Orthodox community, where the legacy of oppression in Eastern Europe has shaped a culture of caution.
"He's basically shy," one former aide said. "There are so many things in the world that he hasn't experienced."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE ALLIANCE; 
Fallout From Iraq Rift: NATO May Feel a Strain

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 10 

 BODY:
The disagreement that split the United States and three European allies today was provoked by the issue of disarming Iraq. But the rift now threatens to undermine the unity of NATO itself at a time of widespread questions about the alliance's future after the cold war.
 It was an open question today how serious or permanent the potential breach at NATO will turn out to be. Despite the current tensions, Europe and the United States remain closely tied by culture, politics and economics. The alliance has weathered similar strains before. 
 Officials agreed that the action today had more political significance than military. "In terms of what we need to do militarily in Iraq, this fight is of almost no consequence," a senior administration official said. "We will be able to get 16 of 19 countries with us. But the symbolism is important. Just as we wanted the U.N. to step up to the plate, we needed NATO to send a signal to Iraq that we are serious."
The current crisis, as the American ambassador to NATO called it, resulted from the rejection by France, Germany and Belgium of an American request for defensive equipment for Turkey in anticipation of a possible war against Iraq. Coupled with the demand today by Germany, Russia and France for more time for inspections, the rebuff fractured longtime allies on the eve of an increasingly likely conflict in the Persian Gulf region. Moreover, as Russia has become an associate member of NATO, the prospect of Moscow, Berlin and Paris collectively opposing Washington seemed to hold ominous implications.
NATO -- founded in 1949 to oppose the threat of the Soviet Union -- has undertaken post-cold war cooperative ventures in the Balkans and Afghanistan and could still play a role in Iraq, particularly in peacekeeping if Saddam Hussein were ousted.
Diplomats and analysts say the division over aid to Turkey betrays deep feelings of unease on both sides of the Atlantic driven by many factors, not simply Iraq. Not least among them is the longtime French tendency dating from the de Gaulle era to chart a course independently of Washington, especially when Britain lines up with the United States.
Now there is a French-German alliance on many European issues in opposition to Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, Europe's biggest supporter of America's war plans.
Those factors have created a level of distrust across the Atlantic that unsettles many longtime alliance veterans, who have seen crises come and go over the decades. 
"What we have is a messy situation but not a crisis, because it is still fixable," said Richard C. Holbrooke, former ambassador to the United Nations and to Germany in the Clinton administration. "But to fix it, Americans and Europeans will have to reach a new understanding that NATO has a vital role to play in the world today."
As the possibility of a war in Iraq comes ever closer, French and German leaders appear increasingly uneasy with what they see as President Bush's bullying, unilateralist approach to international affairs. In this instance, they felt that the administration was, in effect, forcing NATO to vote for or against war in Iraq -- precisely the vote they have worked hard to delay in the United Nations Security Council.
"Our position is coherent," a French official said. "If we are not yet deciding to go to war in the Security Council, we cannot decide to go to war at NATO. Once the Security Council authorizes force against Iraq, it will be very easy to send materiel to Turkey right away."
The Europeans also accuse the Bush administration of using NATO to provide political cover for Turkish leaders who have aligned their country with the United States despite strong domestic opposition.
American officials argued that the equipment that Turkey needs -- Patriot missiles, chemical and biological warfare defenses, and Awacs surveillance planes -- can be supplied by individual members of NATO. The Dutch have already committed themselves to sending the Patriots to Turkey, an administration official said.
Alternatively, there was hope in Washington that with Turkey formally requesting help under Article IV of the NATO Charter, which requires the alliance to assist any member against attack, Paris and Berlin might change their minds. The previous request for aid came from Washington, not Ankara.
But the French and Germans argue that the fact that Turkey can be supplied by other means shows that the United States was seeking a political gesture from NATO, not a real defensive action.
Over the decades, NATO has been plagued with divisions, all of which have ultimately proved ephemeral. 
There were disagreements over the Vietnam War and over American efforts to use NATO bases to help Israel during wars in the Middle East. A pivotal moment occurred in 1966, when de Gaulle took France out of NATO's integrated military command. In the 1980's, there were protracted strains over the basing of Pershing missiles in Europe.
Beyond these disagreements are philosophical differences between Europeans and Americans epitomized by the cooperative new economic relationship forged by the European Union, a political and economic entity in which disputes great and small are painstakingly negotiated by diplomats and bureaucrats.
Robert Kagan, the author of several books on current affairs, put it succinctly in the opening lines of a new book: "Americans are from Mars and Europeans are from Venus." Europeans, he says, feel they have evolved into a postmodern, literally postwar world. Americans, Mr. Kagan argues, understand that sometimes there is no alternative to force.
The current dispute in NATO is "qualitatively different" from past disputes, Mr. Kagan said in an interview.
"It goes to the level of world view," he added. "I don't subscribe to the view that the French are being petty. They believe sincerely that the only legitimacy for action is a legal institution like the United Nations -- a view that I don't think most Democrats in the United States fully agree with."
Today, however, American officials were not inclined to view the problem philosophically.
"There is no logic to the French position," a senior administration official said. "To say you can't agree to this quite limited military move is unacceptable. There is a pattern of behavior here by the French that undercuts NATO's effectiveness. They say we are trying to isolate them. But they are only isolating themselves."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: KABUL; 
Terrorists Still a Threat, U.S. Official Tells Afghans

BYLINE:  By CARLOTTA GALL 

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, Feb. 10 

 BODY:
The American special envoy to Afghanistan said today that it was unacceptable that members of Al Qaeda and the Taliban were chased out of Afghanistan only to be given sanctuary in Pakistan's tribal areas, where Qaeda members are present.
 The envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, was in the Afghan capital to reassure the Afghan government and people of continued American support "no matter what happens in Iraq." At a news conference in the heavily fortified American Embassy in Kabul, he said recent fighting in southern Afghanistan had shown that terrorists, whether from the Taliban or Al Qaeda, still posed a significant problem. 
 "There are some key Taliban figures in Pakistan, and I don't think all they are doing is having tea there and sitting in their homes," he said. "They are probably plotting and encouraging negative developments in Afghanistan. And it is also true there are some Al Qaeda people in the border areas." 
Mr. Khalilzad would not comment on the level of assistance or encouragement the groups were receiving from official Pakistani channels, but said the United States government's understanding with the Pakistani leadership was that the groups should not be given sanctuary.
"We regard the Pakistani government to be a partner, and we will work with them to deal with these problems," he said.
There has been an increase in recent weeks in cross-border activity from Pakistan by militants opposed to the American presence in Afghanistan. Hundreds of American soldiers battled with rebels in southern Afghanistan two weeks ago, and have spent days since sweeping the mountains and caves to clear the area.
Afghan officials complain that Pakistan is not only doing nothing to apprehend Qaeda and Taliban troublemakers, but also that it is actively encouraging them. American military officials have also expressed frustration at Pakistan's failure to contain the cross-border activity. 
Mr. Khalilzad also showed a rare sign of impatience with the Afghan government today, saying it needed to do "more and better" in its part in the reform and reconstruction of the country.
He reinforced the American commitment to assist Afghanistan even in the event of a war in Iraq. "The U.S. is capable of doing more than one thing at the same time," he said, "and resources required for Afghanistan, in its entirety, we are able to deliver on and we are committed to delivering on, no matter what happens in Iraq."
The United States has spent more than $840 million -- in aid money, State Department expenditures and some military expenditure -- since October 2001 in Afghanistan, Mr. Khalilzad said, and will continue the same level of spending through 2003. He added that President Bush would reinforce the American commitment in person when President Hamid Karzai visits Washington on Feb. 27.
But there was a new tone to this visit. His discussions over the last three days with Afghan officials have concentrated on the overhaul and reconstruction of Afghanistan's security, political and economic institutions, and he said the government was not doing enough.
"I would like to have seen more institution building, on the security track, the army, police and the justice system," he said. "There is a civil service commission that has to reform the bureaucracy; not much has been done. I hope and expect it will do more."
He added, "I do hear complaints about the quality of service that you still get from government departments."
An overhaul of the justice system has barely gotten under way, he said, and a United Nations program, supported by Japan, for disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of armed fighters into civilian life, was supposed to have happened this year but had not. The lack of progress on disarmament and demobilization, even in Kabul, had contributed to the unsatisfactorily slow pace of creating a new national army which the American government has responsibility for, he said.
Mr. Khalilzad also criticized the government for its failure to pay attention to the regions. He said the the United States was using its influence to make provincial leaders cooperate with the central government in paying taxes and cooperating on security. But he said the center needed to do its part.
"It should be looked at as a two-way street rather than a one-way street of the regions submitting to the center," he said. "The center needs to do better."

HEADLINE: Consumers in Europe Resist Gene-Altered Foods 

BYLINE:  By LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

DATELINE: TOTNES, England, Feb. 7 

 BODY:
At the Happy Apple greengrocer in this Elizabethan town in England's West Country, the roasted vegetable pasty is labeled, clearly and proudly, as GM-free. So is the hommity pie and a scattering of other products crammed onto shelves.
 In fact, all across Britain and most of the rest of Europe, shoppers would be hard pressed to find any genetically modified, or GM, products on grocery store shelves, and that is precisely how most people want it. 
 Tinkering with the genetic makeup of crops to make them faster-growing and more resilient, something done routinely in the United States with seldom a pang of consumer concern, is seen here as heretical, or at the very least unhealthy. 
In some countries, including France and Austria, there is an unofficial moratorium on the sale of genetically modified foods. Such foods simply cannot be found there.
"It's not the natural order of things, that's all," Heather Baddeley, who was picking up lettuce and avocados at the Happy Apple, said about GM foods. "It's a kind of corruption, not the right thing to do, you know?"
Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, does not agree. He recently called Europe's stance on genetically modified food "Luddite" and "immoral," saying that Europeans' fears about GM foods had persuaded some famine-ridden countries in Africa to reject genetically altered grains. Some Europeans believed that Mr. Zoellick was in effect blaming Europe for starvation in Africa.
David Byrne, the European Union's health and consumer protection commissioner, said: "The U.S. government, including Republican leaders in Congress, accuse Europe of using the issue of genetically modified food as a way of keeping out American exports." "What Bob Zoellick said over the last few weeks has been unhelpful, clearly. It was unfair. It was wrong."
The European Union finances nongovernmental organizations, but it is those groups themselves, not the European trading bloc, that have moved in some cases to steer Africans clear of genetically altered grains, Mr. Byrne insisted. 
"The E.U.'s position on genetically modified food," he added, "is that it is as safe as conventional food."
That may be the official line at European Union headquarters in Brussels. But public sentiment in much of Europe, successfully stoked by environmental groups, is now so fiercely opposed to genetically altered food that in Austria, for example, politicians have won elections by vowing to keep "Frankenfood" at bay.
Many supermarket chains across France, Britain, Italy and Austria, among others, yanked all genetically modified products from their shelves three years ago and are in no hurry to restock them. Most recently, hundreds of Europe's most respected chefs banded together to form a group called Euro-Toques to battle the biotechnology lobby.
American companies like Monsanto stand to make enormous profits if Europe allows the importing of more genetically modified foods. 
A decision by the European Parliament on stricter labeling of genetically modified foods could be made as early as summer, and European officials hope that may make the food more acceptable, by clarifying exactly how it is made. But there is concern in the United States that the labeling will only alarm European consumers more.
The proposed rules would trace genetically altered substances in corn, tomatoes, feed and oils and make it clear to consumers which products contained at least 0.9 percent of a genetically modified substance. Theproducts concerned include highly refined corn oil, soybean oil and glucose syrup produced from cornstarch.
In France and Italy, Europe's two food meccas, public revulsion at GM food runs especially deep.
"U.S. culture is different from European culture," said Lorenzo Consoli, a Greenpeace expert on genetic engineering. "Here, there is a very strong feeling that links culture and food. And here there is much more the idea that science is not church or a religion. It is not enough anymore for European consumers to have somebody with a white coat, a professional, say it's O.K."
A string of food scandals, including the outbreak of mad cow disease in 1996, severely undermined people's faith in the safety of their food and their confidence in scientists and public officials, many of whom asserted that consumers faced no health risk at the time. 
Other scandals -- H.I.V.-tainted blood in France, the spread of mad cow disease from Britain to other European nations, and dioxin-infested chickens in Belgium -- only added to the mistrust.
Although there is no compelling evidence so far that genetically altered food is harmful, anti-GM activists say it is unknown whether the food is harmful in the long term. The uncertainty is precisely what worries Europeans.
Europeans also tend to be more environmentally sensitive than Americans, and environmental groups like Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth carry much greater sway. 
One widespread fear is that genetically altered crops will pollinate and infest neighboring crops, affecting ecosystems in unpredictable, and perhaps irreversible, ways. Environmental groups have turned that concern into a successful campaign against genetically modified food.
Europeans also care more than Americans about how food tastes, as opposed to how long it can sit on a shelf. "For some member states it's nearly synonymous with sovereignty," said Mr. Byrne, referring to the quality of food. The fight against genetically modified food is being led by organization like Greenpeace, which is rooting for a legal confrontation over the issue in the World Trade Organization.
Pia Ahrenkild Hansen, the spokeswoman for the European Union environmental commissioner, said the industry had done a poor job of marketing the advantages of genetically modified foods in Europe. 
"The industry has been incredibly bad about demonstrating what's the benefit," Ms. Hansen said. "Why it would make food production more sustainable. Why it would require less resources. Those arguments are not known by the consumers. People say, 'Why should we buy it?' "
In this speck of a town in the county of Devon, it is almost impossible to find any supporters of genetically modified foods. Three weeks ago, the county council's executive board endorsed a decision to bar its schools and hospitals from using any genetically altered food.
Angry citizens held marches, set up booths and attended meetings on the issue. Residents were especially incensed when Britain began a set of trials of genetically modified foods on farms, one of which is near here. 
One district councilor, Anne Ward, is petitioning the South Ham district here to declare itself a "GM-free zone." Ms. Baddeley, and many other shoppers at the Happy Apple, would favor that without a second thought, they said.

HEADLINE: New York Arts Being Cut Back In Money Pinch 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
New York City has seen its rich cultural offerings seriously diminished by a weak economy, a drop in tourism, city budget cuts and a decline in private contributions following the terrorist attacks.
 Museums, theaters, concert halls, opera companies, public gardens and zoos throughout the five boroughs are cutting performances, exhibitions, days of operation and staff members. This is only the beginning, arts executives say. 
 "It's like a patient whose health is slipping," said Randall Bourscheidt, president of the Alliance for the Arts, an advocacy group. He said the city's cultural decline was growing increasingly urgent. "The strong will reduce what they do," he said, "and the weak will have to take more drastic measures." 
The impact is already widespread:
*The Metropolitan Museum of Art had a deficit of more than $5 million last year and is projecting a similar shortfall this year. As a result the Met has temporarily closed some galleries, raised its suggested admission by 20 percent to $12, reduced its staff by about 40 from its 2,300 and, to increase revenue, introduced a $50 admission to blockbuster shows for members on Mondays, when the museum is usually closed. Future exhibitions are being reviewed with an eye toward cost cutting. "Every stone is going to be turned," said Philippe de Montebello, the Met's director. "We will do what needs done."
*The Brooklyn Academy of Music has eliminated one opera for next season, laid off a senior executive and expects to cut its $27 million budget by nearly $3 million next year.
*The Brooklyn Museum of Art will have one special exhibition next fall instead of four and can no longer afford to pay for staff trips to view potential exhibitions.
*The Bronx Museum of the Arts canceled two exhibitions last year and has eliminated four management positions. "Last year we killed programs," said Jenny Dixon, the executive director. "This year we're killing people."
*The American Museum of Natural History has closed on Saturday nights, cut its $130 million budget by $14 million, reduced the number of entrances to two from seven; and through attrition reduced its 1,700-member staff by 200.
"There's a point where I don't know what will be cut next except programming," said Ellen V. Futter, president of the natural history museum. "And that's a very serious moment, not just for us but for the city."
Michael R. Bloomberg is considered by leaders of cultural organizations to be the most arts-friendly mayor in at least a decade. But he recently proposed an additional reduction of 6.2 percent in the cultural budget, bringing the total cutback to nearly 18 percent for fiscal year 2003.
Kate D. Levin, the cultural affairs commissioner, said the city's arts institutions had made out fairly well, considering the overall economic situation. 
On the state level Gov. George E. Pataki recently proposed cuts of 15 percent to the New York State Council on the Arts, and Gov. James E. McGreevey of New Jersey outlined a new budget that suspends all grants to arts groups. Some city experts said cultural institutions were merely coming down from the high of the flush 90's, when many of them ballooned in size.
"They're not facing Armageddon," said Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University. "They went on an expansionary binge and now they have to be prudent."
But arts advocates say that there is no fat to cut and that the recent budget reductions bring cultural institutions close to the bone. "I've never seen it as scary as it is now," said Norma P. Munn, chairwoman of the New York City Arts Coalition, a citywide advocacy group. 
"We're losing money from every direction. Every source of income is down," Ms. Munn added.
"It's the tipping point now," said Karen Brooks Hopkins, chairwoman of the Cultural Institutions Group, which is made up of the 34 institutions owned by the municipal government or on city land. "We're at the moment when it's really going to start coming apart."
Arts executives argue that the city's cultural health affects its general health because the arts are an economic engine and provide jobs. Hiring and salaries are frozen at almost every arts institution. The Museum of the Moving Image in Queens, for example, recently eliminated its education director; those duties are now covered by the film curator. 
Tourism is also adversely affected at a time when New York City remains a tough sell because of the terrorist attacks. "If you read in your local paper that the city is cutting back on cultural institutions," Mr. Bourscheidt said, "you can quickly get the impression that the city is not healthy and not vital and not the place to visit next year."
Many cultural institutions have already learned to live without city money and rely much more heavily on donations from foundations, corporations and individuals. In the 1980's the Metropolitan Museum received 30 percent of its operating money from the city, for example; now it gets 10 percent. "They've become much less of a partner," said David E. McKinney, president of the museum. "So we're bearing more and more of the burden and have to pick it up and the private sector is unable to pick it up."
Gifts to the Met of $100,000 to $1 million, especially, are expected to diminish, Mr. McKinney said.
Because of the stock market decline, philanthropic giving is in a downward spiral. Real or not, said Ms. Levin, the cultural affairs commissioner, New Yorkers feel strapped. "The phrase people are using is 'psychic poverty,' " Ms. Levin said, "the sense that 'I feel poor,' even though that may not be the case."
Gifts to the Metropolitan Opera of less than $25,000 have fallen off, for example, although gifts of more than $25,000 -- from people whose finances are less closely tied to the vagaries of the market -- have made up for that softness.
"People are looking at their 401K's and feeling the pressure," said Joseph Volpe, general manager of the opera. "I am spending more time on fund-raising than I did two or three years ago."
Reynold Levy, the president of Lincoln Center, who faces a $1.2 billion fund-raising task for the complex's ambitious redevelopment, said he is urging donors to remember the good years. When they tell him how much less they are worth compared with three years ago, he reminds them how much more they are worth now compared with 10 years ago.
"They still have growth in net assets," Mr. Levy said. "There is still substantial wealth in this country." 
Arts executives describe a vicious cycle: cuts in funds force cuts in programming, which in turn makes it difficult to attract funds. "Exciting programs bring private support," said Ms. Hopkins, who is also the president of the Brooklyn Academy.
The mayor's proposed cut of 20 percent to 30 percent to the cultural capital budget means that many of the building projects begun in the boom years will have to be put off or scrapped.
The Department of Cultural Affairs is giving priority to plans that are already under way. "Anything that's in the ground we're holding harmless," Ms. Levin said.
The Museum of Modern Art's $800 million expansion, for example, is proceeding on schedule; the museum has raised $600 million for it so far.
Because smaller organizations receive greater percentages of their budgets from the city, have modest or nonexistent endowments and a limited donor base, they are cut slightly less than are the larger arts institutions. But they are still reeling. 
The New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx has reduced its staff size by 5 percent from 470 employees and is considering a 6 percent cut, 27 or 28 positions, in 2004. And the garden may go to opening five days a week instead of six or to closing large portions of its grounds to save money on security and maintenance. 
The Public Theater will perform one Shakespeare in the Park production for seven weeks this summer, as it did last summer, instead of two plays for four weeks each, as in the past.
The American Museum of the Moving Image usually raises $1 million at its annual gala; this year's gala, to be held tomorrow night, is expected to raise only $700,000.
The Staten Island Historical Society, an outdoor living history site, recently announced a 20 percent pay cut and reduction in work hours for its employees and is contemplating closing completely. "I'm holding off as long as I can," said John W. Guild, the executive director.
The picture is not without its bright spots. Membership is up at many cultural institutions, in large part because New Yorkers are staying closer to home. But European and Japanese tourists -- let alone residents of Connecticut and New Jersey -- have not returned in pre9/11 numbers.
"It's a mixed message," said Maxwell L. Anderson, director of the Whitney Museum of American Art. "The local universe is looking after us, but the tourism decline is still hitting us," he said."The question is whether we can weather this ebb of tourism without making any changes." 
Members' dues cannot compensate for the drop in big gifts, arts executives say. "It takes a lot of $60 members to make up for a $1 million loss," said Ms. Hopkins of the Brooklyn Academy.
While a few groups may buckle under the economic pressure, arts executives say, most will simply try to maintain their operations on a modified scale.
"Arts groups don't tend to go out of business," Mr. Bourscheidt said. "But they tend to become almost inactive. So a lot of the things people look for -- whether a positive experience in personal terms or a stimulus to the economy in collective terms -- just begin to be bled away."

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Tuesday about the way New York City arts institutions are coping with a reduction in income misstated the fiscal year for which the city has projected an 18 percent reduction in its cultural budget. It is 2004 (which starts on July 1), not 2003.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: MADRID; 
Bush and Aznar New, if Unlikely, Allies

BYLINE:  By EMMA DALY 

DATELINE: MADRID, Feb. 10 

 BODY:
It seems an unlikely pairing the gregarious Texan and the reserved Castilian former tax inspector -- but a close friendship has formed between President Bush and Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar of Spain.
 "From the first moment, there was a current of mutual understanding and liking, and an extraordinary ease in the relationship," Mr. Aznar said in an interview on Friday, describing his relationship with Mr. Bush. "And naturally that makes working together a lot easier." 
 This personal bond stands in striking contrast to Mr. Bush's frosty relations with some other European leaders, particularly Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany. The president is often portrayed in Europe as an aggressive unilateralist who sees the world's problems in dangerously black-and-white terms.
Mr. Aznar shares with Mr. Bush free-market economic values and a no-nonsense view of the world. Although European leaders tend to a more nuanced sense of history, Mr. Aznar has no problem in seeing the Iraq crisis as a choice between Saddam Hussein and George Bush. 
Today, for example, Mr. Aznar lined up behind Mr. Bush on the American proposal that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization begin helping Turkey, a NATO member and Iraq neighbor, prepare for war. Germany, France and Belgium blocked that proposal.
"Spain's position is to heed the request of an ally, Turkey, which feels threatened and asks for help," Mr. Aznar said. "We must not transmit a message of weakness to the Iraqi regime."
He is also convinced, as is Mr. Bush, that terrorists will try to use weapons of mass destruction, and that the world community must act now to pre-empt them. "The combination of rogue states and terrorists capable of anything, of killing thousands of people in five minutes without firing a shot -- I don't want a world like that, and I won't accept a world like that," he said.
His stand has contributed to what appears to be a significant reordering of America's strategic priorities in Europe. Countries like Spain, once regarded as more peripheral than Germany and France, have moved to the center of the Bush administration's attention. Others, like Poland and Italy, that have been supportive of Mr. Bush have raised their standing in Washington.
Spain, now a member of the United Nations Security Council, will vote with the United States to support an attack on Iraq and, with Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, is lobbying other European nations to support Mr. Bush.
Washington might expect such help from London, but Madrid has rarely been such an outspoken ally, and some of its support reflects the personal chemistry between the American and Spanish leaders.
At their initial meeting in June 2001, when Mr. Bush chose to start his first European tour by flying to Spain, he went far beyond what was expected by promising to help Mr. Aznar in the fight against terrorism, a priority of Spain for many years because of its violent Basque separatist movement.
Terrorism was discussed at all four summit meetings between the two leaders. "Cooperation on antiterrorism between the U.S. and Spain has never been closer," Mr. Aznar said in the interview.
On the streets of Madrid, noisy demonstrators have waved "Toxic Texan" banners, but in the Moncloa Palace complex where Mr. Aznar lives and works, the center-right Spanish government dominated by his Popular Party has always offered a warm welcome -- in the only foreign language spoken by Mr. Bush. There was even a Bush-style trip to a government ranch.
Mr. Aznar wrote the first draft of the article signed by eight European leaders and published last month in The Wall Street Journal that hailed "American bravery, generosity and farsightedness" in freeing Europe from Fascism and Communism.
"I'm in favor of a strong, solid relationship between Europe and the United States, and therefore between Spain and the U.S., because I think this relationship increases peace and security," Mr. Aznar said in the interview. "I believe that Europe needs the U.S. more than some think, and that the U.S. needs Europe more than some people think."
This does not always play well at home, especially in an atmosphere of prewar tension heightened by popular opposition to a war in Iraq. Opinion polls show that more than 70 percent of Spaniards oppose intervention in Iraq.
Asked about anti-Americanism in Spain, Mr. Aznar said: "There might be people who believe that to ensure peace and security in the world, we must distance ourselves from the U.S., but I don't see it like that. I believe that rifts between the U.S. and Europe have signaled bad times for global peace."
Mr. Aznar's arguments in support of force to disarm Mr. Hussein are dismissed by other Spanish political parties. Most scorn what they see as Mr. Aznar's willingness to fall into line with Washington.
The opposition Socialist leader, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, accused Mr. Aznar of seeking support for "whatever Mr. Bush says." Guillerme Vazquez of the Galician Nationalist Bloc told Mr. Aznar, "You are the voice of your master," while Gaspar Llamazares, leader of the United Left Party, called him "a vassal" of the United States. 
Mr. Aznar rejects this criticism, accusing the opposition of "doing anything for electoral gain." His party faces local elections in May, but he said "I'm not driven by electoral criteria, nor by short-termism."
He said nobody wanted war, but added: "Peace must be based on respect for law. We cannot invent a reality that does not exist. There is nothing more dangerous than a political leader who builds castles in the air, and I believe political leaders who raise false hopes, who don't look at the world as it is, are set to reap failure." 
Mr. Aznar will meet Chancellor Schroder on Tuesday on the Canary island of Lanzarote. Asked if that would be anopportunity to lobby the German leader, who opposes a war on Iraq, he said he hoped to achieve "a convergence of shades of opinion, more unity than before, on this issue in particular."

HEADLINE: Weak Retail Sales Push Out More and More Executives 

BYLINE:  By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
The revolving door for retail executives has really started to spin.
 Within the last month, at least 14 top executives at retail companies have thrown in the towel -- or the sweater, or the Barbie doll -- and people in the industry say a majority of those were fired. Most of the executives left without a successor in place; many of the vacancies remain unfilled. 
 Last week, Kathy Bronstein was ousted from Wet Seal, after 10 years as chief executive -- and a whopping 25 percent sales decrease in January (although Ms. Bronstein will remain on the board). Kim Roy, the president of Ann Taylor Stores, was out two weeks ago. Rob Gruen left the Parisian stores, owned by Saks Inc., on Feb. 3. 
That is far from all. Major retail executives at Linens 'n Things, American Eagle Outfitters, Toys "R" Us, Kmart, Coach, Bath & Body Works, Talbots, Marc Jacobs, Tommy Hilfiger and Donna Karan have all left their positions. Ken Pilot was chief executive at J. Crew for only about five months when the board got the chance to hire Mickey Drexler, the Gap's former wunderkind. Mr. Pilot was out, and he is now looking for a job.
For those who did not leave voluntarily, the reasons are basically twofold: weak retail sales at the end of the companies' fiscal year and increasingly impatient corporate boards. 
"The number is unprecedented," said Kirk Palmer, founder of Kirk Palmer & Associates, a national retail executive search firm. "Although some always leave at the end of the fiscal year, what is unusual this year is both the number and the high profile of these departures."
Hal Reiter, president of Herbert Mines, another national search firm, said that while harsh year-end retail economics usually results in some axes falling, this year's departures are 25 percent higher than normal. 
"More and more, these boards are like baseball and basketball -- at the end of the season, your report card gets read. If you don't have A's or B's, you're outta there."
Tracy Mullin, president and chief executive at the National Retail Federation, blamed the tough economic times, and said that the retail blood bath might not be over: she said she knew of several more major retail shakeouts that may be announced in the next six months.
Mr. Palmer has already met with eight executives who left recently. He said he expected to meet with almost all of them within the next few months, as they return from spending timewith their families -- or whatever they said they would be doing in the news releases.
If the pace of this year's departures is exceptional, so is the politeness. On Feb. 4, Steven Silverstein resigned as president of Linens 'n Things after less than two years. Mr. Silverstein, the company announced, stepped down to pursue other interests. "The decision was amicable," was the way Norman Axelrod, the chief executive, put it.
Companies may have promised to call a forced departure a resignation, in return for those ousted agreeing to go quietly. Or, the board and the former employee may have agreed on the need not to kick up the dust. Or maybe, they just left.
Yesterday, Rebecca Caruso, a spokeswoman for Toys "R" Us, said that Gregory R. Staley, the former chief executive, was not ousted. 
"It was a mutual decision that he and John Eyler reached together," she said, referring to the company's chairman. "With our physical store renovation completed, they felt it was time to move forward with a fresh vision."
Mr. Staley, who announced his resignation on Jan. 20, left 10 days later, Ms. Caruso said. "He wanted to spend some time with his family -- and consider his options."
Gilbert W. Harrison, the chairman of Financo, an investment banking firm, is also meeting -- discreetly -- with some of these high-level unemployed, exploring their options, which might include new leadership roles in companies that Financo is considering buying.
Mr. Harrison cited the current pressure on the country's chief executives.
"With so many store comps down, with inflation and lower unit profits, it's harder than ever to perform -- there's tremendous pressure -- and the boards are less and less patient," said Mr. Harrison, who sits on several boards, including that of American Eagle Outfitters.
At American Eagle, the new co-chief executive, Roger S. Markfield, said that Jay L. Schottenstein, the company's majority shareholder, resigned in December as chief executive but would remain chairman. Why? "It was cleaner," replied Mr. Markfield, "with all the increased scrutiny of corporations." 
"There is no real change of leadership," he said, adding that he and the other co-chief executive, James V. O'Donnell, had already been running the $1.4 billion clothing company "on a day-to-day basis."
The increased emphasis on corporate responsibility is one reason for the high level of turnover, according to Rakesh Khurana, an assistant professor of organizational behavior at the Harvard Business School and the author of "Searching for a Corporate Savior: The Irrational Quest for Charismatic C.E.O's" (Princeton University Press, 2002).
Based on a study of 850 chief executives who were fired in the last 17 years, Mr. Khurana said, today's chief executive is three times as likely to be fired than a similarly performing chief executive in 1980.
Although Mr. Khurana's book is about chief executives in all industries, he cited Mr. Drexler's arrival at J. Crew, announced two weeks ago, as an example of today's revolving-door situation. .
Mr. Harrison of Financo decried the near extinction of the true "merchant c.e.o.," naming Gordon Segal at Crate & Barrel, Rose Marie Bravo at Burberry and Lew Frankfort at Coach as "stars of that dying breed." Nowadays, he said, boards want less brilliant merchandising creativity and more bottom-line expertise. Mr. Drexler, at the Gap, was succeeded by Paul Pressler, who had been in charge of theme parks at the Walt Disney Company.
Neil Fiske, who was appointed chief executive of Bath & Body Works yesterday, does have retail experience from the consulting side: he spent the last 13 years with the Boston Consulting Group.
But industry sources caution bleeding hearts not to feel too sorry for those ousted. A spokesman for J. Crew hinted that Mr. Pilot's severance was healthy; people close to the decision said the package ran into the millions of dollars. (Although Ms. Bronstein's severance package at Wet Seal has not been disclosed, her compensation while chief executive was $2.6 million, people in the industry said.) Not only that, Mr. Palmer predicts most, if not all, of those out of jobs will find work.
"No one wants to hang up their retail clothes and play golf," he said. "I don't know if you can say they'll end up at better companies or not.
" But just a few years ago, most of these men and women were knocking it out of the park," Mr. Palmer said. "When we return to another business cycle, why couldn't they hit another home run?"
Why, indeed? Tim Lyon, a spokesman for the J. C. Penney Company, said that Beryl Rath, who is now senior vice president and general merchandise manager at Penney, was formerly the chief executive of Zales, the national jewelry chain.
She joined Penney in May 2001, and since then, "deserves much of the credit for getting our jewelry business back on track," Mr. Lyon said, adding that jewelry showed the biggest gain of any merchandise division in the company.
"She brought in better merchandise," he added. "She cleaned up the displays, and she solved our distribution problems."
Who said there are no second acts in America's retail business?

HEADLINE: U.S. Ready To End Tariffs On Textiles In Hemisphere 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 10 

 BODY:
As the first stage in negotiations to expand free trade throughout the Western Hemisphere, the Bush administration is offering to lift all tariffs on textiles and apparel within five years.
 The proposal will be presented on Tuesday by Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, who prepared the offer to cover duties on everything from beef to lamps while making special concessions for the poorest nations, a senior trade official said. The goal, Mr. Zoellick said, is the eventual elimination of duties on goods and services from throughout North and South America. 
 But the administration will refuse to discuss reducing America's multibillion-dollar agricultural subsidies in the negotiations because they are not tariffs, the senior official said.
"I think the countries should be very, very pleased with the offer," the official said. "It is comprehensive and excludes no products."
The United States and nearly every other country in the Western Hemisphere agreed in November on a blueprint for a Free Trade Area of the Americas with the goal of essentially expanding the existing North American Free Trade Agreement to all countries in the hemisphere, with the exception of Cuba, by January 2005. The administration proposal represents the first American offer on how to achieve that.
Besides a staggered lifting of tariffs on consumer, agricultural and industrial products, the offer would open up the services and investment markets as well as government procurement, a sector that accounts for tens of billions of dollars of business in the United States every year.
Smaller Central American nations would benefit the most from the lifting of tariffs on textiles and apparel. In two years, all textile quotas worldwide will be eliminated and China will be free to flood the market with its goods. If a Western Hemisphere trade agreement is reached, Latin American countries would have a better chance of selling their apparel and cloth in the United States if current tariffs -- ranging from 12 percent to 17 percent -- were dropped.
"That really is a dramatic gesture," said Eric P. Farnsworth, vice president of the Council of the Americas, a business group. "It will have a serious impact on the domestic market and be controversial."
The countries of what could become the Free Trade Area of the Americas exported $20.7 billion in textiles and apparel to the United States last year.
But Brazil, the largest Latin American economy and a leading agricultural exporter, is the co-chairman of those talks with the United States and is expected to demand a reduction in farm subsidies.
"Agriculture subsidies are the critical issue here," said Riordan Roett, director of Western Hemisphere studies at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies. "This offer is not going to fly unless there is some give on subsidies."
Last year, the United States approved an 80 percent increase in farm subsidies, promising to pay the nation's biggest producers nearly $180 billion over 10 years to grow wheat, corn, soybeans, rice and cotton. One-third of those crops are exported, amounting to a huge unfair trade barrier, according to many agricultural and trade experts.
The administration says that it will not abandon the farm subsidies until Europe does the same through negotiations at the World Trade Organization.
"Otherwise, we would be disarming unilaterally," the senior trade official said.
For the United States, expanding the free trade area would open South America's lucrative financial and services markets, including engineering, legal, banking and accounting services.
To that end, the United States offer includes opening government procurement for the first time. That would not only allow Latin American companies to bid for federal contracts but would give United States corporations a chance to bid openly for Latin government contracts.
Lifting tariffs throughout the hemisphere would help the sale of United States goods in South America, where average tariffs are much higher than in this country.
The Bush administration argues that its offer would lower the amount of import taxes paid by American consumers and that this trade liberalization could lead to a gain of $814 a year for a family of four in the United States.
The poorest nations would be given what amounts to a special grace period. They would have access to the United States market sooner than other Latin nations and be allowed to open their own markets more slowly.
For example, duties on 91 percent of the consumer and industrial goods exported to the United States from the English-speaking nations of the Caribbean would be dropped immediately while the wealthier nations would find tariffs dropped on only 58 percent of those imports.
"We all agreed we have to give special attention to the least-developed nations," the senior trade official said.
Although the American services market is already fairly open, the administration said that making access permanent for Latin American nations would bolster the expansion of Internet services throughout the hemisphere.

HEADLINE: Renters Receiving U.S. Aid To Pay More Under Budget 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 10 

 BODY:
The Bush administration is proposing to increase rents charged to thousands of poor people who receive federal housing aid. 
 The increase would be accomplished by changing three little words in federal law. The minimum rent for tenants, which is "not more than $50" a month under current law, would have to be "at least $50" a month under President Bush's plan. 
 In budget documents sent to Congress last week, the administration said the proposal was "intended to promote work" by people who live in federally subsidized housing. 
Some local authorities have a minimum rent of zero or $25 a month. Under Mr. Bush's proposal, they would have to charge $50 a month and could set the minimum much higher for some or all tenants.
Housing officials in New York, Philadelphia and Tacoma, Wash., said they did not have minimum rents. On average, they said, tenants pay 30 percent of their incomes in rent for their subsidized units.
The proposal is the latest example of what critics describe as onerous requirements placed on poor people by Mr. Bush's budget. Under it, families would face more difficulties in obtaining hardship exemptions from the minimum rent requirement.
The existing law lists five situations in which local agencies have to grant exemptions, for example if a tenant has lost a job, suffered a death in the family or lost eligibility for cash assistance because of time limits on paying welfare benefits.
The current law, adopted in 1998, also says a family receiving federal housing aid cannot be evicted because of failure to pay the minimum rent.
These categories of mandatory exemptions would be repealed under the administration proposal. Exemptions would be granted in rare circumstances, and then only by the federal government. The proposed language says, "A hardship exemption may be granted on a case-by-case basis, as determined by the secretary" of housing and urban development.
An assistant secretary of housing and urban development, Michael Liu, said today that the minimum rent proposal was "a reasonable way to promote work and responsibility." 
Mr. Liu said some people who lived in public housing or received rental aid in the form of Section 8 vouchers could afford to pay much more than $50 a month. 
"We wanted to provide flexibility to the local housing authorities," he said.
The executive director of the Housing Authority of Reno, Nev., David C. Morton, said, "The proposal for a minimum rent, with no cap, would be a major change and could place significant burdens on some low-income people." 
Moreover, Mr. Morton added, the proposal to require families to obtain federal approval for exemptions is unrealistic. 
"As a practical matter," he asked, "what low-income family is going to be able to go through that process to get an exemption?" 
Mr. Morton is president of a national organization of directors of housing agencies.
Local agencies might need to raise rents because Washington recently told them that their operating subsidies could be cut by up to 30 percent in the first quarter of this year. Federal officials said the cuts might be necessary because of a $250 million shortfall that resulted from government accounting errors and miscalculations.
Housing officials in Boston, Philadelphia, Seattle, Tucson and Tampa, Fla., said they were considering layoffs, hiring freezes and cutbacks in repairs, maintenance, security and other services.
After complaints from lawmakers of both parties, the administration said the cut might be 10 percent, if Congress appropriates the full amount that Mr. Bush requested for the current fiscal year.
The executive director of the Tacoma Housing Authority, Peter J. Ansara, said: "Public housing residents should not have to pay for HUD's miscalculations. The proposed cut comes at a time when, because of the economy, the need for public housing is greater than ever."
The White House budget director, Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., said local authorities were partly responsible for the problem. 
"Some," Mr. Daniels said, "have been simply spending money faster than they were supposed to be spending it."
Dorinda L. Wider, a lawyer at the Legal Aid Society of Minneapolis, said the local authority had a $50 minimum.
"If the ceiling becomes a floor," Ms. Wider said, "we will see minimum rents set at varying levels that will be more burdensome to some tenants. We'll see more homeless folks. That is not the government's intent. But it could be the result, because people with very low incomes won't be able to find affordable housing in our market."
Mr. Liu said the minimum rent requirement would not apply to the elderly or the disabled. 
Government figures show that 128,000 households that receive federal housing aid have no income from welfare or work, even though the head of the household is neither elderly nor disabled. About 53,000 of the households were in public housing. The rest received rental assistance vouchers.

HEADLINE: Market Place; 
Oil Companies Are Said to Balk On Production

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Feb. 10 

 BODY:
Despite the last few years of robust oil prices, many of the largest oil and gas companies are hesitant to greatly increase their investments in oil production because they fear volatile prices in the future, according to a study by Cambridge Energy Research Associates. 
 The hesitancy comes just as the oil industry begins to grapple with a host of challenges over the next seven years in nearly every realm, from drilling for oil to shipping and refining it, the study says. And if such caution continues, the study's authors warn, world markets could face possible shortages and the companies could face lower returns on future projects. 
 "I don't think you can call it a crisis, in the sense that the world will keep turning," said David Hobbs, exploration and production strategy director at Cambridge Energy and an author of the report, which is to be released Tuesday. "But there will be shortages, and from the perspective of individual companies, there are potential crises." 
These days, world oil markets are nervously reacting to changing politics, the most obvious cause of instability. The general strike in Venezuela and the growing probability of war in Iraq have lifted oil prices to about $35 a barrel from $25 to $26 a barrel in November. (Crude oil for March delivery fell 64 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $34.48 a barrel in New York today.) Yet even without war, oil prices have been far more unstable over the last four years -- starting with a collapse in prices in late 1998 -- than through most of the preceding decade. And that has rattled the oil industry, which craves stability to plan projects that take years to complete, according to the report's authors and other industry analysts. 
"You have a very tight energy supply-and-demand balance these days, and the smallest shifts lead to large swings in prices," said John Felmy, economist for the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group in Washington. "The markets are tied together more efficiently, which means that they move rapidly together, though they self-correct, too. Yet if you're planning for a 10-year investment, those moves can certainly give you the willies."
Starting late last year and still more recently, as 2002 earnings were announced, several major oil companies, including Royal Dutch/Shell and ChevronTexaco, have announced plans to scale back on increases in production. BP will report its earnings Tuesday, and industry analysts said they expected the company would announce more modest goals for production growth than it set last year. The Cambridge Energy study, Harnessing the Storm, was assembled in collaboration with the management consulting firm Accenture and it involved the confidential participation of 16 oil and gas companies.
The challenge for oil companies, and indeed for major oil producing countries, is to pump enough oil so that there are no shortages but not so much oil that prices fall sharply. That task, the report's authors contend, may grow much more complicated over the next decade. 
The report points out, for example, that Canada and the countries of the former Soviet Union have the vast proven oil reserves to contribute many more barrels to the world market. But obtaining more oil from those countries may become more difficult. In Canada, possible shortages of natural gas needed to upgrade the viscous but plentiful oil from Alberta might slow production, the report notes. Already in Russia, large companies like Yukos are complaining that the Russian government's unwillingness to expand the state-controlled pipeline system, or approve private networks, will soon lead to serious bottlenecks in oil exports. 
The major oil companies have tied their fate in great part to exploration and production in the deep watersof the Gulf of Mexico and off the coasts of West Africa and Brazil. But Mr. Hobbs and his co-author, Paul Spence, a partner in Accenture's energy group, note in the report that the market for deepwater drilling equipment is tightening to such an extent that "operators may have to choose between ongoing development drilling and exploration."
Challenges abound in other areas of the industry as well. Because of the recent oil spill caused by a tanker that sank off the coast of Spain, European legislators are trying to move up the timetable for scrapping old single-hulled oil vessels. That, combined with the need to build more huge long-haul tankers to take oil from the Middle East to the Far East, would call for a total investment of $25 billion in building new vessels by 2010, the report estimated.
Oil companies may have to invest at least $90 billion in new refineries over the same period, the report predicted. The fastest-growing markets in the world, in Asia and Latin America, will demand much more diesel fuel and jet fuel than gasoline, and refiners will have to change their refining methods accordingly, the report's authors said. In the United States and Europe, environmental regulations for new types of diesel fuel and gasoline may require an additional $26 billion to $30 billion of investment in refining. All this spending is projected in a low-margin business that many of the major companies are trying to shed.
Companies must cope with such challenges at a time when their work forces in North America and Europe are aging and few young people are entering the ranks. At nearly every level, from roustabout to petroleum engineer, the oil industry must cope with a shortage of workers. The answer, Mr. Spence said, may be to look far beyond one's borders for new employees, to countries like those of the former Soviet Union, for instance.
For all the alarms sounded by the report, the authors said they hoped it would serve as a road map for companies to avoid obstacles to developing their resources. "Winning companies need to take their positions," Mr. Spence said, "and pick the time to act."

HEADLINE: Bloomberg, With Promises to Keep, Says He Kept Many 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg took the unusual step of offering New Yorkers a report on his campaign promises yesterday, listing those he fulfilled, explaining those he failed to accomplish or postponed and, in a few cases, suggesting that a promise was not such a great idea to begin with.
 The presentation, held next to a tray of raisin Danish in a diner in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, was equal parts annual shareholders' meeting and political theater. It came with a 56-page report that listed scores of campaign promises and their status. 
 "I have always believed that campaign promises are things that you should take very seriously," Mr. Bloomberg said. "If you ask the people to vote for you because you'll do something, you have to make sure that you actually go and do it." 
In giving what he described as a full accounting of his mayoralty so far, Mr. Bloomberg challenged other elected officials to come clean on how well they have fulfilled their campaign pledges, too.
"The public should demand this of every elected official," he said.
Some of the promises, which were culled from campaign position papers, questionnaires distributed to mayoral candidates and his own campaign speeches, were highly publicized during the mayoral campaign -- like Mr. Bloomberg's pledge to require school uniforms in public schools. That idea was scrapped because, his report said, the policy had not reaped benefits in other cities. 
Some other promises most New Yorkers probably never even knew Mr. Bloomberg had made, like his oath to find asphalt areas appropriate for artificial turf to expand the city's play space. (Fulfilled.)
And some were covenants only in retrospect -- Mr. Bloomberg actually opposed a law that added "transgendered" to the list of people protected by the city's human rights law, although he did sign it into law. 
What was by far his largest broken promise -- a vow not to raise taxes, which became the centerpiece of campaign advertisements -- was buried on page 51, where a recent 18.5 percent property tax increase was described as "unavoidable." 
According to Mr. Bloomberg, of the 380 proposals made during his campaign, just over 300 have been fulfilled, been initiated or will be started this year. Only 5 percent were ditched completely. Providing a full accounting was one of Mr. Bloomberg's most urgent priorities in recent months, his aides said.
"We're not here to have a 100 percent success rate," Mr. Bloomberg said during his news conference at the diner. "We're here to do what's right."
Mr. Bloomberg said he would do a review of his promises once or twice a year as long as he is in office. "The fact that we're not infallible or omniscient is not the point," he said, adding, "The public does have a right to know where we stand." 
Mr. Bloomberg chose the Vegas Diner, on 86th Street, as the site for his announcement, because it is close to the subway stop where he met Tony Santa Maria during the 2001 mayoral campaign. Mr. Santa Maria, who lives nearby, had pointed out to Mr. Bloomberg that candidates rarely return to neighborhoods where they campaign after an election, and challenged Mr. Bloomberg to break that pattern. 
Mr. Bloomberg sees his forays to Bensonhurst as a symbol of his commitment to carry out campaign promises. Mr. Santa Maria, who was present for the news conference, was pleased. Asked what he thought of Mr. Bloomberg's mayoralty, he said, "He happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time," an apparent reference to the poor economy that has generated enormous obstacles for Mr. Bloomberg.
The mayor cited his goals of keeping crime low and abolishing the Board of Education as among his favorite fulfilled pledges. He also said he is pleased with his attempts to bring private-sector names and dollars into city government. 
He said he planned to get his 311 call center off the ground soon, and listed building more housing, opening up the waterfront and rezoning commercial land as some of the goals he expected to fulfill. The document is available online at www.nyc.gov.
Political experts seemed to agree yesterday that by inviting accountability, Mr. Bloomberg was going where few politicians have gone before. Mr. Bloomberg "broke new ground in government accountability," said Senator John McCain, the Republican from Arizona, in a statement. "He is to be commended for his straight talk to the citizens of New York City." 
Mr. McCain is a friend of the mayor's, and Mr. Bloomberg's aides yesterday encouraged reporters to call him for comment.
But by lumping a seismic shift in school governance and gun-control measures with things like the creation of a list of services for the elderly, Mr. Bloomberg runs the risk of underplaying his greatest achievements, said William B. Eimicke, a professor of public administration at Columbia University who studied the campaign promise document yesterday.
"I think the idea is a good one," Mr. Eimicke said. "I think surprisingly, for someone who is not a politician, his political instincts are good." However, he added: "The execution falls short of the concept. Why not highlight the top 10 and organize them by tiers? We just got through being on orange alert, and we are looking at simplifying street signs. I'm sure that is important, but it seems trivial."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: SEOUL; 
Reversals in U.S.-South Korea Links, and Some Jagged Fault Lines

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Feb. 10 

 BODY:
With concerns running high over tensions with North Korea and cracks in the alliance between the United States and South Korea, President-elect Roh Moo Hyun dispatched a delegation to Washington for a getting-to-know-you visit.
 As they have been doing for months, however, the two countries -- which have been close allies for half a century -- managed to accentuate their differences, more than narrow them. 
 At a private Washington dinner for the South Korean visitors last week, which was intended as a frank, off-the-record exchange, several American participants said mouths dropped open when a senior South Korean envoy said that if it had to choose, the incoming government would prefer that North Korea had nuclear weapons to seeing it collapse. "Their responses were so far out that all the other planets were all closer to each other than they were to any of the Koreans," said one participant in the dinner. "I sense major trouble ahead in the relationship. The impression I got is that for Roh and his generation, the ultimate goal is to reunite their country and get us off the peninsula." 
The incoming president has often said nuclear weapons in North Korea would be intolerable. But his envoys to Washington reinforced another message, one that many experts see as contradictory -- that Seoul opposes any military action against North Korea, or even penalties.
The very week of the South Korean visit, speaking at a committee hearing at the House of Representatives, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld used the most provocative language toward North Korea since President Bush included it in his "axis of evil." Mr. Rumsfeld, who recently ordered 24 long-range bombers on alert for possible deployment to the region to deter North Korea from producing nuclear weapons, called the country's government a "terrorist regime." 
Many experts say his language will only harden North Korea's belief that the United States intends to attack it once any war in Iraq is completed. What is certain, though, is that it shocked South Korea's governing party, and deepened strains in its alliance with the United States.
"We are closely watching as to what the real intention was regarding Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and President Bush's comments," Mr. Roh's Millennium Democratic Party said in a strong implicit criticism of the United States. "North Korea and Iraq are different. We make it clear that there must be no mistake in decision making."
For the last two months, North Korea's leadership has been working its way down a checklist toward a bottom line that will almost certainly result in a declaration that the country has become a nuclear state. But throughout, diplomats and political experts say, the United States and South Korea have appeared badly divided and lacking a strategy to slow the nuclear clock.
Those Korea experts say that for many months there have been open divisions within the Bush administration over North Korea policy, between hard-liners and those who urge a more conciliatory approach. Over the last two weeks, however, many say that strong signals have begun to emerge that Secretary of State Colin L. Powell has finally begun to assert State Department control over policy toward the impoverished and heavily armed country.
Above all, the new line from Washington was intended to lower tensions with North Korea, and to prepare the way gradually for direct talks. With Mr. Rumsfeld's comments, and more recent statements on Friday declaring that all options were on the table, however, the administration appeared to be reversing itself yet again on North Korea. 
In a highly unusual commentary published the next day, Rodong Sinmun, the newspaper of the governing North Korean Workers' Party, stated flatly, "We predict that the U.S. imperialists may undertake a military adventure." The commentary added, "It is foolish for the U.S. to think that we will sit idle with folded arms to wait until it gives orders for a pre-emptive strike." Veteran intelligence analysts said they could not recall a formulation in which the North Korean news media predicted an American attack.
"It looks like we are back to Square 1, with Rumsfeld, the Pentagon and John Bolton on one side fighting against Powell and the State Department," said Marcus Noland, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics and author of "Avoiding the Apocalypse: The Future of the Two Koreas." "North Korea keeps marching ahead with its plans, and we don't even appear to have a policy."
In many ways, regional experts say, the situation in South Korea is even more worrisome than the apparent policy disarray in Washington. Both South Korea's departing president, Kim Dae Jung, and its newly elected leader, Mr. Roh, are so firmly committed to engagement with North Korea that any coercive or military measures by Washington aimed at terminating North Korea's nuclear weapons programs could end up destroying the 50-year-old alliance between the United States and South Korea instead.
Many who met with the high-level South Korean delegation to Washington described the visit as a near disaster.
Experts say the results of two special delegations sent by Mr. Roh -- the other one was to North Korea -- illustrate what one diplomat called the incoming government's "romantic funk" over North Korea.
Mr. Roh is a liberal one-term legislator with almost no international experience.
"It is not necessarily a bad thing to be a blank slate," said Victor D. Cha, a Korea expert at Georgetown University, who met with the delegation and cautioned against too much alarmism. "Roh is someone who really seems to listen. But this is a test of alliances, and if they can't figure out how to deal with a real threat together, there's not much of an alliance left."

It's hard to see how Washington can successfully manage the delicate nuclear weapons crisis with North Korea without close cooperation from South Korea. But right now, relations between the Bush administration and the South's president-elect, Roh Moo Hyun, are decidedly tense. A get-acquainted visit to Washington by Mr. Roh's emissaries last week didn't help much. Each side could use a crash course in understanding the other's views and needs. North Korea is certain to take advantage of continued tensions between these two traditional allies. 
 Washington rightly recognizes that continued North Korean nuclear weapons development threatens the security of East Asia and, through its reckless arms export policies, the wider world. But while the Bush administration says it wants a diplomatic solution, it doesn't appear to be actively seeking one. In recent days more hawkish officials have floated veiled threats of a pre-emptive American airstrike against North Korean nuclear plants. Today the administration will be asking the International Atomic Energy Agency to intensify pressure on the North by finding it in violation of several international arms control agreements. 
 The view from South Korea is very different. Last year's presidential election sealed the rise to power of a new, more confident generation that no longer fears aggression from the North, believes the two Koreas will soon be reunited and doesn't want Washington spoiling this bright prospect through military action or steps that could bring North Korea's sudden economic collapse. That's a selective, excessively optimistic picture. But it happens to be the majority view in South Korea, and Washington needs to take account of it. 
Seoul's new leaders should take some steps as well. The peace and prosperity that younger South Koreans grew up with wouldn't have been possible without American security guarantees and the American troops stationed in their country for more than half a century. Mr. Roh, who takes office later this month, can help smooth relations with Washington and counter growing anti-Americanism in South Korea by frankly acknowledging that. He must also accept that North Korea's nuclear programs aren't just America's problem but threaten South Korea's future as well.

Qualcomm Plans to Start Paying A Quarterly Dividend in March

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Feb. 11 

 BODY:
Qualcomm Inc. said today that it would begin paying a quarterly dividend, becoming the second major technology company to announce plans to do so recently. 
 The company, which had about $3.7 billion in cash and investments at the end of last year, also announced a $1 billion stock buyback program that is effective immediately and lasts for the next 24 months. Qualcomm had about 783 million shares of common stock outstanding as of Dec. 29. 
 Qualcomm said the dividend of 5 cents a share would be payable on March 31 to shareholders of record on March 14. The company, which said it planned to continue paying a dividend, said it would pay out about $160 million a year if the dividend continued. 
Microsoft also recentlyannounced it would pay a dividend.
More investors, reeling from shrunken stock values in the formerly highflying technology sector, are seeking dividends. President Bush's plan to ask Congress to eliminate taxes on stock dividends has also pushed several technology companies to reconsider their policies against dividends. 
While I.B.M., Intel and a few other technology companies pay dividends, many have long argued that rising stock prices would be a better reward for shareholders. Several have said they would reconsider that stance if the tax laws changed. 
Qualcomm's shares closed down 3 cents, at $37.58.
While other telecommunications equipment companies have been hurt by the sluggish economy and lower industry spending, Qualcomm has managed to outperform its peers and post profits on the strength of its code division multiple access technology, the dominant wireless technology in the United States and the second most common mobile phone technology in the world. 
Qualcomm owns most of the patents to C.D.M.A and licenses its technology and provides more than 90 percent of the chips for C.D.M.A. phones. 
Last month, the company reported a 73 percent jump in net profit for its fiscal first quarter as demand in Asia helped increase revenue by 57 percent. It also raised expectations for chip shipments in 2003. 
Qualcomm has, however, also been the subject of questions regarding its use of the cash it generates, especially since the company has a separate strategic investment arm that invests in telecommunications companies that commit themselves to C.D.M.A.

HEADLINE: Loan Guarantee For US Airways Is Reaffirmed 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
The federal government renewed its approval of a $900 million loan guarantee for US Airways yesterday, moving the airline a step closer to exiting bankruptcy.
 The Air Transportation Stabilization Board agreed in July to the guarantee, which would back a proposed $1 billion loan, but US Airways, the nation's seventh-biggest airline, prompted a further review of its application when it filed for bankruptcy protection in August. 
"We are gratified by the A.T.S.B.'s action today and its vote of confidence in our company's restructuring and prospects for long-term success," David N. Siegel, the airline's president and chief executive, said in a statement on the US Airways Web site. The company declined to comment further. 
The latest approval, like the first one, hinges on several conditions. US Airways must emerge from bankruptcy by March 31, after which it will be able to borrow the $1 billion. The company has not specified which lenders would provide the money.
The conditions also include formal agreement on concessions from the airline's employees and obtaining approval from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, a federal agency, for a strategy for funding pensions. The bankruptcy court will review that strategy later this month.
The decision by the transportation board came two months after it rejected a similar request from UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, which sought a $1.8 billion guarantee. Less than a week after the board rejected the request, UAL filed for bankruptcy protection.
The board's preference for one airline over another puzzled some experts. "You can point to some small differences between them, but it's very hard to understand why you do one and not the other," said Roger G. Noll, a professor of economics at Stanford University who follows airlines. Yet some differences were important to the board, said Harvey R. Miller, a longtime bankruptcy lawyer who is now a managing director at Greenhill & Company, an investment firm in New York. "US Airways had much more productive spadework prebankruptcy and also has done probably a more radical restructuring in terms of reducing its fleet size and contracting its fleet operations," he said. "In the case of United, the A.T.S.B. basically said that the business plan was not credible."
Mr. Miller also gave credit to David G. Bronner, the chief executive of Alabama's state pension system, which has provided financing for US Airways during its bankruptcy. Mr. Bronner's hardball tactics, Mr. Miller said, forced the company and its employees to make sacrifices. "Sometimes it's good to have a bad guy," he said.
The board's decision had its odd aspects, because UAL had once planned to buy US Airways. The merger was proposed before the terrorist attacks, when UAL was in a much stronger financial position. It collapsed in July 2001 after the Justice Department objected on grounds that competition for passengers would suffer.
"US Airways was in trouble before United was," Professor Noll said. "Its financial problems were deeper and predated 9/11. Its sale to United was a semibankruptcy fire sale. It was not regarded as a viable carrier prior to 9/11."
Last week, US Airways reported a loss of $794 million for the fourth quarter of 2002, a moderate improvement on its shortfall of $1.16 billion in the period a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Outside Do-It-Yourself Store, Men Yearn to Do It for Them 

BYLINE:  By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 11 

 BODY:
It is near the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Western Avenue that the inalienable law of supply and demand collides with the rule of law and order.
 It is here, from the first light of dawn until the last rays of light, that scores of Hispanic day laborers ring the lot of the Home Depot, hoping to find some casual work that is in increasingly short supply. 
 Unlike their East Coast counterparts who mill around the doughnut shops and convenience stores in hopes of employment, the West Coast laborers long ago realized that this is not the optimal strategy.
Why not go where the work is? So every morning over the past few years, thousands of men descend upon Home Depot stores from Phoenix to San Diego, Hollywood to San Jose.
This is not the sort of thing the company had in mind. 
"Home Depot is a do-it-yourself center," said Chuck Sifuentes, a company spokesman based in Southern California. "We want people to do the work themselves. But baby boomers are getting older and want the work done for them. This attracts labor that we don't endorse."
In response, some Home Depot outlets like this one have hired private security firms to keep the men off the premises.
Though the economy has headed south, the men have not, as the company might have hoped. On the contrary, even more laborers who have been laid off from their casual jobs in landscaping and construction are gathering in the mornings to fight for what crumbs are left. Perhaps there is a lady who needs her eaves cleaned, or a man who needs some bricks moved.
The show of muscle has done little to scatter this hungry and desperate subclass. "It's a life of hard knocks," said Juan Alvarado, a Honduran whose wife is stuck in Mexico waiting for him to send money that will not be coming anytime soon. It seems that with the downturn in the economy and the increased border security after Sept. 11, smugglers, or "coyotes," have doubled their price from $600 a head to $1,200.
"Some guys don't have money to eat, and our families have no idea what we're doing out here," Mr. Alvarado said through an interpreter. "But I've got a dream. The guys with luck, the ones with no vices, they make it from the corner to their own job. It's kind of rare, but it's the dream."
Those who have no money accept small loans from those who do. The woman who sells tortillas and chicken from a pot and wagon gives credit to those of good character. Some men have given up on work, and only come for the companionship.
"The corner is like a disease," Alex Santos, a 26-year-old Mexican, said in English. "You come everyday, but fat chance."
The men who gather around Home Depot are something like economic groundhogs whose shadows portend a prolonged and bitter winter.
Joblessness in California has reached a five-year high at 6.6 percent, as measured by those filing for unemployment benefits. But casual corner laborers are not counted since these men do not file for benefits and are not entitled to take them. According to those hanging around the Home Depot, unemployment nears 100 percent these days.
Furthermore, a few American citizens now come to the corner looking for a day's wages, a phenomenon almost unheard of two years ago.
Finally, according to the police, idle hands are accepting the devil's work. Street gangs are finding a willing labor pool here to peddle drugs for what amounts to pocket change.
Indeed, the laborers are a shabby lot. While most are orderly and law abiding, a few do smoke marijuana, some play dice, and one in need of a bath and razor sleeps in the bushes.
What the company hopes to prevent at its 1,400 locations is disorder. Whenever a contractor or homemaker calls on the men, a stampede ensues. The wage is nonnegotiable, an invisible floor has been established at no less than $10 an hour, though one Armenian contractor recently tried to play the men's stomachs against their allegiances.
"That's too much," he said with a blank, oddly aggressive smile, standing in Sunset Boulevard, waiting for the crack in solidarity. A few men did consider taking up his offer to paint a house for $40, until the contractor insisted that they come with their own truck. The contractor was hooted off the corner.
When the men do flock toward a car it is an interesting study in self-promotion, whereby a man tries to appear at once hungry and virile, forlorn yet eager. Others, when left unattended, simply roam the parking lot to drum up business, which, according to Home Depot officials, destroys the clean and pleasant shopping experience the company tries to create.
"I'm just doing a job," a security officer said. "I don't want these guys to hate me, but they scare women away."
The company does seem to treat the laborers humanely. The police are not regularly deployed. The men are not prohibited from using the outlet's toilets. In a San Fernando Valley store, a hiring hall has been set up three blocks away so that contractors looking for a casual laborer can find the men.
The security, it would seem, would discourage the day laborers from gravitating to Home Depot, but the sour economy has left them fewer options. On any given morning at the Sunset Boulevard store, there will be more than 100 men, when just a year ago, there were half that number, according to all parties involved.
"I used to hire these guys sometimes," said Roberto Jalbam, a maintenance man who purchased some copper plumbing the other morning. "But I'm holding on to my money now. There's a war coming. The future's unsure. I can't afford to hire them now."
This seems to be the prevalent attitude among shoppers. Home Depot earned $53.6 billion in sales in fiscal 2001, and while the company encourages its customers to do it themselves, the retailer does have a $2 billion network of contractors.
"Those Mexican guys say they can do everything, but they're really just farmers," said Cristiano Moricci, a homeowner loading lumber into his truck. "I tried them before. They're only good for stuff like digging a hole, and I'll do that myself now."
Then there are those whose virtues are overcome by their vices. "They're a pain in the neck," said Capt. Michael Downey, commander of the Hollywood Precinct. "The rebels among them drink and gamble or get picked up by gang members and sell dope for a daily rate of 50 to 100 bucks."
A few American laborers now come to the corner in search of work. They are black, white and brown. They speak English and have valid working papers. Their luck seems only slightly better than the illegal immigrants. Why stand on the corner at all, Mario Cassiano was asked.
"It's pointless putting in an application because they never call you," said Mr. Cassiano, who has a rap sheet. "Anyway, this corner pays the best."
A Mexican man standing behind him, laughed and said in Spanish: "If I was that young and had that English I wouldn't be standing here."

HEADLINE: BP Completes Big Oil Deal With Russians$ % 

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE with NEELA BANERJEE 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Feb. 11 

 BODY:
BP, the world's third-largest oil company, agreed today to pay $6.75 billion to form a new Russian oil company. The deal underscores the growing attractiveness of Russia to foreign oil concerns and could increase the country's already significant role as an exporter of crude oil.
 Under the deal, which is the largest single investment in post-Soviet Russia, BP will merge its assets in the Russian oil company Sidanco with those of several Russian businessmen who own two other Russian oil producers. The resulting company would become Russia's third-largest oil producer. BP will pay cash and equity for a 50 percent stake in the new company. 
 Analysts and companies warn that because Russia is still a difficult and uncertain place to do business, it is unlikely that other foreign oil powers will race in after BP. Few foreign oil companies appear willing to invest a great deal in Russia unless the government creates a better tax regime and a stronger legal system, oil executives and analysts said. 
"All the major oil companies have been active in one way or another in Russia," said Walter van de Vijver, group managing director and head of exploration and production for Royal Dutch/Shell, which has invested more than $2 billion so far in the Sakhalin 2 offshore project in the Russian Far East. "All of us have had difficulty getting our projects off the ground. It's very easy to invest money, but how easy is it to get your money out? The risks in Russia remain."
But Russia may have become too important to ignore. For the last year, the Bush administration has praised Russia as a stable source of crude oil to world markets, while political instability has plagued other regions that export a lot of oil, most notably the Middle East and Venezuela. Russia's oil output grew nearly 9 percent last year, and by the end of the year, the country had overtaken Saudi Arabia as the world's largest producer, though Saudi Arabia still exports more oil.
"There's been a lot of talk about diversifying away from dependence on Middle East supplies," said Stephen O'Sullivan, head of research at the United Financial Group, an investment bank in Moscow. "It's all very well for governments to say. BP is creating a new production province for itself in Russia."
The BP transaction comes as the largest international oil companies have had to acknowledge the difficulties they face trying to increase oil production through their own exploration and production. One way to meet ambitious growth forecasts, analysts say, is for some companies to acquire others, the path BP appears to have chosen.
"The acquisition may reflect the growing difficulties faced by the majors in replacing their reserves," said Mehdi Varzi, president of Varzi Energy, a London consulting firm. "Russia will remain a relatively hard place to enter, but the BP deal is definitely encouraging."
Indeed, the transaction is a major vote of confidence in President Vladimir V. Putin's economic reforms. Foreign investment has begun to trickle into the oil industry since Mr. Putin's presidency began, but BP's $6.75 billion investment is huge, equal to a quarter of all foreign direct investment since 1992. Mr. Putin, in France on an official visit, told French business executives today that the deal showed Russia's economic climate had improved.
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, chief executive of Yukos, who was attending an industry conference in Houston today, said, "This is an important symbolic moment: that one of the big majors who has been working in Russia for a long time decided to make a major investment under the normal national tax regime."
BP already owns several Russian assets, including 25 percent of Sidanco. The company said that by deepening its commitment to Russia, it could lift production at a time when its workhorse fields were declining. BP missed its production growth target this year and announced today that it would no longer provide the market with production forecasts.
BP's 50 percent stake in the new Russian company would bolster its energy production 13 percent and lift its oil reserves 30 percent. It would put BP's output on par with Royal Dutch/Shell, the world's second-largest oil producer, after Exxon Mobil.
BP would be paying $2.60 for each barrel of reserves, a price some analysts called high.
In a statement today, BP's chief executive, Lord Browne, cited Russia's "greatly improved economic stability, improved legal system and increasing commitment to the international rules of trade and business," as reasons for BP's decision to make the purchase.
The company's experience in Russia in many ways mirrors the country's own roller coaster of economic development. The company bought 10 percent of Sidanco in 1997, but quickly hit trouble when the company's Russian managers ran up large debts.
Two years later, another Russian concern, Tyumen Oil, snatched a crucial oil-producing subsidiary from Sidanco in a bankruptcy procedure that BP said was rigged. BP later reconciled with Tyumen. The owners of Tyumen Oil -- the Russian conglomerate Alfa Group and the Russian-American Access Industries /Renova Group -- are BP's partners in the new venture.
The risks are different now. Instead of share dilutions or asset losses, BP executives will face the extremelydifficult task of reorganizing a Russian company. At the heart of that task will be establishing real control over the company itself down through its middle management. Also, a small stake in the assets held by Sibneft, another Russian oil concern, will have to be addressed.
Robert Dudley, a BP group vice president, said at a news briefing today that BP would appoint the chief executive and a team of about 20 top managers for the new company. The agreement also provides for international arbitration in Sweden in case of serious disagreements.
The Russian partners "have said their expectation is that we will bring management talent to run operations," Mr. Dudley said. "It's clear what they want is an efficient, world-class company."
Foreign oil companies have long lobbied the Russian government to adopt a set of laws and regulations called a production sharing agreement that they say they believe would protect their investments better than what is now on the books. So far, progress on the new rules has moved at a glacial pace, largely because of resistance by crucial politicians as well as by many Russian oil companies themselves, which do not want foreigners on their turf. Today's deal appears to be an admission, at least by one company, that it if plans to work in Russia, it will probably have to do so on the Russian companies' terms -- at least for now.
BP began talking seriously with the Russian groups in September, and on Feb. 4 a breakthrough in negotiations led to the final deal, Mr. Dudley said. The new company is expected to produce 1.2 million barrels of oil a day and would include other assets, including licenses for oil exploration off Russia's Pacific Coast island of Sakhalin and networks of service stations, he said.
The news of the purchase sent Russian stock and bond markets soaring. But investors will be watching the new partnership closely as a benchmark of Western success in the Russian oil industry.
"The pace of change has been very fast" in Russia, Mr. Dudley said. "That has given us the confidence to make this investment. We did not take it lightly."

Kiselev passed row upon row of the cars that keep the Russian Far East rolling: Toyota Land Cruisers, Mitsubishi Pajeros, a delivery van from Osaka, and strings of sensible Hondas and Nissans, many still bearing stickers from parking garages in Tokyo.
 Incomprehensible Japanese characters emblazoned on a Toyota pickup truck? No problem. Left-hand drive in right-hand-drive Russia? No problem. Everything sells. 
 "A Russian car, a Zhiguli for example, practically falls apart after 50,000 kilometers," said Mr. Kiselev, the fur-hatted sales director of Montazhny Rynok, described as "the largest car market in Khabarovsk." There was not a Russian car in sight on a recent Saturday morning; virtually all the 414 cars, trucks and vans on the sales lot had already clocked 30,000 miles on the roads of Japan. 
While the United States is the world's largest importer of new Japanese cars, Russia is now the largest importer of used Japanese cars.
With China and many Southeast Asian countries closed to imports of used cars, some analysts fear that Russia has become a magnet for stolen cars, with western Russia attracting stolen German cars and eastern Russia attracting vehicles stolen in Japan. The Japanese police have broken up several theft rings shipping cars to Russia. But stolen vehicles are thought to account for only a small part of the illicit flow, probably less than 5 percent.
Stolen or not, the high-quality Japanese cars are definitely improving things for a population long deprived of decent vehicles -- or any vehicles at all. On the streets of Khabarovsk, to listen to happy Russian owners, these swarms of preowned Toyotas, Hondas and Nissans are helping Russia make critical steps toward a democratic car culture.
"When I was a kid, only top officials had cars -- everyone else walked or took the tram," said Sergei Rudenko, 46, a retired Aeroflot pilot, as he contentedly piloted his 11-year-old Toyota Sprinter, a Corolla variant sold in Japan, down streets packed rock hard with snow. "See that Zhiguli over there? The latest model costs $20,000 -- that's the price of four used Japanese cars."
Children in this city of more than 600,000 play the back-seat game of "spot the Russian car." With Ladas, Volgas and Sputniks increasingly rare, it takes real hunting to find a Russian-made car on streets clogged with Japanese imports.
To listen to Russian and American carmakers, though, the flood of used-car imports is retarding the development of a national car industry and threatening to set back efforts by General Motors, Ford and other foreign auto producers to build modern new vehicles in Russia. In 2002, Russia's overall car production fell 5 percent, to 970,000, slipping below China's production for the first time. Against this background, Ford and G.M. are embarking on rival assembly projects, investments totaling nearly $500 million.
To listen to Japanese consumers, Russian drivers are getting a free ride -- or at least a subsidized ride -- as a result of Japanese laws that encourage owners to sell their cars after three years, giving an artificial lift to the Japanese automakers.
"In Japan, the older the car gets, the more expensive it is to register it," Christopher Richter, an HSBC auto analyst, said in Tokyo. "In reality, it is a subsidy of the car industry."
After three years on the road, Japanese cars face a formidable safety inspection that usually costs around $1,200. This is then repeated every two years for the life of the car.
"Increasingly, after your fifth year, you have to ask yourself, 'Is it worth it to keep the car?' " Kurt Sanger, an auto analyst for ING Financial, said in Tokyo.
Still, Japan's economic stagnation is squeezing this bounty of used cars. More and more drivers are resisting the government's hint to go out and buy a new car. In 2002, sales dropped 2.3 percent, to 5.8 million vehicles, the lowest level since 1986, and there were 40 percent more sales of used cars than of new ones.
Japanese are holding on to their cars longer, about six years today, compared with four and a half years in 1990.
Still, there are plenty of good-quality 'driven only on Sundays" Japanese cars left over to keep Russia rolling. As many as 200,000 used Japanese cars were exported to Russia in 2002, according to an estimate by Toshio Kimura, an executive with the Japan Used Motor Vehicles Export Association, a trade group.
"The Russians like four-wheel-drive cars, strong off-road-type cars, because their roads are not very good," Chuzo Takayama, president of Honda Used Car Sales, said in Tokyo. The high-quality underbody treatments of Japanese cars generally hold up well on Russian roads, where salt is used liberally in the winter.
Officially, only about 25,000 cars were exported in 2002 to Russia. But many more were exported informally, on the thousands of Russian fishing boats and freighters that dock around the Japanese archipelago.
"As many as 7,000 fishing boats come here a year, bringing timber or fish," Mr. Kimura said. "They go home full of Japanese used cars."
Mr. Richter, the HSBC analyst, said: "They just boat these things across the Sea of Japan. They don't have to go too far."
Used cars now account for about 10 percent of Japan's annual vehicle exports.
Most of the cars arrive in the Russian Pacific port of Vladivostok.
"I came across a police car from Toyama prefecture, buses for a kindergarten, and for a Japanese country inn," Yoichi Funabashi, foreign affairs columnist for Asahi Shimbun, the big Japanese daily, wrote in late January of his car-spotting in Vladivostok.
From the Pacific Coast, many cars are driven here, an eight-hour, nearly 500-mile trip that nets the commercial driver only $50.
"At this site, the cars usually belong to sailors who bring them here and leave them until they are sold," Mr. Kisilev said. "We also have buyers from Moscow, St. Petersburg, Krasnodar, Chelyabinsk." For these Western destinations, cars are shipped by train.
"Buyers from Yakutia just drive their cars home," he said, referring to winter tracks on frozen rivers that lead 1,500 miles northwest to Yakutsk, the region's capital.
Car sales reflect the income split between Russia's economically stagnant east and the expanding west. About 90 percent of the Toyotas sold in the Russian Far East are used. About 90 percent of the Toyotas sold in the more European-inclined west are new.
With Russians buying some 480,000 used cars in 2002, about a third of car sales, German models dominated in the west and Japanese models in the east. Thousands of stolen Mercedes and BMW's pass annually through Kaliningrad, a Russian Baltic outpost. Western police agencies have estimated that as many as half a million of the cars in Moscow were originally stolen in Europe.
In Japan, car thefts have nearly doubled in a decade, reaching 62,673 in 2002. After the police broke up several gangs shipping hundreds of stolen cars to Vladivostok, the government recently reinstated an old rule that allows the export of a car only after submission of proof that the registration has been canceled.
Russian automakers have lobbied hard to raise import tariffs. But the public debate provoked a 30 percent spike in imports. The Russian government is leery of angering consumers and at the same time unwilling to protect an inefficient industry. In October, it raised taxes on cars more than seven years old, to 35 percent, compared with the 25 percent duty on new-car imports.
The import surge caused several carmakers in Russia to close assembly lines intermittently, waiting for inventories to fall.
The wave of imports came as American companies were preparing to produce the kind of rugged, affordable cars that one day should be able to compete with German and Japanese castoffs.
In 2003, Ford plans to produce 10,000 Focus cars at a new plant near St. Petersburg. With this $150 million factory, Ford becomes the first foreign carmaker to own a plant in post-Soviet Russia.
General Motors plans to make 30,000 Chevrolet Nivas in 2003 in a $335 million joint venture with AvtoVAZ, Russia's largest car manufacturer.
In the meantime, Russians seem happy to drive their imports, often oblivious to the Japanese messages emblazoned on some vehicles.
A Toyota dealer in Vladivostok once repaired a car that was painted with the slogan in Japanese: "Return the Northern Territories!" The slogan referred to four disputed islands, claimed by Japan, but occupied by Russia as the southern Kurile Islands since the end of World War II.

HEADLINE: Cosmos Sits for Early Portrait, Gives Up Secrets 

BYLINE:  By DENNIS OVERBYE 

 BODY:
The most detailed and precise map yet produced of the universe just after its birth confirms the Big Bang theory in triumphant detail and opens new chapters in the early history of the cosmos, astronomers said yesterday.
 It reveals the emergence of the first stars in the cosmos, only 200 million years after the Big Bang, some half a billion years earlier than theorists had thought, and gives a first tantalizing hint at the physics of the "dynamite" behind the Big Bang. 
 Astronomers said the map results lent impressive support to the strange picture that has emerged recently: the universe is expanding at an ever-faster rate, pushed apart by a mysterious "dark energy."
By comparing their data with other astronomical observations, the astronomers have also made far more precise calculations of the basic parameters that characterize the universe, including its age, geometry, composition and weight.
In a nutshell, the universe is 13.7 billion years old, plus or minus one percent; a recent previous estimate had a margin of error three times as much. By weight it is 4 percent atoms, 23 percent dark matter -- presumably undiscovered elementary particles left over from the Big Bang -- and 73 percent dark energy. And it is geometrically "flat," meaning that parallel lines will not meet over cosmic scales. 
The result, the astronomers said, is a seamless and consistent history of the universe, from its first few seconds, when it was a sizzling soup of particles and energy, to the modern day and a sky beribboned with chains of pearly galaxies inhabited by at least one race of puzzled and ambitious bipeds.
The map, compiled by a satellite called the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, shows the slight temperature variations in a haze of radio microwaves believed to be the remains of the fires of the Big Bang. Cosmologists said the map would serve as the basis for studying the universe for the rest of the decade.
"We have laid the cornerstone of a unified coherent theory of the cosmos," said Dr. Charles L. Bennett, an astronomer at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., who led an international team that built the satellite and analyzed the results.
The satellite was launched on June 30, 2001, and has been orbiting Earth and recording cosmic emanations from a point on the other side of the Moon. The satellite is the successor to NASA's Cosmic Background Explorer, or COBE, which first mapped the cosmic radiation in broad brushstrokes in 1992. The new satellite can resolve features one-fortieth the size of those in the COBE map.
The results were announced at a news conference at NASA headquarters in Washington yesterday and posted online at map.gsfc.nasa.gov/. 
Cosmologists hailed the new map and said it had exceeded their expectations. Dr. Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at the University of Pennsylvania, called the results "wild," and said they had put the ball in the court of regular astronomy to match its precision. "MAP will be the foundation of all cosmology in the next five years," he said.
Dr. Michael Turner, a cosmologist at the University of Chicago, hailed the results as having something for everyone, confirmation of the New Cosmology that his generation had put together and "hints of surprises" for the next generation to figure out. "This is a great time to be a cosmologist," he said. 
Dr. John Bahcall, an astrophysicist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., said the results were a "rite of passage" for cosmology from philosophical uncertainty to precision. "The motley mixture of strange elements that astronomers have put together over the last two or three decades is confirmed to remarkable accuracy," he said, referring to the entry of dark energy and dark matter into the astronomers' world.
Dr. David N. Spergel, a Princeton astrophysicist and member of the WMAP team, said: "We've answered the set of questions that have driven the field of cosmology for the last two decades. How many atoms in the universe? How old is the universe?"
The task now, he and others agreed, is to understand those motley elements, the dark stuff that apparently makes up 96 percent of everything, and what happened in the Big Bang that gave birth to it all.
Cosmologists do not know what dark energy is. One leading candidate is a repulsive force called the cosmological constant, which Einstein created as a fudge factor to keep the universe from collapsing in his equations, and later disavowed. But some theories of modern physics postulate mysterious force fields called quintessence as the dark energy. While the new analysis has not solved the problem, Dr. Spergel said its data seemed to favor Einstein's fudge factor.
The cosmic microwaves have mesmerized astronomers ever since they were discovered in 1965 as a faint radio hiss filling the sky by Dr. Arno Penzias and Dr. Robert Wilson, radio astronomers at Bell Laboratories who won Nobels for their work. The microwaves represent a snapshot of the universe as it was cooling to the point where atoms could form, at an age of about 380,000 years. But water vapor in the atmosphere obscures the microwaves, and so astronomers have had to be satisfied with glimpses from mountaintops or high-flying balloons.
In 1992, COBE confirmed that this cosmic gravy has lumps, the seeds from which galaxies and other cosmic structures would grow. Since then a series of smaller experiments have studied these lumps, which can be used to diagnose properties like the geometry and matter density of the cosmos, on finer and finer scales. These experiments suggested that the universe is flat and dominated by dark energy, but they only glimpsed small portions of the sky for limited times.
The new satellite scans the whole sky every six months. It is designed to operate for four years. The new map was based on the first year's worth of data.
Originally known as MAP, the satellite was renamed yesterday in honor of Dr. David Wilkinson, a Princeton cosmologist and leader of the MAP project who died last September.
In addition to measuring the brightness or temperature of the microwaves, the satellite's instruments, like a pair of Polaroid sunglasses, can also measure the polarization of the microwaves. That ability was crucial to the discovery of the era of the first stars. Like light skipping off a lake, the electric and magnetic fields that constitute light bouncing off an electrified gas are not jumbled but show a preference to vibrate in a particular plane. Last year astronomers showed that a polarization had been imparted to the cosmic microwaves at the moment that the first atoms formed, and the cosmic fireball thus lost its free electrons.
But astronomers thought there should be another polarization episode. When the lights went on in the universe, blazing ultraviolet from the first stars would have stripped the electrons from hydrogen atoms in space. Those electrons, which scatter the cosmic microwaves, would also polarize them again.
Most astronomers suspected that this had happened at about the time of the most distant and early quasars, around 800 million years of age. It was a surprise, astronomers said, to find the stars had formed so early. 
The first stars, Dr. Bennett explained in an interview, were probably monsters 100 times as massive as the Sun and burned out rapidly and violently, transmuting primordial hydrogen and helium into heavy elements like carbon and oxygen and spewing them out into space to form the basis for future generations of stars and eventually life.
The scientists also said that their data was beginning to shed light on a theory of what might have been going on during the Big Bang.
That theory, known as inflation, hypothesizes that the universe underwent an enormous growth spurt during the first trillionth of a trillionth of a second of time under the influence of a brief but powerful antigravitational field that permeated space. Such behavior is allowed by the laws of physics, and it has formed the core of Big Bang theorizing, but the details depend on the unknown physics that prevails at the energies of the early universe -- far beyond the capacity of modern particle accelerators. And so inflation, as Dr. Bennett noted, is often called a paradigm instead of a theory.
By analyzing the bumps in the cosmic microwaves, which according to inflation are the result of microscopic fluctuations in the mysterious force field that drove inflation, along with other data, Dr. Spergel said, the scientists have ruled out one simple version of inflation that is often seen in textbooks. Other versions, he added, fit the data quite well.
"The data are good enough to rule out whole classes of inflationary theories," Dr. Spergel said. That is a boon, he said, for particle physicists, who want to know what laws governed the universe at the beginning of time. 
"It really is a big hint for them," he said.
Dr. Andrei Linde, a cosmologist at Stanford and one of the fathers of inflation theory, and the inventor of the model that was ruled out, said that it was "great" that theories were getting culled.
He said that it was "painful" for him that one of his theories got killed, but that it was good news that several of his other versions were doing well.
Dr. Turner said: "This is the door to precision cosmology being opened. It's the first step in a long march."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES; 
Words of C.I.A. and F.B.I. Chiefs: Dangers America Faces From Al Qaeda

 BODY:
 Following are excerpts from opening statements in testimony yesterday by George J. Tenet, director of central intelligence, and Robert S. Mueller III, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, before the Senate select intelligence committee as recorded by Federal News Service Inc. A full transcript is at nytimes.com/international.

MR. TENET -- Mr. Chairman, last year in the wake of the September 11th attack on our country, I focused my remarks on the clear and present danger posed by terrorists who seek to destroy who we are and what we stand for. The national security environment that exists today is significantly more complex than a year ago. I can tell you that the threat from Al Qaeda remains, even though we have made important strides in the war on terrorism. Secretary of State Powell clearly outlined last week the continuing threats posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, its efforts to deceive U.N. inspectors, and the safe haven that Baghdad has allowed for terrorists in Iraq.
 North Korea's recent admission that it has a highly enriched uranium program, intends to end the freeze on its plutonium production facilities, and has stated its intention to withdraw from the Nonproliferation Treaty raises serious new challenges for the region and the world. At the same time we cannot lose sight of those national security challenges that, while not occupying space on the front pages, demand a constant level of scrutiny.
Challenges such as the world's vast stretches of ungoverned areas, lawless zones, veritable no man's lands, like some areas along the Afghan-Pakistani border, where extremist movements find shelter and can win the breathing space to grow. Challenges such as the numbers of societies and peoples excluded from the benefits of an expanding global economy, where the daily lot is hunger, disease and displacement, produce large populations of disaffected youth who are prime recruits for our extremist foes.
Mr. Chairman, as you know, the United States last week raised the terrorist threat level. We did so because of the threat reporting from multiple sources with strong Al Qaeda ties. The information we have points to plots aimed at targets on two fronts -- in the United States and on the Arabian Peninsula. It points to plots timed to occur as early as the end of the hajj, which occurs late this week. And it points to plots that could include the use of a radiological dispersal device, as well as poisons and chemicals. The intelligence is not idle chatter on the part of terrorists or their associates. It is the most specific we have seen, and it is consistent with both our knowledge of Al Qaeda's doctrine and our knowledge of plots this network, and particularly its senior leadership, has been working on for years. . . . 
The number of rounded-up Al Qaeda detainees has now grown to over 3,000, up from 1,000 or so when I testified last year. And the number of countries involved in these captures has almost doubled to more than 100. Not everyone arrested was a terrorist. Some have been released. But the worldwide rousting of Al Qaeda has definitely disrupted its operations, and we've obtained a trove of information we're using to prosecute the hunt still further. . . .
Until Al Qaeda finds an opportunity for the big attack, it will try to maintain its operational tempo by striking softer targets. And what I mean by "softer," Mr. Chairman, are simply those targets Al Qaeda planners may view as less well protected. Al Qaeda has also sharpened its focus on our allies in Europe and on operations against Israeli and Jewish targets. Al Qaeda will try to adapt to changing circumstances as it regroups. It will secure base areas so that it can pause from flight and resume planning. We place no limitations on our expectations on what Al Qaeda might do to survive.
We see disturbing signs that Al Qaeda has established a presence in both Iran and Iraq. In addition, we are also concerned that Al Qaeda continues to find refuge in the hinterlands of Pakistan and Afghanistan. Al Qaeda is also developing or refining new means of attack, including use of surface-to-air missiles, poisons, and air and surface and underwater methods to attack maritime targets. If given the choice, Al Qaeda terrorists will choose attacks that achieve multiple objective, striking prominent landmarks, inflicting mass casualties, causing economic disruption and rallying support through shows of strength. The bottom line here, Mr. Chairman, is that Al Qaeda is living in the expectation of resuming the offensive.
We know from the events of September 11th that we can never again ignore a specific type of country -- a country unable to control its own borders and internal territory, lacking the capacity to govern, educate its people, or provide fundamental societal services. Such countries can, however, offer extremists a place to congregate in relative safety. . . . 
Iraq is harboring senior members of a terrorist network led by Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi, a close associate of Al Qaeda. We know Zarqawi's network was behind the poison plots in Europe and . . . the assassination of a U.S. State Department employee in Jordan.
Iraq has in the past provided training in document forgery and bomb-making to Al Qaeda. It has also provided training in poisons and gases to two Al Qaeda associates. One of these associates characterized the relationship he forged with Iraqi officials as successful.
Mr. Chairman, this information is based on a solid foundation of intelligence. It comes to us from credible and reliable sources. Much of it is corroborated by multiple sources. And it is consistent with the pattern of denial and deception exhibited by Saddam Hussein over the past 12 years.
Mr. Chairman, on proliferation, it's important to talk about this for a few moments. We have entered a new world of proliferation. In the vanguard of this new world, we are knowledgeable about nonstate purveyors of W.M.D. materials and technology. Such nonstate outlets are increasingly capable of providing technology and equipment that previously could only be supplied by countries with established capabilities. This is taking place side by side with the continued weakening of the international nonproliferation consensus. Control regimes, like the NPT Treaty, are being battered by developments such as North Korea's withdrawal from the NPT and its open repudiation of other agreements. . . .

MR. MUELLER -- As we enter the second year of the global war on terrorism, the United States and its allies have inflicted a series of significant defeats on Al Qaeda and its terrorist networks, both here at home and abroad. The terrorist enemy, however, is far from defeated. Although our country's ultimate victory is not in doubt, we face a long war whose end is difficult to foresee.
Accordingly, the prevention of another terrorist attack remains the F.B.I.'s top priority. Now, the bureau's efforts to identify and dismantle terrorist networks have yielded successes over the past 17 months, and we have charged 197 suspected terrorists with crimes, 99 of whom have been convicted to date. We have also facilitated the deportation of numerous individuals with suspected links to terrorist groups. Moreover, our efforts have damaged terrorist networks and disrupted terrorist-related activities across the country -- in Portland, in Buffalo, in Seattle, in Detroit, in Chicago and in Florida, to name but a few. Furthermore, we have successfully disrupted the sources of terrorist financing, including freezing $113 million from 62 organizations, and conducting 70 investigations, 23 of which have resulted in convictions. . . .
And Al Qaeda -- the Al Qaeda terrorist network -- is clearly the most urgent threat to U.S. interests. The evidence linking Al Qaeda to the attacks of September 11th is clear and irrefutable. And our investigation of the events leading up to 9/11 has given rise to important insights, into terrorist tactics and trade craft -- trade craft which will prove invaluable as we work to prevent the next attack.
There is no question, though, that Al Qaeda and other terrorist networks have proven adept at defending their organization from U.S. and international law enforcement efforts. As these terrorist organizations evolve and change their tactics, we, too, must be prepared to evolve. Accordingly, the F.B.I. is undergoing substantial changes, including the incorporation of an enhanced intelligence function that will allow us to meet these terrorist threats. I'd like to briefly outline these changes, but first, Mr. Chairman, I'd like to address the most significant threats facing this country today. . . .
Despite the progress the United States has made in disrupting the Al Qaeda network overseas and within our own country, the organization maintains the ability and the intent to inflict significant casualties in the United States with little warning. Our greatest threat is from Al Qaeda cells in the United States that we have not yet been able to identify. Finding and rooting out Al Qaeda members once they have entered the United States and have had time to establish themselves is our most serious intelligence and law enforcement challenge.
But in addition, the threat from single individuals sympathetic or affiliated with Al Qaeda, acting without external support or surrounding conspiracies, is increasing. . . . 
I'll tell you, Mr. Chairman, my greatest concern is that our enemies are trying to acquire dangerous new capabilities with which to harm Americans. . . .

HEADLINE: Taking Apart a Toy Fair And Hoping It Still Works 

BYLINE:  By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
When it opens on Sunday in Manhattan, the 100th American International Toy Fair, the nation's largest trade show for toys, will be the last of the traditional extravaganzas that have crammed a year's worth of hoopla and ballyhoo into a single show. 
 Next time around, the event -- one of New York City's most venerable and lucrative trade fairs -- will for the first time be split into two separate annual shows: one for mass-market buyers and one for smaller specialty retailers. 
 The question, then, for New York in the year of the budget crisis, is this: Will two shows build attendance and be more successful than one, or will a bifurcated Toy Fair become marginalized, losing its economic clout?
Cristyne L. Nicholas, president of NYC & Company, the city's tourism bureau, seemed optimistic about the two-show schedule, but not without reservations. 
"If any city could absorb two successful shows, that is New York City," she said. "But I hope the October show doesn't detract from the February show. Toy Fair has been our bread and butter in February, because there isn't a lot competing with it. There is already a lot going on in October." 
According to NYC & Company, Toy Fair has long ranked among the city's top five trade shows, given its attendance and its economic impact on the city, estimated at more than $100 million.
Over the years, the fair has introduced buyers to the Hula Hoop, Cabbage Patch Kids, Tickle Me Elmo and Furby, and traditionally the February show has created a once-a-year synergy of new-product excitement, media hype and investor events. "Whether that goes away with the new plan remains to be seen," said Jill S. Krutick, an entertainment and leisure analyst for Salomon Smith Barney.
 But there are other signs that Toy Fair is challenged as never before.
Major toymakers, for example, have pulled back significantly. Only three years ago, Mattel, the world's largest toymaker (Barbie dolls, Fisher-Price toys), and its archrival, Hasbro (Parker Brothers Games, G.I. Joe), each spent close to $10 million on their showrooms, and in 1999, Hasbro spent $9 million to double exhibition capacity in its building at 32 West 23rd Street.
Next fall, however, Hasbro, the second-largest toymaker, "will not participate in the October show," said Wayne Charness, a Hasbro senior vice president, adding that "it's possible that we won't participate in February either." 
Hasbro is now in the market to sublet its entire showroom to a tenant, and on Sunday, for the first time, Hasbro will not be welcoming hundreds of buyers through its portals. It will stage a relatively small show of toy-and-game highlights for the news media. 
Mattel does plan to attend the October show in New York, and will be present next February with a small show "to highlight key drivers for the following fall," said Neil Friedman, president of Fisher-Price Brands, speaking for its parent company, Mattel. "But we spend far less than we used to." 
Over all, the $20.2 billion toy business is under pressure from a sagging economy, from mass retailers who demand deep discounts in return for toy distribution and from private-label competitors. But outwardly, the centennial Toy Fair will sparkle this year with its customary high-roller glitz. 
Some 1,800 toymakers are expected to place costly bets on their toy lines in hopes that they can catch the eye of more than 20,000 visitors, slightly more than last year. Some 1,400 exhibitors are preparing to welcome fairgoers -- the public has never been invited -- to two floors of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, and 400 more manufacturers will show their wares to buyers in showrooms in the toy district (21st to 27th Streets, from the Avenue of the Americas to Park Avenue South). 
Certainly some in the industry see a future for Toy Fair. Splitting the show "is a smart move, because it's what the market is dictating," said Maria Weiskott, editor in chief of Playthings, a monthly trade publication that, like Toy Fair, is also celebrating its centennial. "I think that it will help the smaller retailers, and give smaller manufacturers a new platform." 
The first fall show -- to be called the Fall Mass Market Toy Expo -- will be held from Oct. 21 to 23 in the toy district. Major manufacturers are expected to present toys to such retailing giants as Wal-Mart Stores, Target Stores, Toys "R" Us and Kmart. 
That show acknowledges a fundamental change in the buying cycle. Given the complexity of their supply-chain operations, the mass retailers want to see new Christmas toy lines in the fall, more than a year before they appear on the shelves. This enables them to place orders early enough for the manufacturers to rev up toy factories in Asia to manufacture vast numbers of new products, then to ship them by sea. 
Then, in February 2004, the Toy Fair show will reappear, expanding to Javits as it has for years. This event will focus on specialty retailers, which include not only mom-and-pop stores and hobby shops, but also grocery stores, drugstores, gift stores, museum stores and even coffee chains like Starbucks. 
"We can't go back to the good old days, when everyone was in the same buying pattern," said Thomas P. Conley, president of the Toy Industry Association, the Manhattan-based trade group that sponsors Toy Fair. "Having two shows, we are hoping that one plus one will equal three." 
Mr. Conley hopes that mass-market retailers will also come back in February to focus more on the wares of smaller toymakers, which tended to be upstaged by the bigger players. "Innovation tends to reside in the smaller companies," Mr. Conley said. "So we think the mass retailers will have to walk the showroom floor in February to make sure they won't miss the next Hula Hoop." 
John Eyler, chief executive of Toys "R" Us, said that "moving to October from February gives us more time to merchandise effectively," adding that his toy buyers could then focus on smaller manufacturers in February. 
Karen Burk, spokeswoman for Wal-Mart, said that the company's buyers were looking forward to attending this year's Toy Fair but would not comment about next fall. 
The first Manhattan Toy Fair took place in 1902, but the centennial could not be celebrated last year because the show was canceled in 1945, thanks to wartime manufacturing priorities. 
For much of a century, Toy Fair provided the equivalent of opening night for major toy lines. Although the fair began in hotel suites, it found a home in the Toy Center, at 200 Fifth Avenue at 23rd Street, in the 1920's and 1930's. 
But now, New York is beset by a fair glut. "Toy Fair used to be the major show, but in the last decade there has been competition from other shows," said Ms. Weiskott of Playthings, mentioning Mattel's exclusive Las Vegas fall and winter shows as well as Hasbro's six-week presentation at its Rhode Island headquarters, and the way that major retailers dictated command performances at their own headquarters.

U.S. Sees Tape as Evidence Of bin Laden-Iraq Link
Senior Bush administration officials intensified their effort to link Al Qaeda to Iraq, led by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who seized on a new audio tape believed to be of Osama bin Laden as evidence that the terrorist leader was "in partnership with Iraq." A1

France, offering an alternative to the United States' drive to disarm Iraq by force, circulated a plan to Security Council nations for extending and strengthening United Nations weapons inspections. A1

The members of NATO failed to heal a rift that erupted over Iraq, causing one of the worst crises the alliance has ever faced. The argument came into the open when France, Germany and Belgium blocked an initiative to begin military planning to defend Turkey in case it was attacked. A17

In the first detailed public discussion of the Bush administration's plans for a postwar Iraq, administration officials told Congress that it would take more than two years for the United States military to transfer control of Iraq's government to Iraqi leaders. A17

Redefining China's Dissidents

Cricket and Politics Don't Mix
The English cricket squad said it would not go to Zimbabwe for its first World Cup game, a decision that amounted to a boycott unprecedented in cricket. Worries about the implications of seeming to support President Robert Mugabe appeared to have played a part in the move. A5

Palestinians Shut In
Israeli security forces shot and killed an 8-year-old Palestinian boy when they opened fire on a crowd throwing stones. Later, in Bethlehem, an Israeli soldier was shot and killed by a Palestinian sniper. The violence came as the army shut Palestinians into their cities. A12

More Pressure on North Korea
The Bush administration will ask the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna to find North Korea in violation of international nuclear weapons agreements. Such a finding would be a first step toward intensifying pressure on the country to abandon its weapons program. A19

U.S. Ambushed in Afghanistan
American Special Forces troops ran into an ambush Monday during a reconnaissance mission in a remote mountain valley of southern Afghanistan. They escaped injury after calling in airstrikes on at least five gunmen positioned in caves, an American military spokesman said. A19

Serbian Leader Indicted
An extreme nationalist leader who still has a strong following in Serbia, Vojislav Seselj, said that he had learned that he was being indicted by the United Nations war crimes tribunal and that he would go voluntarily to the court. A15

HEADLINE: Arms Makers See Great Potential in India Market 

BYLINE:  By SARITHA RAI 

DATELINE: BANGALORE, India, Feb. 11 

 BODY:
Leading military equipment makers from around the globe are aggressively promoting their products to India's huge defense market, with its $100 billion in expected spending in the next decade.
 Scores of companies converged in Bangalore last week for Aero India 2003, a trade show held every two years for aircraft and military companies. They included companies from the United States, Britain, France, Russia and Israel -- countries that dominate the global military supplies trade. American companies had missed the last two shows because of sanctions imposed by President Clinton. Those sanctions have been lifted by President Bush. 
Manufacturers are also pursuing contracts to supply other Asian nations with combat aircraft. According to news reports in the region, Singapore is negotiating to take part in developing the American-led F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and to buy several dozen of the jets, while Malaysia is talking to Boeing and Sukhoi of Russia about new orders.
The most aggressive battle at the trade show here was among military aircraft makers from Britain, Russia and the United States over a multibillion-dollar order to supply 66 advanced jet trainers to the Indian military. The Indian defense minister, George Fernandes, indicated at the show that India's government was about to make a final decision on the purchase.
The jets under consideration include the Hawk ZJ100 from BAE Systems of Britain, the MIG-AT from Russia and the L159B trainer made by the Czech state-run company Aero Vodochody, which is 35 percent owned by the Boeing Company. Lockheed Martin indicated that it might bid with its T-50 being co-developed with South Korea.
Russia, which has been India's leading supplier of military equipment, holds more than half of the Indian market.
"There aren't any large markets for American defense companies to sell to, bar India and China," said Air Marshal Philip Rajkumar, director of the Aeronautical Development Agency, an autonomous body under India's defense department that is developing the light combat aircraft. "With Americans wary of China, India really is the only market."
Given India's recent hostilities with Pakistan, the country is equipping itself for both conventional and nuclear warfare, with a substantial military budget. This year, for instance, India has allotted 650 billion rupees ($17 billion) for military spending. "The attractive market is making companies push very hard," said Dr. V. S. Arunachalam, former military adviser to the Indian government and now a professor at the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
India imported military equipment worth $7.2 billion from 1998 to 2001, second only to the United Arab Emirates, which bought $10.8 billion in that period. In the next decade, India is expected to be the world's largest importer.
There is considerable competition to fill India's civilian aircraft needs as well, with the world's two main builders of passenger jets, Airbus Industrie, which is based in France, and Boeing vying for India's growing passenger airline market.
Representatives of the two companies attended last week's trade show here not only to market their planes but to lobby the Indian government, which runs the country's two biggest airlines, Indian Airlines and Air India. Both airlines are contemplating large purchases. Indian Airlines and Airbus agreed to a $2.1 billion, 43-plane deal in March but have not yet received government approval.
The French prime minister, Jean-Pierre Raffarin, and the British defense procurement minister, Lord Bach, led their countries' delegations. They also lobbied for military orders, hoping to take market share from Russia.
United States foreign policy has until recently restricted sales to India by American makers of military hardware, because the country had developed nuclear weapons. But relations between the countries have shifted significantly. Restrictions on supplying military equipment have been lifted; the two nations even held joint military exercises last year.
According to an Indian military official, India has a wish list of equipment from the United States, including high-altitude aircraft made by Lockheed Martin, Lockheed's precision-guided munitions or smart bombs, and surveillance equipment from Raytheon and other manufacturers.
"But anything we want from the United States goes through a very complex process," said Dr. Arunachalam, the Carnegie Mellon professor. "Between most countries, trade improves politics. But with the case of the U.S. and India, policy guides trade and technology transfer."
Other countries are also determined not to waste any sales opportunities. Russia hopes to sell India its Admiral Gorshkov aircraft carrier this year, as well as fighter jets, anti-submarine helicopters, long-range bombers and multiple-launching rocket systems. France is negotiating to sell 6 Scorpene submarines and 130 Mirage-2000H fighters. Israel is offering its Phalcon early-warning radar systems.
American makers of military equipment have been eager to join the race. The first major sale has already been struck, with Raytheon signing a $142.4 million deal to supply AN/TPQ-37 weapon-locating radars. The company presented its missile defense and naval systems at the Bangalore trade show.
"The potential in this market is significant," said Dennys S. Plessas, a vice president of Lockheed Martin, which wants to sell its C-130J Hercules heavy-lift aircraft and the P-3 Orion maritime reconnaissance aircraft to India. Lockheed is also offering its F-16 fighters to replace India's aged MIG-21 fighter jets, in competition with the French Mirage-2000 jets.
And many Indian officials say the American companies are likely to get their share.
"The door between India and the United States was firmly closed, but it is now beginning to open," said Dr. V. K. Atre, scientific adviser to India's defense minister. "By the end of 2003, there should be a lot of positive movement."

 BODY:
A CONSUMERS' REPUBLIC
The Politics of Mass Consumption in Postwar America
By Lizabeth Cohen
567 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $35.
 When President Bush called on Americans to go shopping to help the country recover from the trauma of the 9/11 attacks, it was the consummate evocation of consumption as patriotism. In our country's earlier days a president might have called for parades to stoke up patriotic fervor after such an attack, or for the sacrifice of blood and treasure. But President Bush conflated patriotism with shopping. Maxing out your credit cards at the mall wasn't self-indulgence, it was a way to get back at Osama bin Laden. 
 But the concept of consumption as public service didn't begin in September 2001. As Lizabeth Cohen writes in "A Consumers' Republic," when World War II ended, Americans were encouraged to consume as much as possible in order to do well for themselves and do good for the economy. When the war came to a close in 1945, the Great Depression was still a recent memory. The Depression had lingered until our huge military buildup and mass inductions into the armed forces produced full employment.
Many economists feared the Depression would resume when military spending was cut back at war's end. Instead Americans spent their way to national prosperity. "Satisfying personal material wants actually served thenational interest," Ms. Cohen writes insightfully, "since economic recovery . . . depended on a dynamic mass consumption economy." 
Ms. Cohen argues that consumers have remade American society over the past six decades. "I have put Americans' encounter with mass consumption at the center of my analysis," she writes. "I am convinced that Americans after World War II saw their nation as the model for the world of a society committed to mass consumption and what were assumed to be its far-reaching benefits" of material bounty, equality and a steadily rising standard of living.
Ms. Cohen is a history professor at Harvard, and some of her writing seems a bit esoteric for a lay audience. She distinguishes between "citizen consumers" who put market power to work in ways that she approves of, and "purchaser consumers," who are just looking after their own interests. The citizen consumers are the enlightened ones, while the rest of us are purchaser consumers. 
But despite its occasionally infelicitous language and obscure allusions, you have to admire the concept of this book. It's an ambitious attempt to fuse deep scholarship with journalistic reporting techniques to produce a work accessible to general readers who have to be enticed into reading it because, unlike students, they won't be tested on the material. The index and notes sections of "A Consumers' Republic" are more than a third as long as the text, evidence of how much research went into it. 
The book is full of useful insights. Ms. Cohen writes astutely about targeted marketing, which helped segment American suburbs by class and race and today is helping specialized publications and niche cable television channels draw customers from general-circulation publications and from the Big Four networks. Politicians engage in niche marketing as well, she writes, which helps explain why single-issue politics have become popular and the concept of sacrificing one's individual needs for the common good seems to be going out of style. 
Many of her points are well taken, if a bit familiar. In cities mass transportation made jobs accessible to all. But when employment began moving to the suburbs to follow the population, carless urban dwellers were at a horrible disadvantage in finding and keeping good jobs. Retailers in the suburbs could hire suburbanites part time, undercutting unions and helping to hold down wages and benefits. 
Then there's her view of the G.I. Bill, which is widely admired for having allowed millions of veterans to upgrade their educations at government expense. Ms. Cohen shows, in exhaustive detail, how most whites were accepted with open arms when they applied for benefits, but many blacks were turned away. 
But there are problems with "A Consumers' Republic." For starters, Ms. Cohen sets extremely high goals for the consumer's republic -- prosperity for all and racial equality and gender equality -- and then faults the republic for not achieving the goals she set.
Large portions of this book are about the supposed perfidy of the suburbs, which Ms. Cohen castigates for being largely segregated by race and income. Fair point. But many American cities are segregated and segmented, too. And cities also contain consumers. 
Worse, "A Consumers' Republic" suffers from a severe case of political correctness. Almost every chapter has separate sections devoted to women and blacks, as if women and blacks must always be treated as creatures totally separate from white males. 
Ms. Cohen, who in a December op-ed article in The New York Times referred to the 1967 Newark "race riots," doesn't use that term in this book. In true politically correct fashion, she talks about "race rebellion" or "civil unrest" or "urban rebellions," never riots.
She notes, correctly, that the Newark riots were touched off in part by New Jersey's condemning property to expand its medical school. But she doesn't update us, which she could have done: the school has become a major employer of Newark residents. 
And finally there's the lament about how Newark, a focus of her book, spent fewer dollars per student in 1960 than nearby, upscale Millburn, despite Newark residents' paying higher property tax rates. But this is 2003, and Newark schools spend 27 percent more per student than Millburn because the state sends Newark 200 times as much school aid as Millburn gets. (These numbers are on the New Jersey Education Department's Web site.)
For the most part, though, Ms. Cohen does a good job of setting out problems. What she fails to appreciate, I think, is that America is marvelously adaptable. It changes. The problems of yesterday aren't necessarily the problems of today. That's something readers -- and historians -- should keep in mind.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: ASIAN ARENA; 
U.S. to Ask Atom Agency To Chastise North Korea

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 11 

 BODY:
With its policy toward North Korea under fire in Congress and many Asian capitals, the Bush administration on Wednesday will ask the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna to find Pyongyang in violation of international nuclear weapons agreements.
 Such a finding would be a crucial first step toward intensifying international pressure on North Korea to abandon its weapons program, which the Bush administration has pledged to halt through diplomatic rather than military means. 
 North Korea has taken steps recently that could enable it to build as many as half a dozen nuclear weapons within months, American officials say.
If the agency's 35-member board finds that North Korea is out of compliance, the agency will send the matter to the United Nations Security Council for action, which could include economic sanctions. 
Such a decision by the agency is widely expected, though Russia has threatened to vote against it on the ground that it could worsen North Korea's intransigence.
"We have all of our options available to us," Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said today in testimony before Congress. "The option we're pushing is a diplomatic one, and we want to do it within a multilateral framework."
For the administration, which has been sharply criticized by Republicans and Democrats in Congress for not doing enough on North Korea, the vote in Vienna has become a focal point for its diplomatic energies.
Administration officials have said they want the issue brought before the Security Council to focus higher-level international attention on North Korea's weapons programs. But they also hope to send a clear message to North Korea that the dispute will not be resolved through one-on-one talks with the United States, as Pyongyang has demanded, the officials said.
"This is something we've sought for some time," a senior administration official said. "What the North has done is not just a bilateral dispute with the United States, and it's not just a crisis in Northeast Asia. This is a direct challenge to the basis of the nonproliferation regime."
Still, Democratic critics of President Bush have asserted that having the Security Council take up the issue is not enough to break the impasse, and they have accused the administration of pushing North Korea to the back burner while focusing its attention on Iraq.
Even senior Republicans in Congress, including Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, the Foreign Relations Committee chairman, have questioned whether the administration's efforts are adequate to the crisis, calling on the White House to open direct talks with North Korea as soon as possible.
"There needs to be informal dialogue," said Representative Curt Weldon, a Republican from Pennsylvania. "That's the biggest problem now. No one is having discussions."
The administration has said it will not talk directly with North Korea about mutual security agreements or economic aid until the North begins dismantling its weapons program. Pyongyang has rejected those terms.
Despite a vigorous lobbying campaign by the administration, including phone calls from Mr. Bush and Mr. Powell to their Russian counterparts, Moscow remained on the fence today, Western diplomats said.
Russia, which has also joined France and Germany in opposing military action to disarm Iraq, contends that referring the North Korean issue to the Security Council now would only provoke the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, and inflame the crisis. It has called for delaying action to allow time for its own diplomatic initiatives to Pyongyang, Western and Russian diplomats said.
Russia's deputy foreign minister for Asian affairs, Aleksandr P. Losyukov, said Russia planned "numerous steps" to encourage the United States and North Korea to begin talks over the nuclear issue. 
Mr. Losyukov, who met for six hours with Kim Jong Il last month, did not directly address the meeting in Vienna but strongly suggested that Russia's diplomacy, which so far has not produced any breakthroughs, should be given more time.
"We feel there is potential for dialogue between the United States and North Korea and believe that this chance should be used before making any important decisions," he said today in a statement to the Interfax news agency.
Mr. Bush also called President Jiang Zemin of China last week to urge him to help the United States resolve the North Korean standoff. Western diplomats say it now appears that China will support referring the North Korea issue to the Security Council, though American officials contend that China can do more to pressure Mr. Kim to dismantle his weapons program.
Though the board of the atomic energy agency prefers to work by consensus, American officials said they would push for passage of a resolution on North Korea even if Russia votes no, asserting that the other member nations supported the United States position.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: AMMAN; 
Jordan Pressing U.S. to Offer Exile to Hussein And His Aides if They Yield Power in Iraq

BYLINE:  By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Feb. 11 

 BODY:
Officials at high levels of Jordan's government say they are pressing the United States to offer President Saddam Hussein and perhaps 50 of his top aides a guarantee of safe haven elsewhere in the Arab world if they will quit power in Iraq.
 The idea of offering the Iraqi leadership exile is not new. It was floated last month by Saudi Arabian officials, and endorsed by senior figures in the Bush administration, including Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld. But the proposal failed to gain momentum after it was contemptuously rejected by Iraqi officials, and implicitly by Mr. Hussein himself, in statements vowing to defeat an American invasion. 
But top Jordanian officials say they are pushing for incorporation of the idea in any new resolution on Iraq by the United Nations Security Council -- not so much because they believe Mr. Hussein will accept it, but because they are almost certain he will not.
These officials, who declined to be further identified, said that by rejecting a formal offer of exile from the top body of the United Nations, Mr. Hussein would isolate himself from other senior Iraqi leaders, thus increasing the chances of a move to kill or overthrow him.
In part, the significance of Jordan's advocacy of exile for Mr. Hussein and other Iraqi officials is that a neighboring Arab state heavily dependent on economic ties to Baghdad and cheap Iraqi oil has effectively abandoned any moves to preserve the current Iraqi leaders in place.
At senior levels of the Amman government, officials say they regard an American attack on Iraq as unstoppable, and have moved beyond diplomatic maneuvering that might keep Mr. Hussein in power to a more "pragmatic" approach that seeks to accomplish Mr. Hussein's ouster without a war.
The Jordanians say they have discussed the idea with other Arab leaders, and found broad acceptance of the idea with Saudi Arabia, Egypt and others.
Saudi and Egyptian leaders have both met recently with Jordan's ruler, King Abdullah, who has been among the most active Arab leaders in seeking a consensus in reacting to the Iraqi crisis.
Outlining King Abdullah's proposal for an amnesty for Mr. Hussein and other top Iraqi leaders, one official here who has met Mr. Hussein said he was almost certain to choose a fate akin to Hitler's death in his bunker in 1945 Berlin if American forces arrive at in Baghdad.
Other top Iraqis, including both of Mr. Hussein's sons, Qusay and Uday, would be likely to choose personal survival over a cataclysmic end, these officials said.
"Uday might be the first to shoot his father if he refused an amnesty," one senior Jordan official said. He added that Jordan's estimate of the Iraqi leaders was that many in the top 50 who might be included in an amnesty offer, including high-ranking generals, might summon up the resolve to kill Mr. Hussein if he refused an amnesty that was the last lifeline available to them. In his 23 years in power, Mr. Hussein has survived numerous assassination attempts, mostly by disaffected generals, and has executed dozens of alleged plotters.
Senior Jordanian officials say they believe that a "quick war," with limited casualties and damage to Iraq's infrastructure, might lead to an equally rapid reversal of popular opinion across the Arab world. Scenes of Iraqis hailing their liberation, these officials reason, could send a powerful message to Arabs outside Iraq who until now have supported Mr. Hussein.
In discussions with these Jordanian officials, there is barely any reference to the dispute between the United States and European nations over the best way of containing Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. These officials cite the American resolve to get rid ofMr. Hussein in saying the issue in Iraq is "regime change," not weapons, and they make clear they favor the switch.
These officials say that most Arab leaders would be happy to see Mr. Hussein overthrown, despite the Iraqi leader's popularity with many ordinary Arabs.
The Jordanian officials speak in unvarnished terms -- similar to those used in the reports of Western human rights groups -- of the terror they say Mr. Hussein has imposed on Iraq's 24 million people.
The Jordanians also say they have told the Americans that the war with Iraq must be brief -- one top official specified a week, if possible -- and that American military commanders should do everything possible to limit civilian casualties.
In contrast to senior officials in Washington who testified to Congress today that American-controlled governance of Iraq might last more than two years, the Jordanian officials said they have urged the Americans to make plans for governing Iraq, ideally, for no more than three months.
After that, they have told American officials, ultimate authority in Iraq should shift to a civilian authority appointed by a coalition of foreign states, but not necessarily one under United Nations leadership. This civilian leadership would work with American military commanders, the Jordanians say.
One account given at authoritative levels here is that King Abdullah decided to prepare for an American attack on Iraq last July, after a meeting at the White House with President Bush.
A Jordanian official familiar with that meeting said the 41-year-old king had asked Mr. Bush if there was any point in trying to persuade the American leader to abandon plans to topple Mr. Hussein. Mr. Bush, this official said, told King Abdullah that his mind was made up, prompting the king to shift his priorities to making preparations to cushion Jordan against the impact of a war.
This approach contrasts starkly with that of King Abdullah's father, King Hussein, who died of cancer in 1999 after 46 years on the throne. The last few years of that reign were spent struggling with the consequences of the Persian Gulf war, which were difficult for Jordan.
In 1990, after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, King Hussein sought to act as an intermediary, maintaining ties with the Iraqi leader and searching for Arab solutions to the Kuwait crisis in ways that infuriated the first President Bush. Ties with the United States went into the deep freeze for several years afterwards.

HEADLINE: For Sprint Chief, a Hard Fall From Grace 

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
To hear the Sprint Corporation's board tell it, the fall from grace of its longtime chief executive, William T. Esrey, is the consequence of his having followed bad tax advice in handling stock options that Mr. Esrey and his No. 2, Ronald LeMay, received in 1999 and 2000.
 But critics say that a look at Sprint's financial performance in recent years would provide enough justification for the board's forced ouster of Mr. Esrey and Mr. LeMay -- even if their tax shelters had not become the targets of an Internal Revenue Service inquiry. 
 Just last year, Sprint was able to dodge a liquidity crisis only by cutting 17,000 jobs, selling its cash-cow telephone-book publishing business and rolling its short-term debt into longer-maturing obligations. Those panicky moves, critics note, came after the company poured $2 billion into a high-speed Internet project, ION, only to scrap it in 2001, and after pulling out of Global One, its failed international venture with Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom. 
"The results of Sprint's overall strategy have been very discouraging," said Drake Johnstone, a telecommunications analyst at Davenport & Company. "It's still hard to see where any significant growth at Sprint will come from."
Mr. Esrey declined requests for an interview. 
Bill White, a spokesman for Sprint, which is based in Overland Park, Kan., said yesterday that Mr. Esrey would continue in his position until the company succeeds in hiring Gary Forsee, the vice chairman of BellSouth and chairman of its Cingular Wireless joint venture with SBC Communications. Lawsuits by BellSouth and Cingular seeking to block Mr. Forsee's move to Sprint were sent into arbitration this week by an Atlanta judge.
Mr. Esrey's downfall stands out from the epic descents of some other noted telecommunications executives who rode the industry boom of the late 1990's, only to leave under financial clouds -- most notably Gary Winnick of Global Crossing and Bernard J. Ebbers of WorldCom. Unlike them, Mr. Esrey was no telephone industry upstart; he is the longest serving chief executive of any major telecommunications company. 
Indeed, telecommunications was in the very genes of Mr. Esrey, who grew up in Greenwich, Conn., and Kansas City, Mo., as the son of a high-ranking AT&T executive. His first job after graduating from Harvard Business School in 1964 was working as a manager for AT&T, heading his own unit in New York by age 28. 
And after a run as an investment banker during the 1970's, Mr. Esrey returned to the telephone industry in 1980 as an executive vice president of Sprint's predecessor company, United Telecommunications, in Westwood, Kan.
United Telecommunications was a relatively staid Midwestern utility with 19th-century Kansas roots. But Mr. Esrey set out to transform it into a global communications powerhouse with operations in the local and long-distance telephone businesses and, eventually, the wireless industry, as well. 
Sprint has never risen beyond a distant No. 3 in the long-distance market and has never turned a profit in wireless service, where it currently ranks in fourth place. Still, during the telecommunications boom of the late 1990's it did look as if Mr. Esrey's leadership might pay off when he announced a plan in 1999 to merge Sprint with WorldCom, potentially creating one of the world's largest telecommunications companies. 
But that merger plan foundered on regulatory opposition. And it now appears that the attempted WorldCom deal was the beginning of a decline for both Mr. Esrey and his company.
Mr. Esrey, 62, is embroiled in a dispute with the I.R.S. over a tax shelter he purchased from Ernst & Young to avoid paying taxes on more than $100 million in gains on stock options that the board granted him when it still looked as if the WorldCom deal would be completed. 
Since the WorldCom deal unraveled nearly three years ago, Mr. Esrey has repeatedly tried to convince investors of Sprint's potential to succeed as a unified stand-alone company. But these efforts have largely stalled as Sprint struggled with the industrywide malaise and also the company's own apparent lack of a true recovery plan. Before the sale of the company's telephone directory business last summer to R. H. Donnelly for $2.2 billion, it seemed plausible that Sprint might lose the creditworthiness it had attained during its ascent.
Even Mr. Esrey's critics acknowledge that his recent rounds of chemotherapy for lymphoma -- a disease he says is now in remission -- have probably forced him to rely largely on Mr. LeMay to run Sprint since last fall. But they nonetheless fault Mr. Esrey for corporate problems that they say were years in the making, and for failed ambitions that they say give his current crisis almost Shakespearean overtones. 
"Lear's mistake, as I recall, was to divide the kingdom in three parts," said Reed E. Hundt, a former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission who is now senior adviser on information technologies at McKinsey & Company. "Bill Esrey, on the other hand, was wrong not to have divided local, long distance and wireless a long time ago. That's a strategy issue."
In a memo to Sprint's 72,000 employees last week, Mr. Esrey alluded to his I.R.S. problems and said that an unfavorable ruling by the government could wipe him out financially, because the current value of his Sprint stock would not cover his tax liability.
Many investors could probably understand his pain. Since reaching a high of $75.50 in November 1999, Sprint's shares have fallen to a closing price yesterday of $12.39, up 9 cents for the day. Shares of the separate stock for Sprint PCS, which track performance of the company's wireless operations, have fallen from a high of $65.50 in March 2000 to a closing price yesterday of $3.80, down 20 cents for the day.
Like other large telephone companies, Sprint faces an array of challenges, like the growing market share of Internet-based calling systems and the cannibalization of fixed-line local and long-distance services by wireless networks -- which in Sprint's case includes its own Sprint PCS unit. The company's local access lines declined by 1.7 percent in 2002. And total sales at Sprint's nonwireless local and long-distance operations fell 7.3 percent last year, to $15.2 billion, compared with $16.4 billion the previous year.
The decline is particularly acute in long distance, where competition has stiffened with the entry of large local phone companies like BellSouth. The nation's biggest local phone company, Verizon Communications, said last month that its fledgling long-distance business had surpassed Sprint to become the nation's third-largest provider of long-distance service as measured by the number of households served.
But it is the problems of Sprint's own making that analysts see as the most potentially troubling. The decision to spin off the shares of Sprint PCS in 1998 as a separate tracking stock has come under particularly heavy criticism, because the shares have fared no better than Sprint's main stock. The wireless business continues to lose money, even as competitors like Verizon Wireless and AT&T Wireless have recently reported stronger results and have added more customers than Sprint PCS.
Although analysts see few prospects for strong growth at Sprint, the company insists that it is poised for a rebound whenever the telecommunications industry pulls out of its recession.
"We've taken the steps we needed to take to stabilize our business in the view of our investors," said Kurt Fawkes, Sprint's vice president for investor relations. "Last year at this time we were perceived by some to have a liquidity problem on our hands. That perception isn't there anymore."
Mr. Fawkes also said Sprint expected its wireless unit to become profitable in 2004 after the operation's new management addresses problems with late-paying customers and service quality.
For Mr. Esrey, ending his Sprint career under the current circumstances will be a gloomy final chapter in what had long seemed an executive success story.
By 1985, Mr. Esrey had risen to become United Telecommunication's chief executive at a time when the breakup of AT&T had stimulated new competition and new technologies like cellphones, digital switching system and the fiber optic transmission of voice and data calls. 
Mr. Esrey led the company through a series of mergers and spinoffs that eventually formed Sprint, as the company was renamed in 1992. As it grew, Sprint became a powerful symbol of the close-knit and conservative business community of Kansas City. Overland Park is a suburb of Kansas City.
Its board counts among its members Irvine O. Hockaday, the former chief executive of Hallmark Cards, another large Kansas City company. Mr. Esrey, who is a neighbor of Mr. Hockaday in Mission Hills, Kan., appeared to relish the rewards related to his leadership of Sprint. 
A competitive executive with a penchant for daily workouts and helicopter skiing, Mr. Esrey acquired a ski house and part of a sizable ranch near Vail, Colo. He has attended Bohemian Grove, the all-male summer retreat for executives and politicians in Sonoma County, Calif.
Respected as he was during his long career at Sprint, it remains to be seen how Mr. Esrey's departure will be register among the people who have worked for him -- many of whom have lost their own jobs and have seen the collapse of their own Sprint shares. 
"Bill was an incredibly demanding superior," said Richard P. Nespola, a former Sprint executive who is now chief executive of the Management Network Group, a communications consulting company in Overland Park. "Given what he has done at Sprint, it's a tragedy what has happened to him."

HEADLINE: Greenspan Throws Cold Water On Bush Arguments for Tax Cut 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 11 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, today rebutted many of President Bush's arguments in favor of big new tax cuts, saying that the economy probably does not need any short-term stimulus and warning that budget deficits could spiral out of control.
 Mr. Greenspan did not attack the specifics of Mr. Bush's $674 billion tax-cutting package, but he cast doubt on the need for a stimulus proposal in the first place. 
 He also disagreed with the Bush argument that rising budget deficits have little link to higher interest rates. And he pointedly took issue with the administration's argument that the best way to balance the budget is by promoting faster growth.
"I am not one of those who is convinced that stimulus is desirable policy at this point," he told lawmakers at a hearing of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. "My own judgment is that fiscal stimulus is premature."
Because of Mr. Greenspan's enormous stature as a spokesman on economic issues, his comments today were a serious blow to the Bush administration. At the same time, the president met with some lawmakers at the White House to press his proposal. Page A26. 
In a cautious assessment of the economy, Mr. Greenspan said the biggest obstacle to faster growth was uncertainty about a likely war with Iraq. Though expressing optimism that the economy would strengthen once those uncertainties disappeared, he suggested that the Fed would not raise interest rates any time soon.
Two years ago, Mr. Greenspan provided crucial support for Mr. Bush's first round of tax cuts. That support helped Republicans win over wavering Democrats and push through the tax cuts even though Democrats had a slim majority in the Senate at that time.
Administration officials and most Republican lawmakers tried to put the best face possible on Mr. Greenspan's testimony, emphasizing that he had reiterated his support for eliminating the so-called double taxation of dividends.
But one Republican senator angrily accused Mr. Greenspan of surreptitiously trying to sink the Bush plan and suggested that he resign.
"You have been in this position for a long time, some would say too long," said Senator Jim Bunning, Republican of Kentucky and a longtime critic of Mr. Greenspan. "No president should try to set monetary policy. But the Fed chairman should not try to make fiscal policy. That's not your job."
Democrats immediately pounced on Mr. Greenspan's remarks to step up their attack on Mr. Bush's tax plan.
"I think Alan Greenspan two years ago breathed life into the administration's proposal for tax cuts," said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader. "Today, I think he gave the kiss of death to the plan that was offered this year."
Investors showed little reaction to Mr. Greenspan's comments on the economy. The real impact of his comments was political.
Mr. Greenspan bluntly challenged the administration's contention that big budget deficits pose little danger or that the government can largely offset them through faster economic growth.
"We are all too aware that government spending programs and tax preferences can be easy to initiate or expand but extraordinarily difficult to trim or shut down," Mr. Greenspan told the Senate panel.
"Faster economic growth, doubtless, would make deficits easier to contain," he added. "But faster economic growth alone is not likely to be the full solution to the currently projected long-term deficits."
Mr. Greenspan also took issue with the Bush administration's arguments that budget deficits have little effect on interest rates.
"Contrary to what some have said, it does affect long-term interest rates and it does have an impact on the economy," he said.
And while he endorsed Mr. Bush's basic idea of eliminating the taxes paid by individualson corporate dividends, he also said that any such change should be offset by other tax increases or spending cuts.
That is quite different from Mr. Bush's approach. The administration has estimated that the dividend plan will cost the government $385 billion over 10 years.
John W. Snow, who took over as Treasury secretary this week, told reporters today that there was no need to offset the costs of the dividend plan with either tax increases or spending cuts.
"I think a large part of the cost of the dividend plan will be recovered in the future," Mr. Snow said.
Mr. Greenspan's opinions today will probably not be enough on their own to block Mr. Bush's general plan for a new round of tax cuts. But many analysts said crucial elements of the tax plan were already in trouble with moderate Republicans, and they predicted that the Fed chairman's testimony would add to the resistance.
"Even if his remarks influence only two or three votes, that would be the difference between success and failure," said Rudolph Penner, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office.
As in the past, Mr. Greenspan sprinkled his testimony with a mix of remarks that offered something to Republicans and Democrats alike. He did not criticize the specifics of Mr. Bush's tax proposals, saying there were "pluses and minuses," and he repeated his longstanding support for eliminating the taxation of corporate dividends.
But his focus on deficits clearly put him at odds with the administration, and his endorsement of the dividend tax cut was at best tepid in light of his recommendation that any such cut be "revenue neutral."
"We think this makes Mr. Greenspan more of a problem for Mr. Bush than his opponents," wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist for High Frequency Economics, an economic consulting firm in Valhalla, N.Y.
Assessing the broader economic outlook, Mr. Greenspan repeatedly expressed the hope that economic growth would accelerate as soon as the uncertainty about a possible war had been dispelled.
In its monetary policy report to Congress today, the Fed predicted that economic growth could reach an annual rate of about 3 percent by the end of this year.
Mr. Greenspan expressed little worry that consumers, who have provided the main source of economic growth over the last year, were in danger of becoming too bogged down in debt.
Though Mr. Greenspan conceded that household debt had increased, largely as a result of home refinancings encouraged by low interest rates, he said consumers' debt-financing burdens were still about normal.
Mr. Greenspan did rattle one sector of the economy today: government-sponsored companies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that bundle mortgages and resell them to investors. 
Mr. Greenspan implicitly supported stricter oversight of such companies, which have come under growing pressure from lawmakers to provide more disclosure about their liabilities.
"These are legally private corporations and should be handled the way private corporations are handled," Mr. Greenspan said.
The shares of Fannie Mae dropped $1.21, to $63, and Freddie Mac fell 67 cents, to $54.47, after Mr. Greenspan testified.

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday about Alan Greenspan's rebuttal of many of President Bush's arguments for new tax cuts misstated the party makeup of the Senate when Congress passed tax cuts in 2001. It was split 50-50; Democrats did not have a slim majority.

HEADLINE: Head Start Plan Worries Supporters 

BYLINE:  By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 11 

 BODY:
At the Edward C. Mazique Head Start Center here, Giselle Galvez, a 3-year-old who can sing the alphabet and tell pink from purple, pops into the medical office for a routine physical. In the kitchen, cooks puree fresh food for the infants, while toddlers learn to eat family style. Behind a classroom door covered in red hearts for Valentine's Day, Annette Robinson teaches children not yet 2 that A is for airplane. 
 And, as Head Start directors learned to their dismay last week, B is for block grants. 
 Under a Bush administration proposal, Head Start, the preschool program serving nearly one million poor children, would become a block grant program. Direct control would go from the federal government to the nation's cash-strapped governors, who would meld Head Start with existing state programs. 
Administration officials said the change would allow states to coordinate Head Start better with their own preschool programs, and would bolster its educational mission by moving its oversight to the federal Education Department from Health and Human Services. They describe the proposal as a logical extension of President Bush's No Child Left Behind Act, which aims to have every child reading by third grade. 
But critics point to studies showing that Head Start is already successful in giving poor children an advantage when they reach school. The federal program's virtue, they say, lies in its comprehensive approach to preparing children for kindergarten, seeing to their health and nutrition while teaching them not only letters and numbers, but also how to play with other children and trust grownups.
"I don't believe a school is going to focus on those kinds of things," said Leslie Johnson, director of the Mazique Center. "Those are life skills."
Critics, including Sarah Greene, president of the National Head Start Association, also contend that turning Head Start into a block grant program could be the first step toward dismantling it, as governors slice off services to make federal money go further. Under a measure passed by referendum in Florida, Gov. Jeb Bush must provide preschool for all children by 2005. But voters did not say how the cash-strapped state would pay for it. In New York, which had been moving toward sending all 4-year-olds to preschool, Gov. George E. Pataki's latest budget eliminates universal preschool, and cuts back preschool for poor children.
Head Start began as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society legislation. Under federal rules, its centers must give children nutritious meals, medical screening and safe playgrounds, along with instruction in letters and numbers. A share of the federal money can also go to professional training; in many centers, the teachers began as Head Start parents.
The president's proposal would allow states to replace providers as the beneficiaries of Head Start grants. The states would have to devise their own standards for what children must learn and ways to assess their success. They also would have to explain how they would integrate Head Start into existing preschool programs and continue providing nutritional, medical and emotional support to children.
States that take the grants must pledge to continue serving at least as many children as they currently do, and should maintain at least the same level of state spending on early childhood education. In states that do not apply for the money as block grants, the federal government would continue working directly with child-care providers. 
Administration officials dispute the view that Head Start is a success. "The fairest way to look at data that's been done is to say it's clear children do show some improvement, but they still lag quite significantly behind more advantaged peers when they enter kindergarten," one administration official said. "That ought not to be good enough."
In his budget, the president seeks an increase at roughly the rate of inflation for Head Start, a $6.8 billion program that currently serves about three in five eligible children. Early Head Start, which covers children from 6 months to 3 years old, serves only about 3 percent of the eligible children . 
A survey of 36 studies on Head Start and other early childhood programs found Head Start children enter kindergarten with reading and math scores slightly below the national average, but catch up in the first few years of school. They are also less likely to repeat a grade or need special education, said the survey's author, W. Steven Barnett, director of the National Institute for Early Education Research. 
The government is in the midst of a five-year study, due to end in 2006, tracking the impact of Head Start in the lives of 3,000 children at 75 sites nationwide.
"I think it can always do better, but you have to be wary of killing the goose that's laying the golden egg," said Janet Currie, a professor at the University of California at Los Angeles who has studied Head Start. 
Mr. Barnett, who did the national survey, said research "from the very beginning" showed that "Head Start basically works, and does have persistent impacts on children's learning." While the gains are not as large as the programs on which Head Start is modeled, he added, "the reason for that is not curriculum, but that Head Start has never had the resources," particularly to pay for better qualified teachers.
At the Children's Defense Fund, a child welfare advocacy group, Helen Blank, director of child care, called the administration proposal "a radical untested experiment on one million of our poorest youngsters." 
She noted that while 45 states offer preschool programs, the majority of spending is concentrated in only 10 states, suggesting a wide variation in quality and commitment. In addition, many states accept only 4-year-olds in preschool, while Head Start begins at 3.
Ms. Blank suggested the president improve the program by simply covering more children in poverty, rather then spending essentially the same amount, but shifting responsibility to the states. 
"That's not new money," Ms. Blank said. "How's it going to help, unless you take apart the program and give children less?"
Ms. Johnson, who remembers "crawling through mothballed public schools" to find furniture for her Head Start center in the early days, said the Department of Education could not support the range of services, beyond academics, that Head Start has grown to encompass. These goals include connecting parents with educational and job training programs, screening children for disease and involving parents in hiring and policy making decisions.
Dr. Habib Shariat, the head of pediatrics at Howard University Hospital, who runs the Mazique Center's medical office, said some children came to Early Head Start at 18 months, having had only a single series of shots at 6 months. Primary care doctors, he added, typically do not screen children for hearing problems, as Head Start does. He calls his charges "children of the fourth world," the inner city of industrial nations.
"We've come so far to understand that children's well-being is all part of a whole piece," Dr. Shariat said. "They're going backward."

HEADLINE: Bush Gains Crucial Backer For His Tax Plan in Senate 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 11 

 BODY:
President Bush's $674 billion economic plan drew surprising support today from Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who said in January that the centerpiece of the plan, eliminating the dividend tax, would be tough sell in Congress.
 "I think I should have kept my mouth shut back in January," Mr. Grassley told reporters at the White House after a half-hour meeting with the president, other Republican senators and Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's top political adviser. 
 An aide to Mr. Grassley, who is the chairman of the Finance Committee and the most influential senator on tax legislation, insisted that he had not changed his position or had his arm twisted by the White House.
Mr. Grassley had always supported the dividend tax cut, the aide said, but was concerned that it would not get the 51 votes it needed to pass, particularly since some half-dozen members of the president's party announced they were against it.
Today, Mr. Grassley did not go so far as to say that the dividend tax cut would clear Congress, but he did try to sound cheerful.
"Oh, do I expect it to pass?" he said. "I said this to the president, so I can say it to you: everything's on the table. When it's all said and done in the United States Senate, the president is going to get an overwhelming percentage of his various proposals that are in that bill."
Mr. Grassley's meeting with Mr. Bush was part of a White House offensive to show the president as hard at work on the economy and domestic matters at a time of overwhelming international concerns. The president sandwiched the meeting with Mr. Grassley, and one later in the day with House members on welfare legislation, in between phone calls about Iraq and terrorism. At the same time, television sets at the White House were tuned to what was said to be the latest message from Osama bin Laden.
The White House also scheduled the meetings on a day when Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, raised questions about the wisdom of a big tax cut in the face of rising deficits.
Mr. Bush was rewarded by his Capitol Hill guests, who made only positive or neutral statements about an economic plan that many lawmakers, particularly Democrats, call irresponsible, geared to the rich and unlikely to make it intact through Congress. Mr. Grassley, for one, said that he was encouraged because the president had told him he planned an aggressive series of speeches throughout the country to sell Americans on his proposal. 
"We're here, early February," Mr. Grassley said. "People are just beginning to look at this. The president is just beginning to speak about it. Let's give the jury of the American people an opportunity to make a decision."
Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a leader of the Republican moderates who have expressed serious reservations about the president's plan, was among those who met with Mr. Bush today. The get-together did not appear to sway her, and an aide said she remained undecided about whether she would support Mr. Bush.
"The president strongly believes he's put forth the right package," Ms. Collins told reporters at the White House. "He also made it clear that he wants to hear from us."
Ms. Collins said the president went around the room and asked for each senator's thoughts. Other Republicans at the meeting included Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the chairman of the Budget Committee, and Senator Norm Coleman of Minnesota.
White House officials said today that the president still intended to fight for his entire proposal, and that asking for the total elimination of the dividend tax was not an opening position to win a 50 percent reduction as a compromise.
White House officials also took issue with suggestions that it was surprising that Mr. Bush should have to sell his economic plan to members of his own party.
"It's very important to recognize that every individual member of Congress has an opinion," said Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary.

HEADLINE: Conferees Approve G.O.P. Provisions to Expand Development in Alaska National Forests 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER 8. LEE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 11 

 BODY:
Republicans have tucked provisions into the spending bill that the House and Senate conferences are negotiating to permit road building in two Alaska forests, expand timber harvesting in national forests and open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to exploratory oil drilling.
 Democrats say the provisions would weaken Clinton-era protections for national forests. 
 Republicans say Democrats and conservation groups are distorting the proposals to generate opposition to reasonable modifications of overly restrictive policies.
Republicans defeated a Democratic effort on Monday to strip the forest amendments from the bill. As a result, the changes will most likely be included if the $396 billion package is approved. 
Conservation groups said introducing those policies in the negotiations seriously undermined the 2.2 million comments that the public submitted before the policies were introduced in 2000. Industry groups said the sweeping policies surprised the timber industry in 2000.
The main controversy centers on the Tongass and Chugach National Forests in Alaska. 
The Tongass, the last large remaining rain forest in North America, is roughly the size of West Virginia. The Chugach, the second largest national forest, covers the Copper River Delta, home of a famous salmon run.
"This is the forest equivalent of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge," said Phil Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust, an environmental group.
The debate has been framed over whether the pristine forest is worth the burden it puts on the 7.6 percent unemployment rate in Alaska. 
"We are trying to restore those lost jobs," said Owen J. Graham, executive director of the Alaska Forest Association, a trade group.
One amendment would exempt Alaska from "roadless" area policies that permanently protect the more than 30 percent of the forests not open to timber sales. More than half the national forests have been opened to logging, and about 15 percent have been designated wilderness. The "roadless" rules essentially protect the remaining land.
If the restrictions are lifted, 50 sales pending in the Tongass forest would proceed. A number of the amendments were pushed by Senator Ted Stevens, the Alaska Republican who is chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and who has received significant contributions from the timber industry.
Mr. Stevens defended his amendments, saying he was trying to undo President Bill Clinton's last-minute addition of land in Alaska to the roadless program despite a law that prohibited adding land there.
The Clinton administration'sdesignation of many areas of national forest as roadless areas has been challenged in court by Western states, along with the timber industry. The opponents say the government did not assemble enough public reaction for such a broad action.
Concern by Democrats and some moderate Republicans also focuses on the introduction of the amendments. Eight moderate Republicans have sent a letter to the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, C. W. Young, Republican of Florida, saying the last-minute secretive talks "seriously undermine the legislative process."
"It's not a good way to do business," a signer of the letter, Representative Michael N. Castle, Republican of Delaware, said. "It's a practice that should not be followed."
House Republican leaders said they wanted to avoid a fight on the environment in the spending legislation.
Other amendments include a push to free Interior Department money for drilling studies in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, despite a 20-year-old ban on exploration there.
In addition, the amendments would expand a policy allowing timber companies to cut trees as payment for clearing out undergrowth that poses a fire hazard. 
The program's advocates say it is an economical way to pay for a much-needed service. Conservation groups say the program kills trees to save trees.
Republicans are also proposing to exempt some forest plans from administrative and legal challenges as a way to evade a tactic that conservation groups use to delay sales to build in forests.
"It means there is no protection whatsoever for the public interest," said Representative David R. Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin, whose amendment to strip some Republican proposals failed. 
Industry officials said the exemption was streamlining the challenge process from two rounds, with one for the overall national forest development plan and one for individual land sales, to just the individual sales.
"It doesn't take away their right to protest," Mr. Graham of the timber group said. "It takes away their second bite of the apple."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: POSTWAR GOALS; 
American Officials Disclose 2-Year Plan to Rebuild Iraq

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 11 

 BODY:
In the first detailed public discussion of the Bush administration's plans for a postwar Iraq, senior officials told Congress today that it would take more than two years for the United States military to transfer control of Iraq's government to Iraqi leaders.
 The officials, seeking to demonstrate to skeptical senators that the administration's planning was advanced, outlined steps for administering and democratizing Iraq after the ouster of Saddam Hussein. 
 Those would include finding and destroying Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, eliminating terrorist cells, starting economic reconstruction, purging Baathist leaders from the bureaucracy, protecting oil fields and securing the country's borders -- particularly with Iran. They would be carried out by American and coalition forces. 
The United States would also play a leading role in rebuilding Iraq's oil industry. This could cost as much as $10 billion if Mr. Hussein follows through on his threats to destroy oil wells, pipelines and refineries, as he did in Kuwait during the the Persian Gulf war of 1991, the officials said.
If Mr. Hussein "utterly destroys" Iraq's oil industry, "it will make for a horrific reconstruction project," said one of the officials, Douglas J. Feith, the undersecretary of defense for policy.
Although the United States Central Command, under the leadership of Gen. Tommy R. Franks, would oversee Iraq during the military occupation, the officials said they were not looking at the postwar occupation of Japan under General Douglas MacArthur -- which lasted seven years -- as a model.
"The United States would have a commitment to leave as soon as possible," Mr. Feith said.
Mr. Feith's words were tempered, however, by his colleague, Marc Grossman, the undersecretary of state for political affairs, who told the senators that even under good circumstances, it would probably take two years or more for the military to transfer control of many ministries to Iraqi officials.
To speed the growth of an indigenous, Democratic-leaning Iraqi leadership, the United States would encourage Iraqi exiles, bureaucrats, professionals and local leaders to form committees to assist General Franks in several important ways: helping administer the bureaucracy, revising Iraq's laws and drafting a new constitution, the officials said.
"We will demonstrate to the Iraqi people and the world that the United States wants to liberate, not occupy or control their economic resources," Mr. Grossman said. 
But the two officials also said the Bush administration had ruled out plans for helping Iraqi exiles create a provisional government.
The two faced skeptical senators from both parties, who sharply questioned whether the administration had done enough to prepare for the aftermath of a war. And despite their efforts to release new details of the administration's planning, they were chastised by lawmakers for not providing enough information about costs and timetables for reconstruction. On several occasions, Mr. Feith said the cost of rebuilding Iraq was "unknowable," because it was impossible to predict the severity of war-related damage.
"We have a right to know," said Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the ranking Democrat. 
Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, called Mr. Grossman's assertion that the United States could transfer control of the government to the Iraqi people in two years "naive." 
"I think it's better to be upfront with the American people," Mr. Dodd said. "It's going to be very expensive and take a long, long time, particularly if we're doing it ourselves."
Senators from both parties said that the sheer cost and magnitude of rebuilding Iraq would require coalition assistance -- and they questioned whether tensions with France and Germany had complicated postwar cooperation. "Aren't we wiser to bring our coalition partners along?" asked Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska. 
Mr. Grossman said the United States had been consulting closely with numerous allies about reconstruction, though he declined to name them.

Shares Fall on New War Jitters and Greenspan Remarks

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Shares fell across the board yesterday after an audio tape reported to be from Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, ignited investor jitters that war with Iraq was drawing near. 
 Also weighing on sentiment was a cautious outlook on the economy by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan. Mr. Greenspan, in testimony before a Senate committee, said uncertainties created by possible war with Iraq posed "formidable barriers" to business spending and clouded the economic outlook. 
 But Wall Street's focus was on the tape by Mr. bin Laden, who is accused of masterminding the Sept. 11 attacks. 
"Greenspan is being overlooked by this bin Laden tape," said Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak. "It's gotten everyone on edge again." 
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 77 points, nearly 1 percent, to 7,843.11. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended off 6.77 points, or 0.8 percent, at 829.20. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite lost 1.22 points, about 0.1 percent, to 1,295.46. 
Stocks, which were up earlier in the session, fell after the tape said to be from Mr. bin Laden warned Arab states against backing any United States-led war on Iraq and said suicide attacks were important in fighting America. 
Al Jazeera, the satellite television channel in Qatar, broadcast the statement, which urged Muslim solidarity with Iraq. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said the message suggested that Iraq was linked to global terrorism. 
"If that's the case, then war is inevitable," said Anthony Iuliano, head trader for Glenmede Trust, referring to Mr. Powell's comments. "If you take this war off the table, our market's up."
One of the biggest drags on the Dow was SBC Communications, which fell 79 cents, to $23.71, hurt by talk that it might be interested in buying the satellite television provider DirecTV.
Helping to lift the Nasdaq, some semiconductor shares showed strength after Texas Instruments, the top maker of semiconductors for cellphones, reiterated yesterday that it expected first-quarter earnings of about 6 cents a share. 
Texas Instruments rose 39 cents, to $15.44. Among other issues in the sector, Xilinx rose 70 cents, to $19.62; Motorola moved up 12 cents, to $8.15; and Intel rose 7 cents, to $15.34. 
The Web equipment maker Cisco Systems rose 32 cents, to $13.47.
Shares in the health insurer Aetna rose $1.55, to $43.40, after the company said it had a profit because of steeper premiums and cost cutting. Shares in Yum Brands, the No. 2 restaurant company behind McDonald's, with chains that include KFC and Pizza Hut, rose $1.37, to $23.80, after its earnings increased 5 percent, helped by acquisitions, a lower tax rate and higher sales.
MetLife fell $1.38, to $24.62, after the company reported a quarterly profit but took an unexpected charge as it increased its estimate of the costs of settling asbestos claims.
In the bond market yesterday, the 10-year Treasury note rose 2/32, to 100 11/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, dropped to 3.96 percent from 3.97 percent on Monday.
The 30-year bond dropped 8/32, to 107 25/32. Its yield rose rose to 4.87 percent from 4.85 percent.

 BODY:
Fed Chief Rebuts Bush Plan For New Round of Tax Cuts
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, rebutted many of President Bush's arguments in favor of new tax cuts, saying the economy probably does not need a short-term stimulus and warning that deficits could spiral out of control. Mr. Greenspan also disagreed with Mr. Bush's argument that rising budget deficits have little link to higher interest rates.
 In a cautious assessment of the economy, he said the biggest obstacle to faster growth was uncertainty about a likely war with Iraq. Though expressing optimism that the economy would strengthen once those uncertainties disappeared, he suggested that the Fed would not raise interest rates soon. Page A1.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Indian Nurses Sought to Staff U.S. Hospitals" (news article, Feb. 10): 
 As a nurse in a poorly staffed burn unit, I am well aware of how desperate hospitals are for nurses. I wonder, though, with so many people looking for work in the United States, could we perhaps institute some kind of program to train out-of-work people to work as nurses? This would at least help alleviate two problems: the nursing shortage and unemployment.

HEADLINE: Software Success Has India Worried 

BYLINE:  By SARITHA RAI

DATELINE: BOMBAY, Feb. 12 

 BODY:
Is the United States going to start turning its back on outsourcing, the lifeblood of India's software and services industry?
 The global economic downturn and possible war with Iraq are, of course, big concerns for industry executives, who are gathered here this week for an annual industry conference to meet with analysts, consultants and the chief information officers from American corporations, their most important customers. But the growing threat of a political reaction against outsourcing is the worry dominating the discussion. 
 So far, the only concrete signs of a reaction are in the public sector. After the eFunds Corporation of Scottsdale, Ariz., a contractor hired by the State of New Jersey to manage a welfare and food-stamp program, moved its customer-service operations to Bombay from Wisconsin, a New Jersey legislator, Shirley K. Turner, introduced a bill that would require that workers hired under state contracts be American citizens or legal aliens or they occupy some specialty niche that American workers cannot be found to fill. " 'I say it's time to bring 'em back from Bombay,' Senator Turner said of the client service jobs currently based in India," a news release stated. 
Connecticut, Maryland, Wisconsin, and Missouri have also begun considering such laws.
Though public-sector work directly accounts for only a tiny part of India's software and services exports to the United States, executives here are concerned about a chilling effect, with American customers reluctant to send work overseas lest it complicate dealings with government bodies.
The $10 billion software and services industry is hugely important to India. It has so far grown robustly despite the broader slowdown in technology spending, as more Western companies, especially American ones, cut expensive jobs at home and contract out software development and support, call-center operations and other functions to low-cost suppliers in India and elsewhere. By 2008 the Indian government expects the industry to account for about 8 percent of all economic output, up from 2.87 percent now.
More than half the world's top 500 companies, including General Electric and American Express, outsource work to India.
To supply the demand, Indian companies like the Bangalore-based Infosys Technologies and Wipro, and Tata Consultancy Services, or T.C.S., of Bombay, part of the Tata conglomerate, have been hiring by the hundreds, bucking the generally sluggish global trend. Revenue from software and services exports from India were $6.9 billion in the last three quarters of 2002, up 28 percent from the period in 2001, according to data released Tuesday by the National Association of Software and Services Companies. The association, known as Nasscom, organized this week's conference.
The legislation being considered in several states has software and services executives worried that American opposition to outsourcing in India is growing. They worry that regardless of whether such laws are enacted, the sentiment will spread. It may, they fear, slow companies' decisions to outsource -- and perhaps even encourage them to send work to other countries.
India's exporters are divided over whether such legislation should be challenged at the World Trade Organization. "Legislation banning contracts from going abroad is a nontariff barrier, and we are exploring the possibility of countering this at the W.T.O.," Nasscom's president, Kiran Karnik, said.
But some leading companies with large American corporations among their customers said that the job loss issue was emotional and was best underplayed.
Even within Nasscom, a division was evident this morning at a session on global technology trends. When one panelist, E. Jeffrey Berg, executive director of Citigroup Program Management, brought up the proposed New Jersey legislation, Som Mittal, vice chairman of Nasscom and chief executive of Digital GlobalSoft, an Indian subsidiary of Hewlett-Packard, cut in, saying that even a discussion would sensationalize the issue.
Nasscom has recently engaged the public relations firm Hill & Knowlton to work with businesses and politicians in the United States to counter the opposition toward outsourcing to India and to increase the global brand equity of the Indian software industry.
While in the past there has been opposition in the United States to moving manufacturing jobs overseas, those moves primarily affected blue-collar workers. Now, the jobs of white-collar workers are on the line. "This is the vocal, articulate middle class who form an important constituency of every political party," Mr. Karnik said.
Nasscom said it was campaigning to show how Indian software and services exporters were helping the American economy to be more effective. In a letter to the governor of New Jersey, Nasscom said its preliminary data indicated that outsourcing to India gave American banks a 10 percent to 20 percent cost advantage over their European peers and resulted in an $8 billion savings for the banking industry in the last four years.
Nasscom is also talking to nearly 40 state senators in New Jersey in a campaign against the legislation, saying that state governments would have to burden their citizens with more taxes if they insisted that work be done in high-cost locations.
Despite the controversy, outsourcing deals are still being struck by Indian companies. Among them, the World Bank is scheduled to announce next week a $10 million to $20 million technology services deal outsourced to an Indian software company. "Backlash is a natural reaction even at the World Bank, but in this era of globalization, sustaining business and securing jobs is more likely to happen if projects are executed in the most efficient destinations," said Mohamed V. Muhsin, chief information officer of the World Bank.
Gartner Inc., the research firm based in Stamford, Conn., has prepared a note advising its Indian clients to promote the value of their services not just to customers but to the public. 
In the note, "How to handle backlash against offshore services," two Gartner analysts, Rolf Jester and Partha Iyengar, warn, "To ignore the problem, or to pretend it is not real, is to allow negative perceptions to fester, generating a climate of opinion in which selling becomes more difficult."

HEADLINE: Global Talks On Farming Begin Friday 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 12 

 BODY:
Trade ministers from two dozen of the world's largest economies will meet in Tokyo this weekend to discuss guidelines for the reduction of agricultural tariffs and other measures, part of a round of talks the World Trade Organization began last year in Doha, Qatar.
 As with many other multilateral debates over farming, though, the nonbinding discussions may only solidify established positions, not soften them. 
 At the center of the three days of meetings, which begin Friday, is a debate over how to calculate cuts in tariffs and subsidies on rice, beef and other produce. The United States, Australia and other large exporters want tariffs limited to no more than 25 percent of the value of the goods. Another bloc, which includes the European Union, Japan and South Korea, favors across-the-board reductions from current tariff rates. 
The negotiators will probably be presented with a proposal for bridging the gap, written by the chairman of the special committee on agriculture. They must reach an agreement by March 31, a significant task given the disagreement and the need to incorporate a spectrum of opinions in the 145-member group.
Though the trade group has made progress in reducing tariffs on manufactured goods and services, agriculture has always led to more exemptions than concessions. For years, the United States side, allied with Australia, Thailand, Canada, Brazil and Argentina, which make up the Cairns Group, has pressed the world group's members to lower tariffs to allow for more imports of grain, fruit and meats. The Europeans, particularly the French, as well as the Japanese, have tried to protect politically powerful farmers.
The Europeans and Japanese have broadened their defense, arguing that protecting farmers is not just about food, but also about preserving the environment, rural regions and national self-sufficiency. Japan, already the world's largest net importer of food, says it is unfairly accused of hindering imports, even though tariffs on imported rice, for example, are 490 percent.
"There are lines that we cannot concede to," one senior Japanese negotiator said. "It's not that our markets are closed. Our proposals are the middle of the road."
Though Japan imports $135 worth of agricultural goods per capita each year, about 40 percent more than the European Union, food prices in Japan are among the highest in the world. Agricultural land costs 100 times what it does in the United States, and the average American farm is 200 times the size of a Japanese one. With land divided into so many small plots, growers must charge far more to recoup their costs.
As in many industrialized countries, workers are also leaving farms for higher-paying jobs in the city. That has led to more imports, pushing Japan's self-sufficiency rate in food below 40 percent, the second worst, after Iceland, among nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
This decline, however, has gone on for years and prompted a multitude of heated fights with agricultural exporters. In the 1980's, the United States successfully won reductions in Japanese tariffs on beef and oranges. In the 1990's, tariffs were lowered on certain types of apples and rice, producing mixed results.
Still, the Japanese, like many nations, won concessions in the Uruguay Round to protect local farmers from a surge in imports. One such clause, typical of the minutiae that prevent broad agreements, protects farmers by automatically raising tariffs from 38.5 percent to 50 percent if beef imports surge by more than 17 percent in a quarter.
The clause may go into effect soon and has already elicited protests from the Americans and Australians. Any surge, they say, is a result of a decline in beef consumption last year prompted by the discovery that a handful of Japanese cows had mad cow disease. The event falls outside the scope of the world trade agreement, they argue.
"We don't dispute that the Japanese are within their rights to raise tariffs," an Australian trade official said. "But the mad cow disease was an unusual situation because people stopped eating beef regardless of whether it was domestic or imported, so we suffered, too."

HEADLINE: Long Lines Mar Canada's Low-Cost Health Care 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: TORONTO, Feb 11 

 BODY:
During a routine self-examination last May, Shirley Magee found a lump on her breast. Within weeks she had it and some lymph nodes removed. So far so good, until it came to the follow-up therapy.
 Mrs. Magee, a 55-year-old public school secretary, researched her condition on the Internet, and read that optimally, radiation treatment should begin two weeks after surgery. But the local provincial government clearinghouse that manages the waiting time for radiation therapy told her she had to wait until the end of September -- nearly three months after her surgery -- to begin treatment. 
 "I was supposed to feel lucky I got in so quickly," said Mrs. Magee, still viscerally annoyed though she has since successfully completed her radiation regime. "It's a horrible feeling that something in your body is ticking that you have no control over. If I were a politician's wife I wouldn't have had to wait." 
Long heralded for giving all Canadians free health insurance and paying for almost all medical expenses, the health care system founded in the 1960's has long been the third rail of Canadian politics; not to be touched by private hands, nor altered by Parliament.
But growing complaints about long lines for diagnosis and surgery, as well as widespread "line-jumping" by the affluent and connected, are eroding public confidence in Canada's national health care system and producing a leading issue for next year's national elections.
A recent government study indicated that 4.3 million Canadian adults -- or 18 percent of those who saw a doctor in 2001 -- reported they had difficulty seeing a doctor or getting a test or surgery done in a timely fashion. Three million Canadians are unable to find a family physician, according to several private studies, producing a situation all the more serious since it is the family doctor who refers patients to specialists and medical testing.
"The sky isn't falling but things are not rosy," said Dr. Dana W. Hanson, president of the Canadian Medical Association. "Nevertheless if things are not fixed, the sky may fall."
Canada spends $66 billion a year on health care -- only the United States, Germany and Switzerland spend more as a proportion of total economic output -- but budget cutbacks since the early 1990's have impeded efforts to keep health care up to date. A recent report by the Senate's Standing Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technology indicates that well over 30 percent of the country's medical imaging devices are obsolete.
Overworked technology is one reason for the long lines; others include a shortage of nurses and inefficient management of hospital and other health care facilities, according to several studies.
Waiting times have also increased because an aging population has put more demands on the system, while the current generation of doctors is working fewer hours than the last.
Waiting can occur at every step of treatment. A study by the conservative Fraser Institute concluded that patients across Canada experienced average waiting times of 16.5 weeks between receiving a referral from a general practitioner and undergoing treatment in 2001-2002, a rate 77 percent longer than in 1993. The recent Senate report noted that waiting times for M.R.I., C.T. and ultrasound scans grew by 40 percent since 1994.
"Waiting lists are the hornets' nests that are jeopardizing the system," said Dr. Tirone E. David, professor of surgery at the University of Toronto. He noted that Ontario residents needed to wait an average of two months to see a cardiologist unless it was an emergency, queues for angiograms took four to six weeks, and waiting times between initial examination and micro-valve repairs could take as long as six months.
"It wasn't that way 15 years ago," Dr. David added. "It does not alter the ultimate outcome, but there's an anguish and uncertainty when a person feels their life is in a holding pattern for up to a year."
Defenders of the Canadian system note that only patients waiting months for nonemergency care, like treatments for cataracts and hernias, skew the waiting time statistics. And they argue that with a life expectancy of 79 years, Canadians still enjoy one of the longest life expectancies in the world, slightly higher than the United States where 41 million people have no health insurance.
Still, recent polls show that while Canadians want to keep their national system, they are worried about its future effectiveness.
"I don't think there's a lot of patience among the public for a lot more study," said Deputy Prime Minister John Manley in a recent interview, noting that his own driver needed to wait a year for hip replacement surgery. "There's not a lot of time to deal with it."
In response to the growing concerns, Prime Minister Jean Chretien and the Senate conducted studies of the system that concluded in recent months that shortages of doctors, nurses and diagnostic equipment had caused at least some deterioration of care over the last 10 years.
Seeking a legacy in his final year in office, Mr. Chretien agreed last week to spend over $9 billion more over the next three years on programs to improve diagnostic equipment, primary care, drug coverage and home care. But the provincial and territorial premiers say that isn't nearly enough to alleviate shortages of services, particularly in rural areas.
The system's shortfalls have opened the way for tentative but growing moves toward privately managed medical services and user fees in return for quicker service. A hospital in Montreal has begun charging fees for some surgical procedures and renting operating rooms to patients for several hundred dollars an hour. A Vancouver hospital has begun selling full-body C.T. scans for $660.
In an effort to reduce waiting lists, the provinces of Alberta, Nova Scotia and Ontario have established about 30 private M.R.I. and C.T. clinics, some of which offer nonemergency services to be paid for by private insurance.
"With the system cracking at the edges and waiting lists growing, people will eventually say 'all right, let me pay,' " said Dr. Tom McGowan, president of Canadian Radiation Oncology Services, Canada's first for-profit cancer radiation treatment center, which has treated nearly 2,000 patients since it opened in Toronto two years ago. (Patients still pay nothing at the radiation clinic; Dr. McGowan is paid by the province and receives bonuses if he surpasses productivity targets.)
The Ontario provincial government allowed Dr. McGowan to open his night clinic after it was forced to send 1,650 cancer patients to the United States for radiation treatments during a 25-month period in 2000 and 2001 because of waiting lists that were up to 16 weeks long.
Dr. McGowan said the emergency, which cost the province $20 million in travel costs, was not rooted in a shortage of equipment nor staff but inefficient public management. Whatever the reasons, his patients are quick to tell horror stories about their waits for diagnostic tests and treatment.
"Your worst fear is it is going to grow while you are waiting," said Pat McMeekin, a 53-year-old hospital clerical worker, recalling the two months she had to wait between a mammogram and the first of two biopsies confirming she had breast cancer last summer. "When you have something, you want to take care of it and be done with it."

PERSON: Jeffrey Horowitz 

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
Praising American Classical Theater, Not Burying It

BYLINE:  By CHRIS HEDGES

 BODY:
THE theater company founded by Jeffrey Horowitz nearly 25 years ago was born out of a conflagration -- literally.
 Mr. Horowitz had been given a role in 1977 with Zero Mostel in "The Merchant" by Arnold Wesker. Mr. Mostel, however, died after one performance. And Mr. Horowitz, who should have been enjoying a shot at the big time, was back on unemployment. 
 With not much else to do, he decided to polyurethane the wooden floor of his tiny studio apartment in the West Village. The maker of the product, however, had mislabeled the can, leaving out the warning that the pilot light on the stove had to be turned off. When he was in the bathroom he heard "what sounded like the air being sucked out of the room."
"I looked out the door and saw flames leaping up to the ceiling," he said. "I had to run through the fire to get out. I got third-degree burns on my feet. I took the $50,000 I received in the settlement and used it, against the usual parental advice, to start Theater for a New Audience."
His current production, "Julius Caesar," is an example of his hallmark: the fusion of the modern and the ancient. The stage setting at the Lortel Theater in Greenwich Village evokes the iron girders and concrete slabs at ground zero. He places the actors in modern dress.
He said for him the most chilling scene comes when a mob tries to hunt down a conspirator named Cinna and finds instead Cinna the poet.
"I am not Cinna the conspirator," the hapless poet cries as the mob descends upon him.
"It is no matter, his name's Cinna," a member of the crowd yells. "Pluck his name out of his heart." 
"They cut his throat," said Mr. Horowitz, as he runs his finger across his own neck.
As the company's artistic director Mr. Horowitz picks themes each season that he believes run like rivers beneath the surface of society. This season his theme is betrayal. His last play, "The General From America" by Richard Nelson, about Benedict Arnold, dealt, like "Julius Caesar," with the nature of patriotism and what it means to be a traitor.
"I've betrayed nothing that has not already betrayed itself," Arnold acidly says at the end of the play.
"You see, especially in 'Caesar,' how fickle the citizens are," Mr. Horowitz said. "Shakespeare shows us the kinds of words and actions that are used by those in power to manipulate people."
Mr. Horowitz, 56, who grew up in Miami, was a British-trained classical actor. He found roles but was always fascinated with the challenges of making classical theater resonate in America. He disliked the British snobbery that denigrated the American interpretations of classical plays.
"There was a perception that American artists could not handle classical texts," he said. "Beginning in the 1930's with companies such as the Group Theater, the American actors became known for physical and emotional power, but they were also labeled as inarticulate. This was nonsense. There is no one way or accent to speak Shakespeare. No one culture owns the classics."
He said he was "rooted in the tradition of the actor as the primary communicator of the author's language." And he drills his actors in delivery. Cicely Berry, the voice director for the Royal Shakespeare Company, works with his actors and directors "to develop the skills of mastering Shakespeare's texts."
"The actor has to be able to express great language, to respond to its rhythm, the way a pianist has to train his or her fingers to play."
But along with a care for language comes a belief that classical texts can resonate in contemporary culture. Since the Theater for a New Audience started in 1979, Mr. Horowitz has read the newspapers as closely as the stack of scripts that clutter his office. He mixes modern plays and classical plays each season "to make the point that classical theater does not live in the past."
"The themes dealt with by classical authors such as Euripides are also dealt with by contemporary authors such as Edward Bond and Richard Nelson," he said. "The themes repeat because the problems repeat. Human beings are always dealing with love, death and violence. These great plays are about the way we live and die."
Mr. Horowitz, who has two sons, Jake, 8, and Simon, 4, is married to Melissa Gradel, a writer and one of the leaders in the Brooklyn chapter of Voice of the Faithful, a Catholic lay organization formed as a result of the priest sex-abuse scandal. They live in Brooklyn. He can often be seen in the theater with his oldest son. 
MR. HOROWITZ has the look of a slightly rumpled English professor, his silver hair cascaded down over his ears. As he talked in his small office on Christopher Street, he jumped up to pull down books to find quotations he liked, along with a literary essay about his next play, "Don Juan" by Moliere.
"Great theater can be not only a forum but our conscience," he said. "The artist should not only entertain, he or she should be the channel through which we think and reflect. There is no point in doing a classical play unless we can answer the question of why we should do this play now."
Yet while he searches for plays that help illuminate moral ambiguities, he dislikes didactic theater, theater that preaches a political line or viewpoint.
"Life is complex," he said. "Art is about the questions, not the answers."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Fall to 4-Month Low on Continued War Anxieties

BYLINE:  By Reuters

 BODY:
Shares slumped again yesterday, pushing market indexes down amid continuing jitters over the prospect of an American invasion of Iraq and on heightened economic concerns in the United States. 
 General Motors helped to push down the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average after a brokerage firm lowered its recommendation on the company's shares. But Coca-Cola, another Dow stock, rose after it posted results largely in line with expectations. 
 John Person, head financial analyst at Infinity Brokerage Services, explained: "With the overhanging cloud of the Iraqi situation, renewed fears of terrorism and tensions with North Korea, this market breeds fear. And fear drives stock prices lower." 
The dispute over the North Korean nuclear program grew more complicated as the director of central intelligence, George J. Tenet, said that the North Korean pursuit of nuclear weapons was part of a broad erosion of international controls, and the International Atomic Energy Agency referred the matter to the United Nations Security Council.
The Dow industrials fell 84.94 points, or 1.08 percent, to 7,758.17. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 10.52 points, or 1.27 percent, to 818.68, while the technology-focused Nasdaq composite index dropped 16.49 points, or 1.27 percent, to 1,278.97. 
Declining stocks outnumbered those advancing on the New York Stock Exchange by a margin of more than 2 to 1. Volume eased to 1.27 billion shares from 1.32 billion.
The Dow and the S.& P. closed at levels not seen since Oct. 10. All three major market gauges have fallen for four consecutive weeks amid nagging questions about an Iraq war and its impact on a fragile economy. 
Wall Street also weighed comments by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, in a second day of Congressional testimony. Appearing before the House Financial Services Committee, Mr. Greenspan sharpened his warning about the danger of ballooning budget deficits, putting him at odds with President Bush, who has called for far-reaching tax cuts as an economic stimulus. 
Corporate earnings news included soft earnings reports from some leading technology companies like Applied Materials and Sycamore Networks. Shares in Applied Materials, the chip equipment maker, fell 12 cents, to $11.82, after the company posted a loss and forecast profit for the current quarter at the lower end of Wall Street expectations. Among other chip issues, Intel declined 19 cents, to $15.15. Sycamore, a telecommunications equipment maker, fell 15 cents, to $3.10, after it reported a loss amid continued weak spending by phone companies. The big network equipment maker Cisco Systems dropped 27 cents, to $13.20. 
General Motors fell $1.53, to $34.02. Banc of America Securities cut its rating on G.M. to sell from neutral, based on reduced expectations for growth of free cash flow. 
Coca-Cola shares rose 74 cents, to $39.74, after the company reported a slight rise in quarterly profit, reflecting momentum in soft drink, juice and water sales.
Shares in the El Paso Corporation, a heavily indebted gas pipeline business, slid more than 22 percent, down $1.07, to $3.65, after it announced a management shake-up and its credit ratings were reduced five notches.

Treasuries Are Higher
(By Bloomberg News) -- Treasury prices rose as investors sought the relative safety of fixed-income securities amid speculation that the Bush administration was intent on attacking Iraq, with or without Security Council backing. 
Ten-year notes gained after the government sold $18 billion worth of the securities at the lowest yield on record. The new notes yielded 3.96 percent at auction and traded at 3.933 percent late in the day.
The current 10-year note rose 12/32 , to 100 23/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, dropped to 3.91 percent from 3.96 percent on Tuesday. The 30-year Treasury bond rose 9/32 , to 108 2/32 . Its yield fell to 4.85 percent from 4.87 percent. Following are the results of the auction of 10-year notes.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: NORTH KOREA; 
China Asserts It Has Worked to End Nuclear Crisis

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: BEIJING, Feb. 12 

 BODY:
In recent weeks, President Bush and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell have complained loudly that China should be doing more to defuse the nuclear crisis in North Korea, China's reclusive neighbor and closest ally.
 On Tuesday, Chinese officials returned the volley, saying that their diplomats had in fact been working hard to help mediate between North Korea and the United States, but that the two sides would have to find a solution themselves. 
 While the Chinese blamed intransigence on both sides for the standoff, for the first time they publicly criticized their longtime ally for reneging on its prior agreement not to develop nuclear weapons.
"Since last October, China has made lots of efforts in our own way," both in Beijing and Pyongyang, said Zhang Qiyue, a foreign ministry spokeswoman. 
She said China supported the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" according to principles set out in the 1994 Agreed Framework, a treaty under which North Korea agreed to renounce nuclear weapons in exchange for foreign promises of energy and fuel. That framework "should be maintained," she said -- an implicit criticism of North Korea for pulling out of the agreement last month.
But she said that the standoff should be resolved through "dialogue" between the United States and North Korea instead of United Nations intervention and possible sanctions, adding, "We believe that the relevant parties should do more that may help restore dialogue at an early date."
The remarks represented the first time China had so extensively stated its position on the nuclear standoff that began last fall when the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, said the country had restarted its nuclear weapons development program, despite the 1994 accord. But the remarks also raised questions about how much influence China truly has over Mr. Kim, and whether or how it should be exerted.
"China has been quietly playing the role of mediator for many years, but it's hard to say if its influence is big or middling," said Xu Wenji, head of the North-South Korea Research Institute at Jilin University in Changchun. "I would say it's not as much as the U.S., who after all can threaten it with weapons on the one hand and offer peace and money on the other."
China is North Korea's main trading partner and provides extensive financial aid, but it is unlikely to use this economic weapon to punish its impoverished neighbor financially. 
Even though many scholars and officials here privately fault North Korea for provoking the current crisis, Chinese diplomacy hews to more low-key strategies and, more important, its officials fear provoking chaos on China's border. "China won't cut off North Korea economically over this issue," Professor Xu said. "The U.S. is far away, but this is our neighbor and any disturbance on the Korean Peninsula has a profound effect on China."
In recent articles in the Chinese press, experts here have repeatedly expressed worry that a desperate North Korea would only accelerate its nuclear weapons program to save face, and could push nonnuclear countries like Japan and South Korea to follow suit. 
Since India and Pakistan already have such weapons, China could be surrounded by potentially nuclear-powered conflicts, a dangerous position.
"Imagining a worst-case scenario, it is not out of the realm of possibility that China may be subjected to nuclear blackmail when North Korea becomes desperate, and that may force China into an intractable strategic or policy dilemma," wrote Shi Yinhong, an international relations expert at the People's University in Beijing, in the newspaper Ta Kong Pao.
So even though many Chinese officials and scholars express their chagrin over the actions of their ally, few recommend punishment today. Perhaps with a better understanding of the "face" issues so important in Asian diplomacy, they blame the United States, too. 
"Without question, the North Korean government has been the main provocateur, and is primarily responsible for the North Korean nuclear crisis, and its potentially destructive impact on East Asian security," Professor Shi wrote. But he added that "some of the fundamental causes lie in the strategic tenets and trends of the Bush administration," particularly its "foolish and crude" declaration that North Korea was part of what Mr. Bush has called the Axis of Evil.
Both scholars and diplomats here expressed some skepticism about how much influence China could exert on either side, even if it wanted to. Chinese diplomats have long complained about the lukewarm reception they get from Pyongyang, where North Korean counterparts do not return phone calls or accept invitations.
What's more, North Korea has made it clear that it does not want Chinese mediation, preferring to deal with the United States directly. 
In an interview with the Chinese newspaper The 21st Century Economic Herald, Shi Xiaoqin, a member of an army research group, said that China's ability to play a special role was limited and that it could not prevent North Korea from developing nuclear weapons.
So far, the Chinese government has tried to exert a calming influence on North Korea, making its "utmost efforts in its own way," the foreign ministry spokeswoman said.
But with a longstanding official policy of not interfering in other country's affairs, China is disinclined to be an aggressive power broker. Anyway, the Chinese are now trying to placate two antagonistic countries -- the United States and North Korea -- that are both critical to China's future, perhaps an impossible position.
"We have embassies and lots of contacts and therefore there are lots of opportunities," Professor Xu said. "But China does not really put heavy pressure on other countries. It tries to work through persuasion."

Yahoo Outlines Plans for Adding Premium Services

BYLINE:  By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
At its last meeting with analysts, 15 months ago, Yahoo gave each of them a gift of a yo-yo to make the point that what goes down can come up. At a dinner on Tuesday before its meeting yesterday, the company gave analysts a set of balls, to show that it has stabilized its finances and is now juggling several opportunities for growth.
 In the meeting yesterday, at Yahoo's headquarters in Sunnyvale, Calif., the company spent much of its time outlining plans for new premium services it intends to introduce to its Web portal later this year. These include a mix of new services -- like video programming to be watched on computer screens, and expanded versions of its core offerings like e-mail. 
 But the company disappointed some analysts in that it did not announce any new cable or telephone companies in the Untied States through which it will offer its service. Yahoo already has such an arrangement with SBC Communications, and yesterday it announced a similar deal with the BT Group, formerly British Telecommunications.
"I was hoping they would give us a lot more," said Safa Rashtchy, an analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. 
Yahoo is trying to diversify itself away from online advertising, which fell sharply after the Internet bubble burst. Its overarching strategy is to find ways to get more revenue from the more than 200 million people who use the Web portal each month. Last year, it received 40 cents of revenue for each user; it wants that figure to rise to 70 cents within four years.
Yahoo signaled that it is likely to undercut the prices of other leading Internet companies that are also building premium services. America Online, a unit of AOL Time Warner, is preparing to begin an improved $15-a-month service meant for people who have high-speed, or broadband, service from their cable or phone companies. Microsoft's MSN already charges $10 a month for a service that blocks unwanted e-mail messages, among other features. RealNetworks charges $10 a month for its RealOne SuperPass, a package of audio and video programming delivered over the Internet.
Yahoo told investors that it expects that most of its new services would cost $3 to $6 a month, although it did not offer specifics.
To compete with RealOne, it said it would introduce Yahoo Platinum, which would focus on video broadcasts of sports, entertainment and news programming. The only example the company gave, however, was a short section of outtakes from the Fox Broadcasting talent search program "American Idol."
It will also introduce a service called Yahoo Plus, which will include expanded e-mail services, controls to help parents limit their children's use of the Web and other features. Then it will introduce an even more comprehensive and expensive package, meant specifically for users of broadband connections, in the second half of the year that will include some of the sort of video content in the Platinum product.
This service is meant to compete with the MSN and AOL services for the market that has come to be known as "bring your own access." 
All three companies are choosing to market such stand-alone broadband products because they have been unable to reach deals to offer services in conjunction with cable or telephone companies.
Yahoo said it had 1.1 million subscribers to its Internet access service, offered with SBC, and another 1.1 million subscribers to other paid services, mainly enhanced e-mail and online personal ads.
By the end of this year, the company expects to add 1 million to 1.5 million Internet access customers. But despite its many new products, it only expects to add 200,000 to 500,000 subscribers to its other services. That is a much slower growth pace than last year, when its other fee-based services added 725,000 subscribers.
The company talked of a range of other initiatives including expanding its offerings to small businesses and bolstering its HotJobs career advertising site. Yahoo's fastest growing area, however, is its first business: Internet searches. Its revenue from advertising related to searches, already $140 million last year, will grow by 40 percent to 60 percent this year, it predicted. More traditional brand advertising will only grow by 10 percent to 20 percent, although from a larger base of $575 million, it said.

HEADLINE: Voluntary Pacts to Curb Greenhouse Gases 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER 8. LEE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 12 

 BODY:
Administration officials announced several modest agreements with a number of industries today for voluntary controls on emissions of gases linked to global warming. The agreements, a result of aggressive meetings with industry executives, are an effort to stave off pending state and federal proposals for mandatory ceilings.
 Environmental groups and Democrats have seized upon the limited curbs as evidence that voluntary policies will not produce substantive results. 
 The industry commitments ended up being less substantive than the White House first sought, which is a reason the announcement, originally scheduled for the White House last week, ended up taking place in the Department of Energy's cafeteria with cabinet members, conservation groups and industry representatives said. 
Some industries have promised to curb their output of heat-trapping gases, which include carbon dioxide, sulfur hexafluoride and perfluorocarbon. Among the 12 major industrial sectors that joined in the announcement are electrical utilities, petroleum, mining, steel, semiconductors and automobiles.
Critics note, however, that many of the announced emissions targets are pegged to "intensity," which is defined as the amount of such gases per unit of economic production, rather than the absolute volume emissions. Most emissions regulations are pegged to net output. In the case of the Kyoto Protocols, the international pact on global warming, they are pegged to actual reductions compared with 1990 levels.
"It's an accounting trick in our view," said Dan Lashof, the science director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group. "Any pollution pegged to economic activity is unprecedented and unwarranted."
Opponents of regulation were also critical, but for another reason. They see the voluntary policies as precursors for mandatory ceilings.
"It's incoherent," said Myron Ebell, a climate expert at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, which is an advocate for free markets. "It's like saying, 'We're opposed to capital punishment, but don't worry about the gallows we have built in the front yard.' "
Utilities, which account for about 40 percent of United States emissions of heat-trapping gases, pledged to reduce their intensity by 3 percent to 5 percent. The chemical industry agreed to reduce intensity of the gases by 18 percent in 2012, as compared with 1990 levels. The automobile industry pledged reductions in the intensity of its manufacturing emission rates but not the vehicle emission rates by at least 10 percent by 2012 compared with 2002.
Last year, President Bush announced that he wanted to reduce the amount of such gases per unit of gross domestic product by 18 percent. Critics say using the overall economy as a measure of gas emissions is deceptive because the parts of the economy that are growing tend to be service sectors, where emissions are less of a problem. 
Administration officials concede that the overall amount of greenhouse gas emissions is not likely to fall within the next decade.
"It's not going to get smaller immediately," said Christie Whitman, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.
But Mrs. Whitman said industries would get the capital to invest in more environment-friendly technologies. "As they develop the technology, they will in fact see an actual reduction," she said.
The agreements are part of the White House's broader campaign to highlight President Bush's environmental initiatives, an area where polls show him politically vulnerable.

HEADLINE: Zihuatanejo Journal; 
For All to Read: A Mexican Resort's Dirty Secret

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER

DATELINE: ZIHUATANEJO, Mexico, Feb. 8 

 BODY:
This was paradise.
 But a sewer runs through it. Mexico's environmental protection agency sampled the water in Zihuatanejo's beautiful bay back in September. The results were not pretty: the agency said sewage from the city's wastewater plant had tainted one of the nation's loveliest harbors. 
 Winter currents are cleansing the bay, and hundreds of tourists are frolicking on the beach. The report has driven few people away. But it singled out Zihuatanejo among 16 of Mexico's most popular beaches that suffer from pollution. It found fecal coliform levels in the marina, near the plant, at 1,500 parts per 100 milliliters of water, far beyond health standards. 
"People and tourists have a right to know this," said Victor Lichtinger, Mexico's environmental secretary.
But the right to know is a novel concept in Mexico. The local hoteliers reacted to the report's becoming public this week like a man with a hangover hearing an alarm clock. After years of living in denial, the businessmen who live by the tourist dollar here have been forced to admit they have a problem: they may be killing the thing they love.
"This one piece of data from five months ago could destroy this entire community," said Zihuatanejo's former mayor, Armando Federico Gonzalez. It could also change the way Mexico treats a treasure: the beaches that draw millions of tourists who sustain the country's economy.
For the local save-the-bay movement here, this is a moment like the day the Cuyahoga River caught fire outside Cleveland in June 1969, and the burning river compelled Congress to pass the Clean Water Act.
"This is a primordial place for us, and we don't want to lose it," said Oscar Gutierrez, an architect in Zihuatanejo (zee-wah-ta-NAY-ho), on the Pacific coast of Guerrero, one of Mexico's poorest states.
For three decades, the causes of clean water and environmental protection in Mexico have been swamped by the forces of development. The report has forced some members of the conservative business establishment here to the realization that "we've lost our balance," in the words of Javier de la Pena, a hotel director. "The growth of Zihuatanejo exceeded our capacity to contain and control it."
The growth has battered the bay. "To our disgrace," said Zihuatanejo's new mayor, Amador Campos Aburto, "our municipal services did not grow along with the population."
Enrique Krebs, a restaurateur and leader of the three-year-old save-the-bay movement, moved to Zihuatanejo in 1965. No one then, he said, could conceive of its being polluted.
About 3,000 people lived here at the time. About 95,000 live here now. 
What happened? In a word, Ixtapa.
In 1970, Mexico's federal government decided to build a tourist paradise next to Zihuatanejo. The federal tourism board made up the name of Ixtapa (ish-TA-pa). Then the tourism board made up Ixtapa, with 4,200 hotel rooms. It generally takes five workers to maintain one room. Almost all the workers and their families live in Zihuatanejo.
Lots of people got rich off Ixtapa. But little money went to provide basic services for the tens of thousands of people who clean its pools and mop its floors and rake its sand. 
Many thousands of tourists come to Zihuatanejo, too. "We love the water and the sand and the people," said Robin Westerheim of Cypress Springs, Tex. "We did hear about the water, and we were taken aback. But we also know that Mexico knows that tourists are their livelihood. Their economy depends on us."
Zihuatanejo and Ixtapa, along with Acapulco, a three-hour drive down the Pacific coast, are the great tourist attractions in Guerrero. They represent 80 percent of the state's economy, said Guerrero's tourism director, Guadalupe Gomez Maganda.
"This is our life," said Ms. Gomez Maganda. "It's crucial to our economic and social existence. This is our chance to make things better."
Save-the-bay crusaders, like Mr. Gutierrez and Mr. Krebs, say that federal, state and local officials responsible for the water in the bay now have a clear choice: lie, deny, or do something.
Some are still in denial. Enraged state politicians insist the pollution is caused by runoff from rainfall in faraway villages in the Sierras that lack plumbing. But the map suggests that the rivers that run through them do not flow into Zihuatanejo.
Other officials say they will do something. John McCarthy, the director of Fonatur, the federal tourism agency that built Ixtapa, said he would help create a $2 million government fund "to rectify what's going on in Zihuatanejo."
The citizens of Zihuatanejo already have done something. In an election three months ago they voted out the Institutional Revolutionary Party, the PRI, which ran Mexico for seven decades and still runs Guerrero's state government. The biggest issue was the water.
The winner was Mr. Campos, of the left-leaning Democratic Revolutionary Party. He pledged to work with the save-the-bay campaigners.
Now a test of the new Mexico promised by President Vicente Fox when he took power from the PRI two years ago is on tap.
In the city stands Mr. Campos, the leftist. In control of the state stands the old-guard PRI. In charge of the country and i environment stand Mr. Fox and his National Action Party. With national elections coming this summer, they collaborate on little.
"We are different colors," Mayor Campos said. "But we are going to work in harmony on this."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: NUCLEAR STANDOFF; 
North Korea Wants Arms, And More Aid From U.S., Chief of C.I.A. Suggests

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL R. GORDON with FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 12 

 BODY:
The nation's intelligence chief said today that North Korea had settled on a twofold strategy of keeping its nuclear weapons program even as it seeks to improve ties with Washington.
 The director of central intelligence, George J. Tenet, said North Korea was likely to process the spent nuclear fuel from its Yongbyon reactor, which would provide it with enough plutonium for several additional weapons. 
 He also cautioned that the United States could face "a near term" intercontinental missile threat from North Korea, repeating warnings that the Central Intelligence Agency has made for several years that North Korea may test and deploy the Taepodong 2 missile. North Korea is currently observing a moratorium on missile flight tests. 
Mr. Tenet's assessment came as the International Atomic Energy Agency voted to refer the North Korean issue to the United Nations Security Council. The decision was made after the governing board of the I.A.E.A., the United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency, passed a resolution at a meeting in Vienna that formally recognized that North Korea's actions represented a major security threat.
The board's vote came after Mohamed ElBaradei, the agency's director general, said "my numerous and repeated efforts to engage"North Korea had "been in vain." 
Since last fall, North Korea has expelled I.A.E.A inspectors, renounced its participation in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and begun to accelerate its nuclear efforts, prompting wide speculation about its strategy. 
One school of thought holds that North Korea is trying to create a new bargaining chip to induce Washington to offer economic aid and provide formal assurance that it will not attack. A competing theory holds that North Korea has determined that its security would be best assured with a potent nuclear arsenal.
Today, Mr. Tenet said North Korea's strategy was a subtle blending of both aims. 
"Kim Jong Il's attempts to parlay the North's nuclear program into political leverage suggest he is trying to negotiate a fundamentally different relationship with Washington, one that implicitly tolerates the North's nuclear weapons program," Mr. Tenet told the Senate Armed Services Committee.
Mr. Tenet warned that North Korea's nuclear program combined with the weakening of international controls would encourage other nations to follow suit. They may conclude, he said, that nuclear weapons provide the best way to keep up with their neighbors and deter threats from more powerful nations.
"The desire for nuclear weapons is on the upsurge," Mr. Tenet said. "Additional countries may decide to seek nuclear weapons as it becomes clear their neighbors and regional rivals are already doing so. The 'domino theory' of the 21st century may well be nuclear."
Mr. Tenet provided no clues as to how the Bush administration planned to react if North Korea moved ahead with its nuclear program. The C.I.A. has said that North Korea probably has enough plutonium for one or two nuclear weapons. By reprocessing spent fuel from the Yongbyon reactor, North Korea could acquire about five bombs' worth of plutonium in six months or less, current and former American officials say. 
Restarting the reactor itself could churn out enough plutonium for one bomb a year. North Korea could also increase its arsenal by completing the construction of two larger reactors and by proceeding with its uranium enrichment efforts.
North Korea could have a system to enrich uranium by the middle of the decade, the C.I.A. says, producing material for two bombs a year. 
The Bush administration is hoping China and other nations will use diplomatic pressure to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear efforts. The administration has sent conflicting and often confusing signals about its eagerness to engage in direct talks with North Korea. 
Asked if Washington had a negotiating strategy to dissuade North Korea from pursuing nuclear weapons, Mr. Tenet said the policy was still under review.
In Vienna, Dr. ElBaradei emphasized the need for diplomatic solution. He did not rule out economic sanctions, though Washington says it is not pressing for them. 
"The message is that, let us first try a diplomatic solution, as we are trying in Iraq, as we are trying everywhere else," Dr. ElBaradei said. " But if it doesn't work, I haven't heard any member who is saying that the Security Council will not consider other options."
Two members of the nuclear agency's governing board, Russia and Cuba, abstained from the vote and two others were absent. In a statement after the vote, the Russian envoy, Grigory V. Berdennikov, said Moscow believed that direct talks between Washington and North Korea should have preceded the decision to send the report to the Security Council, a step he called "untimely and counterproductive."
John R. Bolton, the undersecretary of state for arms control and international security, said yesterday that North Korea's "nuclear weapons programs are a threat to the global nonproliferation regime."
"That's why a multilateral institution like the Security Council is the appropriate place for this," he said. But he also said the United States would not push for sanctions as a result of today's I.A.E.A. vote.

HEADLINE: In Connecticut And New York, Doctors Plan To Join Protest 

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
Doctors in New York and Connecticut are planning to protest rising malpractice insurance costs next month in Albany and Hartford, voicing their anger over the same rancorous issue that led New Jersey doctors to stage a work slowdown.
 Last week, New Jersey joined a growing list of states where physicians have held limited walkouts to demand so-called tort reform, including a cap on the amount of compensation for pain and suffering that juries can award patients who win malpractice lawsuits. 
Doctors in New York and Connecticut are not threatening any job action, but said they planned to use the lobbying visits they make to their state capitals each year at this time to urge lawmakers to keep rising premiums in check. 
"Our physicians are more and more angry," said Lynda Lees Adams, a spokeswoman for the Medical Society of the State of New York, which represents 28,000 doctors. Ms. Adams said the medical society was urging its members to call state lawmakers on Feb. 25 and to go to Albany on March 11.
The Connecticut State Medical Society, which represents 7,000 doctors, said it would use its annual visit to Hartford on March 26 to stage a white-coat rally and demand relief.
"We have such an acute crisis," said Tim Norbeck, the executive director of the Connecticut society. "The real question here is, can your doctor stay in practice? Unless this crisis is arrested, doctors are going to be forced out of practice, with dire consequences for patient care."
In New York and Connecticut, as in New Jersey, doctors are seeking a $250,000 cap on jury awards for pain and suffering. The cap would not apply to economic damages, like compensation for lost wages.
In Connecticut, doctors say they are unfairly pressured to settle lawsuits becausestate law allows plaintiffs to propose a settlement before trial. If a doctor rejects the settlement but a jury later awards an amount equal or greater, the doctor must pay 12 percent interest on the award for the length of the litigation.
In New York, doctors said they were also seeking changes in trial rules that would make malpractice lawsuits easier to fight.
Lawyers' groups, however, say that doctors and their insurers unjustly want to limit compensation for malpractice victims and that insurance companies are really to blame for the steep rise in premiums.
"We have very few medical malpractice cases in the state of Connecticut," said Christopher D. Bernard, the president of the Connecticut Trial Lawyers Association, who put the number at about 350 a year. "We don't have the issue of a flood of lawsuits. We don't have a problem with runaway juries."
Mr. Bernard said that insurance companies held premiums artificially low during the 1990's while making huge profits from stock investments. Now, with the markets lower, he said, they are trying to make up losses by increasing premiums.
Mr. Bernard said that caps on pain and suffering awards had failed to achieve the desired results in other states and that insurers were taking advantage of doctors.
"The doctors are getting squeezed; there really isn't any issue about that," he said. "But the real focus has to be on trying to level out the ups and the downs of the economy and how they affect insurance premiums."

HEADLINE: Shares Post Decline In Initial Offering Of an Auto Insurer 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Shares in the Infinity Property and Casualty Corporation, the automobile insurance unit of the American Financial Group, fell yesterday, a day after being sold in a $198.1 million initial public offering, the first in the United States this year.
 Infinity shares fell 10 cents, to $15.90, on the New York Stock Exchange, after touching $15.42. American Financial sold 12.38 million shares of the unit at $16 each after cutting the price by as much as a third. 
 With the looming threat of a war in Iraq depressing the outlook for economic growth and corporate profits, some money managers have been wary of buying stock, and few companies have plans to go public. Infinity's sale, which had been scaled back, ended an eight-week drought for initial offerings and came after the first January without an initial sale since 1974. 
"The outlook doesn't look that rosy for many companies," said Kendrick Kam, manager of the Marketocracy Masters 100 Fund. "The rule of thumb is that underwriters don't want to take you public if either of the next two quarters might be disappointing." 
American Financial, which is based in Cincinnati, sold Infinity shares at the low end of the proposed range of $16 to $17 a share. The company cut the range on Monday, from $18 to $20 a share, after marketing the shares to investors for as much as $24 each two weeks ago. 
American Financial shares fell 45 cents yesterday, to $18.48. 
The offering came as buyers shunned new shares amid declines in stocks. The Accredited Home Lenders Holding Company, a mortgage lender to people with histories of unpaid bills, postponed to today, from yesterday, its plan to sell shares in an initial offering valued at up to $106 million. 
Infinity is a holding company that comprises several American Financial auto insurance subsidiaries, including the Atlanta Casualty Company, the Leader Insurance Company and the Windsor Insurance Company, along with property and casualty insurance business from the Great American Insurance Company. 
Infinity, based in Birmingham, Ala., sells car insurance to drivers who are deemed high risk based on driving record, age or vehicle. 
American Financial plans to use proceeds from the offering to pay debt and provide capital to its remaining property and casualty insurance units. American Financial will retain a 39 percent stake in Infinity, valuing the car insurer at $325.6 million.

HEADLINE: Citigroup Chief Is Getting Options in Lieu of a Bonus 

BYLINE:  By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
If investment bankers at Citigroup have complaints about their annual bonuses for 2002, their boss, Sanford I. Weill, will probably be in no mood to listen. He got no bonus at all.
 After a trying year in which Citigroup agreed to pay a $300 million fine to securities regulators and suffered a 25 percent drop in its stock price, Mr. Weill received no cash or stock on top of his $1 million salary. But yesterday, Citigroup's directors softened the blow to Mr. Weill's considerable wealth and ego by giving him options on an additional 1.5 million shares of Citigroup. 
 Citigroup did not place a value on the options, which give Mr. Weill the right to buy shares for $32.05 each over four and a half years, starting in July 2004. But one compensation consulting firm, Pearl Meyer & Partners, said they were worth about $14.5 million.
That estimate, calculated by a complicated formula, is less than the $17 million Mr. Weill received as a bonus for 2001. A year ago this week, he also received a grant of options on 482,490 shares.
Paul Hodgson, senior research associate with the Corporate Library, a research group in Portland, Me., questioned how much Mr. Weill had actually given up.
"If the stock price rebounds when Citigroup and the rest of the market recovers, the potential upside is huge, with profits far higher than any bonus he would be likely to have received this year," Mr. Hodgson said, referring to the options grant.
Mr. Weill, 69, will be able to exercise one-fifth of those options, starting in mid-July. But Citigroup's stock would have to rise by about 35 percent before he would do so. Those options allow him to buy stock at $42.11 a share; Citigroup's stock closed yesterday at $31.42, down 63 cents.
A Citigroup spokeswoman, Leah C. Johnson, cited the decline in the share price as the reason Mr. Weill received no bonus. She declined to explain why the number of options granted to Mr. Weill tripled this year.
Richard D. Parsons, the chairmanand chief executive of AOL Time Warner, is chairman of the personnel and compensation committee of Citigroup's board. He did not respond to a request for comment on Mr. Weill's pay.
Mr. Weill, who is a billionaire, already owns more than 22.7 million Citigroup shares. The value of his stake declined by about $270 million last year as investors grew worried about the potential liability from investor lawsuits over the firm's stock picks.
In December, Citigroup joined 10 other big securities firms in tentatively agreeing to a settlement with regulators who had been investigating whether Wall Street analysts' recommendations were tainted by their employers' desire for investment banking fees. Citigroup agreed to pay a $300 million fine and spend $100 million more to buy independent research and educate investors.
Jack B. Grubman, a former analyst in the Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup, agreed to pay a $15 million fine and to be barred from working on Wall Street. Regulators uncovered e-mail messages written by Mr. Grubman that contended that he had raised his rating on AT&T's stock in exchange for Mr. Weill's help in gaining admission to an exclusive Manhattan nursery school for Mr. Grubman's twins. Citigroup donated $1 million to the school, but Mr. Weill denied that he had done anything wrong in helping Mr. Grubman.
In taking a pay cut last year, Mr. Weill had plenty of company on Wall Street. Most securities firms sharply reduced the bonuses of most of their employees and executives.
Companies traditionally do not disclose the pay of their senior executives until they file their proxy statements, usually in March. But some details have begun trickling out because a new federal law requires quick reporting of executives' stockholdings.
Last week, Merrill Lynch & Company reported that its new chief executive, E. Stanley O'Neal, received shares worth $5.4 million as part of his bonus for 2002. That amount, which was in addition to an undisclosed amount of cash salary and bonus, was down 34 percent from the $8.2 million stock bonus he received for 2001.
Morgan Stanley reported in December that its chairman and chief executive, Philip J. Purcell, received 72,254 shares of restricted stock and options on another 162,572 shares. Morgan Stanley did not give values for those grants, but the shares were worth less than $3 million.
For 2001, Mr. Purcell received a pay package that Morgan Stanley said was worth $15 million. It included 77,304 restricted shares, which were valued at $3.3 million, and options on 173,934 shares, which were also valued at $3.3 million.

HEADLINE: COLLEGE BASKETBALL; 
Woman to Coach Men, for a Game

BYLINE:  By JERE LONGMAN 

 BODY:
As Teresa Phillips sees it, she will make only inadvertent history tonight when she becomes the first woman to coach a major college men's basketball team.
 She is the athletic director at Tennessee State, and a former coach of the women's team. The current men's coach, Hosea Lewis, has been suspended for one game after a brawl on Monday night between Tennessee State and Eastern Kentucky that led to the ejection of 19 players. 
 Hired as athletic director last spring after three interim stints in the position, and possessing a degree in economics and business education from Vanderbilt, where she also played basketball, Phillips is known as a disciplinarian with an insistence on academic excellence. She is one of a small number of female athletic directors at colleges with football programs. Her primary mission is to restore direction and order to an athletic department that once served as the model for historically black universities. 
For one game, as Tennessee State travels to Austin Peay tonight, Phillips will coach the men's basketball team, which is despairing through a 2-20 season that includes an 0-11 record in the Ohio Valley Conference. Conference rules stipulate that Lewis, the head coach, must miss one game because of his players' involvement in Monday's fight.
"I don't really see it as history," Phillips, who is 44, said in an telephone interview last night. "History will occur when institutions actually hire a woman to coach a men's team and give her all the opportunities to build a program. I'm pinch-hitting for one night."
The decision by Phillips to make herself head coach tonight has not come without criticism. In a column yesterday in The Nashville City Paper, Ed Atlas said the move "smacks of a publicity stunt." Ultimately, Atlas wrote, "her presence on the sideline will be a folksy footnote to a forgettable season."
University officials denied that any publicity stunt was involved, saying that Atlas was a former sports publicist at Tennessee State who had been fired by Phillips.
"She is not doing this for the publicity," Dr. James A. Hefner, the university president, said in an interview. "Teresa believes there's not another coach with the experience she has for this one-game coaching stint. Teresa is not a person who says, 'I want to make history in that light.' She's not that type."
As Tennessee State's women's basketball coach from 1989 to 2000, Phillips accumulated a record of 150-151, twice led her teams to the N.C.A.A. tournament and in 1990 was named national coach of the year. Including a previous stint coaching at Fisk University, her career record is 212-189.
Phillips said she decided to coach to avoid putting Chris Graves, a second-year assistant to Lewis, in a potentially awkward situation. "If it was a difficult game, I didn't want the young man to have that hanging over him," she said.
In an interview Graves, 26, said: "It's not my decision. I'm not going to get involved." Of Phillips, he added: "I hope she does well. She's got a lot of experience."
Monday's brawl was not the first embarrassing episode involving the university this basketball season. A potentially dangerous incident occurred in late December, when the former coach Nolan Richardson III got into an argument with Lewis, then his assistant, and retrieved a gun from his car, bringing it into the campus gym.
Richardson, the son of Nolan Richardson, the former Arkansas head coach, was suspended by Phillips, and he resigned on Jan. 8. Lewis was named interim head coach. Hefner, president of Tennessee State, said that Richardson's actions were "foolish, unnecessary, senseless."
The gun incident, combined with Monday's fight, "obviously are going to leave a mark or two," Hefner said, adding that he believed these were isolated though unfortunate occurrences. Of the fight, he said: "That is not T.S.U. We practice sportsmanship. We don't engage in things of that sort. I will not tolerate that."
Tennessee State has a glorious athletic tradition. The sprinter Wilma Rudolph, part of the university's famous Tigerbelles track team, won three gold medals at the 1960 Olympics in Rome. The men's basketball teams coached by the pioneering John McLendon Jr. won three consecutive National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics titles in the late 1950's with a lineup that included the future Knicks star Dick Barnett. John Merritt coached Tennessee State to seven black national football championships from 1965 to 1982.
As Hefner noted, Tennessee State is currently the only historically black university to compete in a conference with other colleges of predominantly white enrollment. In the fall of 2001, it was awarded the Ohio Valley Conference's Academic Achievement Banner. The combined grade point average of Tennessee State athletes, compared with the general student body, was higher than that for any other college in the conference.
The graduation rate of its athletes is also among the highest at predominantly African-American universities, officials said. A decade ago, only about 30 percent of Tennessee State athletes graduated, Phillips said, while increased attention to academics, tutoring and counseling for students has helped increase the rate to 63 percent.
And yet, like other historically black colleges, Tennessee State has faced the challenge of maintaining its athletic success since Southern universities began desegregating, thus providing African-American athletes with a much wider choice among colleges.
Two Tennessee State athletic directors have been fired since 1999. In 2000, the National Collegiate Athletic Association placed the university on probation for three years and reduced some scholarships, citing a lack of institutional control involving football, basketball and several other sports. With few seniors, the football squad finished 2-10 last season. The N.C.A.A. was also investigating the men's basketball team for possible rules infractions at the time Richardson resigned.
Hefner said yesterday that while Lewis had worked diligently as interim coach, he hoped to have a permanent coach in place by mid-March.
Win or lose tonight, Phillips said, she may spend time at practice with the men's team for the remaining regular-season games, and may even sit on the bench, although she will not serve again as head coach. Her more urgent job, she said, was to stabilize an athletic department that is seeking to regain its constancy.
"We have a storied athletic past," she said. "Over the last 15 years, we have struggled. One of the things we have to look at is integration. The years in which we were flourishing, we were getting football players like Ed (Too Tall) Jones and Richard Dent. Now we have to fight the majority schools for the same athletes. It doesn't mean we don't want to be successful, but we face some challenges, including financial challenges."
Having a revolving-door leadership in the athletic department contributed to a downswing in the university's success, she said.
"This one game is not of much importance as far as trying to make any kind of point or history," Phillips said. "I've got to focus on my job of providing the environment and resources for the coaches I hire and student athletes to be successful."

HEADLINE: Pataki's Poll Numbers Drop as Budget Shrinks 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 12 

 BODY:
With New York facing a gigantic budget shortfall and the economy still staggering, the percentage of voters who approve of how Gov. George E. Pataki is handling his job has fallen to the lowest level in seven years, according to a statewide poll by Quinnipiac University.
 The poll, taken from Feb. 4 to Feb. 10, found that 49 percent of the registered voters surveyed approved of Mr. Pataki's job performance and 41 percent disapproved. The other 10 percent had no opinion. In late September, just before the Republican governor won a third term, the same polling institute showed his approval rating was 62 percent. 
 Maurice Carroll, the director of the polling institute, said voters appeared to be responding, in large part, to Mr. Pataki's budget proposal, which would close an $11.5 billion gap mostly by cutting back spending on education and health care. Throughout the election, the governor successfully avoided answering questions about the shaky state of the state's budget and only revealed the size of the looming deficit in January.
Lisa Stoll, a spokeswoman for the governor, said it was natural for the voters to respond negatively to the bearer of bad news. Ms. Stoll said, however, that the poll also shows Mr. Pataki's underlying strength: 62 percent of the voters surveyed think Mr. Pataki "has good leadership qualities" and 59 percent think he "is honest and trustworthy," according to the poll. 
"New Yorkers know the governor is a strong leader and trust he will make the tough choices necessary to grow our economy," Ms. Stoll said.
Mr. Pataki's stature among voters has not sunk this low since July 1996, when the Quinnipiac poll showed about 46 percent of voters approved of his job performance, during a bitter budget fight. He peaked at 81 percent in October 2001.
When asked if they would prefer raising taxes in order to keep state services at their current level or cut services to keep taxes stable, 47 percent of the people who responded to the survey sided with the governor's approach of cutting services, but 41 percent said they would prefer higher taxes. The rest were undecided.
But 84 percent of those surveyed disagreed with the governor's proposed cuts to health care for the poor.
The polling institute at the college, in Hamden, Conn., surveyed 1,141 randomly chosen registered votes across the state. The margin of sampling error for a sample of this size is plus or minus 3 percentage points, so differences of less than that amount are statistically insignificant.

GRAPHIC: Photo: Gov. George E. Pataki's approval rating fell significantly in a new poll by Quinnipiac University. His rating was down steeply from September, just before he won a third term, to its lowest point in seven years. The poll director said the drop seemed related to the governor's proposed budget cuts.

HEADLINE: A Cash Infusion for Digital Archives 

BYLINE:  By KATIE HAFNER 

 BODY:
IN the strongest signal to date of its commitment to preserving the nation's digital legacy, Congress has set aside $100 million for the Library of Congress to carry out a plan for collecting and preserving digital information, including images, CD's, Web pages and electronic journals.
 In December 2000, Congress provided an initial $5 million for the library to come up with a proposal for digital preservation. The library submitted the plan to Congress last September, and lawmakers approved the plan in January. Another $20 million will now be released for carrying out the early phases of the plan. 
 "I don't think we've ever had a single shot of this size in our entire history," said James H. Billington, the librarian of Congress.
 Congress will allot an additional $75 million on the condition that this amount is matched by the private sector. The private contributions could be in the form of cash, hardware, software or consulting services. Initially, the matching funds had to be raised by March 31 of this year. But the library is seeking an extension to March 31, 2005.
 The library has digitized some of its physical collection, including items like Civil War photographs and presidential papers. But it is lagging in the task of archiving electronica: scholarly journals, books and magazines that are "born digital"; CD-ROM's; digital photographs, music and films; and millions of miscellaneous pieces of Internet-based material. Digital technology "has spawned a surfeit of information that is extremely fragile, inherently impermanent, and difficult to assess for long-term value," wrote the authors of the plan that was submitted to Congress. 
 The problem of preserving digital archives is complex. Not only do computer hardware and software quickly become obsolete, but the durability of storage media is also limited. "We know about paper disintegrating, but the digital world is so much more evanescent," Dr. Billington said. 
 Two years ago, Congress established the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program, charging the Library of Congress with leading a nationwide plan for the long-term preservation of digital content. To help carry out the work, the library has formed partnerships with companies and with other federal agencies, including the Commerce Department and the National Archives.
 Archival experts say the Congressional action is coming not a moment too soon.
 "We're talking about losing the potential to be able to access or reuse all of the information and knowledge that's being generated in digital form if we don't come up with effective and economical ways to preserve digital information," said Margaret Hedstrom, associate professor at the School of Information at the University of Michigan and an authority on digital archiving.
 "Everything from basic research data to online art and poetry and performance is digital," Dr. Hedstrom said. "It's a huge part of our heritage and our intellectual capital."
 Laura Campbell, associate librarian for strategic initiatives at the Library of Congress, said that carrying out the plan could take five to seven years, but that the actual preservation of material "will go on forever." 
 One example of the infrastructure that is needed could be a collaborative effort by a group of research libraries to collect electronic journals and put them on a central computer. 
 Whether the library will be able to attract the matching funds it needs from the private sector, especially given the state of the economy, remains unclear.
 "We can do it, though it's much tougher than it would have been, say two or three years ago," said James Barksdale, president and chief executive of the Barksdale Management Corporation, an investment firm in Jackson, Miss. Mr. Barksdale, the former chief executive of Netscape, is a member of the library's National Digital Strategy Advisory Board.
 "All the relevant players have had serious downturns in their stock prices, the value of their companies, and their own personal worth," he said. "It's going to take some work."

Shake a Phone Tree. Shake Again.

BYLINE:  By SARAH MILSTEIN 

 BODY:
ON Dec. 19, at 9:36 a.m., my modem died. 
 The modem provided high-speed Internet service over a digital subscriber line, or D.S.L. At first, I thought the problem was with EarthLink, my service provider. I called the company's technical support line and asked whether its network was down. The technician replied with a question: "Is the second light on your modem yellow?" It was. His verdict: "That thing is dead." 
 In six years as my service provider, EarthLink has sometimes served me well, and after my modem was eventually replaced, company executives graciously answered questions about my experience. But throughout the process, I encountered a typical aggravation: technical support that causes more distress than the problem it is supposed to solve.
 Customer service experts say it is virtually impossible to determine what proportion of a company's customers end up dissatisfied. But even if only a small percentage of technology users are frustrated by the service they receive, that's still a considerable number of people. 
 "Is this something we should worry about?" asked Claes Fornell, a professor of business administration at the University of Michigan and director of the National Quality Research Center, which studies customer satisfaction and its relationship to profitability and productivity. "Since about 80 percent of the U.S. economy consists of services, it's more than just an annoyance, it's a threat to the economy." 
 It can also be a threat to one's sanity.
 My trouble started when the technician explained that my two-year-old D.S.L. wiring had become obsolete and EarthLink no longer made compatible equipment. The company could send a new modem -- which I would have to install myself -- once Verizon had rewired my phone line at its offices. It could take up to five weeks before I received the new equipment. Five weeks! So much for high-speed service.
 Was there a quicker fix? The technician said I could try buying an old modem on eBay. I rejected that option.
 Fourteen days later -- after I had received several pieces of cheery e-mail from EarthLink requesting evaluation of the "completed installation," and had placed several phone calls to customer service that ended in blasts of static, eternal hold, a misleading phone tree or a busy signal -- I realized that I could check the status of my order online. A link from EarthLink's Web site to U.P.S. revealed that my modem was scheduled to arrive that very day. A few hours later, a shoebox-size package landed on my doorstep.
 Big trouble lurked inside the box. The modem itself looked simple, but it came with a handful of bewildering couplers and unfamiliar jacks and a one-page quick-start guide that illustrated two possible arrangements, neither of which applied to my wiring. I tried the user's guide. Six pages in, I was knee deep in a snarl of wires, trying to decipher a note that said my setup -- with a dual-line phone -- required a microfilter that was not included in the kit. 
 Back to customer service. After 15 minutes on hold, my call was answered by a technician who said I should disregard the manual. Then he talked me through a wiring arrangement that worked. He also suggested I install the latest version of EarthLink's software, which included an updated version of its handy pop-up-ad blocker. While it was downloading, he explained how to extract the right program, and then he hung up. 
 I was pleased until I realized that the new software had changed my home page to an EarthLink sales site. After some tinkering, I was able to reset it. But 10 minutes later, I realized I could not receive e-mail. I called again. While on hold, I surfed the company's Web site and found a note about adjusting account settings. I followed the instructions. Problem solved. 
 In a survey conducted last summer by the market research firm J.D. Power, EarthLink received the highest ranking for customer satisfaction among Internet providers for dial-up service, and shared the top ranking for high-speed service. How would EarthLink account for my odyssey? 
 I called Carter Calle, EarthLink's vice president for customer support. He said that a low point of my experience -- being put on hold for nearly an hour -- probably resulted from a computer glitch. Agents are trained to touch base regularly with callers who are on hold. Once I had been on hold for more than 10 or 15 minutes, my connection to the agent had almost certainly been dropped, even though the hold music droned on. In such cases, Mr. Calle said, it is best to hang up and call back, even if that means enduring another hold queue.
 What about the misleading phone tree and the static-filled connections? He promised to look into the tree. Of the poor connections, he joked, "That one is strange, because it's certainly not a policy of ours to put static on the line." 
 Mr. Calle also pointed out two "bright spots" in my experience. The company only recently began posting order statuses online, he said, and he was pleased that I had used that feature. Moreover, he was "ecstatic" to learn that I had found my e-mail account settings online. 
 "Ecstatic" is not the word I would have used. While the Web support was helpful, I was dismayed that the manuals included with my modem were confusing at best. Kevin Brand, EarthLink's vice president for broadband services, who oversees production of those materials, told me that customers have many different computer setups that cannot be covered by even two sets of instructions. 
 That may be understandable, but it does not help us oddballs. I would have been better served if the manuals had prominently included a phone number to call if I ran into trouble. Dr. Fornell, the customer service expert, agreed. "But then they better make sure they have somebody on the other line answering," he said. 
 In fact, EarthLink, a publicly traded company, recently announced plans to close four of its seven call centers, laying off 1,300 of its 5,100 employees. A company representative assured me that customers would not be affected because people would be hired at the remaining centers.
 EarthLink may have more to lose from diminished service than its customers do. As Dr. Fornell said, "We have found a pretty high correlation between levels of customer satisfaction and stock price."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE NATIONAL MOOD; 
Reponses to Warning on Terror Fall Between Fear and Fatalism

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER with TIMOTHY EGAN

DATELINE: DUNWOODY, Ga., Feb. 12 

 BODY:
Lynn Smith dashed off a letter to her two small children, just in case: "Mommy's with God now," it says. Then she dashed off to the Home Depot here for supplies to stock the safe room where she says she hopes her family will be able to ride out a terrorist attack.
 Lisa Gonzales lives in San Francisco with her 6-year-old daughter, but her boyfriend lives across the Golden Gate Bridge in Marin County. And that worries her. "I don't want to be across any bridge if something happens and I'm away from my baby," Ms. Gonzales said. "It scares me to think I would be away and I can't get to her." 
 But Beth Wilhelm, a 38-year old skin care sales manager waiting for a train in downtown Denver, was less concerned. "It might take up a little bit of my free thought, but it has not permeated my lifestyle," Ms. Wilhelm said of the warnings of a possible attack. "Denver just seems like a nonthreat."
The Bush administration's warnings on Monday that the terrorist threat has risen and that people should prepare to protect their families have heightened awareness of the dangers of attack across the country. But the reactions vary greatly.
In New York City and Washington, still shaken by the deadly strikes of Sept. 11, 2001, officials and residents have responded swiftly. The police in New York have increased patrols in subways, bridges and other public places, and the Pentagon ordered jeeps armed with Stinger antiaircraft missiles to patrol the nation's capital. Residents in both cities are stocking upon water, canned foods and supplies to seal their homes in case of a chemical attack.
But in Southern California, where earthquake preparedness has always been a fact of life, there was no stampede to grocery stores. Nor did Ed Helton, 60, a small-business man shopping at the Costco in Glendale, feel the need to pick up the plastic sheeting and duct tape and other items that the government says could save citizens.
"I'm fatalistic," Mr. Helton said. "If something happens, it happens. I'll get a good bottle of cabernet and wait inside."
Retailers and manufacturers of duct tape and other elements of the government's suggested "disaster supply kit" did report surges in sales of as much as 40 percent in some places after the government's announcement.
Jim Sinegal, chief executive of the Costco Wholesale Corporation, said in a telephone interview that stocks of duct tape that normally lasted 30 days had run out in a day and a half. 
"I'm in our new Salt Lake City store, and I just saw a cart with eight cases of duct tape and another with three cases of water," Mr. Sinegal said. 
Still, Mr. Sinegal and other executives said the greatest increases were concentrated in the Northeast, especially in the New York and Washington areas, and to a lesser extent in other major cities and coastal areas. But not in all major cities and coastal areas.
In the Northwest, distance from the centers of government, finance and earlier terrorism targets may have something to do with what seems to be a collective shrug.
About a hundred people a day stop by the Top Line espresso hut, a drive-through in Covington, a Seattle suburb, and the heightened sense of security does not seem to be on a lot of people's minds.
"The government just keeps warning us so many times that people have stopped caring, they're trying to get on with the lives," said Nate Satar, who owns the hut. "I haven't heard one person say they are scared or doing something differently."
In Chicago, Merav Elkan, an officer at the Israeli consulate, said she had endured years living in fear of terrorist attacks before moving there six years ago from Tel Aviv. But Ms. Elkan said she saw no need to stockpile supplies in her high-rise apartment on Michigan Avenue.
"You feel the threat more in Israel because it is so small," she said. "Here, everything is so big, how could it happen to me? Maybe I'm just not used to thinking of this place as threatened by terrorism."
Todd Curtis, 32, on his knees installing carpet in an office building north of the Loop, said: "I'm not sure if a thin sheet of plastic is going to do anything for you. It seems like they are just getting people scared saying things like that. I think they are just trying to cover themselves."
Why some people react with alarm and others do not may depend less on geography than on whether one is young enough to have very young children, or old enough to remember wartime rationing or cold-war-era nuclear anxiety.
In Decatur, Ga., Eva Talton, 61, stocked up on flashlights, water, batteries, kerosene lamps and charcoal. "When I was born they attacked Pearl Harbor," she said. "Now that I'm about to retire, it looks like we're going to war again. All this is just to be safe. I don't want to die of suffocation or burns."
Here in Dunwoody, like Decatur a suburb of Atlanta, Lynn Smith was wheeling two cartons of plastic sheeting, four rolls of duct tape and a couple of containers of foam insulation toward the checkout line at a Home Depot. "I used to be a lot more cavalier about things when I was single, but now that I'm married with two small children, that's changed," she said.
Besides writing her 5-year-old son and 3-year-old daughter a letter to read in case she is killed in an attack, Ms. Smith said she and her husband had set up a safe room in their house with a bathroom, a battery-operated TV, food, radios and a box of toys and books for their children.
She also said she had explained to the children about the "bad men who flew the planes into the buildings," and that the country was likely to go to war soon to prevent that from happening again.
"They've asked me whether the bad guys are going to come to Atlanta," Ms. Smith said. "And I've told them I hope not. But my 5-year-old son says that even if they do, the G.I. Joe's and firemen and police will protect us from them."
In Denver, by contrast, Sarah MacKenzie, a 34-year-old bank secretary, practically rolled her eyes as she spoke of the latest threats, warnings and saber rattling. She said she had started avoiding the TV news in recent days, and laughed at the government's suggested home-protection shopping list. "Maybe it's just a ploy to boost the economy," she said.
Todd Anselmo, 40, smoking a cigar outside his downtown Denver office, expressed a whiff of fatalism. "I live day to day, so who cares?" he said. "I have my will in place. If it's going to affect me, there's not a lot I'll be able to do about it."
He laughed and added, "It's like acid rain -- meaning, don't worry about things that are beyond your control."

HEADLINE: Technology Briefing Telecommunications:Nokia To Cut Jobs At Networks Unit 

BYLINE:  By Alan Cowell (NYT)

 BODY:
 The mobile phone maker Nokia said it would cut 550 of the 18,500 jobs at its networks division, laying off workers in Britain, Finland, Sweden and the United States. 
The Finnish company said it would also close research operations in California and Sweden. The networks division has lost about $350 million in the last six months as phone companies hit by the global economic slowdown cut back on orders for wireless network equipment. Nokia shares fell 32 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $13.77. Alan Cowell (NYT)

STATE STREET TO CLOSE2 OFFICES AND CUT 1,000 JOBS

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

 BODY:
 The State Street Corporation, which last month completed its largest acquisition by adding the record-keeping and securities-lending businesses of Deutsche Bank, said it would close two offices in the United States and eliminate about 1,000 jobs. 
Employees will be laid off starting in June over a 12- to 18-month period, State Street said. Deutsche Bank offices in Nashville and Jersey City will be shut in the third quarter of 2004, and the customer-service operations will be moved to a new location in New York. The company said the work force reduction was part of a plan to save $125 million to $150 million.

DELTA WANTS PILOTS TODISCUSS COST REDUCTIONS

BYLINE:  By Edward Wong (NYT)

 BODY:
 The chief financial officer of Delta Air Lines said yesterday that the company intended to open talks with its pilots' union to renegotiate terms in its labor agreement, but the union said it would not start any such talks unless the company delivers specific proposals. Michele Burns, Delta's chief financial officer, said at a conference in New York that the airline had to get cost cuts from its pilots to stanch its financial losses. 
But the Delta pilots' contract does not become amendable until 2005, and the union said yesterday that it had no plans to meet with executives over it. William C. Buergey, chairman of the Delta chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association, said that if executives gave a proposal to the union, its leaders would examine it and decide whether to enter into talks.

HEADLINE: A War for Oil? Not This Time 

BYLINE:  By Max Boot; Max Boot, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, is author of "The Savage Wars of Peace: Small Wars and the Rise of American Power."

DATELINE: MUNICH 

 BODY:
When Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld visited "Old Europe" last week, the placards and protesters lining his path were a visceral reminder of what the Bush administration already knew: Solid majorities in key European countries think that greed is our motive for wanting to depose Saddam Hussein. In fact, in a recent Pew Research Center poll 75 percent of respondents in France, 54 percent in Germany and 76 percent in Russia said that America wants to invade Iraq because "the U.S. wants to control Iraqi oil."
 Although Americans are divided on the wisdom of an invasion, only 22 percent of us subscribe to the cynical view that it's just about oil. Even Jimmy Carter, hardly a hawk, rebutted the accusation at the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony: "I know my country, I know my people, and I can assure you that's not the policy of my government." 
 What accounts for this trans-Atlantic disconnect? To answer that question, start by considering the accusation on the merits: Is America going into Iraq in search of "black gold"?
The charge has a surface plausibility because Iraq does have the second-largest known reserves in the world. But we certainly don't need to send 250,000 soldiers to get at it. Saddam Hussein would gladly sell us all the oil we wanted. The only thing preventing unlimited sales are the United States-enforced sanctions, which Baghdad (and the big oil companies) would love to see lifted. Washington has refused to go along because Saddam Hussein flouts United Nations resolutions. This suggests that our primary focus is the threat he poses, not the oil he possesses.
It's true that overthrowing Saddam Hussein would lead to the lifting of sanctions and a possible increase in oil exports. But it would take a lot of time and money to rebuild Iraq's dilapidated oil industry, even if the regime didn't torch everything on the way out. A study from the Council on Foreign Relations and the James A. Baker III Institute at Rice University estimated that it would take three years and $5 billion to restore Iraqi production just to its pre-1990 level of 3.5 million barrels a day. That would increase total world production by only 1.3 percent, and might not reduce prices at all if other countries cut output or banded together to keep prices stable. 
Some optimists think a postwar Iraq would stiff OPEC and slash prices radically. This seems unlikely, if the experience of Kuwait is anything to go by. While oil prices spiked before the Persian Gulf war and plummeted afterward, the long-term impact has been close to nil. Kuwait hasn't exactly been offering to fill up American sport utility vehicles free out of gratitude for being liberated. It hasn't even carried out its pledge to allow direct foreign investment in state-owned oil fields. 
As with Kuwait, a liberated Iraq would likely remain an enthusiastic member of OPEC because it would need to establish its nationalist credentials and maintain amicable relations with its oil-cartel neighbors.
For that matter, would our government really want a steep drop in prices? The domestic oil patch -- including President Bush's home state, Texas -- was devastated in the 1980's when prices fell as low as $10 a barrel. Washington is generally happy with a range of $18 to $25 a barrel, about where oil was before the strikes in Venezuela and jitters about Iraq helped push prices over $34 a barrel. If we were really concerned about cheap oil above all, we'd be sending troops to Caracas, not Baghdad.
The other possible economic advantage in Iraq would be for American companies to win contracts to put out fires, repair refineries and help operate the oil industry, as they did in Kuwait. What's the total value of such work? It's impossible to say, but last year Iraq signed a deal with Russian companies (since canceled by Saddam Hussein) to rebuild oil and other industries, valued at $40 billion over five years.
Yet the White House estimates the military operation alone would cost $50 billion to $60 billion. (Others suggest the figure would be far higher.) And rebuilding of the country's cities, roads and public facilities would cost $20 billion to $100 billion more, with much of that money in the initial years coming from the "international community" (read: Uncle Sam). 
Thus, if a capitalist cabal were running the war, it would have to conclude it wasn't a paying proposition.
This doesn't mean that oil is entirely irrelevant to the subject of Iraq. It does matter in one very important way: Oil revenues make Saddam Hussein much more dangerous than your run-of-the-mill dictator, because they give him the ability to build not only palaces but also top-of-the-line weapons of mass destruction. 
Americans recognize this. Europeans don't. Why not? Here's my theory: Europeans are projecting their own behavior onto us. They know that their own foreign policies have in the past often been driven by avarice -- all those imperialists after East Indian spices or African diamonds. (This tradition is going strong today in Russia and France, whose Iraq policies seem driven at least in part by oil companies that were granted lucrative concessions by Saddam Hussein.) 
Nobody would claim that America's global intentions have always been entirely pure. Still, our foreign policy -- from the Barbary war to Kosovo -- has usually had a strain of idealism at which the cynical Europeans have scoffed. In the case of Iraq, they just can't seem to accept that we might be acting for, say, the general safety and security of the world. After more than 200 years, Europe still hasn't figured out what makes America tick.

HEADLINE: Of Sheepskins and Greenbacks 

BYLINE:  By JACQUES STEINBERG

DATELINE: MIDDLEBURY, Vt. 

 BODY:
One morning in late February, Mike Schoenfeld will gather about two dozen manila folders from his desk and carry them to a hearing room inside the admissions office of Middlebury College.
 As the admissions committee listens, Mr. Schoenfeld, the dean of enrollment planning, will present what the college refers to as its "special interest" cases: those of applicants whose parents -- by virtue of being loyal Middlebury alumni, fabulously wealthy or both -- have captured the attention of the Middlebury administration. 
 Though the committee members will be told to vote their conscience, their decisions are often a forgone conclusion, as a decision to admit may well help the college's president, John M. McCardell Jr., say thank you for a contribution (more than $1 million is not unheard of) or help him collect a marker for a future gift.
"I'm sure every admissions office in the country is paying attention to families' ability to make a major donation," said Dean Schoenfeld, who graduated from Middlebury in 1973 and is bombarded these days by applications from the children of his fraternity brothers. "That's likely to be even more important in the down economy." 
While Middlebury, like other highly selective colleges, has engaged in some version of this ritual for more than two centuries, the favoritism that admissions offices show to legacies, as the children of alumni are called, and those with deep pockets is coming under fire as never before. 
Now that critics of affirmative action have persuaded the Supreme Court to consider whether black and Hispanic applicants are taking the rightful spots of more-qualified whites, some supporters of race-conscious admissions are mounting a counteroffensive. They complain that it is the preferential treatment afforded some applicants because of their parents' wealth or college affiliation that is unfair.
At Middlebury and other highly selective colleges, the chance that the children of alumni will be admitted is often double that of applicants without such connections, though frequently not as great as the admission rate of underrepresented minorities and even some athletes.
The lament of the excluded, long expressed by unsuccessful applicants to Harvard and Yale, has crept into the early presidential campaign. In a speech not long ago at the University of Maryland, Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, apparently seeking to enhance egalitarian credentials in his pursuit of the Democratic nomination, criticized the preferences given children of alumni.
"Affirmative action remedies past discrimination," Senator Edwards, a graduate of North Carolina State whose parents did not attend college, said in an interview. "Legacy admissions give more to kids who already have more."
Unlike affirmative action, the preferences for children of alumni have rarely been tested in the courts. But since the overwhelming number of beneficiaries of such policies are white, some scholars say that legal challenges are inevitable.
"Even if it's a private institution, a college is a nonprofit organization subject to civil rights law," said Michael Lind, a former lecturer at Harvard Law School who is now a senior fellow at the New America Foundation, a centrist public policy institute. "Legacies are a relic of white supremacy and Northeastern establishment dominance."
In response to legal challenges to affirmative action, the public university systems of Georgia and California have dropped preferences in recent years for legacies and other so-called V.I.P. applicants. But no highly selective private college has followed suit, in large part because the economic benefit of admitting such applicants is so great.
Yet the flood of applications to highly selective colleges -- Middlebury received 5,300 applications for the current freshman class and offered admission to 1,430 applicants -- has stiffened competition faced by legacies, who until the 1960's were virtually assured admission. In recognition of that competition, many legacies these days do not even try to apply to their parents' colleges.
While legacies made up 12 percent of the freshman class entering Middlebury in the fall of 1965, they are just 5 percent of the current freshman class. It can be difficult to mount an argument that those admitted to this class were not otherwise qualified, at least by the yardstick of the SAT: the 30 legacies in the current freshman class posted an average SAT score (1389) that is 33 points higher than that of the class as a whole.
"We won't bring anyone here who can't succeed," said Mr. McCardell, the president. "I don't care if that person is an impact athlete, a member of a minority group or worth a gazillion dollars."
Middlebury, like other colleges, does occasionally disappoint its big donors. A few years ago, an alumnus who was negotiating a six-figure donation to Middlebury decided to hold off until the admissions committee had ruled on his child's application. When the committee said no, citing low test scores and grades, the prospective donor walked away, Dean Schoenfeld said.
"Our philanthropy follows our children," Dean Schoenfeld quoted the benefactor as saying, "and our children aren't going to Middlebury."
Nonetheless, the admission rate of legacies, even those whose parents rarely donate to the college, far exceeds that of applicants as a whole. At Middlebury, the admission rate of legacies in the class of 2006 was 45 percent, compared with 27 percent for the entire class. At Harvard, legacies who applied for the current freshman class were admitted at nearly four times the rate of students over all (39 percent, versus 11 percent). At Stanford, where nearly 10 percent of students in the freshman class are legacies, their admission rate (about 25 percent ) was double that of the class as a whole (12.7 percent).
But theirs were hardly the only applications that got a "boost," in admissions parlance, on this campus and others. The admission rates for black and Hispanic applicants to Middlebury were each nearly 60 percent. And at the University of Michigan's Ann Arbor campus, whose undergraduate admissions program is one target of a pair of challenges before the Supreme Court, the 4 points (on a 150-point admission scale) awarded to children of alumni are dwarfed by the 20 points awarded to black, Hispanic and Native American applicants. 
Siblings, too, of current and past students often receive favored treatment. But at many selective colleges, athletes receive the greatest boost of all, while accounting for some of the lowest-rated transcripts.
To those who argue that the children of the connected receive an unfair advantage, Mr. McCardell, who has been president of Middlebury since 1992, argues that the admissions process entails "imperfect human beings' exercising their imperfect judgment in rationing a scarce commodity."
He also invokes a financial reality: the $36,000 that full-paying students spend annually would likely soar to nearly $60,000 without the generosity of the college's alumni, who helped raise more than $200 million in its last capital campaign.
"If a handful of slots go to deserving applicants whose families can at least have the potential to improve in dramatic ways the quality of the education at Middlebury College," he said, "we would not be fair to our successors or predecessors if we were to overlook that reality."
But that argument frequently makes it no easier for legacies to convince a classmate that their admissions were merited.
Katie Franklin, who is to graduate from Middlebury in 2006, is one of seven in her extended family accepted to Middlebury. The succession includes her grandmother (class of 1943),her father (class of '71), her mother ('72), her brother ('02), a cousin ('04) and her younger sister (just admitted to the class of 2007). 
Initially, Ms. Franklin said, she "tried to hide" from her classmates that her father, the vice president of an investment firm, was also the chairman of the Middlebury board. But having entered Middlebury with an SAT score (1440) that ranked her above most of her class, and now posting a B-plus average, she no longer feels any qualms.
"Being here as a student, I know that no one knows who's on the board," she said. "Once they do, it's up to them to decide whether I was qualified enough to get in."

An 80's Revival Under the Tents

BYLINE:  By CATHY HORYN

 BODY:
Narciso Rodriguez kept the steam in his ultrasexy clothes, picking up where he left off last season, while Michael Kors did the proverbial Manhattan shuffle in a collection that mixed high and low -- and shades of Claude Montana.
 Meanwhile yesterday, the Bill Blass, Ltd. company fired its head designer, Lars Nilsson, who had presented his third collection for the 33-year-old firm on Tuesday. Michael Groveman, the company's president and chief executive, said the rest of the design staff has also been dismissed. "Basically, the clothes were not selling," he said. "I didn't have a choice." Mr. Nilsson could not be reached for comment. 
 The news sent a jolt through the fall 2003 collections, and served as a reminder of how vulnerable designers are in a tough economy.
So is it time again for the boss leather brilliance of that 1980's triumvirate of Thierry Mugler, Azzedine Alaia and Mr. Montana? Apparently so. The few female garments that Sean Combs sent out last Saturday night were the first to strike the revivalist note, with their hard curves and fanny ruffles. And now Mr. Kors has added silver-studded motorcycle leather, channeled fur jackets with fringed leather skirts, and shiny python-print leggings. 
Many of Mr. Kors' combination just looked too predictable -- society fur mixed with hip-hop denim, big tops with tiny bottoms. One oversize denim jacket, worn on the svelte model Carmen Kass, looked like an advertisement for a big and tall shop. Still, taken separately, most of the pieces worked well enough.
Mr. Rodriguez's collection on Tuesday night didn't break new ground, but it's compelling to see a designer stick with something he (and retailers) believe in. That meant body-hugging dresses with an undercurrent of sexual tension heightened by the placement of seams and illusion panels. Coats had a military precision; and, indeed, if there was any fault in the collection, it was that some of the styles seemed overthought. But the evening dresses, with silvery beading and fleece skirts morphing into chiffon, looked fine, and Mr. Rodriguez excels, as always, at impeccable finishing. 
Backstage, Mr. Rodriguez was greeted by the actresses Julianna Margulies and Hilary Swank. Upon arriving at the tents in Bryant Park, Ms. Swank gamely posed for pictures and seemed to take seriously the business of answering questions about her outfit. No question was too dopey for the considerate Ms. Swank. By the time Kim Cattrall, a star of "Sex and the City," got her turn, the photographers seemed drunk on good will, and one, as if hoping to be included on the star's Christmas card list, trilled, "Thank you, Kim!"
So the love fest continues in Bryant Park, official home of Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week, where the smallest morsels of gossip are duly reported each morning by two ad hoc shiny sheets, leaving little for Papa Bear, Women's Wear Daily, which usually has a corner on such stuff.
To some extent, the gossip-mongering has sucked the energy out of the tents, like an industrial-strength Dirt Devil. But you can't get too worked up about it. Yesterday, at the Behnaz Sarafpour show, a reporter looked up from her heavy reading ("Are You Muse Material?") to see a photographer scrabbling at her feet.
"Boot," the photographer said, and snapped a picture.
Whatever.
Ms. Sarafpour is taking ballet lessons in her spare time, and that explained her models' chignons, slippers and fairy skirts. Yet, to look at her slim shift dresses, with their exposed zippers in the back or a length of bias tape worn as a belt, was to see that Ms. Sarafpour was making a fundamental connection between the worlds of ballet and fashion. It's not the style of a dress or a dance that defines its beauty so much as the sweat and the choices of its creator.
She found other ways to put this idea across -- in a princess-style coat that combined a gold cloque bodice with a skirt of taupe horsehair, and in mesh tops that recalled the boned underpinnings of a fancy Paris dress. And though some gestures echoed of Prada, and a suit or two had unfortunate associations of women running out in their bedroom slippers to fetch the milk, Ms. Sarafpour cleverly showed off her craft.
Marc Jacobs returned to the runway yesterday with Marc, his fast-growing younger label that now has estimated annual sales of $50 million, and it was as cute as it could be. If his main line had seemed hobbled by too many literal references to the 1960's (and less conspicuously, perhaps, to Howard Johnson's restaurant colors of the same era), Marc worked precisely because it couldn't be pinned down.
Under wild domes of hair, the models came out in leopard-print corduroy car coats, jersey minijumpers with porthole pockets, and pants that were a cool blend of peddle-pushers and sweats. The irreverent mix of the clothes, the reprise of parochial plaids and tattersall (tattersall!), the Beatle boots and the pointy flats worn with white tights made one think of girls who are perpetually in detention hall.
But nothing, as I say, could be pinned down to a specific time or place; and a faded, red-hooded sweatshirt bearing the words "Ce Soir" could have been a sly reference to Jean Seberg's newsgirl T-shirt in "Breathless." Or just another enigmatic teenage statement for an adult to wonder about.
Nicole Noselli and Daphne Gutierrez, the designers of Bruce, have come a long way since their first show in the Bowery, without losing their direction. Last night in the tents, they added more polish to their subdued eccentricity, sending out black jersey tops with creamy pleating, loose satin pants, and a snug black sweater inset with black leather, the model's hands tucked into its hidden pockets. Like Ms. Sarafpour, and a lot of young designers, they want to put some thought into fashion; and make it commercial, too.

HEADLINE: Georgia Governor Wants Vote on Flag With Confederate Emblem 

BYLINE:  AP

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Feb. 12 

 BODY:
Georgia's new Republican governor today proposed a referendum next year on bringing back the old state flag with its large Confederate emblem. Opponents quickly promised an economic boycott if the state resumed use of the flag.
 Fulfilling a campaign pledge, Gov. Sonny Perdue said he wanted the nonbinding vote to be held the same day as the state's presidential primary in March 2004. 
 He acknowledged that "Georgia is somewhat a divided house" over the flag and called it "an issue that should be healed as soon as possible."
The state N.A.A.C.P. immediately threatened an economic boycott of Georgia.
"If they think we're playing, they should try us," Walter Butler, state president of the N.A.A.C.P. warned as several hundred members of the group gathered at the Capitol. "They'll see." 
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has been boycotting South Carolina for three years over a Confederate battle flag that flies on the Statehouse grounds. The emblem is not part of the South Carolina flag.
Supporters of the Confederate battle flag say it represents Southern heritage, while blacks and others say it represents racism and slavery.
Governor Perdue had campaigned on the promise to give voters a say on the flag but gave conflicting signals in recent weeks on whether he would keep his word. His proposed referendum would have to be approved by the Republican-controlled Senate and the Democratic-controlled House. The Legislature could then use the results to decide whether it would consider a change.
Democrats have repeatedly said a flag vote would be too divisive.
Hoping to avoid the kind of turmoil that convulsed South Carolina, the Georgia Legislature changed the flag two years ago, reducing to a tiny square the battle flag emblem that was adopted in 1956 amid Southern segregationist defiance.
Gov. Roy Barnes, a Democrat who led the fight to get rid of the Confederate emblem, attributed his loss to Mr. Perdue in last fall's election to anger over the move, especially among rural whites.
Charles Lunsford, president of the Heritage Preservation Association, applauded Governor Perdue's proposal. "It gives us an opportunity for a fair contest," Mr. Lunsford said.
Under Governor Perdue's plan, voters would be asked two ballot questions, the first a yes-no question on whether to keep the current flag. The second would ask if voters wish to revert to the previous state flag with its Confederate emblem, or to the flag that flew until 1956 and did not bear any version of the Confederate symbol.
N.A.A.C.P. leaders urged lawmakers to block the referendum, saying they were certain the Confederate version would win.
"If it were up to the majority of people in the state of Georgia, slavery would still be legal and lynching would still be the law of the land," said the Rev. Charles White Jr., director of the N.A.A.C.P.'s Southeast region.
State and national Republicans had worried that Georgia might put a flag referendum on the ballot for the November 2004 presidential election. They feared that would spark a huge turnout by blacks and moderate whites and hurt Republican candidates, including President Bush.

HEADLINE: Group Sues Christian Program at Iowa Prison 

BYLINE:  By LAURIE GOODSTEIN

 BODY:
Two federal lawsuits filed yesterday in Iowa contend that a state-financed evangelical Christian prison program that gives privileges to participating inmates violates the separation of church and state.
 The program, at the Newton Correctional Facility in Newton, Iowa, is run by Prison Fellowship Ministries, an organization founded by Charles W. Colson, who served a prison term for his role in the Watergate cover-up. The program has also been adopted at prisons in Minnesota and Kansas, and in Texas, where it was backed by President Bush when he was governor. 
 The lawsuits, brought by Americans United for Separation of Church and State, a Washington-based advocacy group, are intended to provoke a constitutional challenge to the president's religion-based initiative, under which federal and state governments would give more money to religious groups that work with poor people, addicts, the unemployed and prisoners. 
The Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United, said of the Iowa prison project: "This program contains everything that is also wrong with the president's faith-based initiative. It uses tax dollars for pervasively religious programs, allows discriminatory hiring, gives preferential treatment to one religion over others, funds coercive conversion efforts and basically ignores the whole notion of a separation between church and state."
Prison Fellowship maintains that its program is constitutional because the state money is used only for secular parts of the program and because prisoners choose to participate.
"The prisoners don't come into this program unless they volunteer, and they know up front it's a Christ-centered program," said Mark Earley, a former attorney general of Virginia who is president of Prison Fellowship. "We make no bones about that." 
Participants are recruited from the general prison population, and while inmates of any faith may apply, they are told in a recruitment brochure, "This program confronts prisoners with the choice of embracing new life in Christ and personal transformation, or remaining in the stranglehold of crime and despair." 
Staff members and volunteers in the program, known as the InnerChange Freedom Initiative, are required to sign a statement of faith in a biblical literalist interpretation of Christianity. The lawsuits argue that this is tantamount to employment discrimination.
Participants in the 18-month program all live in one cellblock of the medium-security prison. The lawsuits say they are given privileges like access to large-screen televisions and computers, keys to their cell doors and free phone calls.
Jerry Wilger, executive national director of the InnerChange program, said the lawsuits' contentions were misleading. He said participants had keys only because the cellblock that the Department of Corrections chose to provide the program had old wooden doors. Mr. Wilger said phone calls were free only in emergencies, computers were for educational purposes and televisions were prohibited.
InnerChange puts the prisoners through an intensive curriculum of prayer, Bible study courses and mentoring sessions with volunteers from local churches. The program in Iowa has 215 participants and 125 graduates, Mr. Wilger said.
Of the four states that have contracted with InnerChange, the only state that does not provide financing is Texas, and the program receives no federal financing, Mr. Earley said. Since Iowa first contracted with InnerChange in 1999, the program has received about $880,000 from the state, 28 percent of its budget, Mr. Wilger said. 
Mr. Earley and Mr. Wilger say that the state pays for only nonreligious parts of the program, like vocational skills courses, substance abuse counseling and job placement. However, the lawsuits argue that the religious and nonreligious aspects of the program are inseparable and quotes from a program brochure, which says, "All programming -- all day, every day -- is Christ-centered."
The plaintiff in one suit is Jerry D. Ashburn, a Mormon inmate at the Newton prison who contends that the program is discriminatory. The other suit is filed on behalf of three relatives of inmates, who argue that every time they phone the prison, they are helping to finance a program they do not believe in. The lawsuits say that the State of Iowa pays for InnerChange by adding a charge to telephone calls to and from inmates, which Mr. Wilger of InnerChange confirmed.
The defendants named in the lawsuits are Prison Fellowship Ministries, InnerChange, the prison warden, the former and acting directors of the Iowa Department of Corrections and several members of the board of corrections. A spokesman for the Department of Corrections said he could not comment because lawyers there had not yet seen the lawsuits.

HEADLINE: Tax Moves By Enron Said To Mystify The I.R.S. 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
Enron and other big companies have escaped taxes in recent years through financial maneuvers so complex that the Internal Revenue Service has been unable to understand them, the Senate Finance Committee will be told this morning by Congressional tax experts who spent nearly a year going over Enron's tax returns.
 In a report to the committee, the experts will explain that companies can avoid taxes by exploiting differences in the rules governing the two sets of books that all companies must keep, one for shareholders and the other for the I.R.S., according to people who have seen the report. 
 These differences between what are known as book accounting and tax accounting can be used to make taxes disappear, but only through costly transactions that create risks for shareholders that are not disclosed.
Current laws are ineffective at stopping the use of such transactions, whose only purpose is to avoid taxes, according to four people who had access to the report's findings. 
Enron, the Houston-based energy trading company, was one of the most politically connected businesses in the country, with ties to President Bush and many other federal officials. Its name became synonymous with corporate scandal when its stock price collapsed and it sought bankruptcy protection in December 2001. Enron's chief financial officer is awaiting trial on fraud and other charges.
The report's disclosures on corporate tax avoidance, and its details on executive compensation, "are eye-popping," said Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, the ranking minority member of the Senate Finance Committee and one of only two people who would speak publicly yesterday about its contents. 
"The report paints quite a shocking picture of Enron's tax gimmicks and structured transactions and executive compensation," Mr. Baucus said. "Bad as Enron is going to come out, the deeper concern is this is just not Enron alone. It involves lots of other companies and how they inundated the I.R.S., out-complexed the I.R.S. The I.R.S. just cannot handle the complexity of some of these transactions."
Enron created 881 offshore subsidiaries, 692 of them in the Cayman Islands, as part of its strategy to avoid taxes.
The committee chairman, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, called the report "an absolute barn-burner."
At a confirmation hearing for new Tax Court judges yesterday, Senator Grassley said the report "provides for the first time the complete story of Enron's efforts to manipulate its taxes and accounting."
"The report is very disturbing in its findings," he added. "From this report, I'm worried about the Tax Court blessing highly artful interpretations of the code."
Legislation sponsored by the two senators that would curb tax shelters, which the Finance Committee approved last week, would not stop many of the practices described in the report, Senator Baucus said. 
Mr. Grassley said the report would "help Congress know what needs fixing."
It was prepared by the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation. Enron cooperated with the study, turning over documents and helping tax lawyers, accountants and economists on the joint committee staff understand the transactions. The report has four volumes, each as thick as a phone book for a large city, according to two people who have read parts of it.
Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said last night that "we have and will continue to cooperate with investigations into Enron's past." He said the chief concern now was "on the future and on maximizing value and in enhancing our creditors' position" so that the company can emerge from bankruptcy. Enron continues to operate, with about 11,000 employees, down from about 25,000, not counting short-term construction and contract workers.
Enron did not pay taxes in four of the five years before its collapse, according to the financial statements it sent to shareholders. The company has hinted in the past that it may have actually paid some tax during those four years because of the corporate alternative minimum tax. If Enron did pay some alternative tax in those four years, it would raise fresh questions about the reliability of reports to shareholders and whether the Securities and Exchange Commission is adequately policing rules on the disclosure of material information about corporate finances.
The report is also likely to influence the debate over corporate governance because the devices that enable taxes to disappear also tie up cash, making it difficult to pay dividends. President Bush has proposed making dividends tax-free to individuals, provided they are paid by corporations that paid taxes.
Tax shelters are sold primarily to the very biggest companies because they can pay the largest fees to the accounting and law firms and investment houses that design them and sell them on the condition of confidentiality. The I.R.S. has stepped up efforts to find tax shelters, but the agency lacks the resources to address the problem fully, Charles O. Rossotti, the former I.R.S. commissioner, warned last fall in his final report to his oversight board.
Corporate profits reported to the I.R.S. in 1998 were $155 billion less than those reported to shareholders, according to Mihir A. Desai, a Harvard economist. His study and others suggest that tax shelters may be the primary reason for this difference, which is costing the government as much as $54 billion in taxes each year.
The 10,000 or so largest companies paid 20.3 percent of their 1999 profits in federal income taxes, while the next tier of companies paid at a 30.9 percent rate, according to an I.R.S. analysis of corporate tax returns for the year. The largest companies had 26 times the profits of the second tier of companies, which paid income taxes at a rate 50 percent higher than the largest companies, the I.R.S. data shows.

HEADLINE: Greenspan's Doubts Prod Bush Defense Of Tax Cuts 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 12 

 BODY:
The White House moved quickly today to shore up support for President Bush's economic plan and took the rare step of bluntly disagreeing with Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, over the need for an immediate new round of tax cuts.
 Faced with signs that his proposed $670 billion tax cut will have difficulty in the Senate, Mr. Bush went on the offensive, giving a speech promoting the plan, releasing a letter from 250 economists backing his approach and seeking to head off any damage from Mr. Greenspan's statement on Tuesday that it is premature for Congress to pass an economic stimulus plan. 
 "It's a well-thought-out plan," Mr. Bush told an audience of about 100 in a speech to a trade association in Alexandria, Va. 
Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, said there was a reasonable disagreement between Mr. Greenspan's view that the economy was likely to recover on its own once the uncertainty about war with Iraq is past and the president's view that the economy needed the impetus that he says his tax cuts would provide.
"The president will err on the side of helping those who look for work," Mr. Fleischer said. "Therefore he supports a stimulus."
But Mr. Fleischer emphasized that Mr. Greenspan had endorsed the centerpiece of Mr. Bush's tax plan, its call for eliminating the tax on most stock dividends.
He objected to newspaper accounts of Mr. Greenspan's testimony as harmful to Mr. Bush's agenda. And he played down the Fed chairman's statement that the dividend tax cut should be adopted only as part of a package that would not worsen the budget deficit, a very different approach from that taken by the president, whose dividend tax cut proposal would increase the deficit by $385 billion over the next decade.
Ultimately, Mr. Fleischer suggested, the president will still get the tax legislation he wants from the House and the Senate.
"You're watching the beginning of a process in the Congress," he told reporters, "and I look forward to continue talking to you about it as the signing ceremony takes place."
In a second consecutive day of testimony on Capitol Hill, Mr. Greenspan, a Republican who was first appointed to his post by President Ronald Reagan in 1987, seemed to want to mend fences with Mr. Bush and his party.
Speaking to the House Financial Services Committee today, Mr. Greenspan did not retract any of the statements he made to the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday -- that there is no need for a short-term stimulus, that deficits are a problem and that Congress should offset new tax cuts with either spending cuts or other tax increases.
But where Mr. Greenspan inveighed about the dangers of deficits on Tuesday, he played down those concerns today and asserted that the worst of the budget problems would only arise once the current generation of baby boomers began to retire in 2010.
"Actually, it turns out that we do not really have a fiscal problem of moment until we get beyond the end of this decade," he said.
Mr. Greenspan said the $300 billion deficits projected by the White House for this year and next were "modest" in relation to the size of the economy, and that the country's longer-range budget problems, caused by a projected surge in Social Security and Medicare spending, would occur "with or without the president's program."
Mr. Greenspan was warmer today than on Tuesday about the president's dividend tax proposal. He said that eliminating taxes on most stock dividends would "almost surely increase the aggregate of economic activity" over the long term and might provide a small immediate boost as well. 
"I strongly support it," he told the committee.
But under persistent questioning from Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, Mr. Greenspan reiterated his view that Congress should approve new tax cuts only after it reinstates recently expired budget rules that would require offsetting tax increases or spending reductions. 
In his speech and in a round-table discussion with a group of investors beforehand at a Charles Schwab & Company brokerage office in Alexandria, Va., Mr. Bush emphasized defending his dividend tax cut.
Dismissing criticism from Democrats that eliminating the tax would primarily benefit the wealthy, Mr. Bush cast the proposal as one that would help an emerging class of small investors, from young people who are saving for their children's educations to retirees who rely on dividends for income.
"Getting rid of the double taxation of dividends is good economic policy for the short term for America, it is good economic policy for the long term of America, and I urge the Congress to eliminate the double taxation of dividends," Mr. Bush said.
Mr. Bush, like President Bill Clinton, has always handled Mr. Greenspan gingerly, given the immense influence the Fed chairman has not only over the economy but also over policy proposals on Capitol Hill. Mr. Greenspan gave Mr. Bush's original tax cut in 2001 crucial support in Congress. But he was also blamed by some Republicans -- including, by some accounts, the current president's father -- for their loss of the White House in 1992, when the economy was slow to emerge from the recession of the previous year.
Still, the current administration appears willing to engage Mr. Greenspan in a debate. R. Glenn Hubbard, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, attempted to rebut Mr. Greenspan's assertion that there was unlikely to be any immediate need for steps by Congress to stimulate the economy.
"Downside risks are more of a key item than his testimony seems to suggest," Mr. Hubbard told a gathering at the United States Chamber of Commerce. "The president is very worried about downside risks to the economy."
But Democrats said Mr. Greenspan had refocused the debate on the implications of Mr. Bush's proposal for the budget deficit in the long run, a shift that they said would help them alter the plan to make it smaller, temporary and focused more on lower and moderate income people who needed the help most.
"We need to have a debate about it," said Senator Jon Corzine, Democrat of New Jersey. "Greenspan has made that debate possible."

White House Disagrees With Fed Chief on Tax Cuts
The White House moved to shore up support for President Bush's economic plan and took the rare step of bluntly disagreeing with Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, over the need for immediate tax cuts.
 Faced with signs that his $670 billion in tax cuts will have difficulty in the Senate, Mr. Bush went on the offensive, giving a speech promoting the plan, releasing a letter from 250 economists backing his approach and seeking to head off any damage from Mr. Greenspan's statement that it is premature for Congress to pass an economic stimulus plan.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: DESERT TARGETS; 
Pro-Qaeda Oil Workers A Sabotage Risk for Saudis

BYLINE:  By JEFF GERTH

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia 

 BODY:
The government of Saudi Arabia has increased security around its oil fields and processing centers after the discovery that employees of the state-owned oil company sympathetic to Al Qaeda were discussing sabotage plans late last summer, American and Saudi officials say.
 American intelligence officials discovered the conversations and alerted the Saudi authorities, who quickly arrested and interrogated the suspects, the officials added. 
 The quiet thwarting of the potentially disastrous sabotage, disclosed in October by ABC News, is seen by officials here and in Washington as a model of cooperation for a relationship that has been under strain since the disclosure of the role of Saudis in the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
Still, the sabotage case and the response to it underscore the deep anxieties about the security of Saudi oil when a war with Iraq could make it more valuable, but also more vulnerable, than ever.
Intelligence officials say the discovery of Qaeda sympathizers inside Saudi Aramco is part of a worrisome trend: Al Qaeda's leadership appears to be increasingly focused on economic targets, especially the oil industry. 
A few weeks after the sabotage suspects were detained, a French supertanker carrying oil from Saudi Arabia was attacked off the coast of Yemen, in a plot that American and Arab officials say was orchestrated by Al Qaeda. About the same time, a Qaeda videotape surfaced showing Osama bin Laden's deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, calling for attacks on economic targets.
The tanker attack had little impact on oil markets, but oil experts say any disruption of Saudi Arabia's oil production could be an economic disaster. Not only are the Saudis the world's largest oil suppliers, but they are the only ones with enough spare capacity to make up for large shortages from producers like Iraq or strike-plagued Venezuela. That is a role they have filled repeatedly in the last two decades.
"To inflict economic damage, Al Qaeda doesn't have to hit the twin towers," said one senior intelligence official. "They can do it in their own backyard, where all the oil is."
"Saudi Arabia's oil facilities are a target-rich environment," said one American intelligence official. He and other officials said the terror tactics that most worried them were computer-aided sabotage and the use of airplanes as missiles.
During the Persian Gulf war 12 years ago, Iraq launched more than three dozen missiles into the oil-rich Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. Some Saudis thought that was part of an unsuccessful effort to damage the Ras Tanura shipping and refining complex near the Persian Gulf, the gateway for most of the eight million barrels of oil that Saudi Arabia produces each day.
"If you blew up Ras Tanura, you can't imagine the damage that would do to the United States," said an American oil executive active in the Middle East.
Now, though, the concern has shifted somewhat.
"The Saudis are more concerned about the threat from inside the country than from Iraq," said one Saudi oil executive who has been briefed on security measures.
The ABC News report briefly noted that dozens of Saudi citizens had been arrested, but did not say how the discussions had been uncovered. Nor did it mention any of the suspects' connections to Saudi Aramco or Al Qaeda -- information that has been closely held within the Saudi and American governments.
Officials said the saboteurs' discussions had been more preliminary planning than a firm plot. They said some of the suspects had been released, though others remained in detention. Some are not Saudis, they said, while a small number worked for Saudi Aramco. American officials say they believe that Qaeda sympathizers are sprinkled throughout the Saudi government.
The nexus of terrorism, oil and Saudi Arabia dates back three decades.
In 1973 terrorists attacked oil tanks in Lebanon owned by Aramco, the joint venture between American oil companies and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis took control of the company in the 1980's and renamed it Saudi Aramco. Today it is the world's largest oil company, with 55,000 workers, most of them Saudis.
During the 1980's, according to a former American intelligence official, the United States government did a secret study of the vulnerability of Aramco's installation at Abqaiq, the world's largest oil and gas processing center. Investigators found that the chemical reactions from a well-placed explosion could cripple Abqaiq's gas-oil separation plant for months, the former official said.
Today Saudi Aramco has 58 separation plants, which are crucial to the transportation of oil.
Saudi Aramco officials said they were unaware of the American study but had further tightened safeguards at their sites, which are guarded by a vast industrial security force.
"Our people are well prepared security-wise," said Abdullah al-Saif, a senior vice president of Saudi Aramco.
A senior Bush administration official agreed.
"The Saudis deserve credit for having a very robust surveillance and detection system on their oil assets," the official said.
Ali al-Naimi, the company chairman and Saudi Arabia's minister of petroleum and natural resources, said separation plants could be secured quickly and shut down in an emergency. But he added that "terminals and power systems could be a problem."
One indication of the heightened security is an Interior Ministry directive, issued several weeks after the sabotage case came to light, instructing Saudi Aramco's security force to post "no photos allowed" signs at oil installations.
During a recent visit to the country's newest and most sophisticated oil installation, at Shaybah in the red-duned desert known as the Empty Quarter, security was tight, especially at the main separation plant.
Workers are flown in and out on company planes. Despite the remoteness of the site, buildings are surrounded by fences, their entrances watched by several guards. 
A control room was manned by only a handful of technical employees. Increasingly, Saudi Aramco's oil installations, including its separation plants, are run by computers.
With a new war looming, American officials say Qaeda sympathizers do not represent the only potential threat to the Saudi oil supply. They also worry about the large Shiite Muslim population in the Eastern Province. Shiites make up 10 percent of Saudi Arabia's population and are generally treated as second-class citizens by the country's Sunni Muslim establishment.
In 1996, Shiite terrorists planted the truck bomb that killed 19 American Air Force personnel at the Khobar Towers housing complex near Dhahran, home of Saudi Aramco.
Mr. Saif, the Saudi Aramco executive, said the treatment of Shiites at the company was "not an issue." But American oil executives and government officials said the Saudi oil company tried to keep Shiites out of sensitive jobs like computer operations.
Thomas Stauffer, a Washington lawyer who has worked for Saudi Aramco, said a United States-led war against Iraq could provoke anti-American and anti-Israeli feelings among Saudi Aramco workers, making it harder to produce extra oil. "A strike or a shutdown is a very real risk if the U.S. goes to war in Iraq," Mr. Stauffer said, adding that "Aramco's staff is well aware of the risk."
American officials say their security concerns have been heightened by a spontaneous and rowdy demonstration by 6,000 to 10,000 people last spring outside the American Consulate in Dhahran, near the oil fields.
Ibrahim al-Mugaiteeb, a Saudi dissident who says he went on Al Jazeera television to report on the demonstration, said, "Shiite oppression and discrimination is not as bad as it used to be, because the 1979 revolution in Iran gave a lot of hope."
But he said he was announcing the formation of an activist group, Human Rights First, because the Saudi authorities continued to block free expression.

HEADLINE: Republicans Back Down On Raising Farm Aid 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 12 

 BODY:
Vice President Dick Cheney persuaded Congressional Republicans today to drop plans for adding new farm subsidies, stepping into a domestic political argument while trying to avoid a contentious foreign trade dispute.
 The United States' trading partners gathered in Tokyo this week to discuss how to trim and eventually eliminate farm subsidies, which in the United States and Western Europe together are equivalent to the gross domestic product of all of Africa. 
 Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, would have faced a hostile reception in Tokyo had Congress approved an omnibus spending bill that included $3.1 billion of disaster relief that amounted to new subsidy payments.
Before Mr. Cheney intervened, the Senate had proposed giving an automatic 42 percent subsidy increase to farmers now receiving federal aid, whether or not they had actually suffered any loss from drought or flooding. The increase would have applied to all farmers who live in counties designated as disaster areas in the last two years. 
"That would have further added to the credibility problem between the stated American goals of free trade and their farm policy," said Gerry Kiely, the agricultural expert for the European Union in Washington.
This is supposed to be the year of the farmer in world trading circles. Rich countries have bowed to poor countries' loud complaints and agreed to begin negotiations on their multibillion dollar farm subsidies, which institutions as diverse as the International Monetary Fund and Oxfam say are among the most unfair trade barriers, responsible for wrecking the livelihoods of millions of poor farmers in Asia, Africa and South America. 
"When you think about the role of farm subsidies and international trade, it has been just disastrous," said Jeffrey D. Sachs, director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University. He said subsidies drive down crop prices and block access to American markets. 
Congressional negotiators had asked Mr. Cheney to help break a deadlock between the Senate and the House over disaster relief for farmers, which was holding up the current year's financing for much of the federal government. He told the Republican leadership that the money had to come from agricultural spending and that farmers and ranchers had to prove they had suffered a loss, returning the plan to its original intent.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Cheney said he was carrying out Mr. Bush's policies regarding agricultural policy and fiscal discipline.
In signing the farm bill last year, the president said that the new law was meant to keep the country's trade commitments and that "the best way to help our farmers and ranchers is trade."
He also said the bill would remove the need for supplemental payments every year, which he called "a bad fiscal habit."
Under today's compromise, which must be approved by the Senate and the House, the money for disaster relief will come out of a new conservation program sponsored by Senator Tom Harkin, a Democrat of Iowa, when he was chairman of the Agriculture Committee last year.
"This is a major hit to the key new conservation program in the farm bill that the president signed nine months ago, saying it was one of his big environmental initiatives," said Mark Halverson, spokesman for Mr. Harkin.
Among the 25 trade ministers attending this week's talks in Tokyo are Mr. Zoellick and Pascal Lamy of the European Union, who both will be crucial to the eventual success of the bid to reduce subsidies.
Sophia Murphy of the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy in Minneapolis said the debate over disaster relief showed what she called "the continued deep disconnect between America's trade agenda promoted by Bob Zoellick and the agricultural policy promoted by Congress."
"It will difficult enough to get a global agreement on agriculture without Congress raising the suspicions of our potential trading partners with the kind of debate we heard this week," she said in a telephone interview. "We needn't paint ourselves into a corner where we are not able to give the trade partners the one thing they want to see from us -- a reduction in farm subsidies."

HEADLINE: Heavy Lifting 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT; E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
He's at it again.
 President Bush traveled to Nashville on Monday to talk, among other things, about compassion, which is a topic this president probably should leave alone. Mr. Bush's idea of compassion tends to send a shiver of dread through those who are disadvantaged. 
 But there he was in Nashville at the National Religious Broadcasters convention, exhorting his audience to "rally the armies of compassion so that we can change America one heart, one soul at a time." 
The president said religious organizations had a responsibility to assist the poor and those who are suffering, and to help alleviate the "artificial divisions" of race and economics.
"I welcome faith to help solve the nation's deepest problems," he said.
If religious leaders take up the challenge they will have to do some awfully heavy lifting, because Mr. Bush's domestic policies -- instead of easing suffering -- are all but guaranteed to provide an ever-swelling stream of people in need of help.
Everywhere you turn, support programs for the poor, the ill, the disabled and the elderly are under attack. Children's services are being battered. As Mr. Bush smiles and talks about compassion, funding for programs large and small is being squeezed, cut back, eliminated.
The day after Mr. Bush's upbeat speech to the religious broadcasters, The Times's Robert Pear revealed that the administration was proposing a change in federal law that would result in rent increases for thousands of poor people receiving housing aid.
The administration has proposed a restructuring of Medicare that would curtail, rather than enhance, delivery of health services to the elderly. 
In the $2.2 trillion budget that Mr. Bush sent to Congress last week was an unconscionable proposal that would eliminate after-school programs for 500,000 children. In the arena of bad ideas, that one's a champion. It would result not just in hardship, but tragedy. For one thing, the peak hours for juvenile crime are 3 p.m. to 8 p.m., with the biggest, most dangerous burst coming in the very first hour after school. That is also the time of day when most teenage girls become pregnant.
Mr. Bush has proposed cuts in juvenile delinquency programs, public housing assistance, children's health insurance and on and on. He's even undermined the funding for his own highly touted school reform program, the No Child Left Behind Act.
Senator Edward Kennedy, who had worked closely with the president on the school reform legislation, said yesterday, "As soon as the Klieg lights were off and the bunting came down, the Bush administration turned its back on school reform and America's children."
Looming over this calculated assault on programs of crucial importance to millions of Americans is Mr. Bush's colossal accumulation of tax cuts for the wealthy and an endless mountain range of federal budget deficits. The ideologues on the right are close to realizing their dream of crippling social services by starving the government of revenues.
Dr. J. Lawrence Aber, director of the National Center for Children in Poverty at Columbia University, said yesterday:
"These cuts are tearing at what was emerging as a bipartisan consensus at the end of the last administration that the unfinished agenda on welfare reform was to create the work and family supports necessary to continue to help people move from welfare to work." 
Tip O'Neill once said of Ronald Reagan, "He has no concern, no regard, no care for the little man of America."
George W. Bush is making the Gipper look like a softy.
Policies that affect the poor and working poor seldom get sustained attention. In an atmosphere of terror and impending war, Mr. Bush's approach to social services is getting even shorter shrift than usual. The policies he is attempting to put in place would largely overturn the notion we've had of a federal responsibility for programs to help struggling Americans. Mr. Bush would turn much of that responsibility over to the states, which are struggling with backbreaking budget problems of their own that are forcing drastic reductions in state services.
The collective result would be a long-term abandonment of the most needy among us. It's difficult to square that with the idea of compassion, conservative or otherwise.

HEADLINE: Protesters Are Denied Potent Tactic Of the Past 

BYLINE:  By JANNY SCOTT

 BODY:
There have been marches that looked like rallies and rallies that looked like marches and demonstrations that were a little bit of both. But when a federal judge ruled this week that antiwar demonstrators could rally in Manhattan on Saturday but not march through the streets, she was drawing a distinction that historians and others say can have great symbolic weight.
 In mass protest movements over the last two centuries, the act of marching has carried psychological and emotional power that scholars say stationary forms of protest do not. The simple act of moving forward in a group, made up of diverse contingents, has a visceral force that energizes not only participants but observers. 
 During the civil rights movement, marching was a specific form of political expression, a statement against segregation, a breaking out into a larger public realm. And it was effective. As historians see it, the march from Selma to Montgomery, Ala., in 1965, for example, transformed the not yet widely noticed voting rights movement in Selma into a national force.
"Common action does something that common presence does not do," said Clark McCauley, a professor of psychology at Bryn Mawr College who specializes in group dynamics. "It produces cohesion and power and maybe a greater sense of universality, that everybody is with us, that whatever it is we're marching for has all the power of all of us behind it."
Because of what the historian Clayborne Carson describes as the tension between the desire of government to contain protests within prescribed limits and the desire of protesters to exceed those limits, some scholars say organizers have often accepted restrictions on their freedom to march in return for permission for large numbers to gather.
Before the 1963 march on Washington, the Kennedy administration worked with the civil rights organizations that had planned the protest to persuade them not to march through the city as they had intended. As a result, the march of 250,000 people was confined largely to the area around the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial and is recalled more as a rally.
"They said O.K.: smaller location, less marching, less movement, more massing of people," said Lucy G. Barber, a historian at the California State Archives and author of "Marching on Washington: The Forging of an American Political Tradition" (University of California, 2002). "That's one of the things that later marches have often sacrificed: marching in order to have mass."
The antiwar demonstrators, who oppose war against Iraq, had sued the city for refusing to permit more than 100,000 people to march down First Avenue past the United Nations, west on 42nd Street and north to Central Park. The city, saying the march presented safety and security risks, had suggested a rally for 10,000 at Dag Hammarskjold Plaza on East 47th Street, with the rest of the crowd overflowing upFirst Avenue.
The judge, Barbara S. Jones of United States District Court in Manhattan, declined Monday to force the city to let the group march. She said the organizers had given the city insufficient time and information to prepare; and she said the city's concerns about crowd control were heightened by the fact that the country and city are in the second highest level of security alert.
Though the New York Civil Liberties Union appealed on the ground that the protesters' First Amendment rights were being violated, a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan upheld Judge Jones's decision yesterday. "The right to use public forums such as streets for speech and assembly is not absolute," according to the ruling by the judges, Jose A. Cabranes, Fred I. Parker and Lewis A. Kaplan.
What gives marching its power is curious and complex. In "Keeping Together in Time: Dance and Drill in Human History," the historian William Hardy McNeill suggests that shared, rhythmic movement has played a profound role in building communities, giving rise to what has been described as a fellow-feeling that seems to facilitate cooperation.
"Every social movement of any importance has had mass marches, not just picnics or gatherings," said Michael Kazin, a professor of history at Georgetown University who specializes in politics and social movements. "The prohibitionists marched on Washington in 1913, women's suffragists marched on Washington, there have been antiwar marches, there were pro-war marches."
Cesar Chavez led the United Farm Workers on a 350-mile march from Delano, Calif., to Sacramento in the mid-1960's, bringing the union to national attention. There is a long history of marches in New York, including a silent antilynching march in 1917, marches to demand unemployment relief, a nuclear disarmament march in 1982 that drew as many as 700,000 people and a 1994 march and rally commemorating the Stonewall Inn incident that helped ignite the gay rights movement.
"Usually, you have both a rally and a march," Professor Kazin said. "You show your strength on the street, yell a lot, get people talking about you. Then you gather and listen to speeches. The march is to gather support, show your power, convince people. The rally does that to some degree but is more a pep rally for the people who are already convinced."
For participants, marching brings a greater sense of involvement and contribution than does simply standing around listening. It makes it possible for each passing contingent to express its views. A march can also produce powerful video images.
"Looking back historically, the voting rights movement in Alabama would have been severely retarded if the marchers had been limited to marching within Selma," said Professor Carson, a Stanford historian and editor of the Martin Luther King Jr. papers. "It was the fact of marching to the seat of government in Montgomery that transformed a relatively small and mostly unnoticed voting rights movement in Selma into a movement of national significance."
David J. Garrow, a civil rights historian at Emory University who lived in Manhattan in the 80's and 90's, suggested in an interview that there was little symbolic power to Dag Hammarskjold Plaza.
"It's not at the U.N., it's not by City Hall, it's not Central Park," he said. "There is a tremendous symbolic devaluing in being shunted into this relatively meaningless space."

HEADLINE: Giant Playground Is Chosen for Site of Meadowlands Arena 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., Feb. 12 

 BODY:
More than 100 acres of the New Jersey Meadowlands would be developed as a family entertainment complex with an indoor ski slope, indoor surfing, a Formula One racetrack, a minor league baseball stadium and office towers, under a $1.3 billion redevelopment plan chosen today by the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority.
 The project, called Meadowlands Xanadu, is the proposal of the Mills Corporation, the Virginia-based mall developer, and the Mack Cali Realty Corporation, a Cranford, N.J., office developer. The sports authority selected the partnership from among three finalists that bid to redevelop the Meadowlands site, as the New Jersey Nets and Devils negotiate a move from the Continental Airlines Arena to a proposed arena in downtown Newark. 
 Today's 9-to-2 vote by the sports authority ended a contentious selection process that began in September, when six developers submitted proposals, and heated up in recent weeks as the two leading finalists waged a publicity war and some officials called for hearings to solicit public opinion. 
Within the next 60 to 90 days the sports authority and the developer will negotiate the smallest details of the deal. If that goes smoothly, both predicted that construction on the project could start as soon as this summer and be completed within six years. 
George R. Zoffinger, president and chief executive of the authority -- which operates Giants Stadium, Meadowlands Raceway and the arena here -- said the project would turn "the most valuable location in the region" into a family destination with its combination of sports, entertainment, shopping, lodging and offices.
Among Xanadu's unusual attractions are the Snow Dome, an indoor skiing center that would be the cornerstone of the complex. The only similar center is under construction by Mills in Madrid. The Indoor Wave would offer year-round surfing for accomplished and beginning surfers. The complex would also include an indoor Formula One racing oval, museums, a music and sports hall of fame, a luxury spa, a 520-room hotel, cooking schools and a child-scale city where children can play roles in mock settings like a hospital, bank, post office and airport.
Laurence C. Seigel, Mills's chairman and chief executive, said Xanadu would assemble a host of new and often untried attractions in a new configuration in which retailing would run a close second to entertainment. The Meadowlands area, surrounded by 16 million people living within a 20-mile radius, is "the best piece of dirt in the U.S." he said, and the ideal testing ground for innovation.
Most important for the sports authority, Mr. Zoffinger said, the choice would bring the agency an immediate $160 million in upfront lease payments on the land. That money would be used to retire the authority's debt on the deficit-ridden Continental Airlines Arena and avoid $90 million in interest payments over time. The annual payments in lieu of taxes to communities surrounding the 106-acre site would increase tenfold, he said, and the developers have agreed to contribute $65 million of their own funds to help with infrastructure improvements like realigning roadways. 
No taxpayer money would be needed for the project, he said, though future mass-transit access would require public money.
It was these economic considerations and the guaranteed upfront payments that tipped the authority toward the Mills proposal, Mr. Zoffinger said. The authority has made no deal to share in recurring revenues generated by the complex, though that could be negotiated later. 
In many ways, the selection of the Mills Corporation saves both the state and the mall developer from a costly confrontation. Mills has the development rights on 560 acres of sensitive Meadowlands wetlands on which it had planned to build a mall. While some federal environmental hurdles have been overcome, New Jersey's state government and an army of environmental groups have remained opposed to the project and threatened legal Armageddon over the plan. Today, the developer said it was prepared to donate the proposed mall location, known as the Empire site, to the state and invest substantially in cleaning it up.
"This stood head and shoulders over other proposals, and the environmental benefits were nothing short of compelling," said Carl Goldberg, the authority's chairman.
The losing proposals came from a partnership of Hartz Mountain Industries and Forest City Ratner, whose plan included a convention center, and the Westfield Group, which proposed converting the arena into a performance space. 
The authority's selection drew immediate criticism from some Republican lawmakers in the county who said the authority, which consulted local advisory committees but held no public hearings, was not open enough in making the choice. Other critics predicted that the site would become a traffic nightmare and do little to bring mass transit to the heart of the Meadowlands, as the sports authority originally promised.
But the prospect of the huge project brought together many other, usually warring, factions.
Environmentalists like William Sheehan, the Hackensack Riverkeeper and longtime opponent of the Mills plan to build on the more environmentally sensitive parcel, cheered the selection as a rare instance of wetlands preservation in a time when federal conservation efforts appeared to be drying up.
Labor unions applauded the estimated 21,000 construction jobs envisioned over the six-year, phased construction of the complex. And business groups, including the Meadowlands Chamber of Commerce, simply cheered that something was being done to stimulate the local economy. Jim Kirkos, president of the chamber, said that public officials usually just talk about providing an economic engine. "Here, they kept their word and acted," he said.
Edward B. Vinson, executive vice president of Mills and the project director, said the new complex would be built in phases, with work beginning first on the family entertainment components and a half-million square feet of retail space.
Under the plan, the Continental Arena would eventually become a performance space, though specifics are yet to be worked out. But construction on the rest of the project can take place, Mr. Vinson said, without interfering with the two teams' use of the arena for the duration of their lease, which runs until 2005. If their Newark plans collapse, he said, the arena could be refurbished. 
Mitchell E. Hersh, chief executive of Mack Cali, said the hotel and 1.7 million square feet of office space would be built in the final phase of the project -- timing that might coincide with the end of the economic downturn and a return of a stronger market for office space. 
"We think the family entertainment and the sports will be a magnet to draw tenants to this area," Mr. Hersh said. "It's the accessibility and the visibility of the site that will make it a place where people want to be."
